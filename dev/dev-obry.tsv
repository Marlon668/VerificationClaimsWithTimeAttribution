obry-00032	In a debate on Oct. 20 at West Salem High School, the now re-elected representative for the 94th District Assembly seat, Democrat Steve Doyle, along with Republican Julian Bradley defended their stances on expanding the state voucher program. Doyle argued that the current system, which is mostly limited to the Milwaukee and Racine school districts, doesn’t need to expand because it would take away funds from quality public school districts in the process. “But we don’t have failing schools in western Wisconsin; we have good, quality schools,” Doyle said.” Are all of the public schools in western Wisconsin meeting state-level standards, as Doyle claimed? 	mostly true	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/12/16/in-the-94th-district-most-schools-are-meeting-state-standards-but-not-all/	None	None	None	Max Bayer	None	In the 94th district, most schools are meeting state standards, but not all	December 16, 2016	None	['Wisconsin', 'Milwaukee', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Racine,_Wisconsin']
obry-00006	Congressman Mark Pocan recently responded to a letter that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker wrote to President Donald Trump supporting the president’s “aggressive actions to secure America’s southern border.” The Wisconsin Democrat Pocan wrote that, “President Trump is not sending troops to the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico. It is clear that his goal is to apprehend migrants, many of whom are children fleeing violence in their home countries.” While we are unable to accurately assess Trump’s motivations, The Observatory decided to check the claim that many of the people coming across the southwest border who are unauthorized are children and that they are fleeing violence in their home countries. 	mostly true	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/05/02/drug-dealers-vs-children-who-is-crossing-u-s-mexico-border-and-why/	None	None	None	Pawan Naidu	None	Drug dealers vs. children: Who is crossing U.S.-Mexico border and why?

obry-00010	In September 2017, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, released a statement about the Parental Choice Programs in Wisconsin, which are voucher programs that allow low-income students to attend selected private schools. Fitzgerald claimed that students in Parental Choice Programs across Wisconsin are outperforming their peers on the ACT, a college preparedness exam taken by all 11th graders in the state. Fitzgerald made this claim after the state Department of Public Instruction released the results for learning assessments administered during the 2016-17 school year. 	unobservable	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/04/23/fitzgerald-choice-schools-outperform-peers-experts-say-picture-is-mixed/	None	None	None	palmby	None	Fitzgerald: ‘Choice’ schools outperform peers; experts say picture is mixed	October 17, 2018	None	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_L._Fitzgerald']
obry-00013	As the Wisconsin gubernatorial race progresses, Democratic candidate and Milwaukee businessman Andy Gronik has repeatedly taken aim at Republican Gov. Scott Walker. In a Jan. 24 blog post, Gronik condemned Walker for low wages that he said lead to residents having to work multiple jobs. Said Gronik: “Wisconsinites will remember Walker’s failures when they go to work at that second, third or fourth job because their wages are so low that one job won’t cut it.” The Observatory checked this claim. 	verified	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/04/19/wisconsin-jobless-rate-at-historic-low-but-many-face-low-pay-work-two-jobs/	None	None	None	Gerald Porter Jr.	None	Wisconsin jobless rate at historic low, but many face low pay, work two jobs	April 19, 2018	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Milwaukee', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
obry-00003	Flint, Michigan, the city known for its contaminated water crisis, has something in common with Wisconsin — childhood lead poisoning. According to Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee, the proportion of children with elevated blood lead levels among Wisconsin’s children has risen close to those of Flint. In a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Moore said, “The rate of lead poisoning among children in Wisconsin is nearly equal to Flint, Michigan.” The Observatory decided to check this claim. 	verified	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/05/10/wisconsins-rate-of-lead-poisoning-worse-than-flint-michigans/	None	None	None	Gerald Porter Jr.	None	Wisconsin’s rate of lead poisoning worse than Flint, Michigan’s	May 10, 2018	None	['Michigan', 'Wisconsin', 'United_States', 'Milwaukee', 'Gwen_Moore', 'Flint,_Michigan', 'Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention']
obry-00048	As the next biennial budget proposal approaches, funding for transportation projects have hit a bump in the road. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation operates from three main revenue sources – federal funding, sources of state revenue like the gas tax and vehicle registration fees and bonding. As a projected $1 billion budget shortfall looms over the state’s Transportation Fund, GOP Assembly leaders and Gov. Scott Walker have continuously sparred over how to remedy the issue. 	mostly false	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/14/state-representative-misrepresents-transportation-budget-figures/	None	None	None	Madeline Sweitzer	None	State representative misrepresents transportation budget figures	January 9, 2017	None	['Scott_Walker_(politician)', 'Wisconsin_Department_of_Transportation']
obry-00028	On July 26, Foxconn Technology Group announced plans to invest $10 billion to build a new factory in Wisconsin. The unveiling of the plan was made at the White House, with Foxconn chairman Terry Gou along with President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Gov. Scott Walker, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. In light of Walker’s 2018 re-election campaign as well as a national concern over the health of American manufacturing, the news was significant. State officials later negotiated an agreement calling for the Taiwanese manufacturer to receive up to $3 billion in state tax subsidies — an incentive that some elected officials, primarily Democrats, questioned as the tax breaks were written into law. The deal for the new LCD screen manufacturing complex has since passed the Legislature and was signed by Walker, cementing Foxconn as the largest foreign recipient of state subsidies in the nation. As the deal headed toward final approval, political leaders chimed in on the impact, both positive and negative of the plant, which is to be built in Mount Pleasant in Racine County. 	mostly true	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2017/12/04/wisconsin-leaders-both-praise-and-decry-foxconn-deal-we-examine-their-claims/	None	None	None	Max Bayer	None	Wisconsin leaders both praise and decry Foxconn deal; we examine their claims	December 4, 2017	None	['United_States', 'Wisconsin', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'White_House', 'Taiwan', 'Mike_Pence', 'Foxconn', 'Racine,_Wisconsin', 'Donald_Trump', 'Paul_Ryan', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
