pomt-06290	"Obama has (a) new Christmas tree tax."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/nov/20/greg-abbott/texas-attorney-general-greg-abbott-says-obama-has-/	Weeks before Thanksgiving, the Internet was abuzz with holiday news that no doubt would turn Santa Claus' smile upside down: President Barack Obama was trying to make it more expensive for people to buy Christmas trees. A headline on the Los Angeles Times’ website asked: "Is President Obama 'the Grinch who taxed Christmas' trees?" And a Republican congressman from Louisiana posted a press release slamming the president for trying to "sneak through this new tax on Christmas trees." In Texas, Attorney General Greg Abbott and others took to Twitter the same day — Nov. 9, 2011 — to express their opposition. Abbott's tweet: "Obama = Scrooge. Obama has new Christmas Tree Tax." Really? Christmas trees are a big business in Oregon, so our PolitiFact colleagues there jumped on this claim. Included in Abbott's tweet was a link to a Nov. 8 blog post by David Addington on the conservative Heritage Foundation's website titled "Obama couldn't wait: His new Christmas tree tax." The post cited an entry in that day's Federal Register — which publishes information on regulations — announcing an effort to help the Christmas tree industry promote itself. It's what’s known as a "checkoff program" — under which producers of a commodity are required to pitch in money for ad campaigns, market research, product development and consumer education efforts. Some of the most familiar checkoff programs are for beef ("it’s what’s for dinner") and pork ("the other white meat"). According to the Federal Register entry on the Christmas tree program, it was sought by an industry group called the Christmas Tree Checkoff Task Force. Proponents of the program say the Christmas tree industry needs a sustained national marketing campaign to compete with advertising by sellers of artificial trees. To fund the program, growers and importers of Christmas trees will pay a "15-cent assessment" on each tree sold, and the money will go to a board made up of 12 Christmas tree sellers, who will direct the research and marketing efforts. Board members will be nominated by the industry and selected by the U.S. secretary of agriculture. Growers and importers who sell fewer than 500 trees a year are exempt from that 15-cent assessment — which Addington dubbed a tax in his blog. A day after the Heritage blog posted, criticism of the program exploded across the Internet. By the end of the day, the White House was telling reporters that the administration would delay the Christmas tree checkoff program. No new start date was given. Justin DeJong, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department, told us that the program is on hold because "misinformation" about it had created confusion for consumers shortly before the start of the Christmas season. DeJong disputed the labeling of the 15-cent assessment as a tax. "What’s being talked about here is an industry group deciding to impose fees on itself to fund a promotional campaign, and there are many success stories in every sector of the industry (milk, beef, pork, etc)," he wrote in an email. Official notice that the program had been delayed indefinitely appeared in the Nov. 17, 2011, Federal Register. The entry says that the program is on hold "to provide additional time for the department to reach out to the Christmas tree industry and the public to explain how a research and promotion program is a producer-driven program to support American farmers." Betty Malone, an Oregon tree farmer who led the task force that submitted the request for the program to the Agriculture Department, told PolitiFact Oregon that she was stunned anyone would describe the tree fee as something dreamed up by Obama. "We’ve been working on this for three-and-a-half years," she said. "The industry has talked about this for 20 years. This started long before Obama" was president. According to the task force's proposal, filed with the Agriculture Department on Aug. 12, 2009, sessions to gauge interest in the establishment of a checkoff program among growers were held in Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania in 2008 — when George W. Bush was president. Not everyone in the industry embraces the idea. According to the Nov. 8 Federal Register entry, the Agriculture Department received more than 550 responses about the checkoff program proposal during its 65-day designated "comment period." Of the total, 398 were in favor while 147 were opposed. In Texas, Marshall Cathey, president of the Texas Christmas Tree Growers Association, with more than 100 members, said the group voted against supporting the checkoff program proposal. We talked with two Texas Christmas tree farmers opposed to the program. Bob Childress, whose farm is about 40 miles east of Abilene, said he considers the program an example of government reaching inappropriately into the marketplace. Marc Nash, co-owner of Elgin Christmas Tree Farm, agreed and said he objects to being forced by the government to pay into an industry promotional campaign. Nash also said Texas growers, which primarily have small farms in rural areas, won't benefit from the checkoff program because its marketing efforts would most likely take place in major, urban areas where any increased sales would help large Christmas tree wholesalers. Next, we looked into whether the 15-cent fee would be passed on to tree buyers and whether it amounts to a tax, as Abbott says. The National Christmas Tree Association, a supporter of the program, said in a Nov. 9, 2011, press release that "the program is not expected to have any impact on the final price consumers pay" for trees. However, Addington, in his blog, writes that "of course, the Christmas tree sellers are free to pass along the 15-cent federal fee to consumers who buy their Christmas trees." Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association, told PolitiFact Oregon that it's unclear whether the fees would ultimately be the responsibility of buyers. "It doesn’t get automatically passed along, but somebody along the line has to cover it," he said. PolitiFact also found disagreement about whether the tree charge is a tax. The federal government monitors the agricultural marketing board that administers the money, but the revenue doesn't go to the government. The national tree association agrees with the Agriculture Department that the 15-cent assessment isn't a tax. Again, Addington's perspective is different. In his blog, he writes: "The federal government mandates that the Christmas tree sellers pay the 15-cents per tree, whether they want to or not. The federal government directs that the revenue generated by the 15-cent fee goes to the board appointed by the secretary of agriculture to carry out the Christmas tree program established by the secretary of agriculture. Mr. President, that's a new 15-cent tax to pay for a federal program to improve the image and marketing of Christmas trees." For other perspectives, PolitiFact consulted national experts. "It certainly doesn't smell or quack like a tax," said Robert Litan, the vice president for Research and Policy at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation who was an associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton. On the other hand, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, says "a coercive levy is a tax." Our ruling Opinion is split on whether the 15-cent fee on Christmas trees — if it goes into effect — would be a tax and whether the cost would be passed along to consumers. Setting that eye-of-the-beholder issue aside, the claim that Obama was behind the tree charge suggests he came up with the scheme. That's not correct; the idea originated with the industry before he became president. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-14177	Says Target installed urinals in a women’s bathroom to "accommodate the ones who have giblets."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2016/apr/26/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-claim-about-target-adding-urinals-w/	Has Target added urinals to a women’s restroom in California? That’s the claim in a Facebook post that’s been shared more than 14,000 times as of April 26, 2016, one week after the mega-retailer announced transgender customers are welcome to use bathrooms that match up with their gender identity at their stores nationwide. Target is the latest corporation to announce the policy, just as state legislatures have debated or approved so-called "bathroom laws." Those laws, including one signed by the governor of North Carolina in late March, would prohibit transgender people from using restrooms that do not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate. Target’s policy has led to mixed customer reviews. Some have cheered it, while more than half a million people had signed a boycott petition by American Family Association, a conservative Christian activist group, as of Tuesday. The group contends the policy encourages sexual predators and puts women and young girls in danger. We know the policy alone is controversial. But we wondered whether Target had taken its stance to an even more contentious level by installing urinals in a women’s store restroom? That’s the claim in the popular Facebook post by a user named Kathleen Crawford: "It's true. ..I'm in the women's bathroom at a Target north of LA...they actually took out a stall for women in order to accommodate the ones who have giblets...yes, these are urinals...for men...and so the war on women progresses. …" The allegation inspired outrage on some conservative blogs, where it was taken as fact. It shouldn’t be. Our research The Facebook post includes a photo of two urinals wrapped in plastic inside a restroom with a red wall. It shows no evidence of where, exactly, the photo was taken. When we contacted Target, a corporate spokeswoman called the claim on Facebook "inaccurate." "We have not made any changes to the restrooms," the spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said in an email. "We have not added any urinals to any women's restrooms nor do we have any plans to do so." She said the company never had past plans to do so. So what’s going on with the photo? It’s hard to say for certain. We reached out to the person who posted it on Facebook, but we haven’t heard back. The myth-busting website Snopes.com also checked out the Facebook post and found it False. It said the "picture has nothing to do with Target's restroom policy. The image was not taken in a women's restroom at a Los Angeles Target store (rather a men's room that was undergoing repair or refurbishment)." Snopes.com did not say how it found out where the photo came from. Snyder, the Target spokeswoman, said she did not know its source. If Target had made this change, we’d expect more than just one photo to surface. We reached out to the woman on Facebook, and we'll add her response should we hear back. Our ruling A popular Facebook post alleged last week that Target installed urinals in a women’s restroom in California. Target representatives told us the claim is "inaccurate," and that the company has no plans to change its restrooms, and never did. Best we can tell, the Facebook post is a one-off picture that hasn’t surfaced in any other form (other than the thousands of people sharing it). So stop that!

pomt-03143	The United Nations has conducted "172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/12/van-jones/van-jones-says-un-has-conducted-172-successful-pea/	With the U.S. and Russia locked in discussions over whether, and how, to exert control over Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles, the United Nations’ role in international arms control is of particular interest. During a discussion on CNN’s Crossfire, host Van Jones pointed to the United Nations’ long record of successful actions to keep the peace and protect civilians. When co-host S.E. Cupp asked, "Do you trust the U.N.?" Jones responded that the United Nations had overseen "172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations." After Cupp expressed skepticism, Jones continued, "The world is a tough, nasty place, and we focus on the places the U.N. has not been able to change human nature. But we are in a much safer world because of the U.N. than we would be without it." Is it really true that the United Nations, since its establishment after the end of World War II, has overseen "172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations"? That would be between two and three new ones per year. When we checked with Jones, he pointed to a 2005 U.N. report. It stated that "since 1945, the U.N. has assisted in negotiating more than 170 peace settlements that have ended regional conflicts. Examples include ending the Iran-Iraq war, facilitating the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and ending the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. The United Nations has used quiet diplomacy to avert imminent wars." Because the document is eight years old -- and because "170 peace settlements" is not precisely the same thing as "172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations" -- we decided to check with the United Nations directly to see if there was an updated number. Counting the peacekeeping missions -- which are typically launched once a peace deal is in place -- is pretty straightforward: The running total since 1948 is 68 peacekeeping missions, of which 15 are ongoing. (The full list is in this U.N. document.) Counting "negotiations" is trickier. One obstacle to arriving at a solid number is that negotiations go on all the time, conducted by "envoys, small offices, or officers" even before a U.N. mission has been established, said Kieran Dwyer, the public affairs section chief in the U.N. departments of peacekeeping operations and field support. Another obstacle is that there’s overlap between peacekeeping operations and negotiations, so there’s a risk of double counting. "In cases where there is an existing peacekeeping operation, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Mali, the mission is involved in supporting continuing political processes or negotiations," Dwyer said. "This is a standard part of the mandate of many of the existing missions, supporting the completion of peace processes, often including negotiations of some sort." Such complications have meant that the United Nations is no longer updating the number it cited in 2005. "We are not currently keeping a running count of peace agreements reached with U.N. involvement," said Jared Kotler, senior officer for strategic communications and public affairs with the United Nations’ political affairs department. Our ruling Jones said the United Nations has conducted "172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations." His claim comes from a U.N. document, though one that is eight years old and that referred to a somewhat different metric. U.N. officials say there’s no way of knowing the correct number today, but the 2005 figure, combined with other data that is up to date, suggests that 172 is a reasonable approximation. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Van Jones	None	None	None	2013-09-12T15:56:56	2013-09-10	['United_Nations']
pomt-02590	Texas added 6,600 miles of highway from 2001-2012, more than any other state.	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/28/rick-perry/texas-change-highway-miles-not-no-1-adjusted-size/	Gov. Rick Perry recently tweeted that his state outpaced others in new highways on his watch. "Texas has added more than 6,600 new highway miles from 2001-2012, more than any other state over that time," Perry said Jan. 7, 2014, the same day he spoke at the Texas Transportation Forum about the importance of such infrastructure. A major reason that matters, according to a Perry press release issued that day, is that "investments in roads and infrastructure directly impact Texas' economic competitiveness and companies' ability to do business in the state." We wondered whether Texas outpaced every other state in the dozen years after Perry became governor in late 2000. The state Legislative Budget Board’s 2012-13 "Fiscal Size-Up" says Texas had about 80,000 miles of highway in 2012, specifically 28,441 miles of U.S. and state highways, 3,231 miles of interstate, 7,031 miles of frontage road, 40,939 miles of farm-to-market roads and ranch-to-market roads, and 331 miles of park roads. Those measurements are in "centerline" miles, the length of a highway. Another transportation measure is "lane" miles, which multiplies centerline miles by the number of lanes; a four-mile stretch of six-lane highway has 24 lane miles. Lane miles would reflect, for example, the widening of an older highway to ease congestion. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed emailed web links to statistics from the Federal Highway Administration on lane miles of highway owned by state highway agencies in 2001 and 2012, to show how Perry reached his conclusion. Texas had the largest increase in highway lane miles in raw terms with 6,660 -- about 3 percent of Texas’ total 194,954 lane miles of state highway in 2012. Montana and Missouri were close behind in raw numbers, with 6,536 and 6,270 new lane miles, respectively. In centerline miles over those years, Texas’ state-owned highways gained 922, which ranked it fourth among the states. National commuting expert Alan Pisarski told us by phone that he thought Perry’s statistic sounded right and that other measures to check would be how mileage changed over time in relation to states’ size and population. Always worth remembering: Texas is real big. When we examine questions of which state has the most high school graduates or the most coal-fired plants, it’s important to take that bigness into account to get a real sense of how Texas is faring compared with other states with widely different populations and geographic areas. So, using U.S. Census Bureau data, we did a bit more math. Texas gained about 2/10 of a lane mile per square mile of area, ranking 21st in both 2001 and 2012. As its population ballooned, Texas’ lane miles of state-owned highway per 100,000 residents fell to 155, dropping it from 19th in 2001 to 23rd in 2012. Running those calculations for all 50 states suggests that Texas’ 2001-2012 change fell considerably shy of No. 1. Looking at the amount of change each state experienced, Texas had the 16th-largest gain in lane miles per square mile. Going by the change in highway lane miles per 100,000 residents, Texas’ drop placed it 42nd. Only six states gained ground in the population category -- ending up in 2012 with more lane miles per person than they had in 2001 -- and one of those was Michigan, the only state that lost population during this time. Over the same years, Texas saw the 12th largest increase in residents per square mile. Separately, we noted some oddities in our spreadsheet. Several states’ changes in lane mileage showed as negative numbers. As it turned out, the tables reflected changes that occurred when roads were reclassified -- say, when a state took over a county road or vice versa. Iowa, for example, apparently "lost" 1,266 lane miles from 2001 through 2012. Iowa Department of Transportation spokeswoman Andrea Henry told us by email that in 2002-03, her agency and Iowa cities and counties reevaluated the appropriate jurisdiction of public roads. "Through a series of individual agreements and legislation, well over 700 miles of state roads were transferred from the Iowa DOT to individual cities and counties," she said, probably reducing the number of state lane miles by about 2,000. Together with lane miles added by new construction, she said, "the net difference of a 1,266 mile reduction in lane miles is reasonable." Texas Department of Transportation spokeswoman Veronica Beyer told us by email that according to that agency, the state gained 6,634 lane miles from 2001 through 2012, "with the overwhelmingly vast majority of that being due to new construction (and not transfer of ownership)." The federal agency didn’t record how many miles of new construction took place in each state. Without such a statistic, we can’t tell whether Texas’ lane miles were the most in the nation because Texas built the most state highways or because other states reclassified a lot of miles. In response to our findings, Nashed said, "Given that we had to choose a number that represented the growth of the system, thus lane miles makes more sense than centerline miles (this way it incorporates taking a road from 2 to 3 lanes for example). "The state to state miles per square mile or population comparison would not have made sense, to me, in this case," she said, noting how Michigan’s drop in population made it appear that "their state system per capita actually shows significant growth over time even though they added just 6 new lane miles. Our ruling Perry tweeted, "Texas has added more than 6,600 new highway miles from 2001-2012, more than any other state over that time." This raw calculation stands up; Texas was No. 1 in total lane miles added. But Texas is also nearly the biggest state. Adjusting for states’ differences in population and geographic area shows Texas’ change in highway miles was the 16th largest gain per square mile of area and the state came in 42nd when ranked on the change in highway miles per resident.

pomt-12595	Says President Donald Trump "had a different opinion" in 2013 than he does now about whether (Barack) Obama should have intervened in Syria after Obama's red line was crossed.	true	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/05/greta-van-susteren/fact-checking-trump/	At least 70 people have died from a vicious chemical weapons attack in Syria, carried out by the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad. President Donald Trump said blame for the attack lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama. "These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration’s weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a ‘red line’ against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing," Trump said in an official White House statement April 4. Many commentators noted that this was a departure from Trump’s past position on Syria, including Greta Van Susteren, who recently moved from Fox News to MSNBC. "A few years ago in the midst of the debate whether President Obama should use force in Syria, then Mr. Trump, now President Trump, had a different opinion," Susteren said on her show April 4. "In a tweet, then Mr. Trump said, quote, ‘President Obama, do not attack Syria.’ " Trump conceded during an April 5, 2017, press conference that his stance on Syria and Assad has shifted, saying he is proud of his willingness to change his position based on current events. "My attitude on Syria and Assad has changed very much," he said, in part because "that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me." What Trump said about Syria in 2013 Obama made the "red line" comment in August 2012, when he said he would change his calculus on armed intervention in Syria if Assad used or moved chemical weapons. Almost a year later, Assad’s regime killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack on the city of Damascus. Even though Assad crossed the "red line," Obama chose not to strike Syria and instead looked to Congress to authorize force. Eventually, through a deal with Russia, Syria handed over its chemical weapons, and no strikes were fired in direct retaliation for the chemical attacks. Throughout August and September 2013, as policymakers and pundits debated how to respond to the Syrian chemical attack, Trump lambasted the Obama administration, while simultaneously saying the United States should not intervene. We found more than 20 Trump tweets making that point. Here’s a sample: "What I am saying is stay out of Syria," he wrote Sept. 3, 2013. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sept. 5, 2013, he wrote, "The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!" he tweeted the same day. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Although Trump’s position seems to have changed from 2013, there is an important consistency: his critique of Obama’s decision to set a red line in the first place then ignore it. "President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!" he tweeted Sept. 1, 2013. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com He reiterated this point in the April 2017 press conference. "The Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand," Trump said. "And when he didn't cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world because it was a blank threat." Trump added that the most recent chemical attacks "crossed a lot of lines," yet he declined to say whether he would take military action in retaliation because he doesn’t want to tip off Assad. "I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other, but I’m certainly not telling you, as much as I respect you," Trump said to a reporter. The Trump administration has accelerated airstrikes and other actions in Syria that began at the tail end of the Obama’s second term. In March, the Trump administration said it would send 400 additional troops to Syria to fight the Islamic State. Our ruling Van Susteren said Trump "had a different opinion" in 2013 than he does now about whether Obama should have intervened in Syria after Obama’s "red line" was crossed. In 2013, Trump said emphatically that the United States should not attack Syria even though the Assad regime crossed the line by using chemical weapons. But in 2017, he criticized the Obama administration for not reacting to the 2013 chemical weapon attack with force. Trump admitted that his position on Assad has changed.

pomt-12512	"The single-largest expense in over half of American households is child care."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/26/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-wrongly-says-child-care-costs-top-oth/	Correction: This report originally misquoted Trump’s comments based on reporting at the event as saying, "The single largest expense in American households is child care." According to video of the event, Trump said, "The single largest expense in over half of American households is child care." We have corrected the fact-check as such and changed the the rating from False to Mostly False. At a meeting in Berlin focused on empowering women entrepreneurs, first daughter and presidential adviser Ivanka Trump said her father stood completely behind women in the workplace. "He's been a tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive," Trump said. She said the thousands of women who have worked for her father know this to be true and that her father would prove it with his policies. "The single largest expense in over half of American households is childcare, even exceeding the cost of housing," Trump said April 25. "So it’s an enormous problem and it's one my father is committed to tackling" The high cost of child care has been well documented. Child Care Aware, a trade and advocacy group, found that it cost on average over $17,000 a year for infant day care in Massachusetts. The question is, does paying for child care top all the other expenses that half of the households have to cover, such as housing and food? Government data suggests it does not. For most families, the No. 1 cost is housing. The latest data on child care comes from a 2011 survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. It found that for all families with children under 15-years-old, child care costs 7 percent of their monthly income. The fraction was highest for families making less than $1,500 a month. They represented about 10 percent of the sample and paid nearly 40% of their income for child care. (However, the margin of error was quite large.) So then we looked at what Americans spend on their other needs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that in 2015, the average married couple with children spent about 31 percent on housing, followed by about 18 percent on transportation. For single parents, housing ate up about 37 percent of their budget, and transportation, about 17 percent. Health care was the only category that took up a lower fraction than child care (which this expenditure report did not highlight). Married couples with children spent about 6.8 percent and single parents about 5.2 percent on health care. We found two bits of information that add a bit of support for Trump’s assertion. The New America Foundation, a center-left think tank in Washington, reported in 2016 that in a handful of states, including West Virginia, Mississippi, New York and Nevada, costs can rise above 30 percent of the state’s median income. But the underlying calculation used an expected cost of child care, not actual spending. A 2015 article in Forbes reported, "For many parents the cost (of child care) is greater than housing, transportation or utilities." However, the source behind that was a survey from the Child Care Aware organization. That group’s latest report is more restrained. It said the price tag in every state "rivals families’ annual expenditures on housing, transportation and the cost of tuition at a four-year, public university." It went on to say "in 38 states, the cost of infant care exceeds 10 percent of the state’s median income for a two-parent family." But neither statistic puts the cost of child care above all other expenses for half of all households. We reached out to the White House and as of publication, were still waiting for numbers. Our ruling Trump said that child care is the single largest expense faced by half of American families. We could find no data to support that. The number we did find suggests it isn’t the case. A government survey in 2011 found that the average family spends about 7 percent of its monthly income on child care. For the poorest households, the number rises to nearly 40 percent. Meanwhile, the government’s consumer expenditure survey found households with children spend at least 30 percent of their money on housing and at least 17 percent on transportation. The two data sets are not perfectly comparable, but they don’t suggest that child care tops the list of expenses for half of all families. Child care is a staggering burden for lower income households. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13472	For immigrants with visa overstays, "we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/12/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-theres-no-effort-against-visa-over/	Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence says that in addition to deporting undocumented criminals and strengthening the border, the United States should be tougher about removing people who overstay their visas. "An enormous number of people come to this country legally and then simply overstay their visas because we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law," Pence said Sept. 4 on NBC’s Meet the Press. People who have overstayed their visas account for a large portion of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, about 40 percent by some estimates. Are government officials really making no efforts against people who overstay their visas, or to uphold the law? Pence’s team guided us to a June Washington Times article that says immigration officials "catch an abysmally small percentage of the illegal immigrants who arrived on visas but overstayed their welcome." The article attributes that factoid to an admission of immigration authorities. But there is more to the story. Enforcement priorities U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does go after visa violators, but the agency prioritizes violent undocumented immigrants. The agency’s top focus is the removal of people convicted of violent crimes, such as murder and rape, ICE spokesperson Dani Bennett said via email. People who overstay their visas but don’t pose a threat to national security, public safety or border security fall into ICE’s second priority. The conservative-leaning Washington Times reported that at least 480,000 people didn’t leave the country as expected in fiscal year 2015. Immigration officials investigated just 10,000 of these cases and arrested fewer than 2,000 because, as the Times reported, "the others don’t rise to the level of being priority targets." The article was based on a June 2016 House Homeland Security Committee hearing on overstays. Homeland Security Department officials testified that out of the nearly 10,000 leads pursued: about 4,100 cases were closed for being in compliance; at least 3,000 were under current investigation; 1,910 were arrested, and the rest were under "continuous monitoring and further investigation as appropriate." ICE data shows that out of a total 235,413 removals in fiscal year 2015, about 18,500 were second-priority removals. There’s no breakdown of how many of those were visa overstays (that category also includes those convicted of drug-related crimes, unlawful possession or use of firearm and other misdemeanors). Indefinite number of overstays Immigration officials and scholars say not much is known about legal immigrants who overstay their visa, so they rely on estimates. In 2006, Pew Research Center said visa overstays could make up at least 4 million of the population here illegally, roughly one-third of that population. The first legal requirement for an entry-exit system came in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. It took about 20 years before DHS released its first ever Entry/Exit Overstay Report, though it only contained information for fiscal year 2015. Almost 45 million people were expected to leave in fiscal year 2015, the report said, and about 98.8 percent did so on time. About 482,700 were still in the country by Sept. 30, 2015, the end of the 2015 fiscal year. That dropped to 416,500 by Jan. 4, 2016. Overstay consequences While DHS devotes less enforcement resources to visa overstays than it does to border enforcement, violators are still apprehended and removed, said Donald M. Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank studying international migration. Undocumented immigrants also are not eligible for most public benefits, said Robert Warren, an expert on immigration and senior visiting fellow at the center. People who overstay their visas and become undocumented may also face limitations when applying for jobs. The Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986 forbids employers from knowingly hiring people who are not authorized to work in the United States. If they leave and want to come back, they may be disqualified from getting a visa and not be let in, said Lazaro Zamora, a Bipartisan Policy Center senior policy analyst. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, unlawful presence for more than 180 days is punishable by a 3-year bar against re-entering, and unlawful presence of one year or more is punishable by a 10-year ban, Zamora said. Our ruling Pence said, "An enormous number of people come to this country legally and then simply overstay their visas because we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law." Pence’s statement suggests there are no repercussions for people who overstay their visa. While they are not ICE’s top concern — officials say they prioritize the removal of convicted criminals over visa violators— they can still be deported and barred from coming back into the United States. About 8 percent of the 235,413 people removed from the country in fiscal year 2015 belonged to a category that includes visa overstays.

pomt-08110	Says federal health care overhaul will cost Texas state government "upwards of $30 billion over the next 10 years."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/dec/12/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-federal-health-care-overhaul-c/	Stumping for his book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington, Texas Gov. Rick Perry often criticizes federal actions that he sees as overreaching, including the Democratic-steered health care overhaul that President Barack Obama signed into law in March. In a Dec. 3 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Perry called the plan "one of the greatest intrusions into our lives" and objected to its "massive cost" to states. "It will cost the State of Texas upwards of $30 billion over the next 10 years," Perry said. Why does the state expect the law to drive up its spending? One big reason is that it's projected to add about 2 million Texans to the number of people on Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and disabled whose costs are shared by federal and state government. The new Medicaid recipients fall into two groups. The first: People made eligible by the new law, which starting in 2014 is anyone who makes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. (For a family of four, the level is $29,327. For a single person, it's $14,404.) This expansion will be a big change for Texas, which limits access to Medicaid more than most states. Currently, adult Texans without children do not qualify, and the vast majority of Medicaid beneficiaries are kids. The second: People who were eligible for Medicaid before the health care law passed but haven't signed up. According to Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, some of these people are expected to come onto the rolls because of the requirement in the new law that all individuals obtain health insurance starting in 2014. These folks are more expensive for the state to serve than the first group because the federal government is expected to pay about 60 percent of their Medicaid costs, as opposed to almost all the costs for the newly eligible. We've heard state leaders talk about the projected costs before. In March, we rated Barely True Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst's statement that "this federal plan costs Texas taxpayers $2.4 billion per year." That number was based on a commission analysis that the law would cost Texas $24.3 billion over the decade running from 2014 through 2023. Dewhurst's statement was problematic on several fronts, partly because it was based on an outdated version of the law. In late March, the commission updated its 10-year cost estimate, raising it to $27 billion. At the time, Executive Commissioner Tom Suehs told lawmakers: "I can tell you right now we have not included all the items we believe that'll have a fiscal impact to the state." Here's how the $27 billion in costs breaks down: $9.5 billion for the "Medicaid expansion" enrollees — people made eligible by the federal law — and $8.6 billion for enrollees who were eligible for Medicaid before the new health care law passed. The rest, $8.9 billion, is what it would cost the state to continue higher payment rates that the new law mandates for primary care services. The federal government will fund the higher rates through 2014, but after that, state lawmakers will have to decide whether to chip in the money to continue paying providers more, Goodman said. If they do, the feds would share the cost as they do now for Medicaid. So, where does Perry get "upwards of $30 billion over the next 10 years"? His spokeswoman, Katherine Cesinger, said that the governor simply "rounded" up from $27 billion and that he was referring to the 10-year period that starts in 2014. But "the next 10 years" begins in January, 2011. The commission's analysis puts the tab for 2011 through 2020 at $13.1 billion, half the 2014-23 estimate. And if lawmakers choose not to continue the provider rate increases, the total drops to $8.4 billion. An essential fact underlying all these figures: Health care reform becomes more expensive for the state as time goes on. Among the factors driving up costs down the line is the federal government's declining contribution for Medicaid. During the first three years of the Medicaid expansion (2014-2016), the feds pay all the cost of newly eligible enrollees. Starting in 2017, that federal share starts to drop, reaching 90 percent by 2020. Another essential fact: So far, we've only mentioned the cost of health care reform to the Health and Human Services Commission. A June report by State Comptroller Susan Combs enumerates other costs — as well as some financial benefits — to the state as a whole, although it doesn't offer a net figure. (The comptroller's report also uses a different time period than the commission's, focusing on the 10 years from 2010 through 2019.) For instance, on the expense side of the ledger is the mandated expansion of health plans administered by the Employees Retirement System of Texas, the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M University System. One of the pluses: The comptroller's office estimates that the state will receive $1.3 billion in new revenue from a tax on premiums charged by insurers and health maintenance organizations licensed by the Texas Department of Insurance. As for the projected increase in Medicaid costs, the comptroller's report jibes with the health commission's estimates. But it also tabulates the hefty federal contribution. For every dollar the state spends on new Medicaid enrollees through 2019, the federal government will spend $13, according to the figures in the report. The total federal contribution: $76 billion. We asked Perry why he had focused solely on the commission's cost projections. Cesinger told us: "We fully recognize there will be additional costs to state government separate from the (health commission) costs. Unfortunately, those additional costs are difficult to calculate because it depends on factors yet to be determined," including how parts of the law are implemented. All told, Perry's sweeping statement is correct in one sense — federal health care reform will eventually cost the state billions. But he errs on several fronts. The latest cost projection from the Texas health commission is $27 billion, not $30 billion; the estimate covers 2014 through 2023, not the next 10 years; and it speaks only to a single state entity, not all of state government. We rate Perry's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08668	"While many of his colleagues turned down a $2,500 pay raise ... (Jeff) Plale pocketed the extra money."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/13/citizens-progressive-wisconsin/wisconsin-state-sen-jeff-plale-pocketed-2500-year-/	Voters in a Milwaukee-area state Senate contest can be forgiven if they are confusing campaign literature with liquor advertising. Citing a laundry-list of complaints, the Progressive Wisconsin Political Fund has been labeling Democratic incumbent Jeff Plale an "Absolute Conservative." Plale is facing Milwaukee County Supervisor Chris Larson in the Sept. 14 primary. The district is heavily Democratic, but ideologically split. That led to the outside groups joining the fray. On the anti-Plale side, the Progressive Wisconsin Political Fund has mailed a dozen or more pieces, with many using a replica of the Absolut vodka bottle. Plale, of South Milwaukee, says he is puzzled by the vodka bottle image. "I don’t even like vodka," he said. Less confusing is the message in a piece labeled "Welcome to Plale’s Playhouse," featuring a cartoonish version of Plale standing in a tree house under a sign: "Typical Politicians Only!" Citing several issues, the piece argues that Plale puts his own interests before taxpayers. It includes this claim: "Last year, while many of his colleagues turned down a $2,500 pay raise because Wisconsin faced a deficit and our families faced tough economic times, Senator Plale pocketed the extra money." As a source, the fund cites a Feb. 9, 2009 item from the St. Paul Pioneer Press, which itself is a reprint of a Wisconsin State Journal editorial from the day before. So did Plale take the money and run? Members of the state Assembly and Senate are paid $49,943. They received a $2,530 (5.06 percent) annual pay raise, which took effect in January 2009 and lasts for the current two-year legislative term. The raise amounts to about $210 a month. State lawmakers automatically got the increase to their salary -- a boost set by an administrative panel and approved by a bipartisan committee from both chambers. So there is no way to turn down the salary increase itself. "I have to pay them their full salary," said Robert Marchant, Senate chief clerk and administrator. The raises come at a time when state employees -- but not state lawmakers -- are required to take 16 unpaid furlough days, eight in the fiscal year that started July 2009 and eight in the fiscal year that started July 2010. And with lots of private-sector employees taking recession-driven pay cuts, many state lawmakers have made a point of giving their raises back. In the Senate, 31 of the 38 members have returned the money in one form or another, according to Marchant. There are several ways to do this, from taking unpaid furlough days to simply writing a check and depositing it back in the state coffers. Others have given the money to charity, though there is no system for tracking that. Plale said he is taking 16 unpaid furlough days to "give back" his raise. "That comes close to washing that out," Plale said. "How can I ask my staff to take 16 unpaid work days and not do it myself?" Will it even out in the end? According to Marchant, Plale in July 2009 began docking his monthly paycheck by $91.20. Over the course of two years, that will be the equivalent of 16 days of salary. From July of 2009 to Sept. 1, 2010, Plale had returned $1,276.90. Over the full two-year period, that would amount to $2,189, or 43 percent of the full raise. So what about the original claim, that Plale pocketed the money? Plale’s salary did go up, there was no way to stop that. He did not start giving the money back right away, as a few lawmakers did. Once other state employees were required to take furloughs, Plale imposed the same standard on himself -- long before the direct mail piece was sent. But that approach won’t account for the full raise, only about 43 percent of it. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-05516	"What president has the worst record on female labor force participation? Barack Obama."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-chart-claims-barack-obama-has-worst-re/	Amid signs that Barack Obama has gained ground among female voters, Mitt Romney is attacking the president on his record on women. We have already rated one claim from the Romney campaign, that "women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama," which earned a Mostly False. Now we’ll rate a second claim posted on the Romney campaign's website that was forwarded to us by a reader. "What president has the worst record on female labor force participation?" the website asks. "Barack Obama." It adds, "Turning the clock back 20 years on American women." First, it's important to note that the statement is confusing because it offers two time frames for the claim. The first sentence refers to the "worst record," suggesting that Obama has the worst record of any president. But then it seems to narrow that time frame to 20 years. We focused on the first part, since it’s so sweeping and since it's clear about what it refers to -- labor force participation, a standard economic statistic that’s checkable. Let's define our terms. The "labor force" includes people who are either employed (either full- or part time) or are unemployed (available and looking for work). It does not include people who aren’t currently seeking work. The statistic "labor force participation" divides the labor force by the total population excluding the military and people who are institutionalized. The statistic goes beyond the familiar unemployment rate, taking into account people who have left the job market, perhaps to go back to school, become a stay-at-home parent or retire. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has labor force participation data going back to 1948. When we checked with the Romney campaign, a spokesman told us that the point of the claim was that Obama was the only president to preside over a significant decline in female labor participation. So we looked at the data. Making comparisons between presidents is tricky, because different presidents served for different lengths of time. So to make things simple, we looked at the female labor participation rate at the beginning and the end of each president’s term. It turns out that every president between Dwight Eisenhower (the first president to start a new term after 1948) and Bill Clinton saw an increase in women’s labor force participation during their terms. The two most recent presidents saw declines -- 0.7 percentage points under George W. Bush and 1.7 percentage points under Obama. But were those losses attributable to either president? The arc of women’s employment participation rose gradually but consistently. It rose from roughly one-third of women in the work force in 1948 to about 57 percent in the late 1980s. In the almost quarter-century since then, labor force participation rates have moved in a fairly narrow range, topping out at 60.2 percent. And the reason for the long upward climb? Far-reaching social trends that are generally out of the control of any president, including the rise of feminism, the advent of birth control, and rising interest in providing girls with an education equal to that of boys. "Long-term social trends have pushed in the direction of rising labor force participation rates among women for decades," said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who served as an outside adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. So, the fact that the labor participation rate for women rose by 3.8 percentage points under President Richard Nixon but fell by 1.7 percentage points under Obama isn’t very illuminating. The main reason for the difference is that Nixon happened to serve during a long period of rising workforce participation rates for women, while Obama happened to serve during a period when the rate has been stuck at more or less the same level for more than two decades. The current labor force participation rate for women age 16 and over is 57.7 percent. It’s true that this represents a low point in recent history. The last time it was this low was in April 1993, when Bill Clinton was president. That was 19 years ago -- close to the 20 years cited in the Romney web graphic. That said, there’s a lot of critical facts that Romney’s claim ignores. The drop in female labor participation is -- so far, at least -- pretty small. Between February 1989 and today -- a period that includes 277 monthly data points -- female labor participation moved up and down within a range of just 3.1 percentage points, a tiny fraction of the movement it displayed between 1948 and 1989. For the sake of comparison, the unemployment rate over the same period zigzagged in a range twice that big, 6.2 percentage points. Between January 2009, when Obama took office, and March 2012, the most recent month available, women’s labor force participation declined by 1.7 percentage points. (Starting the count the day Obama took office is probably not a fair way to measure his record, since his policies wouldn’t have had time to take effect, but we’ll use it here for the sake of convenience.) Considering that Obama inherited what many consider the worst recession since the Great Depression, a 1.7 percentage-point drop isn’t necessarily dramatic. It certainly could turn into a worrisome trend -- but that depends on where the number goes from here. "It depends on whether you see the recent declines as a temporary phenomenon due to a temporarily weak economy, or as the first installment that reverses much of a decades-long climb in the participation rate of women," Davis said. The decline in labor force participation under Obama was similar for men. Over the same period that the women’s labor participation rate was declining by 1.7 percentage points under Obama, the decline for men was actually steeper -- 2.2 percentage points. So labor force participation percentages don’t give much evidence that women in particular are suffering under Obama. This point is "what reveals it to be a political charge rather than an economic one," said Andrew Samwick, a Dartmouth College economist. In analyzing this question, the age of the workforce matters. As they age, more people tend to leave the job market. Given that the baby boomers are reaching or are already in retirement, a portion of the decline in labor participation rate for both sexes comes from the aging of the labor force. A straightforward way of minimizing the impact of aging workers on the statistics is to take a look at a more specific slice of the population -- workers age 25 to 54, who aren’t yet close to retirement. Economists can argue about whether this is a better measure to look at than ages 16 and up -- the figure used above -- but it’s certainly an alternative way of looking at the core of the working-age population. So how does Obama fare using this measurement? Labor participation for women in this age group fell by 1.3 percentage points between January 2009 and March 2012. During the same number of months into George W. Bush’s tenure, the labor participation rate for women in the same age group fell by 1.4 percentage points. Our point is not to say that Bush had a worse record than Obama for women’s employment. Rather, the fact that that Bush had slightly worse numbers than Obama did using this measurement runs counter to the Romney camp’s argument that Obama clearly had the "worst record on female labor force participation." The broader lesson of this comparison is that different statistics may show different trends, and when assessing the sweeping claim that Obama has the "worst record" on something, it’s important to look at the numbers from more than one direction. The decline in labor-force participation under Obama can’t be attributed to his policies alone. Presidents do not have unfettered ability to shape the labor markets. Obama inherited a serious recession, and that has had the biggest impact on women’s employment rates. As it happens, some of the hardest-hit employment sectors during the past few years -- state and local government -- attract a disproportionate share of women. According to BLS data, 57 percent of government workers are women. The state government workforce has shrunk by 2.6 percent since January 2009, and the local government workforce has shrunk by 3.3 percent since January 2009. Public education attracts particularly large numbers of women -- 71 percent of all employees -- and it has shrunk by 2.8 percent since January 2009. State and local government jobs cuts can't be pinned directly on a president. In fact, Republicans played a major role in shrinking public sector employment. A recent study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute found that the 11 states that voted in Republican legislatures in the 2010 elections accounted for 40.5 percent of all state and local government job losses. If anything, Obama’s policies may have eased the job losses in these sectors: A portion of his economic stimulus bill consisted of aid to states, which was designed to save jobs in education and other public services. A second round of stimulus worth $23 billion that Obama sought was rejected by Congressional Republicans. Our ruling Romney's website said, "What president has the worst record on female labor force participation? Barack Obama." According to federal statistics, every president since 1948 except for Obama and George W. Bush has seen women’s participation in the labor force rise on their watch, and Obama’s decline was bigger than Bush’s. So there’s a grain of truth to Romney’s claim -- but not much. The increases for presidents between 1948 and the late 1980s are largely due to broader social trends beyond the control of any president, so saying that Obama did worse than them is a red herring. Meanwhile, other cuts at the data paint a different picture. Under Obama, the decline in workforce participation for women was actually smaller than it was for men, and calculating the data using slightly different age groups shows that George W. Bush had a slightly worse record. This lack of context weakens Romney’s claim that Obama has the "worst record on female labor force participation" of any president.

pomt-11127	Rep. Dan Donovan "voted for Tax Cuts"	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2018/jun/04/donald-trump/did-rep-dan-donovan-vote-tax-cuts-trump-said/	President Donald Trump endorsed Rep. Dan Donovan for re-election, citing the Staten Island Republican’s support for tax cuts. In a tweet, Trump praised Donovan’s record on taxes, the military and other issues. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!" Trump tweeted. Donovan faces a challenge from former Rep. Michael Grimm, who held the seat before Donovan won a 2015 special election. Grimm resigned from Congress after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion charges in 2014. Donovan trailed Grimm by 10 points in a poll conducted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in April. Trump’s tweet could help narrow that gap. But is Trump right about Donovan’s record on tax cuts? Recent tax cuts A spokesperson for Trump did not get back to us with information supporting his claim, so we can't say for sure what he was talking about in his endorsement. A search on Twitter shows Trump tweeted about tax cuts four other times in May. Each of those tweets referred to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the federal tax law passed last year designed to lower taxes for the middle class and give major breaks to corporations and wealthy earners. Donovan was one of only 13 Republicans in the House that actually voted against the law. He and four other Republicans from New York state were against a part of the bill that limited the deductibility of state and local taxes. Residents were previously allowed to deduct an unlimited amount of those taxes. The new law caps that deduction at $10,000. "Capping this deduction – which has been a part of the U.S. tax code since 1913 – will increase taxes and harm the already-unaffordable housing market in my district," Donovan said in a statement at the time. "With the state and local tax deduction nearly eliminated, this tax bill doesn't equal relief for far too many New Yorkers." Past tax cuts Congress has passed other tax cuts since Donovan took office. He voted in favor of an omnibus spending bill that included more than $600 billion in tax relief in 2015. The bill permanently extended several tax breaks enacted during the Great Recession that were set to expire in 2017. The enhanced child tax credit, for example, gave couples without a tax liability a larger tax refund based on the number of children they have. The 2017 tax law allows an even larger refund for those families with the credit. The 2015 law also extended a $2,500 tax credit for low- and middle-income filers attending their first four years of college. That credit was not changed in the 2017 law. Other provisions of the 2015 law expanded another tax credit for low- and middle-income workers with children, allowed teachers to deduct up to $250 in school-related expenses, and extended other tax breaks Donovan also voted for a budget bill earlier this year that included more tax extenders for filers, and a bill in 2017 that gave extra tax relief to victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Our ruling Trump said Donovan "voted for Tax Cuts." That's actually true. Donovan has voted for tax cuts in the past, though he was against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year. Trump's other tweets about tax cuts refer to that law, but we can't assume what Trump was talking about. That makes Trump’s statement accurate, but it required additional information.

We wondered whether Cox’s claim is correct. His speech, it turns out, was written by Matthew Moran, communications director for House Speaker Bill Howell, R-Stafford. Moran told us his information came from statistics kept by the Legislative Information System, a 22-year-old database of bills and votes in the General Assembly. The records show that McAuliffe vetoed 32 bills this year and 26 in 2015. That comes to 58 in the past two years. Here are the four-year totals of each of the three previous governors: •Republican Bob McDonnell, 20 vetoes; •Democrat Tim Kaine, 44 vetoes; •Democrat Mark Warner, 18 vetoes. McAuliffe offers a simple reason for his many vetoes: The Republican-led General Assembly, he says, has passed a lot of what he considers to be bad bills. Among McAuliffe’s vetoes this spring were bills that would have: •Prohibited state agencies from punishing religious organizations that discriminate against same-sex couples; •Stopped state funding for Planned Parenthood; •Allowed home-schooled children to play on public school sports teams; •Prevented localities from removing Confederate monuments; •Repealed the governor’s ban on firearms in state office buildings; •Extended coal tax credits to help struggling coal regions; and •Given legislators control over implementing federal energy regulations. McAuliffe said he made it clear to legislators that he opposed these and other measures. "Unfortunately, they sent those bills to me," he told reporters. "And I vetoed them. No surprise." We should note that the comparisons Cox made in accusing McAuliffe of veto-mania are tightly drawn and wouldn’t hold up if Cox had extended them past the previous three governors. The two governors immediately beyond that threshold, Republicans Jim Gilmore and George Allen, issued 90 and 84 vetoes, respectively, during their four-year terms. The legislative database doesn’t go back further. It’s anyone’s guess whether McAuliffe, who enters the final full year of his term in 2017, will top those high-water marks. In addition to the 58 vetoes from 2015 and 2016 to which Cox referred, McAuliffe rejected 10 bills in 2014. That gives him a total of 68 vetoes through his first three General Assembly sessions. The role of partisanship As a side note, we wondered whether the governors with the most vetoes faced General Assemblies controlled by the opposite party and vice versa. We found a strong, but not ironclad, correlation. Allen, a Republican who served from 1994 to 1998, had 53 vetoes during his first two years, when the legislature was controlled by Democrats; and 31 during his last two years, when the House was run by Democrats and the Senate was evenly split between the parties. Gilmore, a Republican who served from 1998 to 2002, had 60 vetoes during his first two years, when control of the House and Senate was split between parties. He issued 30 vetoes during his last two years, when both chambers were controlled by Republicans. Warner, a Democrat who served from 2002 to 2006, issued 18 vetoes over his four-year term - the fewest by any recent governor - even though he faced a Republican legislature the entire time. Kaine, a Democrat who served from 2006 to 2010, had 27 vetoes during his first two years, when Republicans ran both chambers. He issued 17 during the second half of his term, when Democrats gained control of the Senate and the House remained in GOP hands. McDonnell, a Republican who served from 2010 to 2014, had four vetoes during his first two years, when the House was Republican and the Senate was Democratic. He issued 16 during his last two years, when Republicans controlled the House and the Senate was split. McAuliffe, a Democrat, has faced a Republican-controlled legislature during his first three years and, as we’ve noted, issued 68 vetoes. Our ruling Cox said, "In two years, Gov. McAuliffe has vetoed more bills than the previous three governors issued in each of their four-year terms." The record bears him out. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06348	"People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/07/wisconsin-anti-violence-effort-educational-fund/workplace-homicides-more-likely-where-guns-allowed/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s support of concealed carry gave his critics, some of whom want to recall him from office in 2012, another reason to slam him. On Oct. 30, 2011, two days before the concealed carrying of guns and other weapons became legal in Wisconsin, one visitor to a Facebook site that bashes Walker took a shot at the Republican governor and the law. She posted this statement from the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort Educational Fund: "People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it." Concealed carry has drawn high interest from gun owners -- more than 80,000 application forms for permits were downloaded by 9 a.m. on the first day the law took effect -- and from people who fear more gun carrying will lead to more violence. So we decided to check WAVE’s statement. In becoming the 49th state to legalize concealed carry, Wisconsin generally allows people age 21 and over to carry hidden handguns, stun guns, most knives and other weapons. But there are restrictions, including some that apply to workplaces. Owners and occupants of property can prohibit concealed carry on or in the property. And employers can prohibit employees from carrying concealed weapons while on the job. WAVE, which describes itself as the "only statewide grassroots organization solely dedicated to reducing gun violence, injuries and deaths," has been pushing businesses to post signs prohibiting concealed carry on their premises. It has made the claim that people are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms to tens of thousands of people through its website, emails and direct mail, said executive director Jeri Bonavia. The claim, she said, is based on a May 2005 article in the American Journal of Public Health, which publishes peer-reviewed scientific research. The article was written by researchers from the University of North Carolina’s Department of Epidemiology and Injury Prevention Research Center. We also found an earlier article on the same study, which appeared in another research publication, the American Journal of Epidemiology. The researchers examined 152 homicides that occurred in 143 workplaces in North Carolina from January 1994 through March 1998. They concluded that workplaces where guns were permitted "were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a worker homicide relative to those where all weapons were prohibited." So, the researchers said workplaces that allowed guns were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a homicide. In contrast, WAVE said people are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms. We asked Stephen Marshall, one of the researchers, whether WAVE’s wording was an accurate expression of what his study found; he simply reiterated the phrasing used in the study. We put the same question to other researchers; some said they thought WAVE’s statement was an essentially accurate expression of what the study found, while others thought WAVE’s wording was problematic. But there’s a more important question in terms of whether WAVE’s claim is accurate: Does the study’s major finding -- North Carolina workplaces that allowed guns were much more likely to be the site of a homicide -- apply to other states, including Wisconsin? Marshall said one could not assume that the five-to-seven-times statistic from his study would be true for Wisconsin or any other place. Other experts, however, gave a range of answers on whether the finding of the North Carolina study is applicable to Wisconsin workplaces. Applicability unknown: Susan Gerberich, co-director of the Regional Injury Prevention Center at the University of Minnesota, said that because the study was limited to North Carolina, it is not known whether the increased risk of workplace homicide would be true in other places. Corinne Peek-Assa, director of the University of Iowa Injury Prevention Research Center, said "generalizing epidemiologic studies is never simple." And Mary Vriniotis, research specialist with the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, said: "This study provides good evidence that workplaces allowing firearms increase the risk of workplace homicide," but "it's hard to say whether the findings in Wisconsin would be the same." Applicability possible: Epidemiology professor Sabrina Walsh of the University of Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center said it is possible the higher workplace homicide risk found in North Carolina would be true in other states. And Stephen Hargarten, director of the Medical College of Wisconsin Injury Research Center, said the North Carolina study should be cause for concern in Wisconsin that workplace homicides would occur more often in workplaces that allow guns than in those that don’t. Applicability likely: Daniel Webster, co-director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research, said that although the five-to-seven times statistic found in the North Carolina wouldn’t automatically apply to other states, "I don’t have any reason to think you’d have radically different findings" if the North Carolina study were replicated in Wisconsin. All the researchers said they were not aware of any other study like the one done in North Carolina. Our conclusion Citing a university study, the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort said: "People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it." Some experts faulted WAVE -- though others didn’t -- for using different wording than the study itself, which said North Carolina workplaces that allowed guns were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a homicide. Some experts said they could not conclude from the North Carolina study whether the higher likelihood of workplace homicide would be true in other places like Wisconsin. But other experts said the North Carolina study was proof that the workplace homicide rate in Wisconsin likely would be at least somewhat higher in workplaces that allow guns compared to workplaces that don’t. In sum, WAVE’s statement is generally accurate, but leaves out important details, such as that the study applied only to North Carolina. That’s our definition for Half True.

pomt-07782	Sunday liquor sales could generate $3.4 million to $4.8 million a year in additional sales tax revenue for Georgia.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/22/distilled-spirits-council-united-states/georgia-can-bring-big-bucks-ending-booze-ban-group/	Each year, a new round of a seemingly age-old debate takes place at the Georgia Capitol, and 2011 has been no exception. Should Georgia lawmakers end the Sunday ban on the sale of alcohol in stores? After Gov. Sonny Perdue and his threatened veto of Sunday sales legislation left office in January, supporters of the change took heart. But last week, state Senate leaders said there wasn’t enough support in the Republican-led chamber to end the ban. Some lawmakers oppose ending the ban for moral reasons. Proponents of "takeout "alcohol sales hope to persuade lawmakers Wednesday with a rally at the Gold Dome. One group that wants to end the ban made its case to legislators in a recent op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a Washington, D.C.-based group that says it represents many of the nation’s leading liquor manufacturers, says Georgia can add millions of dollars to its coffers from the sales taxes it would collect from people buying alcohol on Sundays. "Georgia stands to generate $3.4 [million] to $4.8 million in additional state tax revenues per year simply by repealing this outmoded ban," wrote the group’s vice president, Ben Jenkins. A PolitiFact Georgia reader was dubious that there would be an increase in liquor sales on Sunday since Georgians are already trained to make their purchases on Saturdays. He asked us to check out the council’s math. Georgia collects about $170 million a year in alcohol beverage taxes, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report in 2009. Alcohol can be consumed at many sports events, restaurants and bars on Sundays, but it can’t be sold in grocery or liquor stores. Connecticut and Indiana are the only states that currently ban Sunday sales of all three types of alcohol: beer, wine and liquor. The Georgia Department of Revenue has not studied the potential economic impact of ending the Sunday takeout ban, a spokesman said. Mark Stehr, an associate professor of economics at Drexel University in Philadelphia, has done several studies on the subject in recent years. His research shows there is a spike in all forms of alcohol sales on Sundays. "In most cases, people will plan around [a Sunday ban]," he said, "but some people forget or may be doing something with their kids and can’t buy on Saturday." The Distilled Spirits Council produced a four-page report that breaks down how it came up with its estimate. First, its study looks only at sales of liquor, not beer or wine. It used data from four states that relaxed their Sunday alcohol sales to help estimate the potential increase in Georgia. Those states, Delaware, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania, experienced statewide increases in sales between 5.8 and 9.5 percent. In order not to oversell the potential economic benefit, the council went with a 5 to 7 percent estimate. Using that 5 to 7 percent estimate, the council concluded there would be an increase of between 181,250 and 253,750 9-liter cases sold in Georgia a year. The council used Georgia’s 4 percent sales tax rate and added several state and local taxes to estimate that Georgia’s revenue from liquor sales would rise $3.4 million to $4.8 million a year. So what about this estimated 5 to 7 percent increase in sales? Is it correct? We asked around. Texas has studied the potential economic impact of allowing off-site consumption of alcohol. Its data shows the increase would be about 3.6 percent a year. Colorado lawmakers lifted a decades-old ban on Sunday liquor sales in 2008, boosting the state’s excise tax by 7 percent, USNews.com reported. A 2007 study for the National Tax Journal by Stehr reported the average state saw a per capita increase in the sales of beer and spirits of 4.1 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, after repeal of a Sunday sales ban. The council sent us that report to support its conclusion. Stehr, however, has since updated his estimate, based on additional data from states that have eased their Sunday rules. He found that states experience about a 3 percent increase in liquor sales when a takeout ban is lifted. "I think it’s unlikely," Stehr said of the council’s 5 to 7 percent estimate, "but it’s not completely out of the realm of possibility." The studies we found all show alcohol sales increase after a repeal. Some reports show a 5 to 7 percent increase in liquor sales is within the range of possibility, but Stehr believes it would likely be a bit lower. Other states, like Texas, also use lower estimates. With that caveat, we’ll be cautious about the council’s estimate that ending the takeout ban will result in an annual increase of $3.4 million to $4.8 million in taxes in the state of Georgia. It appears safe to say sales tax revenue would increase; the only question is by how much. Therefore, we rate the claim as Mostly True.

pomt-06622	"Poverty among Americans 65 and over is statistically unchanged" in recent years because of Social Security.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/19/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-said-social-security-keeping-older-a/	The most recent census numbers show poverty is on the rise. Median household incomes have fallen to their lowest level since the 1990s, prompting analysts to say we are in the midst of a "lost decade." Liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow reviewed the numbers on her prime-time show on MSNBC: The news that the U.S. poverty rate is now the highest it has been since the early '90s, nearly one in six Americans now living in poverty. And the specifics are even worse: Child poverty rose from under 21 percent to 22 percent. Poverty among Hispanic Americans went from more than 25 percent to more than 26 percent. Poverty among African-Americans went from just under 26 percent to over 27 percent. Poverty among white people is much lower than those other groups but it is rising, too, and fast. It went up from 9.4 percent to 9.9 percent. The only large segment of the American population that serves as any sort of silver lining in these poverty numbers is older Americans. Poverty among Americans 65 and over is statistically unchanged, even as it is getting so much worse for so many other groups of people. And that, of course, is because we have something in this country that keeps older Americans out of poverty. It's called Social Security. And the fact that Social Security works, that it is keeping old people out of poverty in America, even as everybody else is slipping into it, the fact that it works means that in Republicanland, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination is someone who says that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and a failure. We wondered if Maddow was right that Social Security is the main factor keeping older Americans out of poverty. We suspected the federal program likely played some role, but we also wondered what role traditional pensions played. So we decided to check it out. A review of how Social Security works: Workers contribute to the program via payroll taxes. (Most people are required to participate, with a few exceptions, such as retirement programs for government employees like those in Galveston County, Texas.) When workers reach retirement age, they file for Social Security benefits. The government calculates their benefits according to a formula primarily based on average lifetime earnings, and sends them monthly checks. They'll get that amount, with small increases for inflation, until they die. Social Security has become a political topic lately because officials project the program won't take in enough money to pay full benefits starting around 2036. Most people agree the program will have to be changed to make it more financially solid. Getting back to our fact-check, Maddow is right that the poverty rate for Americans over age 65 is quite stable. For 2010, it was at 9 percent, up slightly from 8.9 percent in 2009, and lower than it was during the 1990s, when it reached a decade-high 12.9 percent in 1992. Next, we wanted to know how much Social Security made a difference to seniors with relatively low incomes: Quite a bit, it turns out. The Social Security Administration performs economic analysis and publishes research statistics for Americans over age 65. The latest research available is for 2008, but Melissa Favreault, an expert on Social Security with the Urban Institute, told us she didn't expect the percentages would be significantly different for 2010. The Social Security Administration looks at taxpayers aged 65 and older, dividing them up by income into five groups, from the lowest earning group to the highest. (For you non-policy wonks out there, these five groups are known as quintiles.) The numbers show that the less income people have, the more they depend on Social Security. Meanwhile, people who get pensions tend to be in the higher earning groups. Meanwhile, the Census Bureau stated in its recent report that Social Security was keeping millions of people out of poverty: "In 2010, the number of people aged 65 and older in poverty would be higher by almost 14 million if Social Security payments were excluded from money income, quintupling the number of elderly people in poverty." If you added 14 million additional seniors to those already in poverty in 2010, the poverty rate for American over age 65 would be 45 percent, not 9 percent. We also found a 2008 report on Social Security from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that analyzed ways to improve the future financing of Social Security. The report starts: "Social Security has significantly reduced elderly poverty. The elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35% in 1959 to an all-time low of 9% in 2006, in large part because of Social Security. If Social Security benefits did not exist, an estimated 44% of the elderly would be poor today assuming no changes in behavior." Still, there are a few other things to consider when evaluating Maddow's statement. Some seniors get public assistance from federal, state and local programs, particularly if they are poor or disabled. Those programs also have a role in keeping low-income seniors out of poverty. (Going back to the Social Security statistics that analyze quintiles, about 8 percent of the lowest quintile receives 50 percent or more of its income from public assistance.) Health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid could also indirectly increase people's income by paying for health care costs that they might otherwise pay out of pocket. Then there's the argument to be made that some Social Security beneficiaries would have saved the money on their own, in other more productive ways. We fact-checked Ed Schultz's statement on what poverty numbers might look like if Social Security had never existed, and looked in some detail at different scenarios. Finally, Social Security is not specifically aimed at keeping people out of poverty; many middle and upper-class people benefit as well. Social Security payments are based on people's lifetime earnings, so the more people earned during their working years, the more they get from Social Security. However, Social Security is progressive in the sense that low earners get more back in benefits than they contribute via payroll taxes. Andrew Biggs, an expert on Social Security with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that Social Security isn't particularly effective if looked at solely as an antipoverty program. "In 2010, Social Security spent over $575 billion on retirement and survivors benefits, which comes to $14,675 for each person over age 65 –- enough to give every person a benefit that's 50 percent above the poverty line," said Biggs. "And yet we still have 10 percent of seniors in poverty. If reducing poverty was our only goal, we could do a lot more while spending a lot less than we do." In rating Maddow's statement, she's largely correct that Social Security keeps a significant number of older Americans out of poverty. But other programs also play a role. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2011-09-19T16:29:58	2011-09-19	['United_States']

pomt-15355	In Florida, "the number of voters who now register as ‘other’ has grown by a million in the last 10 years. Compare that with the Democrats, who only grew by 300,000 and the Republicans who grew by just 200,000."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/08/chuck-todd/florida-no-party-voters-are-growing-question-why/	As the candidate field for the 2016 election continues to grow, the line between Republicans and Democrats is drawn, altered and emphasized. The race toward the primaries and the White House is starting, and the two major parties are, as usual, the ones to watch. Or are they? On a segment of Meet the Press this past Sunday, moderator Chuck Todd brought up a third group that may be just as important as the two major parties in the upcoming election. "The growing number of voters who don't affiliate with either major political party is reshaping our political system, perhaps more than you may realize," Todd said. Todd went on to describe how, according to a recent poll, a larger percentage of Americans identify as independent rather than as Democrat or Republican. Todd cited Florida as a specific example. "The number of voters (in Florida) who now register as ‘other’ has grown by a million in the last 10 years," Todd said. "Compare that with the Democrats, who only grew by 300,000 and the Republicans who grew by just 200,000." Has the number of independents really increased by a million? And what do those changes mean? Starting with 2014 as the most recent complete year, PunditFact looked at Florida voter data going back to 2004. We looked at last voter registration report before the November election. The chart below summarizes what we found. Registered Republican voters Registered Democrat voters No Party Affiliation 2004 3,892,492 4,261,249 1,886,013 2014 4,172,232 4,628,178 2,778,547 10-year change 279,740 366,929 892,534 Percent increase 7.19% 8.61% 47.32% The numbers are relatively close to what Todd said. (After hearing from Todd's staff, the differences mainly appear to be the result of rounding and whether or not you count minor parties such as the Reform Party, the Constitution Party and the Florida Socialist Workers Party, among others.) So the numbers are in the ballpark. Still, there are a few caveats to consider. No Party Affiliation is a catch-all Florida’s most recent voter registration form became effective in October 2013. In the Party Affiliation box, registrants are asked to choose whether they are affiliated with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, a minor party, or no party at all. However, if left blank, registrants are automatically registered as having no party affiliation. PunditFact has asked the Florida Department of State how many people are registered with No Party Affiliation because they left the field blank. If we get an answer, we’ll update this item. No Party Affiliation doesn’t translate to no party In an article published in 2014 by Politics in Polk, Kevin Wagner, an associate professor of political science at Florida Atlantic University, warned about some additional nuances that are necessary to consider when talking about independent voters. "We have leaners or loosely affiliated voters," Wagner said. "Sometimes partisan voters like to call themselves independent. So just asking that question can be inaccurate." According to one 2009 article, once all the "leaners" are taken out of consideration, the pure independents actually end up totaling less than 10 percent of registered voters (with the leaners, independents total about 43 percent of the total registered voters). PunditFact also reached out to John Brehm, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. Brehm said it might be helpful to think of the "other" voters Todd mentioned as being divided into two categories. Young voters who have not yet formed a definitive identity mainly constitute the members of the first category. "The majority of these individuals will eventually come to identify with their parents’ party identities," Brehm said. "Some ... will be influenced by short term forces, typically economic, although sometimes having to do with major foreign policy crises (such as Sept. 11)." The other category of voters, described by Brehm as those who "left their partisan identity," includes "longtime Republicans or Democrats who say ‘their party has left them’." "Nearly all of these people will come to vote with their prior identities, and another large share will simply not vote," said Brehm. As far as not voting goes, the numbers at the polls seem to support this. In the 2014 midterm election, 28 percent of the voter turnout identified as independent. However, at the time, a Gallup poll recorded that independent voters made up 43 percent of registered voters. As Todd even put it during his show, "Even as the number of Americans identifying as independents has grown, we haven't seen a jump in the number of independent candidates, certainly none that are actually gaining traction, because there are none in the (presidential) race." Our ruling Todd said that "the number of voters (in Florida) who now register as ‘other’ has grown by a million in the last 10 years," while registered Democrat and Republican voters grew by 300,000 and 200,000 respectively. In Florida, voters who do not indicate affiliation on their registration forms are automatically placed in the No Party Affiliation category, artificially inflating the number of seemingly independent voters. And among voters registered as having No Party Affiliation, many still vote according to partisan lines. Still, the numbers are fairly close, and the trend is certainly spot on. Todd’s statement is accurate but needs some additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Update: We updated this item on July 8, 2015, to add more information explaining how NBC got its figures.

pomt-09880	"The Senate voted this week to allow illegal aliens access to Social Security benefits."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/29/chain-email/claims-senate-voted-give-undocumented-workers-soci/	You asked, so we're delivering. For nearly six months, loyal PolitiFact readers have encouraged us to look into a chain email about undocumented immigrants getting Social Security benefits. The e-mail has come in several forms, but most often goes as follows: "It does not matter if you personally like or dislike Obama. It is already impossible to live on Social Security alone. If the government gives benefits to illegal aliens who have never contributed, where does that leave those of us who have paid into Social Security all our working lives? Please sign this petition and flood President Obama's e-mail box with e-mails that tell him that, even if the House passes this bill, he needs to veto it. ... The Senate voted this week to allow illegal aliens access to Social Security benefits." Typically, the text is followed by hundreds of signatures asking President Barack Obama to veto said bill. The e-mails provide no bill number, no bill name and — oddly — they all insist that the Senate "voted this week" on the legislation. Yet, we've been getting the same petition for months. Digging back through our own archives we found the first version of this e-mail was sent on Feb. 13, 2009, a Friday. As with the many that have followed, the e-mail claimed the Senate had just voted on the bill, so we went back to the Congressional Record to see what the Senate had been debating that week, and we found that the stimulus was on the chamber's agenda. At first we thought the e-mail might have something to do with the stimulus package, but upon further investigation, we found that the claim goes back as far as 2006, as our friends at FactCheck.org have pointed out. (Then, the claim was used against senators who voted against an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Act that would have blocked Social Security benefits to legal immigrants who paid taxes before they obtained the right to work.) But back to 2009. We ran a search in Thomas, the Library of Congress's bill database, and found no such legislation. And just to be sure we hadn't missed anything, we contacted several groups that typically weigh in on the immigration debate to see if they'd heard otherwise. The answer from all corners was a resounding "no." "We're not aware of any such bill," said Ira Mehlman, communication director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates for stronger border security and stricter immigration laws. "This garbage has been floating around since 2006" when Congress was debating the immigration bill, said Jon Blazer, who is an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. "First it was George Bush, and they just changed the name to Obama." Like most chain e-mails, it seems this letter has morphed through a Web-based game of telephone. What started as a specious campaign attack back in 2006 has hung around as a rumor under the new administration. We've been getting this e-mail for six months, and every time, it exclaims that the Senate voted "this week" on such a bill. Unless our senators are trapped in a time warp, debating and passing the same bill every week, such a claim is impossible. It's Pants on Fire for this chain e-mail!

pomt-10091	Measures in Barack Obama's health plan could "lower health care costs for the typical family by $2,500 a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/30/barack-obama/savings-projection-is-best-case-scenario/	During a 30-minute campaign ad that aired Oct. 29, 2008, Barack Obama laid out his policy proposals in detail, including health care. "In the last year, I've visited many hospitals that are computerizing records and implementing technology that improves patient care and dramatically reduces costs," Obama said. "That's why my health care plan includes improving information technology, requires coverage for preventive care and pre-existing conditions, and lowers health care costs for the typical family by $2,500 a year, and you can keep your same coverage and your same doctor." As Obama's statement makes clear, he brings down costs by introducing efficiency to the existing health care system. He believes the savings should be reflected in lower costs for health insurance and medical care. We wanted to look into that $2,500 number and see what's behind it. From our previous coverage of health care, we know that it's difficult to forecast costs with precision . But we were curious whether Obama's number was an approximation of realistic savings or an outlandish exaggeration of what experts would say is possible. The Obama campaign pointed us to a memo several researchers at Harvard University wrote after the campaign asked them to review Obama's plan . Their report concluded that health savings could reach about $2,500 per family, though they included the caveat that "there is no consensus in the research community about how much each element will save, or how much could be saved if these elements were effectively implemented in combination." We then turned to an independent health policy expert, Kenneth Thorpe of Emory University. He drew up detailed examinations of the Obama and McCain health plans that he published this summer. Thorpe considered savings that could be achieved through the following Obama proposals: • expanding evidence-based, best practice programs in public programs like Medicare • accelerating the adoption of electronic health information technology, such as electronic medical records • promoting wider use of wellness programs designed to reduce obesity and smoking • reducing administrative costs through changes in insurance programs • creating a clinical effectiveness research institute to discourage unproductive health care spending • improving patient safety by reducing preventable medical errors Obama's plan has additional cost-savings measures that relate to the way private insurance works. Thorpe did not include those measures in his analysis. Thorpe concluded that by 2012, the Obama plan could reduce health care spending by $203 billion to $273 billion per year. It sounds like a lot, but it's actually not that much when you consider the United States spends more than $2.5 trillion annually on health care. Thorpe's report figured that Obama's proposal could reduce total spending by between 6 and 9 percent. Other researchers believe it could be more, with some estimates as high as 30 percent. So take the total savings Thorpe found and divide it by about 140 million tax filers -- a rough equivalent for families -- and you get savings of between $1,500 and $2,000 per family. That's $1,000 to $500 away from what Obama touts, but he is likely using more aggressive savings targets. Both sets of numbers, however, are estimates based on events that have not yet come to pass, and it's not really possible to say that one set is wrong and another is right. Thorpe did say, though, that Obama's proposal is superior to John McCain's in achieving cost savings because Obama has designated funding to get initiatives off the ground, such as $50 billion over five years to encourage health information technology. McCain's plan does not include this funding, Thorpe said. The $2,500-per-family savings that Obama mentioned in his ad is a speculative estimate of what he hopes will happen once all the pieces of his plan are in place. It's $500 to $1,000 dollars higher than the number we came up with using Thorpe's independent analysis. We recognize that plans are vague and it's difficult to predict future numbers with any precision. But Obama's numbers are significantly higher than the best independent estimate we could find. So we find his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-30T00:00:00	2008-10-29	['None']
pomt-08470	"Houston suffered $1.7 billion in operating losses under Mayor Bill White."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/13/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-houston-had-17-billion-operating-l/	In a recent television ad, Gov. Rick Perry says Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White was a poor financial manager as mayor of Houston Perry's spot levels budget-related charges including this one: "Houston suffered $1.7 billion in operating losses under Mayor Bill White." We dug into this figure, which also pops up in a Perry ad that refers to the total as 17 billion dimes. In support of the number, Perry's campaign pointed us to a July report from Citizens for Public Accountability, which calls itself "a bipartisan group of retired partners of some of Houston's accounting firms." The report — written by Bob Lemer, a retired Ernst & Young accountant who often criticized city finances on White's watch — is titled "City of Houston Total Operating Losses Fiscal Years 2004-2009: $1.7 billion." In an interview, Lemer told us that he reached the figure by adding up the "change in net assets" entry from the city's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for each of the years White was mayor, 2004 through 2009. Because Houston's net assets declined every year, the cumulative change was a negative $1.69 billion. That figure, Lemer said, is the amount by which the city's expenditures exceeded its income during White's tenure. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon challenged the characterization of the $1.7 billion as an operating loss. "An operating loss is a business concept, not a government concept," she said. Lemer's report distorts "financial statements that are generated under government accounting standards," Bacon said. Say what? We decided to hit the books — one book, anyway — for a crash course in municipal finance. Our question: What are a city's "net assets" and what does it mean when they go up or down? According to "Financial Management in the Public Sector" by XiaoHu Wang, a public administration professor at the University of Central Florida, assets include land, building and equipment, as well cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities are what an organization owes to others. Subtracting liabilities from assets yields net assets. Cities track their net assets from year to year in their financial reports. A positive change means net assets increased; a negative number means they declined. The change "can be seen as an organization-wide operating surplus (or deficit)," the book says. Next, we asked Wang if it's fair to equate "change in net assets" with "operating loss," as Lemer did. Yes, Wang said, because both terms indicate a deficit. However, he cautioned that no single indicator, including this one, is sufficient to gauge a city's overall financial health. Other experts were critical of calling the $1.7 billion figure "operating losses." Lewis McLain, former executive director of the Government Finance Officers Association of Texas, told us that the problem with applying "for-profit" accounting terms — like operating loss — to nonprofit public entities is that their enterprises serve different purposes. "You wouldn’t expect the accounting for church finances to be exactly the same as for an automobile corporation," he said. While a company "focuses on measuring its use of assets to return a profit," a city focuses on the funding of a variety of expensive services for its citizens, "from road repair to police and fire officers to libraries and mowed parks." Diana Thomas, controller for the City of Austin, said the term "operating losses" is an unfair description; she noted that among the expenses subtracted from the city's net assets each year are long-term liabilities such as depreciation of assets and retiree benefits that will actually be paid out later. Cities only recently were required to account for some of those future costs on their current financial statements, Thomas said. McLain said the changes in accounting rules are a reason that Houston's "change in net assets" report shows high negative numbers. "The accounting profession has changed rules to recognize more of these (long-term) costs, since to not do so makes a huge liability less transparent," McLain said. "Houston is experiencing the same pressures as many cities across the state and nation. These liabilities have been accumulating for a number of years, mostly in the last three decades. It is not an overnight problem, and the solutions are going to be slow and painful." When asked what changes in net assets say about a city's financial health, McLain said: "Virtually nothing. In fact, they can be misleading and misused." The central purpose of a city's annual financial report, McLain said, is to fully report the financial affairs of a city functioning as "a multi-business entity with legal constraints on various monies that are placed in standalone funds for the purpose of accountability, control and disclosure." In fact, said McLain, "if you are going to talk about operating losses or gains," a more telling number is the balance in its general fund at the end of the year. The general fund, which is the government's largest kitty, helps supports most basic services, including police and fire protection. In Houston's case, the general fund balance increased every year that White was in office, except for 2009, McLain said, going from $136 million in 2004 to $332 million in 2008. The balance fell to $304 million in 2009. "That means revenues had to be bigger than expenditures for operations" during those years, McLain said. Summing up: The $1.7 billion figure for net operating losses in White's time as mayor has a basis in fact; the city's net assets did decline by that amount on his watch, though changes in accounting practices also drove up the number. Problematically, using a single private-sector measure to gauge overall financial performance in the public sector doesn't necessarily produce conclusive results. Houston's accumulated "changes in net assets" by themselves are an incomplete reflection of the city's fiscal health while White was mayor; the $1.7 billion figure may even be meaningless in this regard.

pomt-08727	"The states that actually have lots of teachers in teacher unions tend to be the states that have done the best in terms of academic success in this country."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/02/randi-weingarten/randi-weingarten-says-students-strong-union-states/	Education was the topic du jour on ABC's This Week on Aug. 29, 2010, and the discussion quickly came around to teachers unions. This Week host Christiane Amanpour asked Randi Weingarten, president of the American Teachers Federation, how schools can get around huge impediments in many collective bargaining agreements to getting rid of bad teachers. Weingarten responded with a quick defense of teachers unions. "Let me say this," Weingarten said. "First, the states that actually have lots of teachers in teacher unions tend to be the states that have done the best in terms of academic success in this country. And the states that don't tend to be the worst. "The issue is not a teacher union contract or a teacher union-management contract. What we have to do with these contracts is we have to make them solution-driven." We decided to check Weingarten's claim that states that "have lots of teachers in teachers unions tend to be the states that have done the best in terms of academic success." We realize we are wading into some treacherous waters here. An intense debate has raged for years over the effect of teacher unions on student achievement. On one side, you have those who believe unions act as an impediment to necessary school reforms; make it difficult to get rid of bad teachers, and oppose ideas like merit pay to encourage better teaching. On the other side are those who argue strong unions lead to better-paid, better-supported teachers, which helps to attract and retain better teachers and, in turn, contributes to improved student achievement. Weingarten's statement not only makes an absolute claim about better academic performance in states with strong unions, it implies unions are the reason why -- otherwise, why cite it? We contacted the American Federation of Teachers, which represents about 1.4 million K-12 teachers in the United States, to get backup for Weingarten's claim. Initially, spokesman John See pointed us toward a state-by-state breakdown on collective bargaining policies -- such as whether the state has a "right to work" law or allows strikes. And he included links to comparisons of academic achievement by state from the National Center for Education Statistics and Education Week. Strong union states like Maryland, Massachusetts and New York, See said, were among the highest ranked in these 2010 reports. Later, See also forwarded links to several studies linking teacher unions to higher student achievement. The first is a study published in 2000 in the Harvard Educational Review. According to the abstract: "Comparison of standardized test scores and degree of teacher unionization in states found a statistically significant and positive relationship between the presence of teacher unions and stronger state performance on tests. Taking into account the percentage of students taking the tests, states with greater percentages of teachers in unions reported higher test performance." The second is a 2002 survey of studies by Robert M. Carini of Indiana University Bloomington, who found that "While only 17 prominent studies have looked at the teacher union-achievement link, the evidence suggests that unionism raises achievement modestly for most students in public schools." However, Carini wrote that while studies seem to suggest that unions benefit middle range students, who are the majority, "a union presence was harmful for the very lowest- and highest-achieving students." "In fact, public opinion is split as to whether teacher unionism is harmful or helpful to educational outcomes," Carini wrote. "Considering both this general perception and the considerable rhetoric from both critics and supporters of unions, it is surprising that so little research exists on the unionism-achievement link. Still, the overall pattern in the research is increasingly clear; teacher unionism favorably influences achievement for most students in public schools." In an e-mail, See said the reports "make the positive findings pretty clear." If there were only one way to measure this statistic, See might be right. But, in fact, there are lots of variables in play. A 2008 paper written by Nathan Burroughs, a visiting research associate at the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy, cited numerous studies that seemed to make the case both for and against unions with regard to student achievement. "Ideally, the proper role of collective bargaining in public education could be settled by a consensus in the research literature," Burroughs wrote in his paper, Arguments and Evidence: The Debate over Collective Bargaining's Role in Public Education. "Regrettably, no such consensus exists." "While a body of research exists suggesting that collective bargaining results in greater student achievement (usually measured through standardized test scores, most commonly the SAT), another body of work suggests the opposite," Burroughs wrote. "To complicate matters, both veins of research generally employ different analytical and statistical methods, making a clear-cut comparison somewhat elusive. In addition, there is a limited number of quality research studies dedicated to the effects of collective bargaining on student achievement." What gives? For one, the studies that showed a positive effect from unions typically examined student achievement at a single point in time; while studies that showed lower student achievement in states with stronger unions usually measured achievement over time. We spoke to Burroughs, who explained that while a snapshot might show better scores in an affluent state compared to a poor one; students in an affluent state might improve less dramatically over time than a poor one, producing dramatically different results. It's simply two different ways to measure a school's performance. "The intensity of the debate over the role of collective bargaining has obscured the fact that empirical evidence supports either side of the discussion," Burroughs concluded. "There can be no verdict on whether collective bargaining in public education is 'bad' or 'good,' because there is insufficient evidence to warrant a definitive judgment. Much of the research on the effects of collective bargaining focuses on only one or two elements of the question or has results that appear dependent on a particular methodological strategy." In addition, Burroughs cautioned that collective bargaining is most likely an indirect causal factor when it comes to student achievement; as opposed to direct factors such as income or parental education. "It could be a spurious relationship," Burroughs told us. "The data really isn't there. When it comes to making claims about unions and student performance, it's just not clear. I think it's more constructive to focus on other things." We also spoke to Andy Rotherham, co-founder of the non-profit Bellwether Education Partners, an education columnist for TIME.com and the blog Eduwonk.com, and co-editor of the book "Collective Bargaining in Education." "On its face, it's true," Rotherham said of Weingarten's claim. "Massachusetts (a strong union state) does better than Virginia or Alabama. What it ignores is all of the things that influence student achievement." "It's a classic correlation-causation fallacy," said Rotherham, who previously served at the White House as Special Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy during the Clinton administration. Ultimately, he said, research is mixed and there is no study that can definitively settle whether unions are, or are not, the problem with student achievement. "Sweeping statements one way or the other on this should be viewed with suspicion," Rotherham said. We agree. Weingarten's claim that states that have lots of teachers in teacher unions tend to be the states that have done the best in terms of academic success is perhaps technically correct -- at least by some measures. But the empirical scientific research on this subject is -- in the words of Burroughs -- "limited, ambiguous and incomplete." Further, there is even less evidence to support the implication that strong unionization is the cause for one state performing better than another. And so we rate Weingarten's claim Half True.

pomt-03251	A United Nations working group has "adopted a proposed agenda" to enable member nations to "disarm civilians within their borders."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/12/chain-email/united-nations-document-shared-social-media-says-c/	A reader recently sent us a realistic-looking document from the United Nations with a pretty explosive claim -- that the world body is moving forward with plans to help member nations disarm their civilian populations of "military grade," "concealable" and "hunting grade" firearms, and even "ammunition and components to manufacture ammunition." Americans who support the right to bear arms have long expressed worry that the U.S. government is on the verge of taking away lawful citizens’ guns, and that concern has only increased when a U.N. body is believed to play a supporting role. The document sent to us by the reader would seem to be (pardon the expression) a smoking gun. Superficially, the document has the trappings of officialdom -- a blue U.N. logo at the top, along with the name of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, a real office. It’s dated Aug. 5, 2013, and labeled "restricted." The headline reads, "Disarmament Commission -- Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group." And it’s filled with believable bureaucratic jargon, such as creation of a "codification framework" and the need to undergo a "full review by the Office of the Secretary General." Here’s the full text: "The issue of military grade weaponry in the hands of civilians looms ever larger in the face of the global implementation of 22/Agenda 21 by member nations. In particular, the United States of America has an estimated 500 million weapons in the hands of its civilian population. This is not just a static problem, it is a massive dynamic problem for the process of confiscation as there will be those who refuse to surrender their firearms. "The conclusion of discussions by the CWCSG led to the adoption of a proposed agenda to begin the process for introducing to member nations a framework by which they can begin codification of national laws to disarm civilians within their borders through a graduated process. "Within the discussion framework, we have identified several problem areas that must be addressed, they are: "1. Classification of military grade weapons to be made illegal for possession. "2. Creation of programs to provide reasonable compensation for voluntary surrender of said arms. "3. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of concealable firearms. "4. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of hunting grade firearms. "5. Codification of laws to restrict the sale of, and possession of ammunition and components to manufacture ammunition. "6. Finally, codification of laws to completely makes (sic) any and all firearms illegal to own, possess or use outside of military and law enforcement usage. "7. Creation of a United Nations Police Taskforce with the specific mission of assisting member nations with the collection of weaponry from civilian hands. "The CWCSG will submit its findings and final recommendations once we have created the codification framework for member nations for a full review by the Office of the Secretary General." The document is persuasive enough to have been picked up by pro-gun advocates on a few message boards and Facebook pages. But is it real? When we checked with the United Nations, a spokesman declared it a fake. "I checked the document number on our internal document system, and the reply I got back now was simply, ‘There is no document matching your request,’ said Farhan Haq, associate spokesperson for the Secretary-General. "The document number (A/CN.11/L.72) doesn't conform to our standard system, in any case." In addition, Haq said, "there is no such body as a ‘Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group.’ Nor does the United Nations involve itself in confiscating weapons from member states." Finally, Haq said, "the use of blue ink, some of the type font and the scanner icon in the bottom right-hand corner are not found in real U.N. documents. So, in several different ways, this document is fake." Our ruling A document found on the Internet and circulating via email and social media says that a United Nations working group has "adopted a proposed agenda" to enable member nations to "disarm civilians within their borders." If the document were real, it would confirm the worst fears of those who fear a mass confiscation of handguns, hunting rifles and ammunition in the U.S. -- but a United Nations spokesman cited several reasons for concluding that the document is a fake, including the fact that the study group referenced in the document does not exist.

pomt-08238	"We now consume at the federal level 25 percent of the gross domestic product. Historically we were at 20 percent. So we've taken 5 percent away from the private sector."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-federal-spending-has-risen-25-perce/	With the rise of the fiscally conservative tea party and the recent release of a draft report by the presidentially appointed National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the nation's fiscal challenges have rocketed up the list of urgent agenda items in Washington. We'll take a look at two comments on federal spending made on the Nov. 14, 2010, Sunday talk shows -- one by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and the other by Sen.-elect Rand Paul, R-Ky. We'll address Paul's here. On CBS' Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer asked Paul whether he would favor eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, as the commission suggested. "No, once again, I'm on the other side," Paul said. "I want to be on the side of reducing spending. So I think really the compromise is where you find the reductions in spending. But I don't think the compromise is in raising taxes. I mean, you have to put things in perspective. We now consume at the federal level 25 percent of the gross domestic product. Historically we were at 20 percent. So we've taken 5 percent away from the private sector. And the private sector is the engine that creates all these jobs. I want to send that 5 percent back to the private sector." We'll focus on whether Paul's numbers are correct. As we did with Conrad's comment, we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole. The most recent full-year figure is for 2009, and it shows that federal spending accounted for 24.7 percent of gross domestic product that year, or 25 percent when rounded up. So Paul is correct. The second statistic -- the historical level of spending as a percentage of GDP -- is slightly more complicated, but here too Paul is basically correct. Over the past 40 years, spending has averaged 20.7 percent of GDP, though it has varied a bit over the years. In both the 1970s and the decade beginning in 2000, it was almost exactly 20 percent. In the 1990s, it was slightly higher, while in the 1980s it exceeded 22 percent. In fact, the only other years since 1950 in which federal spending exceeded 23 percent of GDP came in 1982 and 1983, with 23.1 percent and 23.5 percent, respectively. That was during and immediately after the last recession that rivaled the current one in severity, the 1981-82 recession. Economic downturns tend to affect this statistic because they slow GDP and increase the demand for government services. Even without special stimulus measures, spending goes up for mandatory items such as food stamps. So in 1983, under a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, the government spent just 1.2 percentage points less than the current level, which suggests that the recession shouldn't be ignored as a major reason why spending is so high. Still, Paul's larger point is valid. Federal spending is now approximately 25 percent of GDP, and that level is roughly 5 percentage points higher than the historical pattern. So we rate his statement True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2010-11-15T15:56:56	2010-11-14	['None']
pomt-04363	"Virginia papers called (Scott) Rigell’s campaign ‘Mostly False.’"	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/22/paul-hirschbiel/paul-hirschbiel-says-newspapers-called-scott-rigel/	Democrat Paul Hirschbiel, challenging U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, R-2nd , is airing a TV ad that portrays Rigell as a below-the-belt campaigner. The commercial says "Virginia papers called Rigell’s campaign ‘Mostly False,’" and the screen flashes a PolitiFact logo. Since Hirschbiel campaign chose to invoke our name, we decided to examine his claim. Hirschbiel’s ad cites a PolitiFact Virginia article from the 2010 election, when Rigell defeated one-term incumbent Democrat Glenn Nye. The article examined a Rigell ad claim that Nye voted "in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi" 83 percent of the time. In fact, Nye voted with the Democratic Party about 83 percent of the time, but with Pelosi -- who was House speaker back then -- only 66 percent of the time. Nye actually had one of the most independent records in Congress and Pelosi rarely voted in 2009 and 2010, a standard for House speakers. Rigell’s statement was rated Mostly False and the Republican also earned a False for another claim during his 2010 run. We should also note that last year, we rated a claim he made about U.S. borrowing as True. This year, we have not rated any campaign statements by Rigell. Our ruling Hirschbiel said Rigell’s campaign had been labeled "Mostly False" and attributed his statement to PolitiFact. PolitiFact Virginia rated a single 2010 election claim by Rigell as Mostly False, but we never passed judgment on the overall veracity of the candidate or his campaign. Hirschbiel’s statement was over the top and we give it our worst rating: Pants on Fire.	None	Paul Hirschbiel	None	None	None	2012-10-22T14:12:02	2012-09-28	['None']

pomt-09146	"Bill McCollum holds the same position on (embryonic stem cell research) as Barack Obama."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/11/rick-scott/bill-mccollum-and-barack-obama-stem-cell-research/	In a Republican primary, it's often hard to find major policy issues where the candidates disagree. That's why Rick Scott, the former health care CEO running for governor, is trying to make the most of a perceived policy difference with Attorney General Bill McCollum. In new direct mail pieces, Scott is claiming that McCollum supports embryonic stem cell research. Scott, meanwhile, says he would work to ban any embryonic stem cell research in Florida. "Career politician Bill McCollum -- Testing stem cells. Testing our values," the mailer reads. "Bill McCollum supports embryonic stem cell research. Bill McCollum holds the same position on this issue as Barack Obama, who recently lifted a ban on funding for embryonic stem cell research." McCollum disputed Scott's mailer, calling it false (and Scott "ruthless") in an interview with the Associated Press on June 7, 2010. "That's just absolutely not true. I don't know where he got that from," McCollum said. Sounds like a case for PolitiFact Florida. For this fact-check, we're going to detail to McCollum's public position on embryonic stem cell research, and then President Obama's. Then we'll see if they're the same, as Scott claims. McCollum's position Embryonic stem cells are harvested from embryos that are four or five days old. In almost every case, the stem cells are extracted from left-over embryos created by women attempting to get pregnant through invitro fertilization. Scientists say embryonic stem cells hold great potential, and can be used to test new drugs and have unique regenerative capabilities that could unlock treatments for heart disease, diabetes and other diseases. The embryos are destroyed in the process. To best understand McCollum's position on embryonic stem cell research, we need to start back in 1996 when McCollum was a congressman from Central Florida. That year, Congress attached an amendment to an appropriations bill that limited or banned federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. The Dickey Amendment -- named for Arkansas Republican Jay Dickey --- said that the federal government could not fund the creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes or fund research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death. The appropriations bill -- and the amendment -- passed 371-42. McCollum voted for the measure. The Dickey Amendment hardly ended the discussion, however, nor ultimately clarifies McCollum's position. The NIH produced a legal opinion that essentially created a loophole in the proviso. The federal government could not use tax dollars to create embryonic stem cells, the NIH said, but it could fund research on privately-created stem cell lines. Former President Bill Clinton's administration began crafting policies to fund embryonic stem cell research, but control of the White House changed before the new policies were implemented. Enter President George W. Bush. In August 2001, Bush essentially restated U.S. policy with an executive order. Bush gave a nationally televised speech, outlining his position -- that the federal government could and should fund research on the 60 or so embryonic stem cell lines already in existence, but that it would not fund research on new or future embryonic stem cell lines. Now, jump to the elections of 2004. Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry promised if elected to open new embryonic stem cell lines to federal funding. Bush maintained his opposition. The dichotomy between Kerry and Bush trickled down the Florida Republican Senate primary that year between McCollum and Mel Martinez. Martinez supported Bush's restrictions and pressed McCollum to stake out a position. Throughout 2004, newspapers generically said McCollum favored increased embryonic stem cell research, but provided little context. In July 2004, McCollum said: ''I think appropriate funding for embryonic stem cell research is a pro-life position. It conforms completely with my faith and my belief in the unborn and my belief of when life begins. And I'm one with my conscience and with my Lord.'' Then, in an August 2004 debate, Martinez fired a second bullet on the stem cell issue. According to the Miami Herald accounting of the debate, Martinez said: "What you should do is define yourself. Do you support President Bush on stem-cell research or do you not?" Martinez said. "Or will you continue to side with John Kerry on this very important issue, and one, frankly, that's becoming a dividing issue in the presidential contest?" McCollum interrupted, the Herald reported. "Mr. Martinez, you know that I do not believe in stem-cell research that takes a life." McCollum then pointed out that other conservatives support the research, and the Herald reported that McCollum has said that test-tube-fertilized embryos that are to be discarded at fertility clinics are not technically human life. He said they should be used for scientific experiments to cure diseases. McCollum lost the primary, and his position on embryonic stem cell research was not questioned again. Until now. Spokeswoman Kristy Campbell explained his current thinking. "The general has been consistent on this issue," Campbell said. "He's never supported creating embryonic stem cells simply for research. But if the only options were to destroy the stem cells, or use them for research, he's preferred they go to research." To recap: McCollum voted for the Dickey Amendment, which blocks federal funding of at least some embryonic stem cell research, but he has consistently advocated for stem cell research beyond that of President Bush. In particular, he has said if the options for embryonic stem cells are destruction or research, he chooses research. Obama's position Obama clearly detailed his position on embryonic stem cell research during the 2008 presidential campaign. "I believe that the restrictions that President Bush has placed on funding of human embryonic stem cell research have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations," Obama said in response to a question from the website ScienceDebate.org. "As president, I will lift the current administration’s ban on federal funding of research on embryonic stem cell lines created after Aug. 9, 2001, through executive order, and I will ensure that all research on stem cells is conducted ethically and with rigorous oversight," Obama wrote. "I recognize that some people object to government support of research that requires cells to be harvested from human embryos. However, hundreds of thousands of embryos stored in the U.S. in invitro fertilization clinics will not be used for reproductive purposes, and will eventually be destroyed. I believe that it is ethical to use these extra embryos for research that could save lives when they are freely donated for that express purpose." Practically, Obama's position was not altogether different that Republican nominee John McCain. McCain said he supported federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, but opposed the "intentional creation of human embryos for research purposes." In March 2009, Obama reversed U.S. policy and lifted Bush's ban on embryonic stem cell funding. Obama's reversal, however, is still somewhat limited by the Dickey Amendment. To recap: Obama supports increased funding for embryonic stem cell research, and reversed Bush's 2001 executive order. He says it is ethical to use extra embryos from invitro fertilization clinics that would otherwise be destroyed. Comparing the two Embryonic stem cell research is not a strictly partisan issue. The Republican-controlled Congress in 2005 passed a bill that would ease Bush's stem cell research restrictions, but it was vetoed by Bush. Among those supporting the measure were Republican senators Trent Lott, Orrin Hatch, Bill Frist and Kay Bailey Hutchison, and House Republicans Ginny Brown-Waite, Bill Young and Connie Mack. Bush also vetoed a similar measure in 2007 that passed with some GOP support. The key in this fact check, however, is to see if McCollum and Obama have the "same" position. On embryonic stem cell research, it appears McCollum and Obama are awfully close. Obama supports using embryonic stem cells that otherwise would be destroyed for research. McCollum does, too. The only real question is regarding funding. McCollum did vote for the Dickey Amendment, which sought to prevent federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. But in 2004, he talked about "appropriate funding" for embryonic stem cell research. Obama, meanwhile, has supported increased federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, saying embryonic stem cells "may have the potential to help us understand, and possibly cure, some of our most devastating diseases and conditions." There's enough of a question when it comes to funding in our minds to add a slight asterisk to Scott's mailer. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12869	"The overwhelming majority of America’s elite universities, they no longer require history majors to take a single course in American history."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/jan/30/don-willett/don-willett-elite-universities-dont-require-us-his/	Sounding a tad exasperated, a Texas Supreme Court justice told participants at a legislative forum that many young Americans have too little knowledge about basic U.S. civics and history. "Get this," Don Willett said at the January 2017 event hosted by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. "The overwhelming majority of America’s elite universities, they no longer require history majors to take a single course in American history." At first pass, we can imagine a student possibly majoring in history without studying American history. After all, if you’re seeking expertise in what’s happened someplace beyond North America, you probably didn’t get steeped in it before college. Still, do most American colleges not require that history majors take even one American history course? Willett cites report We asked Willett, whose name appeared on a 2016 Donald Trump list of U.S. Supreme Court prospects, the basis of his claim. Willett, known for his oft-humorous Twitter account, answered with an email pointing out a report, closing his reply: "Gotta avoid that dreaded Robe on Fire rating." The July 2016 report -- issued by the Washington-based American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which says it’s an independent group "committed to academic freedom, excellence, and accountability at America's colleges and universities" -- states that 23 of the 76 U.S. colleges and universities ranked most highly by U.S. News & World Report were requiring students seeking a history degree to take courses in American history--so 70 percent were not. Do Top-Ranked U.S. Universities Require History Majors to take American History? SOURCE: Report, "No U.S. History?," the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, July 1, 2016 Also, the report says that among the high-ranked institutions requiring a course in American history, "11 allow courses so narrow in scope—such as ‘History of Sexualities’ or ‘History of the FBI’—that it takes a leap of the imagination to see these as an adequate fulfillment of an undergraduate history requirement." At the council, the study's lead author, Michael Poliakoff, told us by email that the focus was on university requirements "based on the understanding that it is through requirements that a program articulates its own concept of academic priorities." Poliakoff said the research did not try to gauge how many history students take at least one U.S. history course. Texas universities We checked some of the report’s accounts, starting with the two Texas universities included in the review. Rice University, the report says, previously required history majors to take a U.S. history course, "but their new set of requirements makes it merely optional." On a web page, Rice says that each history major matriculating after fall 2014 must take 10 history courses including one each in four of five fields: Premodern; Europe; U.S.; Asia, Latin America, Africa; and transnational history--perhaps an indication there’s a good chance a Rice history major takes American history. But it’s not required. Also, according to the report, the University of Texas requires history majors to take two U.S. history courses though, the study says, a class on Jews in American entertainment can count. To our inquiry, a UT spokesman, J.B. Bird, noted by email that by state law, every degree-seeking student at public colleges and universities--regardless of major--must take a couple American history courses. We confirmed that: The relevant state law, tracing to 1955, states that "a college or university receiving state support or state aid from public funds may not grant a baccalaureate degree or a lesser degree or academic certificate to any person unless the person has credit for six semester hours or its equivalent in American History." Bird also guided us to Jacqueline Jones, who chairs the university’s history department. By email, Jones said most UT undergraduates take the department’s survey courses, one covering American history before 1865, the other picking up from there. Jones also said it would be highly unlikely for a student to take an upper-level history course, including the one on Jews in American entertainment, toward complying with the state mandate. Jones further offered that she takes issue with "the premise that if a college student does not take history-department courses, s/he has learned no American history. My colleagues in the American Studies department teach many different history courses. Faculty in the Government department who teach U.S. politics and political institutions also teach American history. I could go on and list other relevant departments here—Mexican-American and Latino/Latina Studies and African and African Diaspora Studies, for example." Checking universities outside Texas We went on to check the requirements placed upon history majors at very-high-ranked Yale University, which the report singles out for creating a "specialist track" history degree, starting with the class of 2017, enabling students to "forgo a requirement in U.S. history whereas previous students were required to take at least two courses in the history of the United States or Canada." That’s correct, we confirmed on a Yale web page stating that students with the specialist track major may take up to eight courses within a chosen world region plus two courses from outside that region--with one of the possible five regions being the U.S. "Their overall coursework must include courses from at least 3 geographic regions," the university says. Then again, Yalies may alternatively seek a history degree on the "global track," which requires each major to take at least one U.S. history course. Harvard University, similarly listed in the report as not requiring history majors to take U.S. history, says on a web page that it requires students concentrating in history to take 10 history "half-courses," which we take to mean one-semester courses. According to the web page, Harvard’s requirements of history majors include a half-course in U.S. or European History (western). In spring 2017, about when Willett spoke, we noticed more than 25 course options in this category including nine courses centered on American history such as one on the American Revolution; another introducing American history with an emphasis on democratic political institutions; a course on the New Deal; and a course on U.S. legal history from 1776 to 1865. The University of Michigan, the highest-ranked public university identified in the report as not requiring history majors to take American history, says on a web page that each major must take 10 history courses--including one each from four of seven regions/categories including U.S./Canada. At the University of North Carolina, also listed in the report as not requiring history majors to take an American history course, history majors also must take 10 history courses, according to a university web page. Up to six of the courses can be in the student’s chosen "concentration," the page says; the university’s eight history concentrations include one in U.S. history. National expert We asked UT’s Jones to suggest a national expert who might speak to what universities require of history majors. Jones pointed us to Jim Grossman of the Washington-based American Historical Association, which describes itself as the nation’s largest professional organization serving historians in all fields and professions. Grossman, who said in a May 2016 commentary that the percentage of students earning history degrees has lately declined, noted by email that the council study didn’t give a lot of credit to colleges that require all undergraduates to take U.S history nor did it sort out the history courses that students actually take. "I wish I had such data," Grossman wrote. Grossman also told us that most institutions don't have a major in American history. "A student majors in history," Grossman wrote, "and in the best programs that major includes a wide variety of courses, enabling a student to develop the skills and habits of thought that a history major provides, but from a wide variety of angles." When we circled back to Poliakoff, he said the only recent research on what students actually take suggests that less than half of respondents in 1992, more than 20 years ago, took a U.S. history course. Poliakoff noted too that another council study, titled "What Will They Learn?," found 18 percent of American universities requiring all students to take U.S. government or history. The September 2016 version of that report states the council reached its conclusions about curricular requirements based on reviewing course catalogs and other publicly available materials for more than 1,100 colleges and universities. Our ruling Willett said the "overwhelming majority of America’s elite universities" don’t require history majors to take a course in American history. In 2016, some 70 percent of the country’s 76 colleges and universities most highly-ranked by U.S. News & World Report did not require history majors to take American history, a study shows, though clarifications are missing. There's evidently no current research on what students actually take while in places including Texas, every degree-seeking undergraduate at a public college must take American history. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 10:23 a.m., Jan. 30, 2017: After this fact check posted, we added Professor Jones' additional comment that it'd be unlikely for a UT student to fulfill state requirements by taking an upper-level course such as the class on Jews in American entertainment. This addition did not affect our rating of the claim. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cfbf3dff-2209-4f26-8b0a-b4a600e5f182	None	Don Willett	None	None	None	2017-01-30T17:56:41	2017-01-12	['United_States']
pomt-13767	Says Hillary Clinton "wants sanctuary cities."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-rnc-hillary-clinton-says-hillary/	Donald Trump said at the Republican convention that nothing affected him more deeply than spending time with parents who have lost their children to violence "spilling across our border." He said that Hillary Clinton favors shielding undocumented immigrants from federal laws. "My opponent wants sanctuary cities," Trump said to boos. Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that have laws or practices that limit their assistance to federal immigration officials, for a variety of reasons that we’ll explain. Trump proposes eliminating federal grants to sanctuary cities. Clinton expressed support for the sanctuary city policies during her first presidential race in 2008. During her current race, she criticized decisions by a particular city in the spotlight for sanctuary policy; however, she did reiterate her support for sanctuary cities. We did not get a reply from the Trump campaign for this fact-check. Clinton’s comments on sanctuary cities in 2016 race There is no blanket legal definition of sanctuary cities, but it generally refers to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. Supporters of such policies, often in liberal jurisdictions or places with large Hispanic populations, say it’s not the job of local officials to help deport residents accused of low-level crimes. Supporters also say they don’t want undocumented immigrants to fear the police and avoid reporting crimes to them. Opponents say that sanctuary cities harm the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws and give some undocumented immigrants a pass. Attacking opponents for supporting sanctuary cities became a nationwide political talking point after the July 2015 shooting death of Kate Steinle of San Francisco. The alleged shooter, who was from Mexico and had been deported several times in the past, had been released from San Francisco’s jail facing drug charges, despite a federal request to keep him in custody so he could face deportation. The case sparked a debate over rules like San Francisco’s quarter-century-old law declaring it a "city and county of refuge." The law banned public employees from assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement with investigations or arrests unless required by a law or a warrant or for people convicted of felonies. Steinle’s death prompted the city to revisit the law. About a week later, Clinton was asked about her position on sanctuary cities on CNN. Brianna Keilar: "When you last ran for president you supported sanctuary cities. In light of this terrible incident, does that change anything about your view on this?" Clinton: "Well, what should be done is any city should listen to the Department of Homeland Security, which as I understand it, urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time. Here's a case where we've deported, we've deported, we've deported. He ends back up in our country, and I think the city made a mistake. The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported. "So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on. "However, there are -- like if it were a first-time traffic citation, if it were something minor, a misdemeanor, that's entirely different. This man had already been deported five times. And he should have been deported at the request of the federal government." Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin sent PolitiFact a statement the campaign issued a couple days after the CNN interview to clarify her position: "Hillary Clinton believes that sanctuary cities can help further public safety, and she has defended those policies going back years." Clinton’s comments on sanctuary cities in 2008 race Clinton appeared more favorable toward sanctuary cities during her first presidential campaign During an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly in 2008, Clinton defended sanctuary cities. O’Reilly: "Are you going to crack down on the sanctuary cities?" Clinton: "No, I’m not. And I’ll tell you why. … I’m not because the reason why a lot of those folks do it — in New York, why do police officers turn a blind eye? O’Reilly: "Because they want them to report crimes." Clinton: "They want them to report crimes. Because… sometimes you have two competing values. You want to report crime, you want to protect people and the violence spills way beyond whatever community." Our ruling Trump said that Clinton "wants sanctuary cities." During her first race for president, Clinton expressed support for sanctuary cities and said she wouldn’t crack down on them. She argued that without such policies, people will hide from police and not report crimes. In 2015, Clinton criticized the city of San Francisco for releasing a man from jail who later was charged with murdering a woman and had previously been deported many times. However, her campaign reiterated Clinton’s view that she believes sanctuary cities can help further public safety.

pomt-02874	"In July 2010 the government said small businesses -- 60 percent -- will lose their health care, 45 percent of big business and a large percentage of individual health."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/13/sean-hannity/hannity-says-government-predicted-massive-loss-hea/	There is a once-obscure government report that Obamacare’s critics don’t seem to be able to resist misquoting. Sean Hannity made this mistake on his Fox News show Monday. "In July 2010 the government said small businesses -- 60 percent -- will lose their health care, 45 percent of big business and a large percentage of individual health," Hannity said. "That's not 5 percent. That’s half of America. That's 128 million Americans, by their math, not mine." Fox News told us that Hannity drew upon an article in Forbes that projected about 93 million people would not be able to keep their current plans under Affordable Care Act regulations. That article, plus a report from NBC, relied upon a government analysis from June 2010. It drew very little attention when it was published in the Federal Register. That has since changed. In this fact-check, we’re going to walk you through the report -- and why it doesn’t say what Hannity says it does. The 2010 federal report As part of the health care law, the federal government said people could keep the health insurance they had so long as the plan was in place before the health care law was passed in 2010. That’s the so-called "grandfather" provision. But if the plan changed -- sometimes even in ways people might consider minor -- people would have to purchase health insurance that meets new minimum standards. For some people, that could mean purchasing additional coverages for maternity and mental health care, which in turn could mean higher premiums. Back in 2010, three federal departments (Labor, Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service) tried to determine how many plans would change to the point that they would need to meet the new minimum standards. They looked at the historical patterns of insurance plans pre-Obamacare and tried to project what would happen in an Obamacare world. What they found is that many plans indeed would make the changes to trigger the new minimum standards. How many people would be affected? By the end of 2013, government analysts said half of all group or employer-based plans would change to the point that they would need to meet the new standards -- which is about what Hannity said. When combined with the number of people in the individual insurance market facing the same fate, government officials concluded that the health care plans of about 93 million to 99 million Americans would need to now meet the minimum standards created by the health care law. (Hannity said 128 million, which we’ll address shortly.) So why is Hannity wrong? The problem for Hannity is that the government analysts did not try to determine how many of those millions of Americans are in health insurance plans that already meet the minimum standards. That’s an important distinction because if plans already meet the minimum standards, the health care law has a modest impact. Robert Kaestner, a professor at the Institute for Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, told us that most large employers already do what the law demands. "The requirements are not that binding because many of these plans adhere to the requirements already," Kaestner said. A 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans backs up Kaestner’s point. It found that about three-quarters of the employer-sponsored health plans it contacted already meet the criteria of the health care law. The survey included both large and small employers and was based on 966 responses from human resource officers and benefits consultants. While we don’t know exactly how many plans already meet the new minimum standards and how many don’t, there’s nothing in the government report to suggest that the reality is close to the 128 million that Hannity claimed. The difference between a changed plan and no plan at all Hannity said a total of 128 million Americans will lose health care. This is quite similar to a mistake Glenn Beck made, and we repeat this key point: A change in a plan is not the same as losing health coverage. One of the highest estimates of how many people will see their plans change comes from Christopher Conover, a researcher at Duke University and an adjunct scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. (The American Enterprise Institute and its scholars have generally been critical of the health care law.) Fox News noted that Hannity had interviewed Conover and relied on his work. But even Conover doesn’t back up Hannity’s claim. Conover estimated that as many 135 million people would see their plans affected, although his mid-range figure was 129 million. But Conover draws a line between seeing your plan change and losing your health care. "Let me clear that I am not predicting that 135.8 million Americans have or will have their policies canceled due to Obamacare," Conover wrote. Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, was equally emphatic. "Losing grandfathered status does not mean that you lose your health insurance," Harrington said. Our ruling Citing a government report, Hannity said "small businesses -- 60 percent -- will lose their health care, 45 percent of big business and a large percentage of individual health." The government report did not say that. The report attempted to quantify the number of insurance plans that -- through the normal ebbs and flows of the market -- would change to the point that they would trigger new minimum standards. Put another way, government analysts tried to quantify how many plans would lose their grandfathered status. But they didn’t look at the coverage those plans offered. In those terms, many of the plans that will lose their grandfathered status already met the new minimum standards. We rate Hannity’s claim False.

pomt-02995	"Unemployment in the city of St. Petersburg is below the state average."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/oct/17/bill-foster/bill-foster-says-st-petersburgs-unemployment-rate-/	Candidates for St. Petersburg mayor painted two very different portraits of the city’s economy during the recent Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 mayoral debate. Mayor Bill Foster touted the city’s unemployment rate. "We've added 5,000 new residents to the city of St. Petersburg," Foster said. "Unemployment in the city of St. Petersburg is below the state average." Challenger Rick Kriseman’s response included claims about how there are fewer small businesses and fewer overall workers than before Foster took office in 2010. We decided to put each candidate’s economic talk on the Truth-O-Meter. (We checked Kriseman's statements here and here.) In this fact-check, we’re looking at Foster’s claim about the unemployment rate. Comparing the city’s unemployment rate with the state average is tricky. The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts out monthly reports with unemployment data for the country, state and metro areas. Using this data to compare cities with their home states is a little bit like analyzing apples and oranges. Why? The national and state data is adjusted for the season, but the metro data is not. The distinction between adjusted data and unadjusted data is important in Florida, where the economy is hugely susceptible to seasonal swings, economists told us. Think of the snowbirds who come to our state during the cooler months each year. They seek out services, pack restaurants, buy goods and visit the beach -- an annual economic stimulus. "That doesn’t just affect tourism jobs," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. "That affects everything." That factor and others, such as teachers taking off for the summer, contribute to the state’s unadjusted employment rate typically ticking up in the summer months. When seasonal forces are factored in, the unemployment rate is smoothed out. Cities do not get the same treatment, left only with the less precise, unadjusted figure. With that disclaimer, we’ll move ahead with the check using labor data mostly from BLS. 2013 unemployment rate Month St. Pete (NSA) FL (NSA) FL (SA) Jan. 7.7 8 7.9 Feb. 7.1 7.6 7.8 March 6.6 7 7.5 April 6.8 6.8 7.2 May 6.9 7 7.1 June 7.4 7.4 7.1 July 7.4 7.4 7.1 Aug. 6.9* 7.1 7 * From state Department of Economic Opportunity. NSA = Not seasonally adjusted, SA = Seasonally adjusted So the state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for August, the most recent month available, was 7 percent and the unadjusted rate is 7.1 percent. The BLS did not release unemployment data for metro areas and cities as scheduled on Oct. 2 due to the government shutdown. The bureau’s most recent, public estimate for St. Petersburg’s unemployment rate is for July 2013, when the (unadjusted) rate was 7.4 percent. That’s even with Florida’s unadjusted rate for July and larger than its adjusted rate. We checked in with the state’s Department of Economic Opportunity, which feeds some economic data to the BLS, before calling Foster’s claim inaccurate. According to DEO, the city’s unemployment rate for August was 6.9 percent -- a smidgen lower than the state’s unadjusted and adjusted rates for that month. The city’s unemployment rate was actually lower than the state’s, by either measure, for most of 2013. We asked our experts to point to better data, but they said this home survey-based data is the best we have. Residents are asked if they are working and, if not, whether they are looking for work. The government uses the data to crank out assessments for the national, state and local levels. "At the state level, they’re estimates," said Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist. "So when you get down to the smaller and smaller geographies, the availability and timeliness of data both begin to wane." A declining unemployment rate is not necessarily a completely positive measure of the economy, PolitiFact Florida has found. Florida has a problem with discouraged workers being out of the workforce for a long time and eventually dropping out of the labor force. These workers are no longer reflected in the unemployment rate, which is a ratio of the number of workers versus the number of available workers. For example, Florida’s unemployment rate fell steeply from December 2011 to July 2013, from 9.4 percent to 7.1 percent. If the labor force had remained the same in July as it was a year and a half earlier, the real unemployment rate would have been 8.2 percent, according to an August 2013 report by the Legislature’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research. The report found that about half of the reason for the drop is due to people leaving the labor force or putting off joining it. A similar analysis has not been completed at the city level. Foster did not return our call seeking comment. Our ruling St. Petersburg’s unemployment rate is a little bit better than the state average, according to the most recent data we have from the state and federal government. It’s been the case for most of the year. Is it substantially better? No. And experts cautioned that the numbers we have are not the best. Still, they’re the best we have. We rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Bill Foster	None	None	None	2013-10-17T17:00:07	2013-10-15	['Saint_Petersburg']

pomt-09544	"Our (Texas) graduation rate ranks 43rd out of 50 states."	true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/05/bill-white/texas-has-43rd-best-graduation-rate-united-states/	Democrat Bill White, the former Houston mayor running for governor, has said if elected, he'll "move Texas forward" — a vow he's said will include revamping education. "Texas should be America's great state of opportunity," White says in his first TV ad, which started airing Feb. 1. "But how can we move forward when our graduation rate ranks 43rd out of 50 states, and we're lagging behind in test scores?" Almost the bottom of the barrel? We decided to check. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon pointed us to the the Legislative Budget Board's 2010 Texas Fact Book, which lists everything from elected officials' phone numbers to — we're not kidding — our state snack and tie (tortilla chips and salsa, and the bolo, by the way). The fact book also ranks Texas' estimated public high school graduation rate for 2009 — 43rd, with 61.3 percent of students who were enrolled in ninth grade graduating. John Barton, the board's public information and report production manager, said the agency pulled the statistic from State Rankings 2009, a comprehensive publication issued by CQ Press, a widely-regarded nonpartisan publisher of infomation related to American politics and policy. The budget board's depressing ranking indeed matched CQ's, which used data from the National Education Association in Washington and the National Center for Education Statistics to compare the estimated number of public high school graduates in 2009 with the number who were enrolled in 9th grade in fall 2005. Vermont ranked first, with 96.6 percent graduating. South Carolina ranked last with 55.2 percent; Washington, D.C., isn't included. The national rate of graduating students in 2009 was 69.3 percent. Texas' graduation rate has been sliding. In 2001 the state ranked 35th, with 65 percent of students graduating from high school. In 2008, Texas ranked 42nd with 62.6 percent of students graduating.

pomt-08297	Says he has a track record of not raising taxes.	false	/texas/statements/2010/nov/01/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-he-has-track-record-not-raisin/	Gov. Rick Perry says he's not overlooking any means of closing the state's widely expected revenue shortfall — except higher taxes, according to an Oct. 15 interview with the Texas Tribune. "I think for anybody to stand up here and say categorically there's not going to be this or there's not going to be that —" Perry started, before Evan Smith of the Tribune edged in: "Well, you said it with taxes." Perry's response: "Well, but I've got a track record of that too. We don't raise taxes." Later, Smith asked: "So you don't believe that at any time that anybody reasonably could look over the last 10 years and identify anything where a tax went up?" Perry agreed. We wondered whether Perry had accurately recited his track record as governor. After asking his campaign to elaborate, we took up a basic question: Has Perry signed tax hikes into law? Boy howdy, yes. Since becoming governor in late 2000, Perry has signed into law higher taxes on fireworks and cigarettes while also ushering into place a change in business taxation, according to the state comptroller's office. To get a handle on tax changes made early in Perry's governorship, we consulted a 2004 report from the comptroller's office that details the history of revenue-related bills that have become law from 1972 through 2003. Some notables from 2001, Perry's first legislative session as governor, and 2003: * House Bill 3667, which Perry signed into law on June 16, 2001, enacting a 2 percent tax on the retail sale of fireworks to help fund a rural volunteer fire department insurance fund. The new levy was projected to generate $848,000 over the next two years; it ended up raising about $1.4 million in that period. * Senate Bill 5, which Perry signed into law June 15, 2001, creating the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan Fund as part of an effort to help reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, which are air pollutants. Revenue for the fund was generated through "several new charges," including a tax of 1 percent on the purchase or rental of diesel equipment. * House Bill 1365, signed by the governor on June 22, 2003, made tweaks in the emissions reduction fund to bring in more money. With the changes, the report says, the impact to the fund was projected to be $234.9 million in 2004-05. Austin consultant Billy Hamilton, who served as deputy comptroller under state Comptrollers John Sharp and Carole Keeton Strayhorn, told us that he doesn't think there was a tax increase per se in 2003. "There were, however, several fee increases, and one school of thought is that fee is another word for tax," he said. We gauged Perry's tax record from 2004 to the present from other sources, including news articles and agency communications. In 2004, before a special legislative session, Perry laid out a plan to cut local school property taxes while generating new revenue in several ways, including through a $1-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes, a fee on admissions to topless bars, a statewide business property tax, and the closure of loopholes enabling some taxpayers to avoid the state's franchise and motor vehicle taxes, according to an April 2004 press release from his office. The plan went nowhere. Lawmakers returned to the school finance topic in a 2006 special session, engineering a tax overhaul that reduced local school property taxes. To help districts offset the loss of revenue, the Legislature revamped the franchise tax, increased the cigarette tax and modified how the state taxes used-car purchases. Perry signed the overhaul legislation into law in May 2006. A key goal of the new franchise tax, often called the margins tax, was to apply it to companies that had largely avoided the old corporate franchise tax. As expected at the time, businesses paid more in total after the overhaul of the franchise tax than before, although less than was forecast. Franchise tax revenue had totaled $5.8 billion in 2006 and 2007. In 2008 and 2009, the first two years of the revised tax, total revenue was $8.7 billion. However, the 2006 changes didn't affect all businesses the same way, said Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, which represents several hundred largely Texas-based businesses and legal and accounting firms. Because of the property tax reductions, some saw their taxes drop. Others had increases, he said. The $1-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes proposed by Perry in 2004 also was part of the 2006 tax changes; the $1.41-a-pack tax took effect in 2007. These increases alone generated $707 million in fiscal 2007 and $908 million in fiscal 2008. Lastly, the package required that the sale of used cars be taxed on a standard value "rather than trusting sellers to report the true sales price," according to a May 15, 2006 news article from The Associated Press. The additional revenue from that change was $20.8 million for 2007 and 2008. Three tax increases? Sure. However, Perry has stressed that the 2006 increases shouldn't be counted against him because the cuts in local property taxes set in motion by lawmakers were bigger. Told by Smith on Oct. 15 that some people consider the franchise tax change to be an increase, Perry replied: "That was a net tax decrease." Craymer has a similar view. In an e-mail, he told us that the franchise tax change was a part of a package of bills "that raised some taxes (franchise, cigarette, motor vehicle sales taxes) and lowered others (property tax) by much more." Craymer shared a document with us based on the 2006 estimates of the impact of the tax changes; for each year from 2007 to 2011, it shows the property tax reductions as greater than the revenue generated by the other taxes. "The new (franchise) tax never would have passed without the property tax cuts, so I don’t think it’s correct to try to look at it independently of the property tax cut," he said. Like Craymer, Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington-based group that collects pledges by officeholders and seekers not to raise taxes, says it doesn't consider tax swaps to violate the pledge. Spokesman Patrick Gleason told us the group's definition of a tax increase depends on the impact of a law. "If it's revenue neutral or a net cut, that doesn't violate the pledge," he said. On Oct. 1, 2009, Perry signed the group's pledge for governors, which says that signatories will "oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." Gleason said Perry hadn't previously signed the pledge. Tobacco users were hit again in 2009, when the Legislature decided to tax smokeless tobacco on weight rather than price, "generating additional revenue of $105 million over two years," according to a May 28, 2009 Dallas Morning News news article. According to a December 2009 report from the Legislative Budget Board, some of the new revenue helps repay medical-school loans for doctors who agree to practice in underserved areas of the state. The rest was to be used to help offset franchise tax revenue that was lost when the Legislature temporarily exempted 40,000 businesses. Another tax that has jumped recently is the unemployment tax, which businesses pay quarterly to the Texas Workforce Commission to replenish the trust fund that "provides unemployment insurance for Texas workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own," according to a Dec. 8, 2009 news release from the commission. Each year, the commission, whose members are appointed by Perry, sets a rate; it goes up if the balance in the trust fund is below a statutory level as of Oct. 1. According to a July 2009 news article in the Austin American-Statesman, "unemployment taxes rise and fall with the economy, and, in fact, the tax rate fell steadily in Texas between 2004 and 2008." However, the rate rose in 2009 and 2010, largely because of the impact of the economic downturn. In 2010, the increase in the minimum tax rate meant that most Texas employers would pay $64.80 per employee, compared with $23.40 the previous year. Craymer told us that the unemployment tax rate "is set automatically based on the balance in the fund and is independent of any gubernatorial action." We asked Hamilton about the big picture: Does he see tax increases during Perry's tenure? He said that depends on a person's perspective. "There were significant tax increases for some taxpayers in 2006 with the cigarette tax and margin tax changes," he said. "However, these are said to have been offset by reductions in school property taxes. In aggregate, that's true, but revenue neutrality is in the eye of the beholder. Some people wound up paying less, but some are paying more." We never heard back from Perry on his tax track record. Upshot: Legislation, reports, news articles and expert analysis show that Perry has signed about half a dozen tax increases into law, including the three 2006 changes intended to help cover cuts in school property taxes. Texans paying more thanks to Perry's signature on tax-increase measures include companies with higher business taxes, plus cigarette smokers and purchasers of smokeless tobacco, fireworks and diesel equipment.

pomt-14816	Says President Barack Obama did not invite a Republican senator to dine at the White House until his fifth year in office.	false	/iowa/statements/2015/nov/23/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-claims-obama-didnt-host-republican-senato/	During a campaign stop in Atlantic, Iowa, on Nov. 11, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush told a very detailed and specific story to underscore Democratic President Barack Obama’s alleged unwillingness to work with Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Here's what he said: "The story I tell all the time is about a Republican senator that was invited by the White House to have dinner with the president. And so he’s going up the rickety elevator to go up to the residence, the second floor, and the eager aide to President Obama says with great excitement, ‘Senator, you’re the first Republican he’s had dinner with in the residence since he’s been president.’ And that’s the fifth year." Obama is so unwilling to work with Senate Republicans, Bush alleges, that he didn't even invite one to dine at the White House until his fifth year in office. But is it true? Did Obama really wait until 2013 to host a Republican for dinner at the White House? Bush’s campaign declined to provide more information or sources for the anecdote. (Instead, a spokeswoman issued a statement saying the president has pursued "a policy of divide and conquer" and refused to work with Republicans.) The White House, meanwhile, referred us to the official White House Visitor Access Records, which are posted online in a series of spreadsheets. The Visitor Access Records contain extremely detailed – albeit inconsistently organized – entries for hundreds of thousands of White House visits. The 2012 database, for example, included more than 930,000 separate records. To vet Bush’s statement, we filtered these voluminous results first to show only visits in which "POTUS" – that is, the president of the United States – was listed as the "visitee." Then we filtered them further to capture visits to the "Residence" and other White House rooms in which it’s conceivable that a private dinner could occur. Among that filtered database, we searched for Democratic and Republican U.S. senators. Here’s what we found. When possible, we paired the results found in the database with news reports or White House statements concerning the meeting or a concurrent event. 2009 U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar. R-Ind., visited the residence area of the White House on Sept. 1, 2009, for an evening event. The day and time corresponds to a dinner celebrating Ramadan that included numerous guests. 2010 There appear to be no dinners or other events involving the president and members of the Senate in 2010. It should be noted, though, that Obama did invite Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Jon Kyl of Arizona, along with top Republicans from the House and Democratic leaders from both chambers, to a dinner following the midterm elections that November. That meal-time meeting was dubbed the "Slurpee Summit" after Obama promised to serve the drinks for dessert, but Republicans declined to attend, and the dinner was canceled. 2011 Obama hosted a dinner in the East Room of the White House (which is on the State Floor in the residence) attended by both Democrats and Republicans on May 2, 2011. McConnell was among those present. U.S. Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Mark Udall, D-Colo., visited the White House residence with a larger group during a state dinner for German Chancellor Angela Merkel on June 7, 2011. U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, visited the White House residence on Nov. 11, 2011, with a larger group. That same day, Obama called Murray to discuss budget and deficit reduction negotiations that were occurring at that time. 2012 McConnell attended a lunch with the president on Feb. 29, 2012, in a room labeled "POTUS dini" in the White House logs. Also at the table were House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Lugar visited the White House residence during a state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron on March 14, 2012. Democratic Sens. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, John Kerry of Massachusetts, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Charles Schumer of New York also visited the residence at that time. Democratic Sens. Kerry, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ben Cardin of Maryland, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Richard Durbin of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Jon Tester of Montana visited the White House residence during a St. Patrick’s Day reception on March 20, 2012. Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina was among 706 guests to visit the White House Residence on Dec. 12, 2012, during what appears to be a White House Christmas party. 2013 Democratic Sens. Casey, Durbin, Kerry, McCaskill, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia, visited the White House residence on Inauguration Day in 2013. Obama hosted a bipartisan dinner for women senators on April 23, 2013. U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., visited the White House residence during a ceremony honoring Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients on Nov. 20, 2013. Democratic Sens. Durbin, Leahy, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Brian Schatz of Hawaii also attended. U.S. Reps. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., and Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, attended a lunch with the president in a room labeled "Private Di" in the White House logs on March 7, 2013. Obama dined with two large groups of Republican senators on March 6, 2013, and again on April 10. The first dinner took place at the Jefferson Hotel, while the second was held in the Old Family Dining Room on the State Floor of the White House. Ten Republican and 21 Democratic senators were among 878 guests to the White House residence on Dec. 12, 2013, during what appears to be a White House Christmas party. Our ruling Based on our review of visitor logs, there are a handful of instances in which Republican U.S. senators visited the White House residence between 2009 and 2012, including a 2011 dinner attended by Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell. There’s also that high-profile 2010 case in which Obama invited two Republican senators to dinner – the famous Slurpee Summit – only to be publicly snubbed. And it’s worth noting, too, that the records indicate that Obama hasn’t dined privately with Democratic senators all that often either – suggesting that private evening meals just aren’t part of Obama’s congressional relations strategy. We rate this claim False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-11-23T17:05:00	2015-11-11	['White_House', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-13630	"Bruce Rauner is of record that he will fully support the Trump candidacy. It's documented. It’s available."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2016/aug/10/michael-madigan/Madigan-highlights-Rauners-support-Trump-camp/	Governor Bruce Rauner has stayed decidedly quiet about the 2016 presidential campaign. Despite Rauner’s reluctance to comment, Democrats are pouncing on the opportunity to try to link the first-term governor to the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Illinois House Speaker and Democratic Party Chairman Michael Madigan is one of those Democrats. Madigan has compared Rauner to Trump several times and said he feels fully justified grouping the two together. In an interview with WSIU and WBBM radio stations published Aug. 1, Madigan said: "Bruce Rauner is of record that he will fully support the Trump candidacy. It's documented. It’s available." We wondered if Madigan was right. Does Rauner fully support Trump? What’s Rauner’s take on the Republican presidential nominee? We looked into Madigan’s claim to find out. Supporting the presidential nominee When we asked where Madigan found the information backing his claim, Madigan spokesman Steve Brown simply said, "It’s everywhere online. Google it, and it will come up in 9 seconds." Brown didn’t point to any specific articles, so we took his recommendation and Googled our question. For the record, it only took Google .45 seconds to find articles relating to Rauner and Trump. In March, Rauner told reporters he would support the Republican presidential nominee, even if it turned out to be Trump. When asked why, Rauner explained, "I’m the leader of the Republican party in Illinois." He added, "I will do everything I can to support that nominee." That same month, he told students in Wilmette he was "horrified" by the presidential campaign rhetoric. "Democracy is hard, you know, and this presidential election, oh my goodness, I'm appalled by the rhetoric, it's appalling," Rauner said. "And it's ugly and it's nasty and it's weird, and just some of the statements that get made, I'm just, I'm horrified." Since those public comments, Rauner’s been asked repeatedly about his actions related to the presidential election. Rauner hasn’t said much and doesn’t answer questions about Trump. On July 12, Rauner did not join Trump during a campaign fundraiser even though the two were both in Chicago that day. A week later, Rauner skipped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland when Trump formally became the party’s presidential nominee. Rauner’s aides told the Chicago Tribune the governor wouldn’t formally endorse Trump, and did not explain why not. The Tribune reported, "Rauner repeatedly had sought to stay out of the presidential race, though he did say that as leader of the GOP in Illinois, he would back the eventual nominee. But Rauner aides stressed there are various levels of "support," and that the governor would not be giving Trump a formal endorsement." Brian Gaines, a political science professor at the University of Illinois, said because Rauner isn’t up for election this year, there’s really no reason for him make any more comments about his relationship with Trump. "There’s no law saying that a politician needs to endorse their party’s candidate," Gaines said. "(Sen.) Mark Kirk is the more interesting example. Since he would have more interaction with the president and he’s up for election, he really needs to comment. Rauner’s interaction is somewhat fabricated." In June, Kirk said publicly he would no longer support Trump. Gaines said Rauner’s language regarding Trump is much more nuanced and purposefully vague. "(Rauner) could say voting for Trump is a form of support and he wouldn’t have to say another word," Gaines explained. "And as the Trump campaign looks weaker and weaker, Rauner can point back and say ‘I never said I would endorse Trump.’" Rauner continues to refuse to answer questions from reporters about the presidential election, and his office did not return multiple requests for comment from PolitiFact Illinois for this story. Our ruling "Bruce Rauner is of record that he will fully support the Trump candidacy. It's documented. It’s available." Madigan is correct. In March, Rauner said he would fully support the Republican presidential nominee. When asked by a reporter if he would still support the nominee if it’s Trump, Rauner reiterated his earlier statement, saying: "I will support the Republican Party’s nominee." But Madigan does not reference any of Rauner’s subsequent comments, including Rauner’s refusal to formally endorse Trump.

pomt-01978	When Rick Scott "was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/17/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-took-5th-75-times-democratic-party-ad-s/	The Florida Democratic Party launched its first TV ad this year in the governor’s race and the subject is a familiar one: the investigation into Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s former health care company. "Maybe you’ve heard about what was the largest Medicare fraud in history, committed when Rick Scott was a CEO," the narrator says. "Or that Scott’s company paid record fraud fines of $1.7 billion dollars. And when Scott was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times. Meaning, 75 times, Scott refused to answer questions because – if he had – he might admit to committing a crime." The ad launched June 17, 2014, and is airing in West Palm Beach and Orlando, as well as Tampa Bay, which is home turf for Democratic front runner Charlie Crist. Earlier this year, we fact-checked a similar claim by the Democrats about the $1.7 billion fine, rating it Mostly True. Here we will fact-check whether Scott took the Fifth Amendment 75 times. It’s not a new topic, for Scott or for us. We fact-checked similar claims during Scott’s first race in 2010. Columbia/HCA Scott started Columbia in 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country’s largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals. In early 1997, federal agents revealed they were investigating the Columbia/HCA chain for, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Allegations included that Columbia/HCA billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and that the hospital chain would perform one type of medical test but bill the federal government for a more expensive test or procedure. Agents seized records from facilities across the country including in Florida. Scott resigned in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations, but the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion. Scott’s deposition Scott gave a deposition in 2000 in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 75 times. The amendment reads in part that no one "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." But that deposition was not part of the criminal fraud case being pursued by the federal government. In fact, Scott was never officially questioned during the federal criminal investigation. The deposition was part of a civil case in which Nevada Communications Corp. alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract. Scott gave the deposition at his offices in Stamford, Conn., on July 27, 2000, months before the settlement with the federal government. (The records of Scott’s deposition were distributed to reporters by Scott’s Republican primary opponent Bill McCollum in 2010.) The deposition shows that Scott repeatedly refused to answer questions. Scott's lawyer first interjected after an opposing lawyer began the deposition by asking simply if Scott was employed. "Under normal circumstances, Mr. Scott would be pleased to answer that question and other questions that you pose today," Scott's lawyer, Steven Steinbach, said. "Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself." Scott then went on to read the same answer, even when asked if Scott is a current or former employee of Columbia/HCA -- "Upon advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the questions by asserting my rights and privileges under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution." The Democrats’ ad doesn’t tell viewers that the deposition was part of a civil case unrelated to the federal government’s criminal fraud investigation. However, Scott’s reason for invoking the Fifth Amendment was as a result of the criminal investigations, his lawyer said. What about other depositions? The Democrats’ ad makes a reference to multiple lawsuits: "And when Scott was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times." "The Nevada Communications Corp. case is the only lawsuit where Scott took the Fifth 75 times," Florida Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp told PolitiFact Florida. (The ad includes video footage of Scott from a 1995 case -- not the 2000 case which is the focus of the ad.) Karp pointed to a 2010 Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times article which stated that Scott gave "murky testimony" in a series of depositions. An example: In a 1997 deposition when he was asked about an apparent agreement he made with a Texas doctor, Scott said: "I don't know what your definition or anybody's definition of an ‘agreement’ is, or an ‘offer’ is, or ‘promise’ is.'' What he ‘might’ admit to if he had testified The ad states that "Scott refused to answer questions because, if he had, he might admit to committing a crime." We can’t fact-check what Scott might or might not have admitted, but it’s worth noting a few things about the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment cannot be used in a criminal court to suggest guilt, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1956. In a civil case, things get a little murkier, and judges or juries can infer what they want from a person using the Fifth Amendment. "The bottom line is that in a civil case, the judge and jury are free to draw the inference that 'a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him,' " George R. Dekle, Sr., a professor of law at the University of Florida, told PolitiFact Florida in 2010. "However, there can be myriads of reasons other than guilt which prompt a person to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, and it might be just as reasonable to infer that the witness refused to answer for some other reason." Scott’s response During the Univision debate in October 2010, Scott was asked about the deposition: "With regard to that deposition, that was years after I left HCA. It was just, you know, all the same trial lawyers that are supporting my opponent, they were doing a fishing expedition, and they sat there, you know, it was a case I knew nothing about, I was not involved, I was not a defendant. So to stop the fishing expedition I just didn't do it." As for the case itself, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times in 2010, "There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader." Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party’s TV ad states that when Rick Scott "was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times." We have two quibbles with the ad: the Democrats don't specify that the deposition was from a civil business case -- not the federal government’s criminal fraud investigation into Columbia/HCA. However, Scott used the Fifth Amendment due to that federal investigation. Also, the ad refers to multiple lawsuits -- Scott was deposed in separate lawsuits, but he took the Fifth Amendment 75 times in only one of them. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14814	After the Texas cutoff of aid to women’s health care services including Planned Parenthood clinics, "over 150,000… women lost the only health care they had. Our Medicaid birth rate shot up. It cost taxpayers over $130 million in one year alone in extra Medicaid birth costs."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/24/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-lawmakers-cut-150000-women-/	Wendy Davis recalled recent Texas history while weighing in on the Republican push to defund Planned Parenthood. In a September 2015 interview on MSNBC’s "The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell," the former Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee and state senator responded to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida telling a Des Moines TV station he favors transferring all funding from Planned Parenthood to health centers that do not provide abortions. The funding shifts that Republicans seek nationally, Davis charged, will diminish women’s access to breast cancer screenings, contraceptive care and other health services. Looking back, Davis said that after Texas reduced funding for family planning care, "over 150,000 real women lost the only health care that they had. Our Medicaid birth rate shot up. It cost taxpayers over $130 million in one year alone in extra Medicaid birth costs. So, not only does it harm real women, it costs taxpayers more." Did she get that all those effects right? Legislative moves To recap, the 2011 Legislature drove down spending in a state family planning program by more than $70 million (from an existing two-year expenditure of $111 million) in 2012-13 and block family planning aid that flowed through a Medicaid-supported program from going to providers associated with abortions. Republican lawmakers also moved to remove Planned Parenthood from the state’s Women’s Healthcare Program, which provides low-income women access to family planning care. About two years later, legislators imposed stricter health and safety standards on clinics that perform abortions, a move expected to reduce the number of clinics from around 40 to 10; the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in November 2015 to review the law. Davis’ comments seemed curious in part because we found True in September 2015 a claim that Texas state government is "funding women’s health services at historically high levels." Most recently, the 2015 Legislature signed off on nearly $285 million in spending on several women’s health efforts, including $50 million for family planning services, in 2016-17. Per what Davis said, we looked into whether more than 150,000 women lost the only health care they had and whether the Texas actions drove up the number of births paid for through Medicaid. Davis offers backup Davis told us by phone her "over 150,000" figure came from a Texas Department of State Health Services report filed during a 2013 meeting of the State Health Services Council, which consists of nine members who gather feedback on the agency’s proposed rules and make recommendations to the agency and the overarching Health and Human Services Commission. Davis said: "The report in the hearing showed that in 2013, the amount of women served (by the DSHS Family Planning Program) was 47,322, which was a decrease from 202,968 clients served in 2011," indicating "a 77 percent decrease in the number of women served." That would be a decrease of 155,646 women served—more than 150,000. That program, the state says, helps clinics provide comprehensive low-cost family planning and reproductive health care services to women and men. According to the state, the services help individuals determine the number and spacing of their children, reduce unintended pregnancies, positively affect future pregnancy and birth outcomes, and improve general health. A 2013 report An online search landed the report Davis mentioned and her cited figures as part of the council’s Nov. 21, 2013, meeting agenda. Yet the report, "DSHS Family Planning Program Client Count and Average Cost Per Client, FY 2010-2013," didn’t specify women served; rather, it presented the "number of women and men" combined who received services from the DSHS Family Planning Program in the chosen years. So, how many women may have lost services? Additional inquiry led us to Enrique Marquez, a commission spokesman, who emailed us a chart indicating 181,460 women were served by the DSHS Family Planning Program in the state’s fiscal 2011, which ran through August 2012, while in fiscal 2013--after the actions by the 2011 Legislature--45,335 women were served. That’s a difference of 136,125--though that’s also without taking into account a decrease of 12,096 in women served by the state’s Women’s Health Program, which provides birth control, cancer screenings, annual exams and STD tests for low-income women. Women served by DSHS Family Planning Program and Women’s Health Program, FY 2011 - FY 2013 Program FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Difference (FY 2013 - FY 2011) DSHS Family Planning Program 181,460 76,898 45,335 136,125 decrease Women’s Health Program/Texas Women’s Health Program 127,536 126,473 115,440 12,096 decrease Total Decrease 148,221 Sources: Texas Department of State Health Services (numbers for DSHS Family Planning Program received by email from Enrique Marquez, Sept. 30, 2015; numbers for WHP/TWHP received by email from Bryan Black on Nov. 17, 2015) Add those up and you get 148,221, close to the 150,000 figure offered by Davis. Did women lose their only health care? Davis did not show nor could we determine the number of women who lost the only health care they had, as she put it. By email, HHSC spokesman Bryan Black said the agency has no way of estimating the number of women who were solely getting care through a state program. Separately, Sarah Wheat, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Texas, agreed with Davis that many women relied on its clinics for health care as did Janet Realini, who chairs the Texas Women’s Healthcare Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that says it’s dedicated to improving the health and well-being of women, babies and families by assuring access to preventive care for women. Researchers for the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, a project partnering with Ibis Reproductive Health, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, have been studying the effects of the changes legislated in 2011 and 2013. The researchers told us Davis was likely right about the women losing their only health care, but they also said there’s no way to pin that. Medicaid-funded births We previously found True a claim that more than half the state’s births are paid for by Medicaid. For this story, we looked into whether Davis was correct about Medicaid-funded birth costs increasing more than $130 million in a year. Davis told us she drew that figure from a January 2013 report, "Texas Women’s Healthcare in Crisis," by the coalition chaired by Realini. That report noted a state projection of 23,000 additional Medicaid births in 2014-15, according to HHSC’s request for legislative appropriations covering 2014-15. The report, drawing on the same state projection, went on: "Budget cuts to DSHS Family Planning program will increase Medicaid costs by at least $136 million by 2015." The HHSC’s appropriations request at the time said those costs were projected to total $33 million in the year through August 2013 and an additional $103 million in fiscal 2014-15. By phone, Davis conceded she was off by saying the $130 million would accrue in a year; it was over two years. Separately, Realini cautioned, when we asked, that the presented projections covered three years, not one. Also, she said, the coalition hadn’t done a follow-up report. Over seven weeks, we asked the commission how much Medicaid births have cost taxpayers for each of the past five years, but didn’t field a response to that. Separately, neither the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare in Washington, D.C., nor outside experts could immediately provide such detail. So, did the rate of Medicaid-funded births surge? We inquired into whether the projections played out. To our inquiry, Marquez emailed a chart stating that in 2011, the year the family planning cuts were approved, there were 215,114 Medicaid-funded births in Texas. The tally dropped to 204,322 the next year. Medicaid-funded births in Texas, FY 2011 - FY 2014 Year Medicaid-paid births 2011 215,114 2012 204,322 2013 207,058 2014 213,253 Source: Texas Department of State Health Services (chart received from Enrique Marquez, Sept. 29, 2015) In 2014, after the cuts had taken effect, there were fewer--not more--Medicaid-funded births than in 2011, though the count had escalated in both 2013 and 2014. Our ruling Davis said that after the Texas cutoff of aid to women’s health services including Planned Parenthood clinics, "over 150,000… women lost the only health care they had. Our Medicaid birth rate shot up. It cost taxpayers over $130 million in one year alone in extra Medicaid birth costs." There was about that much of a drop-off in women participating in state-backed family planning and cancer screening programs. But Davis didn’t provide nor did we find confirmation all the women lost the only care they had or that Medicaid-funded birth costs actually spiked by the predicted $130 million-plus. In fact, there were fewer Medicaid-covered Texas births in 2014 than in 2011. We rate this multi-part claim Mostly False.

CORRECTION, 4:44 p.m., Dec. 2, 2015: We revised this fact check to correct our initial version's description of actions taken by the Legislature in 2011 to reduce family-planning aid that went to clinics connected to providing abortions. As a reader nudged, that version incorrectly said an action took place in 2013 when the move occurred in 2011. That story also was imprecise about the dollar costs of the actions. These changes did not affect our rating of Davis' claim.	None	Wendy Davis	None	None	None	2015-11-24T10:00:00	2015-09-21	['Texas', 'Planned_Parenthood', 'Medicaid']
pomt-11152	"Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/29/scott-dawson/scott-dawson-alabama-governor-kay-ivey-lgbtq/	Scott Dawson, an evangelical minister running for governor in Alabama, accused the incumbent of funnelling taxpayer dollars to a controversial cause. "It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism," Dawson’s campaign wrote in a press release. The organization in question is Free2Be, a non-profit that provides counseling services to LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama. The nonprofit has been the subject of heavy scrutiny in Alabama, but for financial reasons, not political ones. After the group’s founder, James Robinson, left the group in January, the board of directors determined that Free2Be did not have the financial stability to continue. The group shuttered its doors after a state agency found they had failed to pay payroll taxes to the IRS. Dawson’s campaign pointed us to a 2012 YouTube video as evidence Free2be is a "liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism." The video didn’t suggest the organization aimed to change anyone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Neither do the group’s public statements. Instead, Robinson railed against messages of hate from teachers, parents and churches towards LGBTQ teens. Federal grants So what taxpayer funding did the group receive until they landed in hot water? Dawson’s campaign overshot the target by a few hundred thousand dollars with their $1 million figure. The campaign calculated that Free2Be received $762,042.37 in federal grants since Ivey assumed office in April 2017, using data from Alabama’s Finance Department. But the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, which reviews grant applications and presents funding recommendations to the governor’s office for approval, announces grants on an annual basis. Ivey’s administration was responsible for approving $800,000 in grants for fiscal year 2018, which began in October 2017. Of that total, $727,410 came from the Victims of Crime Act, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, and $49,915 from the federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act. The grants refunded expenses incurred by the organization. Those payments stopped in late March, when Free2Be shut down, and added up to $422,680.37. In fiscal year 2018, the state awarded $23.5 million in Victims of Crime Act grants to 79 nonprofit or governmental agencies across Alabama, said Department of Economic and Community Affairs spokesman Josh Carples. Free2Be was one of those recipients. The law requires that 10 percent of Victims of Crime Act grant funding go to underserved victims of violent crime each year. The agency started to look for LGBTQ grant recipients in 2013, after a program specialist noticed the agency was not funding any providers that serviced that community. Because it qualified as underserved, the specialist suggested the agency begin LGBTQ outreach. The following year, Free2Be was the only Victims of Crime Act applicant serving the LGBTQ population, and the agency approved their grant request. Taxpayer dollars Ivey’s campaign argued that the grants were not funded by taxpayer dollars, but by federal criminal fees. The Office for Victims of Crime’s website uses a similar distinction as Ivey in describing these grants: "The Fund is financed by fines and penalties paid by convicted federal offenders, not from tax dollars." But Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there is a distinction between tax dollars and taxpayer dollars. "User fees are, technically, not ‘tax dollars’ in that they are not the product of our tax system," Gardner said. "But the broader claim that these are not ‘taxpayer dollars’ doesn't seem right. When we pay the $20 entrance fee to visit a national park, we're not paying a tax. But most people would say that $20 is ‘taxpayer dollars’ in that the government collected it from people, and will spend it on some public services." Gardner likened a $20 park fee to the fines and penalties paid by federal offenders. Susan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, agreed. "Criminal fines and forfeitures are not typical taxes, but resemble typical taxes because they represent dollars collected involuntarily and are used for some public purpose," Hamill said. Our ruling Dawson said, "It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism." The organization in question is Free2Be, a victims resources nonprofit that serviced the LGBTQ community. Dawson distorted the organization’s purpose, which was to support LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama, not to change anyone’s gender identity or sexual orientation. The Ivey administration approved almost $800,000 in grants to Free2Be in order to meet a federal grant quota for underserved communities. But the group did not receive the full amount before it closed in March; it received a little more than half of that funding.

pomt-04022	"Eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson's disease or glaucoma. They have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/03/patrick-kennedy/former-us-rep-patrick-kennedy-says-80-percent-peop/	When former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-.R.I., launched a national group in January that opposes marijuana legalization, he also took issue with medical-marijuana laws that he says may have been well-intended but are misguided. And he questioned whether many of those who get permission to use marijuana for medical reasons are using it for legitimate reasons. "Eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson’s disease or glaucoma," Kennedy said in a Jan. 8 story in The Providence Journal. "They have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana." (Kennedy’s group, Project SAM, which stands for Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argues that medical marijuana should only be used in non-smoked forms. ) Nineteen states and the District of Columbia allow its medical use, although it is still illegal under federal law. In addition to cancer and glaucoma, among conditions approved for medical marijuana use are HIV/AIDS, severe or chronic pain, persistent nausea and multiple sclerosis. We decided to examine both parts of Kennedy’s statement, beginning with the specific ailments people cite when seeking permission to use medical marijuana. Kennedy’s group referred us to Kevin A. Sabet, a professor and drug policy institute director at the University of Florida, who is a former Obama administration adviser on drug policy and a co-founder of Project SAM. He guided us to statistical links on the Project SAM website and e-mailed some figures related to medical marijuana programs in Colorado. The most recent Colorado data, as of Nov. 30, 2012, showed 3 percent of that state’s roughly 107,000 medical-marijuana patients reported having cancer and 1 percent had glaucoma, while Parkinson’s was not listed as a specific reportable condition. Ninety-four percent reported severe pain as their condition or one of their conditions. We checked with other states and found similar figures. In most states, including Colorado, medical marijuana patients reported more than one condition. In Arizona, where medical marijuana became legal in 2010, just under 4 percent of its 33,600 medical marijuana cardholders reported having cancer while 1.5 percent reported glaucoma. By far the most reported condition as of Nov. 7, 2012, was chronic pain at 90 percent. Nevada, one of the earlier states to legalize marijuana for medical use, adopting it in 2001, showed cancer cases were about 3.6 percent of reported conditions -- and glaucoma just under 2 percent, as of Jan. 8, 2013. Severe pain was overwhelmingly the number-one condition, hovering at more than 3,200 patients monthly.The total number of patients with medical-marijuana cards in Nevada, fluctuates; as of Jan. 8, it was 3,580. In Rhode Island, where medical marijuana became legal in 2009, 5.9 percent percent of those who received approval in 2010 cited cancer or cancer treatment, according to the Department of Health. Four percent of those getting approval in 2012 reported cancer. Glaucoma accounted for about 1 percent in both years while Parkinson’s is not listed as a separate qualifying diagnosis. Rhode Island, which has 4,860 people approved to use medical marijuana in its program, lists a wider range of diagnoses than several states we examined. Forty-four percent of Rhode Island patients cited "severe debilitating chronic pain" in 2012; 17 percent reported muscle spasms and 11 percent reported severe nausea. So the first part of Kennedy’s statement is right: Only a very small percentage of medical marijuana users cited cancer or glaucoma as their reason for using the drug; states we checked do not specifically list Parkinson’s, indicating few cite that ailment. What about the second part of the statement, that 80 percent of the people using medical marijuana "have nothing you would associate" with it? Sabet, from Project SAM, said Kennedy didn’t mean that the 80 percent have no legitimate reason to use the drug. But we think that most readers would understand that statement to mean 80 percent didn’t have an ailment generally associated with medical marijuana use. The facts show otherwise. As our research found, chronic pain, severe pain or severe debilitating chronic pain -- the most common conditions medical marijuana users cite -- are among several conditions or diagnoses listed by states as qualifying reasons for using, contingent on whatever standard a state requires applicant and physician to meet. The states with medical-marijuana laws require some form of sign-off from a physician on an application. Dr. Syed Rizvi, a neurologist at Rhode Island Hospital and associate professor at Brown University, said the patients he has approved for medical marijuana have included those with multiple sclerosis, are extremely disabled, maybe in extreme pain, and may not have responded well to other medications. He said he limits it to patients he has seen for some time, even years. Dr. Josiah D. Rich, a professor of medicine and community health at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School, said in his experience and from what he knows of other physicians, there are other legitimate conditions than those Kennedy cited that are legal in states for medical marijuana. "Some of my patients who have AIDS … get very nauseous with the medicines they take," and therefore are approved to use medical marijuana, Dr. Rich said. Our ruling Former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy said that "eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson’s disease or glaucoma" and that "they have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana." Kennedy is right about the comparatively small percentage of medical-marijuana patients who use it for the conditions he named. But he is wrong that most of those using the drug do so for conditions not associated with it. In fact, states with medical marijuana laws allow use for chronic and severe pain -- the most common conditions cited by patients.

pomt-11513	"I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/20/donald-trump/has-donald-trump-been-much-tougher-russia-barack-o/	Amid swelling evidence of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, President Donald Trump pushed back against critics who say he's given the Kremlin a free pass. In one tweet on Feb. 20, Trump said, "I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet immediately drew guffaws among media commentators and on social media, who quickly plucked examples of Trump downplaying evidence of a far-reaching effort by Russia to meddle in the election. (Just a day earlier, we gave Trump a Pants on Fire for tweeting that he "never said Russia did not meddle in the election.") When we looked at the past decade of U.S.-Russia policy, however, we found a more nuanced picture. Tougher government policies implemented under President Barack Obama have largely continued under Trump, even though they were often overshadowed — and perhaps undercut — by Trump’s friendly remarks and tweets toward Russia and President Vladimir Putin. The election-meddling conflict The consensus among experts is that Obama was more forceful than Trump has been to date on countering election meddling. "The key difference from Obama was (Trump’s) unwillingness to take the meddling issue head on," said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. As we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, the Obama administration took actions before and after Election Day. Prior to the election, the Obama administration publicly named the Russian government as the culprit, confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin in person, and worked to secure U.S. election infrastructure — all while intelligence agencies investigated the issue. But the Obama administration’s most significant retaliatory measure against Russia came after Trump’s electoral win. On Dec. 29, 2016, Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected intelligence agents to leave the United States, and he also imposed narrow sanctions on some Russian individuals and organizations. Trump, on the other hand, has cast doubt on Russia’s election meddling and repeated Putin’s denials of his government’s involvement. "The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to undermine the credibility of the FBI and intelligence agencies in their investigation and assessment of the threat to the integrity of U.S. elections by Russian operatives," said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Herrera added that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether the Trump administration crossed the line into obstruction of justice by trying to impede the investigation of the Russian threat to the American electoral system. While some experts noted that Trump signed a law calling for new sanctions against Russia in response to its interference with the election, they added that the legislation was hardly the product of Trump’s hardline advocacy. Congress largely passed the bill — with veto-proof majorities — in response to Trump’s downplaying of the meddling question and his seeming interest in lifting sanctions against Russia, Sestanovich said. When it came time to sign the bill into law in August, Trump did so grudgingly. He expressed significant reservations, saying it was "seriously flawed" because it usurped the executive branch’s negotiating authority. Matthew Kroenig, an associate professor in the Department of Government and School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, said Trump had a point with his reservations about the legislative package, noting that the Obama administration made similar arguments that congressional sanctions against Iran infringed on the executive's authority to set foreign policy. Several experts said the White House has been hesitant to implement the sanctions. Sestanovich characterized its implementation as "slow and half-hearted." In late January, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers the administration would apply sanctions to a new list of Russian oligarchs and senior government officials. "The Trump administration didn’t provide the list of who they apply to until very late," Herrera said. "That’s a clear sign of foot-dragging by the White House." Susanne Wengle, a political science professor at the University of Notre Dame, agreed that Trump "has not been proactive or voiced strong opposition to Russian involvement in U.S. politics," while Obama did. However, she noted that the Trump administration has not gone so far as to reverse Obama-era laws and regulations, including the Magnitsky Act, which targeted high-ranking Russians with sanctions. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to President Barack Obama in Hangzhou, China on Sept. 5, 2016. (Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool via AP) Geopolitical relations The White House provided some examples of policies broader than the reaction to election meddling. Judging the tweet based on the administration's geopolitical policies makes the analysis a bit more complicated. There’s a crucial dividing line for U.S. policy toward Russia — early 2014, when Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Before that, the United States sought common ground with Russia. After that, Russia was seen in a more adversarial way. During the early years of Obama’s presidency, and especially during the Russian presidential interregnum of Dmitry Medvedev, the United States sought a "reset" with Russia and managed to hammer out several accomplishments, including a nuclear-arms deal. "Obama's first national security strategy only mentioned Russia as a potential partner, never as a possible threat," Kroenig said. "He promised in the famous ‘hot mic’ episode that he would have ‘flexibility’ to make concessions on missile defense after the (2012) election. He refused to intervene in Syria in part because his team feared direct conflict with Russia. He refused to provide lethal aid to Ukraine fearing escalation with Russia. And he did not develop a serious strategy to deter the threat of Russian nuclear ‘de-escalation’ strikes." However, an increase in conflict between the two countries, heightened by the return of Putin to the presidency in 2012, prompted skepticism about whether a genuine reset was feasible. Ultimately, the reset died out entirely after the Crimean annexation in 2014. In a very narrow sense, Trump has a case. "If you compare current 2018 U.S. policy to U.S. policy during Obama’s first term, then the U.S. is clearly ‘tougher’ on Russia now," said Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. After 2014, however, Obama’s Russia policy stiffened considerably. These included a rapid set of sanctions on people and enterprises in March 2014 following the Crimean annexation, and sector-based sanctions on Russia in July 2014 following continued Russian military activities in eastern Ukraine, said Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Later, Obama’s actions included the expulsion of Russian diplomats in December 2016, the closing of Russian compounds, and a variety of statements critical of Russia and Putin. Disentangling Trump’s comments from his administration’s policies Trump’s rhetoric has consistently indicated warmth and trust toward Russia and Putin, and Trump has also sent mixed signals about the U.S. commitment to NATO. On the other hand, post-2014 U.S. policy aimed at Russia has chugged forward in important ways since Trump became president — despite his rhetoric. "The rest of the executive branch and Congress have actually taken a few tough stands against Russia during the last year," said Susan H. Allen, director of the Center for Peacemaking Practice at George Mason University’s School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution. Among them, Kroening said, are a boost in funding for the European Reassurance Initiative, a security program that began under Obama; the development of new, low-yield nuclear capabilities to deter Russian nuclear attack; upgrades for missile defenses; and an approval of Montenegro’s bid to join NATO, which had been in the works for years. The Trump administration also slapped new sanctions on five Russians and Chechens over human rights abuses. Trump’s two highest-profile acts challenging Russia were his cruise missile attack against Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally, and his approval of lethal arms sales to Ukraine. In both of those cases, Trump went further than Obama did, though it remains to be seen how thoroughly the administration will follow through on both developments. To the extent that Trump’s policies against Russia have met or exceeded Obama’s post-2014 policies, the credit goes more to his agencies and Congress, experts said. These policies are ones that "hawkish military types in his orbit like, and were not likely from his own initiative," said Wengle, the University of Notre Dame professor. Our ruling Trump said, "I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!" There’s broad agreement that on election meddling, Obama’s actions — while arguably insufficient to the threat at hand — were stronger than Trump’s. On a broader geopolitical level, there has been a significant degree of consistency between the Obama and Trump administrations in actual U.S. policy, and even a few examples where Trump has gone further than Obama did. That said, Trump’s own record of Russia- and Putin-friendly comments have sent contrary messages about U.S. policy toward Russia. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-15262	Since Volvo spurned Georgia for South Carolina in early May, some 3,455 jobs promising more than $800 million in investments have come to the Peach State.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/31/chris-riley/numbers-back-rosy-jobs-claim-georgia/	Job creation was one of the main issues in Gov. Nathan Deal’s successful re-election bid last year, with wins from the state’s focus on recruiting automakers a key element of the talk. Years of effort paid off with big headlines when Porsche North America expanded its headquarters here. The headlines got bigger earlier this year when Mercedes-Benz announced metro Atlanta would become the new home of its U.S. headquarters. But in May, the tone of the big news changed when Volvo rejected Georgia and went with South Carolina for a new $500 million factory that will employ 4,000 workers. State leaders were disappointed but called it a speed bump, not a crash, and pledged to focus on other economic development projects. This month, Deal’s chief of staff, Chris Riley, repeated the point. Since the May 11 Volvo announcement, Riley said those other projects have brought more than $800 million in investments and the promise of 3,455 jobs. "Sometimes the home runs look good," Riley said. "But it’s the singles and doubles that really add up." Mixed sports and driving metaphors aside, did Georgia really manage to bring in even more investment than the Volvo factory promised? We wanted to see the details. Riley was unavailable for comment, but a spokeswoman for Deal’s office said the governor’s top aide drew the numbers from the state’s Department of Economic Development. The agency is responsible for planning and mobilizing state incentives and other resources to attract new business and expand existing operations. The big pitches generate big numbers, in dollars and in jobs, and big headlines. With Mercedes-Benz, for instance, the state offered an incentives package worth $23.3 million. Taken with Fulton County’s property tax break worth $4 million for the next decade, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution calculated that package translated into incentives of $28,750 per job for the 950 total employees that will work in the new Sandy Springs headquarters. The smaller headlines, if they made news at all, were the smaller projects that Riley mentioned. The Economic Development Department keeps track of all of its work, though it only announces named projects when firms agree. Some expansions, for instance, are kept mum so competitors don’t learn of investments that put a firm at a disadvantage, department spokeswoman Stefanie Paupeck Harper said. But the department showed PolitiFact Georgia its tally, broken down by region and type of work when firm names are not released. Between May 11 and Riley’s statement, the department tallied 3,728 jobs – or 273 more than Riley claimed. Of that total, 300 came on the same day that Volvo spurned Georgia. Half of them are with an unnamed food processing expansion project in the 10-county region south and west of metro Atlanta. Named on the list: 100 manufacturing jobs coming with the expansion of MI Metals in Jenkins County; 100 software/tech jobs from Courion moving its headquarters from Massachusetts to Roswell; 200 automotive manufacturing jobs coming with German auto supplier NIFCO KTW’s construction of a plant in Toccoa; and 400 software jobs with the expansion of the Brazilian IT provider Stefanini in Atlanta. We found one error in the tally. The Economic Development Department counts 450 jobs with the relocation of Sage, a British software firm, while the official press releases list 400 jobs. Yet even without those 50 jobs, the tally grew to 3,871 jobs and $902 million in investment by the time we talked to Chris Carr, the state economic development commissioner, on July 23. Among the latest jobs: 120 positions (and $5.5 million in investment) with the relocation of the Dutch firm CSM Bakery Solutions to Sandy Springs. "Obviously, we tried to be aggressive with Volvo, but we are aggressive with smaller companies, too, because with the different regions, the impact is seen all over Georgia," Carr said. "It’s a fun thing to watch." That means the data back up Riley's claim, with one notable caveat. All the projects must invest and hire as promised to receive the incentives, but the timelines vary based on the project, Carr said. None of those extend beyond about eight years, Carr said. But the different deals mean that Georgia has not added nearly twice as many jobs since March, when Volvo said it was going to South Carolina. Then again, it’s not as if Volvo has already set up shop in the Palmetto State and added those jobs. It has years to get to its promise, known in the paperwork as "up to 4,000 jobs." So, in that frame, it means Riley was comparing apples to apples when he made his claim. And the point, Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said, was clear. "We all love the megadeals. They spread news about our state and our great business climate here," Robinson said. "But the jobs that don’t make the headlines present just as much economic security and opportunity for some Georgians, somewhere," he added. "Every Georgian has a stake in each one of these deals." Our ruling State officials promised that Georgia’s momentum for attracting new business would not falter following the loss of a $500 million Volvo plant to rival South Carolina in May. Gov. Nathan Deal’s chief of staff said in July that smaller deals since the Volvo project have led to the promise of 3,455 jobs and $800 million in investment statewide. State economic development data show Chris Riley was low in his tally. Even with an error in the data, Georgia can count nearly as many jobs and significantly more in investment than was promised by Volvo. We rate his claim True.

pomt-14952	Says Denmark’s suicide rate has been about twice as high as the United States’ over the past five decades.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/23/viral-image/internet-graphic-says-suicide-rate-much-higher-den/	Recently, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been pointing to Denmark as an example of an economically just country, including a mention in the first Democratic presidential debate. Since then, an Internet graphic has been circulating that compares the United States to Denmark, purportedly in the form of a first-hand account by a Danish teacher. The description is unflattering to Denmark, and a number of readers have asked us to take a look at it. The graphic talks about excessive taxes and crushing personal debt for residents of Denmark, but one element that caught our eye is a claim about suicide rates. "Denmark’s suicide rate has averaged 20.8 per 100,000 (people) during the last five decades, with its highest level of 32," the graphic states. "The American suicide rate averaged only 11.1 (per 100,000 people) during the last five decades and has never exceeded 12.7." We decided to take a closer look. We should first note that Snopes.com recently broke down each of the meme’s statistical claims. It found a mixed bag -- some claims were largely accurate, but many statements were unsupported or false. According to Scopes, the meme was originally posted on a blog called The Federalist Papers on Oct. 20, and seemed to be a cheeky response to an earlier meme that was favorable toward Denmark, reproduced below: Since the meme references "the last five decades," we looked at the trends over that period from this chart by the World Health Organization. Denmark’s suicide rate (per 100,000 people) 1960: 20 1970: 22 1980: 32 1990: 24 2000: 14 2012: 8.8 Source: The World Health Organization United States’ suicide rate (per 100,000 people) 1960: 10.6 1970: 11.5 1980: 11.8 1990: 12.4 2000: 10.4 2012: 12.1 Source: The World Health Organization Using those numbers, Denmark’s average suicide rate over the last five decades is indeed about 20 people per 100,000. The average U.S. suicide rate in that timeframe is 11.5 people per 100,000. So the graphic has offered fairly accurate numbers. But a closer look at the data shows that they are presented in a misleading way. Reading the meme, one would think that Denmark has a much bigger suicide problem than the United States does. In reality, the latest statistics show exactly the opposite. Danish suicide rates peaked in the 1980s and have fallen significantly since then -- by almost three-quarters. By contrast, the U.S. rate has been largely static since the 1960s, rising modestly between 2000 and 2012. So by 2012, Denmark’s suicide rate was lower than the United States, not higher -- 8.8 people per 100,000 in Denmark, compared to 12.1 per 100,000 in the United States. When we reached Mikkel Clair Nissen, whose website was cited on the graphic, he said this line of query has interested him since Oprah Winfrey visited Denmark in 2009 and called Danes the happiest people in the world. To him, this clashed with Denmark’s historically high suicide rate. Nissen attributes more recent declines to the widespread use of antidepressants. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show Denmark with the highest rate of antidepressant use -- something that he expresses reservations about in his writings. It may be true that Denmark has reduced its suicide rate in part due to antidepressant use, but this seems tangential to the claim we’re checking -- that Denmark has a bigger suicide problem than the United States does. Our ruling An Internet graphic critical of Denmark claimed that Denmark’s suicide rate has been about twice as high as the United States’ over the past five decades. The numbers are accurate, but in the course of making a broader case against Denmark, the data is cherry-picked to make it seem as if Denmark has a much higher suicide rate than the United States. In reality, the rate today is about 50 percent higher in the United States, and in the United States the rate has been increasing somewhat in recent years. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

John Kasich fell into a common trap while campaigning in his home state of Ohio the day before the primary election. He repeated a famous saying without checking it first. Explaining how he planned to fend off outside interests in his decision-making, the Republican presidential candidate invoked the 33rd president, saying, "You know what Truman said -- ‘You want a friend in Washington, buy a dog.’ " It does sound like one of the folksy, farm-charm quips for which Harry S. Truman is known. He’s the leader whose desk displayed the plaque reading, "The buck stops here." But did Truman really say, "You want a friend in Washington, buy a dog?' " Or is it a myth that solidified through repetition, like a thousand witticisms wrongly attributed to George Carlin in email chains? PITCH IN $1, HELP POLITIFACT GET $15,000 IN MATCHING FUNDS TO HIRE A FACT-CHECKER The definitive information comes from the historians at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum. Sam Rushay, supervisory archivist, told us, "We have never been able to confirm or verify that President Truman ever wrote or said, ‘If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,’ a quote that is often attributed to him." The most often cited source for the non-quote is from a work of fiction. In the play Give ‘em Hell, Harry, written by Samuel Gallu in 1975, Truman’s character says, "You want a friend in life, get a dog!" Previous investigators have found the mistake in a 1987 op-ed in the New York Times, and in a 1989 column by the New York Times’ Maureen Dowd. In both cases, the writers credited the quote to the real Truman, and substituted the word "Washington" for "life." History proves that Truman was no fan of dogs. The Presidential Pet Museum’s website includes a page on "President Truman’s Unwanted Dog, Feller," given to the White House as a gift from a supporter. The president gave the puppy away to his doctor, which didn’t play well in the press. A reporter asked Truman, "Whatever happened to Feller?" "To what?" Truman said. "Feller, the puppy," the reporter said. "Oh, he’s around," Truman answered. Our ruling Kasich told an Ohio crowd, "You know what Truman said, ‘You want a friend in Washington, buy a dog.’ " Though that statement is often attributed to Truman, there’s no evidence Truman ever actually said that.

pomt-11298	Claims to be endorsed by the Democratic Party.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/apr/20/duane-hall/democrat-touts-party-endorsement-party-we-want-you/	Since state Rep. Duane Hall won his first election in 2012, his name has been accompanied by the letter "D" for Democrat. But this year, it appears that he’s misusing the party label. Hall, a Raleigh attorney, is serving his third term representing state House District 11 and is seeking a fourth. But to earn it, he’ll first have to beat challenger Allison Dahle in the May 8 Democratic primary. Now, perhaps to reinforce his status as the strongest Democrat in the race, Hall is circulating mailers that suggest he’s endorsed by the Democratic Party. One mailer boasts that Hall is "making education priority one." And at the bottom, the words "endorsed by" accompany a blue "D" with a circle around it. The logo is almost identical to the one used by the Democratic National Committee. Hall indeed received the support of Democrats in previous elections. The Wake County Democratic Party included Hall’s name on voter guides at the polls in the 2014 and 2016 general election, said Virginia Reed, the group’s executive director. "He has been listed on our Democratic candidate slate cards in the past which could be considered an implied endorsement," Reed said. And the North Carolina Democratic Party promoted Hall in a similar manner, party spokesman Robert Howard said. No primary endorsements However, PolitiFact North Carolina found that neither the Wake County Democratic Party, the NC Democratic Party nor the DNC have endorsed Hall in his primary race against Dahle. On Wednesday, each party organization told PolitiFact that they don’t endorse any candidates in primary races. "We have not endorsed any 2018 candidates and will not until after May 8th," Reed said on behalf of the county party. "The state party supports Democratic candidates in the general election but does not typically endorse legislative candidates in the traditional sense, leaving that to local and county parties," Howard said. In fact, the state party has been the opposite of supportive of Hall this year. On Feb. 28, party chairman Wayne Goodwin called on Hall to resign from the legislature because he faced allegations of sexual misconduct. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Calls to resign "Sexual harassment is never acceptable – no matter the party or politics. These are serious allegations and Representative Hall should step down," Goodwin said in a statement. "The North Carolina Democratic Party has no tolerance for sexual harassment and we continue to encourage women to speak out against inappropriate behavior of any kind." Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, also called Hall to resign. Hall, for his part, denied that he has harassed anyone. Nonetheless, on Thursday, the DNC joined the state party in calling for Hall to resign. "The DNC does not endorse candidates running in contested primaries and we have not endorsed Duane Hall in North Carolina. We were not informed, nor did we approve the use of our logo in his mailer," Francisco Pelayo, DNC director of Hispanic media and regional press secretary, wrote in an email. "We take sexual harassment very seriously and we are very concerned by the allegations against Hall. We stand with Governor Cooper’s and NCDP’s calls for him to step down," Pelayo wrote. He added that he’s not aware of any time that the DNC has previously endorsed Hall. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It’s unclear why Hall is using the "D" logo. He didn’t respond to an email or voicemails left by a reporter. What is clear is that the national, state and county parties haven’t endorsed him this year. Our ruling Hall’s mailer suggests that he’s endorsed by the Democratic Party. The local and state parties have promoted him in the past. But the Wake County Democratic Party, NC Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee all denied making any primary endorsements at all. Not only are the parties not endorsing him, the NCDP and DNC have called on him to step down. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03803	"Already, a prototype driverless car has traveled more than 300,000 miles in the crowded maze of California streets without a single accident."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/25/jeb-bush/driverless-car-has-gone-300000-miles-without-accid/	Imagine while fighting through traffic that you could paint your toenails, play the guitar or read a novel -- but safely, because the car would be doing all the driving. We’re not talking about a Jetsons make-believe scenario here: Several companies have autonomous or self-driving cars in the works. (Spoiler alert: the scenario we describe could be years away, and you might have to pay attention enough to grab the wheel.) Former Gov. Jeb Bush mentioned such cars as an example of technological innovations during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 15, 2013. "Driverless vehicles will flawlessly move people and products across our highways, never getting lost, never having accidents," said Bush, a potential Republican 2016 presidential candidate. "Already, a prototype driverless car has traveled more than 300,000 miles in the crowded maze of California streets without a single accident." Has a driverless car really traveled 300,000 miles on crowded California streets without a single accident? PolitiFact hit the virtual road to find out. A ride in a driverless car Several car companies are developing so-called autonomous or self-driving cars operated by computers. But they may not be publicly available for at least a decade if not longer. Among the challenges are the legal questions of who faces liability when a driverless crashes, as well as bringing down the $100,000 price tag for the technology. But the technology is cool. Check out this Google video of a blind man taking a ride in the driver’s seat to Taco Bell ("Look ma no hands!"). A recent Forbes story offered a good first-hand account of riding at 65 miles per hour around Silicon Valley in a Lexus equipped with Google’s technology. When a slow-moving truck merged onto the highway, the Google car hit the brakes on its own; the car also tracked a tailgater and a motorcyclist weaving in traffic. The article explained that Google engineers gather information about the route and add it to maps before the self-driving takes off. "When it’s the autonomous vehicle’s turn to drive, it compares the data it is acquiring from all those sensors and cameras to the previously recorded data," Forbes reported. "That helps it differentiate a pedestrian from a light pole." The car has limitations. A Google official said that the car can’t handle heavy rain and or snow-covered roads, and engineers are working on how to handle encountering a stalled car or a tire in the middle of the road. Florida, California and Nevada have all passed laws that allow testers to operate so-called autonomous cars. In 2012, the Florida Legislature passed a law that requires humans in the cars to intervene if necessary. Testers must submit proof of $5 million in insurance. As of March 21, no testers have registered, said Leslie Palmer, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Bush’s spokeswoman referred us to an August 2012 Google blog: "Our vehicles, of which about a dozen are on the road at any given time, have now completed more than 300,000 miles of testing. They’ve covered a wide range of traffic conditions, and there hasn’t been a single accident under computer control." Of those 300,000 miles, Google co-founder Sergey Brin said: "I think we’ve done 50,000 miles now without safety critical intervention. But that’s not good enough…The self-driving car is going to face greater scrutiny than any human would. And I think that’s appropriate." A Google spokesman gave PolitiFact Florida a statement after Bush’s speech that the cars have actually driven over 500,000 miles on public roads. A Google car crash -- near headquarters Google did face scrutiny in August 2011 when several blogs and news reports highlighted a car crash involving such a car near Google’s Mountain View headquarters. "This photo of what looks like a minor case of Prius-on-Prius vehicular violence may actually be a piece of automotive history: the first accident caused by Google's self-driving car. Whose name should the cop write down on the ticket?" wrote the Jalopnik blog. But Google said a human being was manually controlling the car when the accident occurred. Mountain View police referred PolitiFact Florida to a Mountain View Voice article which quoted a police spokeswoman: "Since it involved five vehicles, we wanted to make sure there were no injuries and facilitate the exchange of names. Essentially, it was five-car fender-bender. No one reported any injuries and so the officer simply facilitated the exchange of names. No case was taken." The article also said that "Google claims the Google car was in between tests and that the accident was on a road that had not been mapped previously to allow it to drive autonomously on that section of street." Popular Mechanics wrote that it had no reason to doubt Google’s word that a human caused the crash but noted, "With this accident, there's not much to go on besides Google's word." The crash raised the question if companies will provide law enforcement full access to verify if a person was driving at the time of the accident. The only other report of a crash we could find was a New York Times 2010 story that said a Google car was rear-ended at a traffic light. Being rear-ended usually means the other driver is considered at fault. Experts raise some caveats about the cars We ran Bush’s claim by Bryant Walker Smith, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, who wrote a paper on the legality of automated cars. (The center publicly discloses its donors, which include Google and some car companies.) He said driverless cars haven’t traveled enough miles yet to prove their safety. Based on the number of car crashes in the United States and the miles traveled, he concluded that Google's cars would need "to drive themselves (by themselves) more than 725,000 representative miles without incident for us to say with 99 percent confidence that they crash less frequently than conventional cars. If we look only at fatal crashes, this minimum skyrockets to 300 million miles. To my knowledge, Google has yet to reach these milestones." Smith said that Bush’s claim is a good faith summary of the media reports; however, it omits some caveats. "These are testers who are being closely supervised by highly trained drivers who do occasionally intervene in the operation," he said. "That is very different from sending a vehicle unmonitored through a variety of road conditions. ... Although Google has logged impressive miles, and demonstrated other statistics that they are more safe than human drivers, that is not publicly documented at this point and there is an incredible amount of research required." He also said we shouldn’t expect cars that function completely without human intervention of some sort. "‘Driverless car’ is probably not the right word for the kind of vehicle we are talking about," he told PolitiFact Florida. "Driving will be shared with a computer either simultaneously or sequentially. A human may need to do some functions of the driver, and the computer may augment functions of humans depending on road conditions and kind of road." Our ruling During his CPAC speech, Bush talked about technological innovations underway and that will occur over the next 100 years. "Already, a prototype driverless car has traveled more than 300,000 miles in the crowded maze of California streets without a single accident," Bush said. We don’t fault Bush for citing the 300,000 figure rather than the recent 500,000 figure, because that higher number only received publicity after the CPAC speech. But technically, Bush was wrong to say that the prototype car has driven in California "without a single accident." We found two accidents, but they both had mitigating factors. One car was rear ended, which suggests another driver was at fault. In another accident, a human was operating the car, at least according to Google. Still, we couldn’t find one incident where a driverless car operating under its own technology clearly caused an accident. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11671	"Mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data" that could show election fraud.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/05/donald-trump/trump-blames-democratic-states-providing-voter-d/	President Donald Trump blamed Democratic states for the demise of his voter fraud commission. "Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud," Trump tweeted Jan. 4. "They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump disbanded the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity on Jan. 3 and asked the Department of Homeland Security to review its initial findings and determine next courses of action. The commission was plagued by infighting, multiple lawsuits and pushback from many states. We will fact-check whether it was mostly Democratic states that refused to hand over the data. Many states wouldn’t provide the data In May 2017, Trump issued an executive order establishing the voter fraud commission headed up by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Trump had made repeated misleading claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging during and after the election. While some instances of voter fraud have occurred, national experts have said fraud is isolated and rare. The commission in June asked state election officials for information that included voters' names, registration status, political party affiliation, voting history, partial Social Security numbers. Many of states did agree to provide some data to the commission, although many required that the commission meet certain criteria, such as paying a fee. Still, the commission didn’t get all the data it wanted, even from the states that agreed to comply. The AP found that states that agreed to comply did withhold some details that the commission had sought, such as only releasing information considered public under state law. (Even Kobach said that his state of Kansas couldn’t provide Social Security information because it wasn’t available under state law.) According to the AP as of Oct. 22, the states that denied the request were: California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming. Arizona and Illinois were categorized as undecided. There are several holes in Trump’s argument that is was mostly Democratic states. Some states that denied or didn’t comply with the commission’s request ultimately voted for Trump. Arizona, Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming all voted for Trump. That undercuts Trump’s portrayal of Democratic states being the only ones fighting the commission. Some states don’t fall neatly into one partisan category. In Illinois, the bipartisan state board of elections sent a letter to the commission raising concerns and seeking more information. Illinois is generally thought of as a blue state and voted for Clinton, but the board that acted on the Trump commission request includes both Democrats and Republicans. Kentucky, which reliably votes for Republicans in presidential elections and went overwhelmingly for Trump, has an elected Democratic Secretary of State, Alison Lundergan-Grimes. She was the one who officially rejected the commission’s request. Some Republican officials rejected or didn’t comply with the commission’s request. This includes Arizona, North Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming. Ed Murray, the Republican secretary of state in Wyoming, said in July, "I am going to safeguard the privacy of Wyoming’s voters because of my strong belief in a citizen’s right of privacy." He said that elections are the responsibility of the states and the request could lead to federal overreach. North Dakota also does not have voter registration and state law forbids the state from releasing details about voters. In Arizona, Republican Secretary of State Michele Reagan called the commission's request a "hastily organized experiment." Even the states that agreed to comply didn’t provide everything the commission requested. The AP found that states that agreed to comply still withheld some details the commission had sought and only released information considered public under state law. Even Kobach’s own state, Kansas, didn’t allow for the release of Social Security data. Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican, said he would only disclose public records and not Social Security or driver’s license numbers. "We absolutely will not provide any information that is not already publicly available," he said in July. "The responsibility for the accuracy and fairness of our elections process in Florida lies with us, not with the federal government in Washington, D.C." A final note on the part of Trump’s tweet that said states that didn’t comply did so "because they know that many people are voting illegally." PolitiFact has repeatedly found no evidence of widespread national voter fraud. While we were working on this item the Washington Post’s The Fact Checker published their own analysis and used a different methodology but reached similar conclusions. Our ruling Trump tweeted that "mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data." While there are multiple ways to define states as Democratic -- and the White House didn’t explain the definition Trump was using -- he has a point that a variety of predominantly Democratic states were among the states that went the furthest in opposing the commission’s request. They include California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont. However, six states won by Trump -- Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wyoming and Arizona -- didn’t comply with the commission’s request, and other Republican states complied only in part with the commission’s request.

pomt-07898	In the 1980s, "The lowest income people had the biggest gains."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/03/steve-moore/wall-street-journals-steve-moore-claims-low-income/	Rachel Maddow got into a spirited back-and-forth with Stephen Moore of the Wall Street Journal on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher show Jan. 21, 2011, over the effect of the Reagan tax cuts and income inequality. Moore got the ball rolling with his comment, "I say the Reagan tax cuts were the greatest economic policy of the last 50 years." Moore said the economy boomed. Maddow said the deficit went up. Moore said the value of assets soared. "Awesome," Maddow said. "What happened to the top first, 1 percent of the country? Their income went up roughly 80 percent." "Everybody’s income went up," Moore said. Maddow began to cite a statistic about the median wage from 1980 to 1990 when Moore interrupted. "The facts are the facts, Rachel. The lowest income people had the biggest gains," Moore said. In a separate item, we're checking Maddow's claim that "From 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent" while "the median wage in the country over (the same) 10 years went up 3 percent." Here, we're checking Moore's claim that during the 1980s, "The lowest income people had the biggest gains." There are lots of ways to slice income statistics, but neither Maddow nor Moore responded to our e-mails seeking clarification and backup material. So we turned to the U.S. Census and a few economists for input. Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist to liberal Brookings Institution, said U.S. Census data doesn't back Moore up. According to Census data, when presented in equivalent 2009 dollars, the income among the lowest fifth of the population increased about 6.3 percent (from $10,682 to $11,400). That's the lowest gain compared to other quintiles: 7.9 percent for the second lowest fifth; 8 percent for the middle fifth; 10.5 percent for the fourth fifth, and 20.3 percent in the highest fifth. Incomes rose 28.2 percent among the top 5 percent. "Incomes rose in the bottom, middle, and top portions of the income distribution as Mr. Moore stated, although the income gains were certainly bigger at the top compared with the bottom," Burtless said. "These results clearly show that low-income Americans did not obtain the biggest income gains between 1980 and 1990." According to the U.S. Census, the share of the aggregate income received by families decreased in every quintile except the top quintile (where it increased from 41.1 to 44.3 percent). In other words, the richest Americans held a larger share of all income in 1990 than in 1980. Those are the census figures. Economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez also analyzed income via tax data. According to their study, average inflation-adjusted income (pre-tax) per family in the top 1 percent increased from $427,000 in 1980 to $661,000 in 1990. That's a 55 percent increase. Meanwhile, the average income (pre-tax) per family in the bottom 90 percent fell slightly from $30,900 in 1980 to $30,800 in 1990. You can see all of the results in Table A6 of their report. "All economists agree that the 1980s saw a huge increase in inequality," said Saez, an economics professor at the University of California Berkeley. There was "increased concentration at the top and big losses at the bottom (especially during the early 1980s recession)." So Moore can make a credible argument -- based on Census data -- that all incomes rose during the 1980s, but the data does not support his claim that the lowest income people had the biggest gains. To the contrary, the lowest income people had the smallest gains. We rule Moore's claim False.	None	Steve Moore	None	None	None	2011-02-03T12:37:44	2011-02-02	['None']

pomt-11882	Says West Virginia is "down to around 50 percent of the adult workers who are actually working now because of addiction or conviction."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/27/joe-manchin/opioid-epidemic-likely-hurting-west-virginias-work/	The Democratic senator from West Virginia — where the opioid overdose death rate ranked highest in the nation in 2015 — connected the state’s opioid use with its battered workforce. Sen. Joe Manchin told MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt that the opioid crisis is destroying families and wrecking the state’s economic future. "I've got the greatest workers in the world," Manchin said on Oct. 22. "But I'm down to around 50 percent of the adult workers who are actually working now because of addiction or conviction." We wondered to what extent opioids are to blame for low employment in West Virginia. Manchin’s office told us he learned about the effect opioid abuse has on the state’s employment through "hundreds of meetings with business executives, state workforce and labor experts, at his job fairs and with community leaders across the state." The office also clarified Manchin’s comment, saying people who struggle with addiction or have been convicted in crimes related to opioid use in the past often have trouble getting jobs. Experts agreed that the opioid crisis affects employment rates in West Virginia, but they don’t know how much. Measuring the workforce Manchin is about on the mark when he says about half of West Virginia’s adults are employed. What’s less certain is the role opioid abuse plays. To measure this, the Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at two key figures: the employment-population ratio (the percentage of people over the age of 16 who are employed) and the labor force participation rate (the percentage of people over the age of 16 who are either employed or actively looking for a job). The latest estimates place West Virginia at a 50.4 percent employment-population ratio and a 53.1 percent labor force participation rate in September. By comparison, the United States’ employment-participation ratio in September was at 60.4 percent and the labor force participation rate was 63.1 percent. (Because the labor force doesn’t typically include students and retirees, college towns or populations with more elderly individuals might sometimes appear to have lower workforce participation.) West Virginia has historically had one of the lowest labor participation rates in the United States. Since the late 1970s, as far back as the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ data on labor participation rates goes, the state’s rate has remained below 58 percent. Similarly, the employment-population ratio has not exceeded 55 percent. A 2015 study of West Virginia’s labor participation rate conducted by the West Virginia Center on Budget & Policy found that the state’s higher-than-average elderly population, percentage of people on work disability and poor overall health were major factors in the participation rate. In addition, lower rates of educational attainment beyond a high school degree had prevented young workers from obtaining jobs that require more education. Where does that leave opioid addiction? Experts say that’s an unanswered question. "While I'm sure addiction and the opioid crisis have played a role in hurting West Virginia's workforce, I'm not sure you can attribute much of the state's decline to it," said Sean O’Leary, a senior policy analyst with the center. He also noted that the state’s recent decline coincides with the national recession. The opioid epidemic’s effect on labor At the national level, a September 2017 paper out of Princeton University suggested opioid use could account for 20 percent of the drop in men’s labor force participation from 1999 to 2015 and 25 percent of the decline in women’s participation. And the problem has drawn the attention of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who testified to the epidemic’s effects on national labor during a July 13 Senate Banking Committee meeting. "I do think it is related to declining labor force participation among prime-age workers," Yellen said. "I don’t know if it’s causal or if it’s a symptom of long-running economic maladies that have affected these communities and particularly affected workers who have seen their job opportunities decline." But there is no specific research related to West Virginia. Anecdotal evidence suggests employers nationwide have struggled in the past several years to find potential workers who are drug-free and healthy enough to perform required job tasks. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland also cited the problem in a September 2016 report on West Virginia, which said local employers contacted by the reserve bank indicated "educational attainment and social factors such as frequent opioid and heroin use" limited the employers from finding the workers they need. Still, the exact statistical impact for the state remains unclear. Jessica Ice, an assistant professor at West Virginia University’s Institute for Labor Studies and Research, said she would be hesitant to attribute the entire decline in employment to opioids. "I think we are still learning about the extent of the problem here as the epidemic continues to wreak havoc on the state of West Virginia," Ice said. "While surely there is an impact I cannot even say what came first, disability and then prescription drug abuse? Hopelessness over the state of the economy and resorting to drugs to cope?" Our ruling Manchin said the reason for the decline of working adults in West Virginia to "around 50 percent" of adults is due to the state’s opioid epidemic. His estimate of workforce participation is correct, and recent research at the national level suggests opioids have hurt workers and employers looking for healthy employees. Experts on West Virginia’s economy think the health crisis has affected participation in the workforce; they just don’t yet know to what extent. In any event, a number of other factors are likely driving the decline. Manchin’s claim is partially accurate, but lacks context that might give a different understanding of the data.

pomt-01809	"I’m running the second-largest county district attorney’s office … at 1985 staffing levels."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/23/ismael-ozanne/attorney-general-candidate-says-hes-running-distri/	In the run-up to the Aug. 12, 2014 primary election for state attorney general, Democrat Ismael Ozanne has stressed his experience as the Dane County district attorney and as a former deputy secretary of the state Department of Corrections. On June 7, 2014, near the end of a speech he gave at the state Democratic Party convention, Ozanne said: "And I’m running the second-largest county district attorney’s office. And I’ve talked to you about some of the innovations that we’re doing, some of the things that we’re doing to be proactive. But I’m doing that at 1985 staffing levels. So, you think about that. That’s leadership. That’s experience. I’m doing more with less in a county that’s grown 46 percent, where law enforcement’s grown 103 percent. We are moving forward." It’s no surprise that the population of Dane County, home to Madison, has been growing and that court caseloads would be higher, as well. So, is the DA’s office there still operating with the same number of staff it did nearly three decades ago? Prosecutor funding In Wisconsin, the elected district attorneys and the prosecutors they hire primarily prosecute felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well juvenile cases, in circuit court. They were county employees until 1990, after a change in state law made them state employees. The change was made largely as a means of providing local property tax relief and reducing turnover in prosecutor positions, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. As a result, the vast majority of prosecutor positions in the district attorney offices is determined through the state budget process. Some county district attorney offices also get prosecutors via state- or federally funded grants, which come and go. Concerns have been raised for years about the number of prosecutors. A state Legislative Audit Bureau analysis done in 2007 noted that the state employed 425 district attorney prosecutors but -- based on the number and types of cases prosecuted as analyzed by the State Prosecutors Office -- should employ 542. That gap has grown, according to a more recent analysis. The State Prosecutors Office says there were still 425 district attorney prosecutors as of April 2014, but there should be 555. Ozanne's numbers As for Ozanne’s claim, he said he was referring to the prosecutor positions in his office. To back the claim, his campaign initially cited a chart on the website of the Dane County district attorney's office, which lists the number of prosecutors annually back from 1985 through 2011. Separately, we obtained a 1985 budget document from the county’s budget office. Both indicate the Dane County DA’s office had 26 prosecutors in 1985. The number remained in the high 20s to low 30s well into the 1990s before peaking at 34 in both 1999 and 2003, according to the chart. The low was 25 prosecutors in 2010. The current number, however, is slightly higher than the 26 that there were in 1985. The full-time-equivalent number of prosecutor positions for 2014 is 27.85, according to the State Prosecutors Office. That is nearly two positions, or about 7 percent, more than Dane County’s 1985 total. By comparison, Milwaukee County had 86 prosecutors in 1990 (the oldest complete data available) compared to 119.5 in 2014, according to the State Prosecutors Office. But two other important factors bear on Ozanne’s claim. 1. The Dane County DA's office has used more state-paid special prosecutors than any other county in each year since 2012 (Ozanne became DA in August 2010), according to the State Prosecutors Office. So far in 2014, it has used six special prosecutors, including two who are covering extended leaves; that would technically bump its total to 29.85 prosecutors for 2014, as indicated on information Ozanne’s campaign provided. The state incurs an additional cost to pay the special prosecutors, even though they are not a net addition to the prosecutorial staff. 2. Ozanne’s claim was general -- the level of staffing in his office, rather than specifically the number of prosecutors. We found there are currently 58 non-prosecutors in the DA’s office -- paralegals, investigators, secretaries and others -- which is 41 percent more than the 41 support staff in 1985. Our rating Ozanne said: "I’m running the second-largest county district attorney’s office … at 1985 staffing levels." The Dane County district attorney’s office has a full-time-equivalent of 27.85 prosecutors, just slightly more than the 26 in 1985, but it also regularly utilizes special prosecutors to fill temporary vacancies. And the office has 41 percent more support staff than it did in 1985. We rate Ozanne’s statement Half True.	None	Ismael Ozanne	None	None	None	2014-07-23T05:00:00	2014-06-07	['None']

pomt-08509	Says Oregon ranks 43rd in education.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/07/chris-dudley/first-debate-john-kitzhaber-chris-dudley-says-oreg/	During the first, and possibly only, gubernatorial debate, Republican candidate Chris Dudley addressed the need for statewide educational reform. To underscore the necessity, he mentioned -- twice -- that Oregon’s school system ranked 43rd nationally. "I was disappointed that when, in the Race to the Top, Oregon's application, we were graded an F, and then when it was time to reapply we decided not to even do it," Dudley said, referring to a national grant competition funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (better known as the stimulus). "And this is when our school system has been ranked 43rd in the nation. Instead of racing to the top, Oregon has decided to run for the hills. "We have to look at reform. We absolutely have to. When you're at 43rd, you have to look at how do you change it, how do you make it better." Everything Dudley said seemed to track with previous reports in The Oregonian about Race to the Top: Oregon didn’t do too well in the first call for applications and then passed on applying for the second round. But his claim that Oregon ranked 43rd nationally stuck with us -- especially because he kept repeating the claim (we counted five mentions in total). We wondered whether it would hold up to scrutiny. Dudley’s campaign pointed us to Education Week’s most recent Quality Counts, an annual report of the state of education in the United States. A look at the press releasethat accompanied the most recent report bore out Dudley’s claim. Oregon did show up 43rd overall. But, as with most complicated rankings, not everybody thinks Quality Counts offers the best picture of how Oregon stacks up against other states. For instance, Oregon earned its lowest score -- and, in fact, the lowest in the nation -- on "teacher preparation and support." The Oregon Coalition for Quality Teaching and Learning, made up of the leading education policy organizations in Oregon, released a statementafter the most recent Quality Counts report. The coalition said Oregon’s score on teacher preparation was skewed because of the way some of the questions were asked. One example: Quality Counts asks whether Oregon requires all "prospective teachers from traditional preparation programs to pass written tests in subject specific knowledge." For the most part, Oregon does. But, the coalition notes, the state provides for some leeway. The state does allow alternative assessments in specific cases. But the number is low. In the 2006-07 school year (the year the state used when filling out the survey), only 0.5 percent of the state’s prospective teachers took this alternative assessment. That’s just 21 teachers statewide. Because of the 21, however, Oregon was given no credit for that question. More broadly, the coalition says the report is biased in its preference for statewide education measures, something that penalizes Oregon, where local control in setting policies is generally preferred. Christopher Swanson, the vice president of Editorial Projects in Education (the publisher of Education Week), said that some of those concerns are valid, particularly the bit about local control. "This is kind of a report and report card looking at state policies and education trends and to the extent that the state is an actor," Swanson said. "States with more local control will tend not to score as high." As for the teacher prep question, he doubts Oregon’s ranking would have changed all that much even if the score on that section had improved some. Either way, it didn’t seem right to let this study be the final word on Oregon’s school system, partly because it doesn’t focus on student achievement -- which is how many parents judge school quality. PolitiFact Oregon dug around for some other possible measurements. Susanne Smith, a spokeswoman for Oregon's superintendent for public instruction, pointed us toward the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a standardized test. The test, she said, offers "an apples-to-apples measure" of student performance nationally. Oregon did better than 43rd on all counts on scores for 2009. Fourth-grade students ranked 35th and 36th in math and reading, respectively. Eighth-graders ranked 25th and 26th. Of course, those national test scores are pretty narrow in what they reveal. They speak only to student performance and not to the system as a whole. To get a good idea of where Oregon -- or any other state -- ranks overall is difficult, Smith said. "Every state creates their own content standards, what students should know and learn. Then, based on those standards, they have their own accountability system." For the final word, we turned to Oregon Stand for Children, a student advocacy group made up largely of parents. Sue Levin, the executive director, said that Dudley used the same 43 number in his endorsement interview with the organization. (The organization has so far endorsed neither Dudley nor John Kitzhaber, his Democratic opponent.) "I thought about it afterward and I didn't feel -- let's put it this way: In every measure of educational quality that I have ever seen, Oregon tends to be in the bottom third, so therefore we're somewhere between 34 and 50." PolitiFact Oregon takes a similar view. Dudley is clearly cherry-picking one ranking out of dozens, but he did accurately quote a well-known educational study. Other rankings do place Oregon on the lower end of things. So, we rate this claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Chris Dudley	None	None	None	2010-10-07T06:00:00	2010-09-30	['None']

pomt-05388	Says the average Ohio student graduates from a four-year college or university with nearly $27,000 in tuition debt.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/07/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-ohio-students-graduate-college-/	Editor's note: We originally rated this claim True. After receiving feedback from readers, we have downgraded that rating to Half True because the claim applies the average debt of about $27,000 to a much broader group than did the study from which it was cited. Interest rates on federally subsidized student loans went on the front burner as a political issue after Mitt Romney followed President Obama in saying he did not want those rates to go up. Congressional Republicans -- who earlier passed a budget allowing the rates to double in July to their 2007 rate of 6.8 percent -- closed ranks behind their presumptive presidential nominee. They voted for a hastily introduced bill that would keep the rate at 3.4 percent, and pay for it with funds intended for preventive health care programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Raiding that fund made the legislation unpalatable for Democrats -- just as the Democratic proposals to extend the lower interest rates were unpalatable to Republicans. One of the proposals would have paid for the college loan subsidies by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Another would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners. Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown was a co-sponsor of the latter bill and of earlier legislation to stop the loan rates from going up. "Federally-subsidized Stafford loans have allowed thousands of students—who might not otherwise be able pay for to college—afford the ever-increasing cost of higher education," he said in a news release. "With the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution with nearly $27,000 in tuition bills, the last thing we should be doing is adding to their already-heavy debt load." The figure of $27,000 caught the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. It is more than $6,700 per year for four years of school. We asked Brown's office for his source and more information. They referred us to the Project on Student Debt, a project of the independent, nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success. Its most recent survey of public and private four-year institutions in Ohio found that 68 percent of students graduate in debt, and that the average debt on college loans is $27,713 -- the 7th-highest statewide average in the nation. (New Hampshire was highest, with average debt of $31,048; Wyoming was lowest, with $20,571.) The actual debt level is probably higher, the Project on Student Debt noted, because the data is voluntarily reported by colleges and not available for all of them. The report also reflects only graduates of public and private nonprofit colleges because few for-profit colleges report the student debt data. Based on national surveys by the U.S. Department of Education, graduates of for-profit four-year colleges are much more likely to borrow student loans, and borrow significantly more, than counterparts at nonprofit institutions. Nationally, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average student loan balance per borrower is $23,300. The median balance is roughly half of that, $12,800. About one-quarter of borrowers nationally owe more than $28,000, and about 10 percent owe more than $54,000, according to the New York Fed. In aggregate, the bank said, the outstanding student loan balance now stands at about $870 billion, surpassing the nation’s total credit card balance ($693 billion) and the total auto loan balance ($730 billion). About 37 million people hold outstanding student loan debt. The key with all these figures is that they deal specifically with students who borrow and then graduate with loan debt. So how does that mesh with Brown’s claim? In his statement he said "the average Ohio student graduating from a four-year institution." That describes a bigger pool of people than just the students who graduate with debt. In that most recent survey it would also include the 32 percent of the graduates who had no debt. But the figure Brown cited, nearly $27,000, was an average covering just those students who graduated with debt. Brown’s statement is partially accurate. He cites the correct figure from a survey on debt among college students. But he describes those affected by debt too broadly, applying the average to all rather than just those who graduate with loan balances. Including all students would lower the average for loan debt by about a third. That’s an important detail needed to fully understand Brown’s claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, Brown’s statement rates as Half True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2012-05-07T06:00:00	2012-04-15	['Ohio']
pomt-11601	"Because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-partly-correct-rejoinder-jay-z/	President Donald Trump didn’t wait long to respond to Jay-Z when the rapper and businessman appeared on the inaugural edition of the Van Jones Show on CNN. During the show, which aired on the night of Saturday, Jan. 27, Jones asked Jay-Z whether it's okay for Trump "to say terrible things but put money in our pockets," referring to Trump's repeated assertion that unemployment for African-Americans has dropped to record lows. Jay-Z responded in the negative, saying, "It's not about money at the end of the day. Money doesn't equate to happiness. It doesn't. That's missing the whole point." He added, "You treat people like human beings. That's the main point. It goes back to the whole thing — 'treat me really bad and pay me well.' It's not going to lead to happiness, it's going to lead to, again, the same thing. Everyone's going to be sick." Early the next morning, Trump tweeted, "Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Setting aside Trump’s non-sequitur — Jay-Z didn’t dispute that the African-American unemployment rate was the lowest ever — we wondered whether Trump has a point that the decline is "because of my policies." As we’ve noted, the unemployment rate for African-Americans is currently the lowest since the statistic was first calculated in 1972. In December 2017, African-American unemployment fell to 6.8 percent. The previous record low was 7 percent in April 2000 and September 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com However, as we also noted, the African-American unemployment rate didn’t exactly turn on a dime once Trump took office. Black unemployment peaked at 16.6 percent in April 2010, after a historic recession and when Barack Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 percent by the time Obama left office in January 2017. More to the point, as we’ve noted in regard to presidents of both parties, presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters. Broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's Analytics, said that while the jury remains out on his long-term record, Trump does deserve some credit for overall economic growth on his watch. In the tweet, Lafakis said, Trump "is likely suggesting that his policies have boosted the overall economy, which has helped black people as well as whites. This is the only thing I can think of him referring to, since he hasn’t undertaken any initiatives solely designed to benefit blacks." Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, agreed that he "cannot think of any specific policy under President Trump that has especially aided African-American workers or job seekers." Trump can "legitimately argue that his stewardship has contributed to, or at least not detracted from, the good economic news of the past 12 months," Burtless said. But beyond that, any specific link to African-Americans’ economic fortunes is speculative, he said. "Higher stock prices and improved investor confidence may fuel higher investment in the United States and better job growth in the future, helping African-Americans as well as all other workers, but that remains to be seen," he said. The White House told PolitiFact that even though the decline began on Obama’s watch, Trump has kept the momentum going. Our ruling Trump said that "because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!" While African-American unemployment rates are indeed at record lows, Trump’s ability to take credit is uncertain. The rate has fallen with ski-slope consistency since about 2010, six years before Trump took office. And economists have always been skeptical about the ability of presidents to take either credit or blame for conditions on their watch, since many other factors play into economic results. Trump has taken no specific actions aimed at lowering the unemployment rate for African-Americans. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-10601	"Bill Clinton's peace dividend . . . cut the military 25 and 30 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/24/rudy-giuliani/the-peace-dividend-began-with-a-bush/	At a Republican debate in Boca Raton on Jan. 24, 2008, Rudy Giuliani repeated his claim that Bill Clinton is to blame for shrinking the nation's military. "I think we should increase the size of our military substantially to overcome the damage that Bill Clinton did with the peace dividend," he said, adding that "a lot of the cause of (the smaller military force) was Bill Clinton's peace dividend, in which he cut the military 25 and 30 percent." We've covered this topic in two previous items, one for Giuliani and one for a similiar claim made earlier by Mitt Romney. But because this misleading claim is new to many voters who are just tuning into the campaign, we'll reiterate what we've said before. Romney made his claim in April 2007, saying that, "Following the end of the Cold War, President Clinton began to dismantle our military. He reduced our forces by 500,000. He retired almost 80 ships. Our spending on national defense dropped from over 6 percent of GDP to 3.8 percent today." The two Republicans are correct that military forces were reduced significantly under Clinton. The active-duty military totaled 1.8-million at the start of his presidency in 1993 and declined to 1.4-million in 2000. They are also correct that the naval fleet shrank dramatically. The Navy had 454 ships in 1993, but as vessels were retired and not replaced, the fleet was down to 341 by 2000. But they are selectively choosing numbers that make it appear that the military cuts were Clinton's alone. In fact, the cuts were prompted by the end of the Cold War during the presidency of President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. During Bush's presidency, he and Congress agreed to a sharp drop in military personnel. Active-duty military declined from 2.2-million to 1.8-million. Total defense forces also shrank, from 3.3-million to 2.9-million. The Republicans are trying to portray Clinton and the Democrats as weak on defense and to make the peace dividend look like a partisan effort. But contrary to the Republicans' claims, the post-Cold War shrinkage of the U.S. military was very much a bipartisan effort. It began under a Republican president and a Democratic Congress and continued under a Democratic president and a Republican Congress. And so we find, as we did before, that this claim is Half True.

pomt-07249	Says the Obama Administration has fulfilled all of Texas’ requests for fire management assisting grants.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/30/jay-carney/white-house-press-secretary-jay-carney-says-obama-/	En route to El Paso with President Barack Obama on May 10, White House press secretary Jay Carney jumped on a reporter’s question about whether the administration’s denial of a disaster declaration for Texas was politically motivated. In an April 16 letter to Obama, Gov. Rick Perry requested a "major disaster declaration" as a result of wildfires that have burned through the state. The request sought federal aid to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of firefighting costs already expended and to help the state fight burning fires in 252 of the state’s 254 counties, including Travis. On May 3, the Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected the request after concluding that recovery needs did not exceed what state and local governments could handle, according to a May 4 Star-Telegram news article. Besides, Carney told reporters, "this administration has been extremely responsive to the state of Texas’ requests for wildfire management assisting grants — 25 of them at last count," he said. "All that have been requested had been, as far as I know it, have been provided." Indeed, the state has received 27 grants requested in connection with 27 wildfires that burned about 1 million acres in 31 counties. The grants cover 75 percent of the firefighting costs associated with the 27 fires. FEMA spokeswoman Rachel Racusen later told us the grants factored into the agency’s denial of the request for the disaster declaration because they "fund many of the same emergency response activities Gov. Perry was seeking assistance for." Separately, some affected Texas residents are eligible for other federal help, including low-interest loans and assistance to ranchers and farmers who lost livestock in the fires. Texas Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor told us that from Sept. 1 through May 15, local fire departments and the state spent about $97.5 million on wildfires. Of that, the state has pitched in $90.8 million, and expects to be reimbursed about $23 million from the 27 approved federal grants to date. Perry isn’t placated. During an interview on NewsRadio 1080 KRLD on May 11, Perry said: "We've had over 9,000 different fires in the state of Texas, 2.3 million acres burned. If that doesn't rise to the level of a major emergency I don't know what does." As of May 16, according to the service, 10,123 Texas fires burned nearly 2.6 million acres in 237 counties. On May 26, Perry appealed the Obama administration's decision to deny the declaration. But this isn’t the first time the federal government hasn’t granted Texas’ aid requests. We found that it has gone both ways on fire-related requests for disaster declarations from Texas. — In February 2009, according to FEMA, the Obama administration denied a Perry request for an emergency declaration for wildfires, and his subsequent request for a major disaster declaration. According to an April 2009 Abilene Reporter News article, Perry requested the declaration after wildfires burned through 400,000 acres, destroying 200 homes. — In 2008, the Bush administration denied Perry’s request for a major disaster declaration due to wildfires that had burned, according to Perry’s office, nearly 940,000 acres in 215 counties, the San Antonio Express-News reported March 20, 2008. The reason: "We just didn’t see that the state’s capacity to respond was overwhelmed," said FEMA spokesman Earl Armstrong, according to the Express-News article. After the state appealed the rejection, the government granted a emergency disaster declaration, which is more limited in scope and doesn’t have the long-term federal recovery programs that can come with a major disaster declaration. Texas also received fire management assistance grants for 22 fires that year, according to FEMA. — In January 2006, President Bush issued a major disaster declaration after at least 450 fires, blamed largely on a long drought, burned across north and west Texas. At the time, Perry wrote the federal government: "Based on these extreme conditions, the magnitude of response required is beyond the resources and capabilities of the state and the affected local governments," according to a January 2006 Fort Worth Star-Telegram news article. Since 1953, Texas has received more major disaster declarations than any other state — 84 — mostly for severe storms, flooding and tornadoes. California, the largest state, has received the second most (78) followed by Oklahoma (68) and Florida (63). Rhode Island has received the least (8). So far, Obama has issued one major disaster declaration for Texas — in August 2010, for Hurricane Alex, according to FEMA. Before that, President George W. Bush issued two major disaster declarations after hurricanes hit the state in July and September 2008. Carney correctly summed up the Obama administration’s approval of fire-fighting grants for Texas but he glosses over its denial of the disaster declaration, which could have covered more counties and provided retroactive assistance. We rate his statement as Mostly True.	None	Jay Carney	None	None	None	2011-05-30T06:00:00	2011-05-10	['Texas', 'Presidency_of_Barack_Obama']

pomt-07902	"In the past, President Obama has refused to meet with representatives from Cuban exile organizations."	false	/florida/statements/2011/feb/02/david-rivera/david-rivera-says-obama-ignored-cuban-exile-commun/	U.S. Rep. David Rivera, who has criticized President Barack Obama's loosening of restrictions in policy toward Cuba, blasted the president following a White House reception for new members of Congress in January. Rivera's guest at the reception, former political prisoner Cary Roque, delivered a letter to Obama dated Aug. 25, 2010, that was signed by 26 Cuban exile organizations. The letter asked for a meeting with the president or a member of his administration. The next day, the Miami Republican accused Obama of not doing enough to accommodate Cuban exiles. "In the past," Rivera said in a statement on Jan. 25, 2011, "President Obama has refused to meet with representatives from Cuban exile organizations, so I was proud to take Cary Roque as my guest to the White House last night to help the president put a real human face to the issue of Cuba. I thought it was important to introduce him to someone who knows first-hand what it’s like to be imprisoned and abused by the Castro dictatorship." Before he was elected in November 2008, Obama stressed the need for a new policy approach to Cuba. He also called for the lifting of limits on Cuban Americans who want to visit Cuba or send money to relatives on the island. But had he "refused" to meet with reps from Cuban exile groups, as Rivera alleged? Rivera defined "exile organizations" as the ones that signed Roque's letter, according to his spokeswoman Leslie Veiga. These groups include Consejo por la Libertad de Cuba, Frente Nacional Presidio Politico, Presidio Politico Historico y Casa del Preso and Junta Militar de Veteranos Cubanos. But others interpret "exile organizations" more broadly to include other groups and individuals, too. "I laughed when I read the quote," said Jeff Garcia, a partner at Balsera Communications, a Miami firm that boasts it delivered much of the Hispanic vote to secure an Obama victory. "What David was saying (was that Obama) refuses to meet with his people." We found that Obama has met with various Cuban exile leaders, including Carlos Rodriguez, co-chair of the Cuba Study Group, before he took office January 2009. But maybe Rivera meant meetings with representatives -- or leaders -- from the Cuban exile groups after his January 2009 inauguration. We found one meeting Obama had, on April 15, 2010, with a pair of prominent exiles: Gloria and Emilio Estefan. He met with the celebrity couple at their home on exclusive Star Island as part of a fundraiser for the Democratic Party that raised $2.5 million. Even though the Estefans aren't Democrats, they say they wanted to get the president's ear on Cuba’s human rights record. Gloria Estefan gave Obama letters from dissidents, according to the Miami Herald. (Some Cuban-American exiles assailed the fundraising event because they believe Obama is not tough enough on Cuba.) The couple has a long history in defense of human rights. In October, the Cuban Liberty Council honored the Estefans as "Heroes of Liberty" in downtown Miami. A month before, the couple led a march of tens of thousands in Little Havana for Cuba's Las Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White. Separately, Obama met in October 2010 with Joe Garcia, the former head of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, who helped the administration formulate its travel policy. Garcia, who lost to Rivera in the recent congressional race, and Obama had their heart-to-heart at El Mago De Las Fritas on Calle Ocho. "We talked about Cuba, how to facilitate civil society, how to adjust travel," Garcia said. Garcia and others say Obama has also met with Francisco "Pepe" Hernandez, president of the Cuban America National Foundation. (Obama spoke to an audience of nearly 900 people about the need for a new Cuba policy at a CANF luncheon in 2008.) The leading exile group once opposed travel to Cuba but now supports it. Our efforts to confirm that Hernandez met with Obama were unsuccessful. Three days of calls to CANF weren't returned. A spokeswoman for the White House declined to release details on any other meetings between Obama and Cuban exile leaders. She referred PolitiFact Florida to an online database that lists White House guests. Among the White House guests: Mauricio Claver-Carone, a lawyer who's against increased travel to Cuba and represents Cuba Democracy Public Advocacy. He visited 1600 Pennsylvania on Nov. 12, 2009, according to the database. "It was not to advocate for or against anything," Claver-Carone said. Claver-Carone said he met with a presidential foreign policy adviser, not the president, but couldn't remember his name. Separately, Obama has contacted island dissidents. In November 2009 he personally responded to an e-mail message from Generación Y blogger Yoani Sánchez, telling her that her blog "provides the world a unique window into the realities of daily life in Cuba." Rivera's claim is that "In the past, President Obama has refused to meet with representatives from Cuban exile organizations." Certainly, he has not met with all the many exile groups -- but he clearly has met with some representatives. We think Rivera overstated in claiming no meetings at all, so we rate his claim False.

pomt-07744	"Some of our state's educational administrators joined the feds in seeking to mandate Arabic classes for Texas children."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/feb/28/chuck-norris/chuck-norris-says-school-districts-and-federal-gov/	Walker, Texas Ranger, is taking on a twist in Texas education. In an opinion column posted Feb. 14 on the conservative website World Net Daily, actor Chuck Norris laments that just "this past week, some of our state's educational administrators joined the feds in seeking to mandate Arabic classes for Texas children. No joke!" Risking a roundhouse kick, we decided to check. We couldn’t reach Norris, but his column claims that an "Arabic studies program, funded by a five-year, $1.3 million Foreign Language Assistance Program federal grant, was to begin this semester at Cross Timbers Intermediate School in Mansfield School District" and be expanded later at neighboring schools in the district, about 20 miles southeast of Fort Worth. According to a Feb. 8 post on the Mansfield schools’ website, the U.S. Department of Education recently gave the district a five-year, $1.3 million Foreign Language Assistance Program (FLAP) grant to incorporate Arabic into the curriculum. Mansfield was one of five U.S. school districts — and the only Texas one — to receive that grant, according to the district website and a July U.S. Department of Education chart. The federal education department didn’t respond to our queries, but we found a description of the program on the agency’s website that says it gives grants to local education agencies "to establish, improve or expand innovative foreign language programs for elementary and secondary school students." A 2007 agency brochure says: "Consistent with the principle of local flexibility under No Child Left Behind, FLAP permits schools and states to choose instructional approaches that best meet local needs." According to the brochure, President George W. Bush established the National Security Language Initiative in 2006 to "dramatically increase the number of Americans learning critical foreign languages through new and expanded programs." A 9/11 Commission report issued in 2004 says that the government’s counter-terrorism plan had failed, in part, because "the FBI did not dedicate sufficient resources to the surveillance and translation needs of counter-terrorism agents. The agency lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and other key languages." "The district applied for this grant because the Arabic language is listed by the federal government as a critical language," according to the district’s website. "This means that our country has a shortage of Arabic speakers and there is a need for people who are not only proficient in the Arabic language, but also possess knowledge about its cultures and traditions." In bold type, the web entry says: "There are no ‘mandatory Arabic classes,’ as being falsely reported in the media." Richie Escovedo, a Mansfield district spokesman, called Norris’ claim "highly misleading." He told us that after the district informed the school board about the grant in December, it backed off its plans to implement the program after parents, among others, raised concerns about the curriculum. Republican state Rep. Dan Flynn, for example, said in a Feb. 14 op-ed criticizing the school district’s plans that "the ‘culture’ of the Arab world is inseparable from the religious component because it does not respect secular government and never has. … So, if schools want to teach Islam as a ‘culture’ then I want my constituents to be able to teach Christianity as a culture since the United States was founded on Judeo-Christian principles." And the Johnson County Republican Party passed a resolution condemning the district’s plans, according to a Feb. 13 news article in the Cleburne Times-Review. In it, party chairman Henry Teich is quoted as saying: "The purpose in passing this resolution is that there is a decided effort to suppress the history of our own country. Now, we’re teaching everything but English." Before the district backed off its plans, elements of Arabic would be incorporated into other elementary and middle school classes the state requires, like English, math and social studies, Escovedo said. If students were studying fractions, for example, they might learn that "the early ages of algebra came from the Arabic culture," he said. "But they still go on with the mathematics lesson of the day." High school and middle school students will be able to take Arabic language classes as an elective, he said. According to a Frequently Asked Questions page we found on the school district’s website about the Arabic-language studies planned for Cross Timbers Intermediate School, all students "would receive an average of 20 minutes per day of Arabic language and culture through social studies classes, advisory once a week and intermittently in electives such as technology applications, art and P.E." Escovedo said "none of the curriculum was set" when the district decided Feb. 7 to delay the program’s implementation. On Feb. 18, the school district issued a press release announcing that all Arabic instruction would be optional. Starting next school year, T.A. Howard Middle School will offer Arabic as an elective foreign-language class for seventh-graders and an Arabic language class for high-school credit for eighth-graders. At least one other Texas district has plans to offer Arabic. According to a Feb. 20 Fort Worth Star-Telegram news article, the Hurst-Euless-Bedford district will offer language classes this fall. According to the Texas Education Agency, less than one-half percent were enrolled in Arabic classes last year, the article says. So, a district is planning to implement an Arabic language program using federal funds — and before it backed off its plan, the district was going to introduce elements of Arabic into everyday curriculum. We found no evidence, though, that any students in any district was going to be required to take Arabic classes. Nor does there appear to be proof that federal and school district officials are teaming up to impose that mandate on students in general. Still, Norris’ statement contains an element of truth. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11922	"Job creation fell by 70 percent in Wisconsin in 2016" under Scott Walker.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/18/tony-evers/jobs-have-grown-under-gop-gov-scott-walker-democra/	In a video posted Oct. 4, 2017 in his run for governor, Tony Evers repeatedly cites Gov. Scott Walker’s failed 250,000 jobs promise -- then hits him with a new attack. Midway into the video, an unidentified TV anchor says this in introducing a news story: "Job creation in the state fell by an astounding 70 percent last year to the lowest level since Gov. Scott Walker took office." After another reference to Walker’s jobs promise, from his first campaign for governor in 2010, the video replays the audio of the anchor’s words and then these words appear on the screen: "Job creation fell by 70% in Wisconsin in 2016." To be clear, the number of private-sector jobs in Wisconsin has increased each year Walker has been in office. But Evers refers to the most recent annual figure that measures how fast jobs are growing. Let’s see if he’s correct. The promise and the race Walker promised to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his first term. Our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks the Republican’s campaign promises, rated that pledge Promise Broken. The tally had reached only 130,000 by January 2015. We also rated rated as True a claim that as of June 2017, Walker still was short, as the job total had reached about 180,000 at that point in his tenure. Nevertheless, Walker survived a recall election in 2012, won re-election in 2014 and -- though he has pushed off a formal announcement of his intentions -- is widely expected to seek a third term. Meanwhile, Evers, the state school superintendent since 2009, is among a half-dozen Democrats with active campaigns who hope to win the August 2018 primary and compete in the November 2018 general election. Evers’ evidence To back Evers’ claim, his campaign provided us video of the full TV news story, which was aired in May 2017 on WKOW in Madison. The story said the increase in private-sector jobs in Wisconsin in 2016 was 70 percent lower than the increase in 2015, and that the figure was based on data given to the station by Walker’s administration. The original source of the data was the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. We asked Walker’s campaign organization for a response and were referred to Wisconsin Republican Party spokesman Alec Zimmerman. He cited a June 2017 opinion article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel by a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, which called Wisconsin’s job growth over six years "extraordinarily strong," and told us: For someone to talk about Wisconsin’s job growth while leaving out the fact that the state is exceeding what most economists consider to be full employment, not only ignores a critical factors but gives a very skewed impression of Wisconsin’s economy ….We aren't talking about job losses. This is about slower gains, and gains that are slower because we are at or near full employment, a good thing. Quarterly figures The federal quarterly figures are considered the gold standard for job counts. Although the claim we’re checking focuses on the change in 2016, the Evers video also alludes to Walker’s entire tenure. So, for perspective, we’ll show the annual figures for private-sector job growth for each year since Walker took office in January 2011 (percentages are rounded). Year Annual increase in private- sector jobs in Wisconsin Percentage change in private-sector job growth vs the previous year 2010 33,658 --- 2011 29,800 -11% 2012 33,872 +14% 2013 29,723 -12% 2014 36,758 +24% 2015 38,077 +4% 2016 12,937 -66% So, for 2011 through 2015, the number of private-sector jobs rose by roughly 30,000 to 38,000 per year. But in 2016, the increase was 66 percent lower than the increase in 2015 -- nearly the 70 percent figure Evers claimed. While Evers doesn’t directly blame Walker, his video is an attack that clearly holds Walker at least partly responsible. We’ve reported in many fact checks that according to economists, a governor plays an important, but limited, role in a state’s economy, given that many factors are at play. As for what happened in 2016, Milwaukee-area economist Brian Jacobsen told us that nationwide, the growth in private-sector jobs was 29 percent lower than the growth in 2015. He said manufacturing-heavy states such as Wisconsin lagged more, but that the pace of job growth in Wisconsin has picked up in 2017. Andrew Reschovsky, a professor emeritus of applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us Evers’ statement is technically accurate. But he said it could be stated in a more "transparent" way, such as: "The rate of private-sector job creation in Wisconsin was 66 percent lower in 2016 than in 2015" under Walker. Our rating Evers says: "Job creation fell by 70 percent in Wisconsin in 2016" under Walker. He’s essentially on target in that the one-year growth in private-sector jobs in 2016 was 66 percent lower than the growth in 2015 (13,000 jobs versus 38,000 jobs) -- though it’s important to note that private-sector jobs have increased each year during Walker’s tenure, but much more slowly in 2016. Where clarification is needed is that Walker’s performance is only one of many factors affecting job growth. We rate Evers’ statement Mostly True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tony Evers	None	None	None	2017-10-18T05:00:00	2017-10-04	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']

pomt-03386	"We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jul/08/tony-perkins/wedding-vendors-have-been-forced-participate-same-/	Let’s step away for a moment from the political implications of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage and fast-forward straight to the wedding day: What does it mean for those who make the white-tiered frosted wedding cake, arrange the bouquet tossed by the bride, or snap the "I Do" pics? Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, said on CBS’ Face the Nation a few days after the ruling that such wedding vendors have already been "forced" to serve same-sex couples. "We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail. I can't think of anything that's more un-American than that. ... " Host Bob Schieffer responded: "How is it that bakers and florists are being forced to participate in this? I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here." Perkins replied: "Well, we're seeing in Washington state, Colorado, and some of the other states that have these anti-discrimination statutes that are being imposed, that when a same-sex couple comes and says, ‘I want you to take pictures of my wedding,’ or ‘I want you to bake a cake.’ And they say, ‘Look, my religious convictions will not allow me participate in that,’ they're literally being sued by the government, not the individuals, and they've even been adjudicated in such places as New Mexico. So we're going to see a loss of religious freedom. There is no question about it. It's already happening." Have there been bakers who have laid down their wire whisks and refused to bake a cake for a gay couple and hauled off to jail? A florist nervously piecing together a floral arrangement under the threat of a cop? We decided to investigate. State anti-discrimination laws used in some legal challenges In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the Defense of Marriage Act that bars federal benefits for married same-sex couples, and it dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California’s law that banned gay marriage. The Prop 8 ruling means that same-sex couples in California can now get married again, but neither ruling makes gay marriage legal in every state -- currently 12 states allow gay marriages. While same-sex marriage laws can include exemptions for religious clergy who don’t want to officiate such unions, there aren’t typically exemptions for wedding vendors. So it’s possible for gay couples to take legal action against wedding vendors who refused to serve them if there are state or local anti-discrimination laws in place that include sexual orientation. About 21 states have such, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for gay rights. (Florida isn’t one of them, although some counties or cities have such laws.) "These nondiscrimination laws say you cannot refuse to serve a couple because of sexual orientation," said Sarah Warbelow, an attorney and state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign. "If you are a photographer and a same-sex couple comes to you and says we want to employ you, the photographer for whatever event -- whether it's a marriage ceremony, commitment ceremony or whether it’s a birthday party -- the laws of those states state you cannot refuse them on basis of sexual orientation." Each state can have their own process and penalties -- the ones we reviewed are generally heard before a civil rights or human rights commission. It’s theoretically possible a vendor who lost such a lawsuit could face jail if they refused to comply with the order, but Warbelow said, "I’ve never heard of anyone actually going to jail." Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado The Family Research Council directed us to multiple cases, including one particular case that they argue includes the threat of jail: Masterpiece Cakeshop. In 2012, a gay couple visited the suburban Denver shop in search of a cake for a Colorado celebration following their Massachusetts wedding. After the cake shop refused, the ACLU initiated a complaint on behalf of the two men. The Colorado attorney general’s office later filed a formal complaint which will be heard before the state’s civil rights commission in September. The owner has said, "We would close down the bakery before we would compromise our beliefs." The cake shop’s lawyer, Nicolle Martin, has said if the owner loses he could face up to a year in jail. In the meantime, though, the Colorado Legislature has taken action to repeal the criminal penalties for discrimination in places of public accommodations, which had included up to a year in jail and/or a $300 fine. The provision had never been used, and the repeal coincided with legislators passing a civil unions bill. We reached bill co-sponsor state Sen. Pat Steadman, D-Denver, who told us that the repeal officially goes into effect in August, and he didn’t believe that a prosecutor would use that part of the law in the last month that it remains on the books. "A D.A. has to choose to file misdemeanor charges," Steadman said. "It never happened. It never will." However, since the Masterpiece Cakeshop incident occurred in 2012, Martin said it’s still possible that the law on the books at the time -- which did include jail -- would apply. "I have received no assurances from the state of Colorado that no prosecution will be pursued even in light of this recent repeal," Martin told PolitiFact. We checked with both the Colorado attorney general and the local district attorney; no criminal charges are pending. Even if no one has been jailed so far, the threat remains, said Ken Klukowski, a senior fellow for religious liberty at the FRC. "It is no comfort to a person of faith to cite the frequency a person is criminally prosecuted and put behind bars especially in a rapidly changing legal environment ...," he said. "The threat of prosecution has a chilling effect on people's behavior." Completed cases in Vermont and New Jersey Of the other cases related to wedding vendors cited by Perkins, only a couple have reached a conclusion. The Wildflower Inn in Vermont told a lesbian couple in 2010 that the inn didn't host "gay receptions" because of the owners' "personal feelings." After a lawsuit, it agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, to place $20,000 in a charitable trust and to stop hosting weddings -- whether the couple is gay or straight. The director of the Vermont Human Rights Commission told PolitiFact that the inn has paid the first half of the fine and the second half is due in September. The owners didn’t face jail based on the complaint itself. However, under Vermont law, failure to pay a fine can lead to a civil contempt action. "This is no different than any other defendant who has a judgment against him/her and refuses to pay," director Karen Richards told PolitiFact in an email. "As a practical matter, most unpaid judgments do not result in contempt proceedings, nor do they result in incarceration, except in very extreme cases, such as child support cases, where the party clearly has the money and is basically thumbing its nose at the court. I am not aware of any case in Vermont that resulted in a jail time for a defendant in any type of discrimination case." In New Jersey, the Methodist Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association refused to allow a lesbian couple to hold a ceremony at its boardwalk pavilion in 2007. The New Jersey Division on Civil Rights ruled in 2012 that the association, which gets a tax exemption, must cease and desist violating the law but did not impose a fine or other penalty. The association stopped renting out the pavilion for marriages, an attorney who represented the association during the legal battle told PolitiFact. New Jersey can impose a fine of up to $10,000 for a first offense. A provision of the law states that anyone violating an order as a result of a legal challenge could face up to a year in jail or a fine. "However, no attorney I've spoken with here is aware of this provision ever having been used to prosecute anyone, and there are no reported cases of it," Lee Moore, a spokesman for the state's Department of Law and Public Safety, told PolitiFact. Pending cases One case we reviewed received considerable publicity but ultimately went nowhere. In Oregon, a TV news station reported that Sweet Cakes by Melissa co-owner Aaron Klein allegedly told a lesbian couple that "they were abominations to the Lord" and refused to fill the order. Klein told the media he didn’t use that phrase, and that after the publicity he received death threats and his wedding business fell by half. The couple contacted the attorney general, who determined it would fall under the jurisdiction of the state’s Bureau of Labor and Industries. A spokesman for the bureau told PolitiFact the couple didn’t file their case with the agency, and we couldn’t find any evidence that the case was re-filed elsewhere. New York’s human rights law includes a provision that a person can be sent to jail for up to a year if they refuse to comply with an order. But we could not find any evidence that anyone had been sent to jail. A case against the Liberty Ridge Farm, a New York wedding venue that refused to host a wedding for a lesbian couple, remains pending. Lisa Hardaway, spokeswoman for Lambda Legal in New York, said she had never heard of jail time in such a case. "This is an extreme scare tactic by opponents of equality for LGBT folks," she told PolitiFact in an email. "It's a good talking point but not real." Other cases that remain pending are in Washington state and New Mexico, where a photographer’s case is before the state Supreme Court. Our ruling After the Supreme Court rulings about gay marriage, Perkins said, "We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail." We didn't find cases where people were forced to participate against their will. However, if vendors refuse service, there are consequences. There are 21 states that forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation. Vendors who refuse service there could face legal actions and fines. The "jail" part of Perkins’ claim is an exaggeration. We couldn’t find any evidence that a vendor had been sent to jail or that any legal authority had threatened jail time. In some states, if a business owner loses an anti-discrimination case and refuses to comply with an order, the owner could face jail, but we found no evidence of that ever happening. One state, Colorado, specifically took action to remove the threat of jail. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10981	Says associates of financier Bill Browder "sent a huge amount of money, over $400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/16/vladimir-putin/putins-pants-fire-claim-about-400-million-donation/	Russian President Vladimir Putin offered a novel idea to advance the Russia investigation during a joint news conference with President Donald Trump in Helsinki. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team could come to his country, Putin said, if Russian investigators were allowed to go the United States to dig into alleged tax evasion by American-born financier Bill Browder and his associates. "Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over 1.5 billion dollars in Russia," Putin said through a translator. "They never paid any taxes." Putin continued. "They sent a huge amount of money, over 400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton," he said. "Well, that’s their personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal." Did Browder's associates send $400 million to Hillary Clinton's campaign? No. We found $17,700 donated to Clinton and another $297,000 to the Democratic National Committee. A little background The Russians say that Browder and his partners at Ziff Brothers Investments, a New York venture capital firm, illegally syphoned billions of rubles out of the country. To add salt to the wound, Browder had led the charge to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, a law that penalizes Russian officials suspected of sanctioning the death of Browder’s lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison. The Ziff brothers came up during the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and others, and Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on the Hillary Clinton campaign. According to transcripts from Senate Judiciary Committee interviews, Veselnitskaya’s materials described the Ziffs as Democratic donors, although Trump’s son said they gave both to Democrats and Republicans. Follow the money We reached out to the Russian Embassy and the Russian consulate in Washington to get details on the $400 million donation and had not heard back in time for our deadline. Given that Veselnitskaya tied Browder and the Ziff brothers together, we researched their political donations. Browder became a British citizen and can’t legally contribute to U.S. candidates. Ziff Brothers Investments through its executives can give freely, and they have. Before we get into their political contributions, we also wondered if Putin could have been talking about money that went to the Clinton Foundation. In past years, Browder and Ziff Brothers Investments had given to the Clinton Global Initiative, a project of the Clinton Foundation, but the total was not more than $110,000, records show. In the 2016 election cycle, Ziff Brothers Investments gave $1.7 million. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, nearly two-thirds, or about $1.1 million, went to Democratic committees, and the rest to Republicans. The center listed the firm’s top recipients: Recipient Amount DNC Services Corp $296,966 Senate Majority PAC $250,000 Defending Main Street $200,000 Democratic Senatorial Campaign Cmte $40,000 Democratic State Central Cmte/Louisiana $35,412 National Republican Congressional Cmte $32,400 Democratic Party of Montana $28,622 Democratic Executive Cmte of Florida $27,287 Democratic Party of New Hampshire $27,287 Democratic Party of Virginia $27,287 Democratic Party of Wisconsin $27,287 Georgia Federal Elections Cmte $27,287 Federal law puts tighter limits on contributions to individual candidates. Here, the Ziffs mainly put their money into incumbents, and Republicans did better by a margin of about $145,000 to $46,000. Clinton’s campaign received $17,700. Unless Putin had other Browder associates in mind, his figure of $400 million going to the Clinton campaign is a massive exaggeration. Between the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, the Ziffs gave about $315,000. The Clinton campaign raised $563 million overall, so Putin's sum would account for nearly three-fourths of all donations. (PACs affiliated with Clinton's campaign raised an additional $231 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.) Our ruling Putin said associates of Bill Browder gave $400 million to the Clinton campaign. The associates appear to be the Ziff brothers. According to public data, Ziff Brothers Investments gave about $315,000 to Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. Overall, the firm gave about $1.1 million to Democratic committees around the country. The exaggeration is so great, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06891	In Europe, "church attendance rates (are) in the single digits" because churches are supported by taxes.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/27/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-church-attendance-single-digits/	Rick Santorum often says on the campaign trail that liberty -- economic and spiritual -- has made America great. But Europe isn't so fortunate. "Look at every other country from which we came and almost every one, if not every one, are dead from a faith perspective," the former U.S. senator, R-Penn., said at a Henniker, N.H., house party on July 18, 2011. "You go to Europe, church attendance rates in the single digits -- secular society. Why? Because the government co-opted faith, because faith and the government are intertwined. (People in Europe) pay taxes -- you don’t tithe to your church -- you pay taxes to support your church, and they’ve been co-opted to the point where the two are unrecognizable as far as of difference, and so people have lost faith." There's a lot to unpack here. But let’s start with his claim about church attendance rates: Do Europeans attend church, on a percentage basis, in the single digits? When we asked Santorum’s campaign for its source on this, we were pointed to news articles dating back to 2005 and a European Social Survey conducted in 2008 and 2009. All detail declining church attendance, but none indicate single-digit rates continent-wide. In fact, Santorum’s back-up material largely reaffirms the view of the experts on European worship patterns we consulted, who say Santorum is exaggerating. "Europe as a whole, compared to the United States is much less religious, but there are great differences between European countries," says Peter Berger, Director of the Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs at Boston University. Ronald Inglehart, a political scientist at the University of Michigan and chairman of the Stockholm-based World Values Survey, which collects public input in religious practices in more than 100 countries, said Santorum is correct to a point. England, France, and the Scandinavian countries, do indeed have attendance rates in the single digits. "But Italy has about 39 percent church attendance; Ireland has about 65 percent; Portugal 30; Spain 20; Germany 15. So, single digits are actually fairly rare." And what about about Santorum’s other main contention: that European countries that collect a so-called "church tax" or earmark public money for churches, are less religious? Let’s recall the candidate’s exact words: People in Europe "pay taxes to support your church, and they’ve been co-opted to the point where the two are unrecognizable in terms of difference and so people have lost faith." As sources, the Santorum campaign cited an unusual pair: French historian Alexis deTocqueville, who died in 1859, and Santorum’s 2012 GOP-rival Mitt Romney. Both men have argued -- 178 years apart -- that America is better off for not having a state religion. But neither prove Santorum’s claim that directing tax dollars to churches drives down attendance levels in 2011. "I think he’s not terribly well-informed," said Inglehart of the World Values Survey, "He is stretching." Indeed, some churches get tax support and still have high attendance rates, according to World Values Survey: Italy directs tax dollars to churches and attendance levels there stand at 39 percent, roughly on par with the U.S. Germany and Austria levy "church taxes" and have rates of church attendance around 15 percent. Finland and Iceland also collect taxes for religious use, and their churchgoing rates stand at around 4 percent. Berger examined this question in his book Religious America, Secular Europe? He says that in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Europe saw instances when political tensions led to dissatisfaction with a state church. But Berger says Santorum misses the mark when he suggests that government-church relations are driving contemporary worship trends. "He is distorting things. To talk about Europe today as if it were Europe 200 years ago is not very accurate." Our Ruling: While Santorum is right that some European countries have church attendance rates that are below 10 percent, we found others that have rates of worship well above the single digits. Santorum’s other claim, that European governments collect taxes and send the money to churches, is also a mixed bag. Santorum is correct when he says some countries assess so-called church taxes. But more importantly to his main point, scholars say they don't see a connection between the taxes and church attendance. Indeed, the rate in Italy is about 39 percent. So we rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2011-07-27T18:14:51	2011-07-18	['Europe']

pomt-06780	Under Gov. Scott Walker, "unemployment is increasing in Wisconsin at twice the rate it is nationally."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/18/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-unemployment-incre/	After employment figures for June 2011 were announced, the Wisconsin Republican Party, among others, declared that over half of the job growth in America occurred in Wisconsin. We graded that statement False, given that the GOP’s math made an apples-to-oranges comparison. Ten days after the Republican Party made its claim, the Wisconsin Democratic Party focused on the other half of the jobs equation: unemployment. The Democrats asserted in an Aug. 1, 2011, news release that "the jobs-killing policies of Scott Walker and his GOP allies in the Senate have put Wisconsin on the top of the heap in unemployment growth. Contrary to Walker's flailing claims about creating jobs, he and his Republican Legislature have actually deepened the pain for Wisconsin's job seekers." Then, citing an opinion column posted the previous day in the Capital Times newspaper of Madison, the party claimed that under Walker, "unemployment is increasing in Wisconsin at twice the rate it is nationally." That line caught our attention. We rated the Republicans wrong on their claim; let’s see about the Democrats. We called and emailed state Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski over two days to see if there was other evidence the party wanted us to consider. He did not respond. The column cited in the Democrats’ news release was written by John Nichols, who is associate editor of the Capital Times and Washington correspondent for The Nation magazine. Both publications have long been known for having a liberal editorial stance. Nichols wrote that unemployment in June 2011 rose by one-tenth of 1 percent nationally and two-tenths of 1 percent in Wisconsin. "That’s twice the rate of increase at the national level," he said. Besides the state Democratic Party, Democratic Underground, the pro-labor group Solidarity Wisconsin and RecallScottWalker.com also cited Nichols’ column. We checked the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report that compared May 2011 and June 2011 unemployment rates and found that Nichols was correct: the U.S. rate rose 0.1 percentage point to 9.2 percent and the Wisconsin rate rose by twice that amount, 0.2 percentage points, to 7.4 percent. But the state party’s claim was that under Walker, "unemployment is increasing in Wisconsin at twice the rate it is nationally." That sets not a one-month measuring stick, but a much longer one. Here’s a look at the U.S. and Wisconsin monthly unemployment rates from January, when Walker took office, through June of 2011. January: U.S. -- 9.0 percent ; Wisconsin -- 7.4 percent February: U.S. -- 8.9 percent ; Wisconsin -- 7.4 percent March: U.S. -- 8.8 percent; Wisconsin -- 7.4 percent April: U.S. -- 9.0 percent ; Wisconsin -- 7.3 percent May: U.S. -- 9.1 percent ; Wisconsin -- 7.4 percent June: U.S. -- 9.2 percent; Wisconsin -- 7.6 percent (The July 2011 figures are scheduled to be released Aug. 19, 2011.) So, the Wisconsin unemployment rate remained unchanged -- at 7.4 percent -- for the first three months of the Walker administration, then it dropped one-tenth of a point in April 2011. The next month, Wisconsin’s rate returned to 7.4 percent, rising by 0.1 percentage point -- the same rate of increase that occurred nationally. In June 2011, as we’ve already established, Wisconsin’s rate rose 0.2 percentage points and the U.S. rate rose 0.1 percentage point. That means Wisconsin’s unemployment rate increased during two of the first six months of the Walker administration, and it rose more than the U.S. rate only one of those times, in June 2011. The figures also show that both the Wisconsin and U.S. unemployment rates were both 0.2 percentage points higher in June 2011 than in January 2011. We asked Jon Peacock, research director of the liberal Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, about the monthly unemployment numbers under Walker. He was aware of the small state and national unemployment rate increases in June 2011. "Taking a really short-term look at things is problematic, especially when you’re looking at unemployment rates -- but also when you’re looking at jobs (growth)," Peacock said. In other words, a one-month change in jobs numbers -- good or bad -- does not a trend make. So, let’s rate the statement. The state Democratic Party said that under Walker, "unemployment is increasing in Wisconsin at twice the rate it is nationally," suggesting a strong upward trend had been established. The state’s unemployment rate did rise by 0.2 percentage points in June 2011, which was double the 0.1 percentage point increase in the U.S. unemployment rate. But this was far from a consistent trend or even a sharp increase. In the first six months of Walker’s administration, the Wisconsin unemployment rate rose more than the U.S. rate only in one month. Moreover, the overall percentage point increase in the state and U.S. rates when compared to January were the same. The Democrats’ claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-14602	"During eight years under Ronald Reagan, African-American median income rose by about $5,000."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/03/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-median-african-american-family-was-5/	CORRECTION, Feb. 4, 2016: After we published this fact-check, a reader wrote us to say that in our original article, we had used the wrong Census Bureau data table to analyze Cruz’s statement and rate it Mostly True. However, using the proper data table, Cruz is actually incorrect, so we have changed the rating to Mostly False. The original article is archived here. During a town hall event at New England College in Henniker, N.H., Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz faced a questioner who asked what he would do for "struggling minorities." Cruz said the key is economic growth, underpinned by a vigorous free-enterprise system. He suggested that his father -- who worked as a dishwasher shortly after emigrating from Cuba to the United States -- would have lost his job if politicians at the time had raised the minimum wage as high as today’s Democrats would like. Cruz pointed to the Reagan years as a golden age for African-American economic advancement. "During eight years under Ronald Reagan," Cruz said, "African-American median income rose by about $5,000. That is real and meaningful transformation." We should note that Cruz was describing the Reagan years as a time of economic growth, not crediting Reagan for a specific policy. So we’ll simply look to see how wages performed. We turned to median income data collected annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. All figures below have been adjusted for inflation. White Black Hispanic Median income, 1980 $51,127 $29,455 $37,355 Median income, 1988 $55,365 $31,562 $39,164 Gain in dollars $4,238 + $2,107 + $1,809 Gain in percent + 8 percent + 7 percent + 5 percent So Cruz is wrong -- the gain in median income for African-Americans under Reagan was a little over $2,000, not $5,000, and the increase was smaller on both a dollar basis and a percentage basis than the increase for whites. It’s also worth noting that Reagan wasn’t the best president for African-American median income in recent history. That crown goes to Bill Clinton -- unlike Reagan, a Democratic president. Between 1992 and 2000, black incomes rose from $31,018 to $40,783 -- a gain of $9,765 and a striking 31 percent increase. Our ruling Cruz said that "during eight years under Ronald Reagan, African-American median income rose by about $5,000." The actual increase was a little over $2,000, and the increase was significantly larger under a subsequent Democratic president, Bill Clinton. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-06307	"(President Barack Obama gave) half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/nov/15/americans-prosperity/solyndra-ad-president-barack-obama-taxpayer-money/	A new TV ad airing in Florida and other states portrays President Barack Obama as a politician who showered millions of taxpayer dollars on "his friends at Solyndra," a once-hot solar company now in bankruptcy court. Americans for Prosperity, a group that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad, which uses news clips and e-mail snippets to support an ominous voiceover: "Wealthy donors with ties to Solyndra give Obama hundreds of thousands of dollars. "What does Obama give them in return? Half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy. But loaned them the money anyway. "And when the government found out that Solyndra couldn't make its payments, the administration changed the terms of the loan to let Solyndra continue taking taxpayer money. "Now, Solyndra's bankrupt, and taxpayers are stuck with the bill. What's worse? The Obama administration has just approved another billion dollars in loans to solar companies who also donated money to Democrats. "Risking billions of taxpayer dollars to help his political donors — is this the change we're supposed to believe in?" We decided to fact-check the ad, focusing on whether the president gave "half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy." Rise and fall of a solar panel company Solyndra, based in Silicon Valley, formed in 2005 with a blockbuster idea: a unique type of solar cell, cylinders that didn't require pricey silicon, which promised to make them cheaper than their rivals. In 2006, the U.S. Department of Energy invited the company to apply for a new loan guarantee program, a program created with the support of a majority of Republicans, who controlled Congress at the time. The company's December 2006 pre-application was enough to vault it into a group of 16 applicants invited to submit full applications in 2007. By early January 2009, Solyndra's file had been reviewed by the department's credit committee and returned with a request for further analysis. On Jan. 15, the loan program office said "due diligence" for the Solyndra loan was scheduled to be complete by March 2009. The money was going to build a gleaming new factory in Fremont, Calif. Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009, and one of his first legislative achievements was a major economic stimulus package. The administration pushed to finish the $535 million loan for Solyndra so it could tout the company as a poster child of the stimulus — construction jobs plus a boost to American green energy. Solyndra got the loan Sept. 3, 2009. As recently as 2010, the company was hailed as a Silicon Valley superstar, ranked a top clean-tech company by the Wall Street Journal and one of the "World's 50 Most Innovative Companies" by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology magazine. But subsidized Chinese solar panels got even cheaper as the price of silicon plummeted — along with Solyndra's chances for becoming profitable. Red flags multiplied by February 2011, and the government restructured the loan to rescue the factory project. Still, Solyndra collapsed spectacularly in August 2011. Factory employees who worked late the night before, as they often did, found their jobs had evaporated the following morning — with no notice and no severance. An FBI raid followed. Solyndra filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 6, 2011. Solyndra had fallen far and fast. Its unique solar cells had once attracted more than $1 billion from private investors. Now taxpayers could lose hundreds of millions of dollars. Friends of Barack? The Americans for Prosperity ad says Obama helped "his friends at Solyndra." So, who owns Solyndra? Four venture capital firms own nearly 70 percent of the company, according to bankruptcy filings. Argonaut Ventures owns the largest stake, with nearly 40 percent, while Madrone Partners own 13 percent. Two others own about 9 percent and 7 percent. Who was the ad talking about? The ad's fine print refers to a Daily Caller article headlined "Bankrupt solar company with fed backing has cozy ties to Obama admin." The story focused on "shareholders and executives" of Solyndra who "fundraised for and donated to the Obama administration to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars." The largest contributor listed in the story: George Kaiser, who raised $50,000 to $100,000 for Obama's campaign. (For a little context, in the big-money world of presidential fundraising, he's among 560 elite fundraisers for Obama, though not in the top tier who gathered upwards of half a million each.) Kaiser, though, is neither a shareholder nor an executive of Solyndra. The Tulsa, Okla., oil billionaire is the donor behind the George Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation focuses on poverty, community health, civic enhancement — and national energy policy. (Its National Energy Policy Institute is "an effort to establish a rational energy policy that will effectively reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.") The foundation, rather than hire an outside financial adviser to handle its investments, does it mostly in-house, through a subsidiary. That subsidiary is Argonaut Ventures, the largest investor in Solyndra. Kaiser isn't on the foundation's board or Argonaut's or Solyndra's. (And for the record, his foundation is unrelated to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on the health care system and national health care reform.) It's important to note here that Kaiser was never in a position to profit from Solyndra — his contributions to his foundation are "irretractable." "He could not withdraw money from the foundation for his private use," said C. Renzi Stone, a spokesman for the foundation. "So that money is there forever. ... The investment in Solyndra would not have benefited Mr. Kaiser personally in any way." A handful of other executives affiliated with Solyndra's management and board donated to the Obama campaign or other Democrats over the years, according to the Daily Caller story. But others didn't reach the level of Kaiser's fundraising — which Stone said could be traced to a single fundraiser at Kaiser's Tulsa home in 2007. Meanwhile, Madrone Partners, which owns more than 10 percent of Solyndra, is an investment vehicle for another family — the Waltons of Walmart fame. While some argue that Walmart is no longer a conservative company that focuses solely on GOP causes, a search of Federal Election Commission records for contributions from people who list Madrone as an employer still shows most cash benefited GOP recipients. General partner Gregory Penner, for example, a Walton in-law, gave primarily to Republicans, such as $5,000 to the Senate Conservatives Fund, $10,000 to the Republican Party of Kentucky and $10,000 to McCain Victory 2008. He also made smaller contributions to a handful of Democrats such as U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. House Republicans investigate The Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee has been investigating since February 2011 how close ties may have been between Solyndra and the Obama administration. Its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held hearings in July, September and October, and has been collecting documents and correspondence, including from the White House. So far, the subcommittee's work has generated more than 85,000 pages of documents, according to the White House. The committee members have pointed to e-mails that show the Obama administration was eager to confirm Solyndra's loan so the president and vice president could tout it as a stimulus success story. "Can you confirm whether there are any issues regarding a closing on Sept. 3 for a Sept. 4 VP event on Solyndra? This implies we will need to wrap up our review/approval by Sept. 1," said one Energy Department e-mail from late August. Other e-mail shows that Steve Mitchell, Argonaut's managing director who also served on Solyndra's board, and Ken Levit, the executive director of the George Kaiser Family Foundation, exchanged messages with George Kaiser about Solyndra and the White House. Kaiser visited Obama's White House at least 16 times to chat about energy policy, according to the Daily Caller and Tulsa World, but the foundation told reporters that Solyndra's loan never came up. Spokesman Stone repeated in November: "To reaffirm our previous public statements, George Kaiser had no discussions with the government regarding the loan to Solyndra." But messages released by House Republicans on Nov. 9, 2011 include this one from Kaiser to Mitchell, copied to Levit: "A couple of weeks ago when Ken and I were visited with a group of administration folks in D.C. who are in charge of the stimulus process (White House, not DOE) and Solyndra came up, every one of them responded simultaneously about their thorough knowledge of the Solyndra story, suggesting it was one of their prime poster children," Kaiser wrote in March 2010. Did they talk about the loan? It's not clear. Meanwhile, in the same batch of e-mails, they discuss that they don't expect to leverage their White House relationships for special treatment. Mitchell noted to Kaiser and Levit, "I think the company is hoping that we have some unnatural relationship that can open bigger doors — I've cautioned them that no one really has those relationships anymore." The path to bankruptcy So did the administration know Solyndra was "on the path to bankruptcy"? The ad suggests that the Energy Department thought Solyndra would run short on cash as it built its new factory but approved the loan anyway, pointing to e-mail messages released by the House subcommittee. Those messages, written in August 2009 as the department was drafting the final loan terms, got into details about the project's "cash balance" and "working capital requirements." The loan guarantee was formally issued on Sept. 3, 2009. House Democrats responded to this idea in September, saying that "a career agency official who served in the Bush administration" had responded to the concern raised on those messages. That official's e-mail, also from August, said that equity investors, who had already pumped over $1 billion into the company, wouldn't let a short-term cash crunch keep Solyndra from finishing its project. And in fact when Solyndra later restructured its Energy Department loan, private investors did throw in $75 million to keep the company on track. (Of course, that's the subject of its own uproar: The terms of the deal put that $75 million loan ahead of taxpayers' investment. House Republicans say that was illegal; Energy Department lawyers had cleared it at the time.) The idea of the loan guarantee program was to push technology from research and development into commercial production — an inherently risky process. Energy Department officials questioned whether Solyndra had the cash to complete its factory project but concluded private investors would continue to bankroll the company. That's rather different from the ad's claim of political favoritism. The sky-high price of high-grade silicon, one of the keys to marketing Solyndra's silicon-free design, dove from almost $1,000 a pound in early 2008 to less than $100 a pound a year later, according to the Los Angeles Times. That left its technology much more expensive than competing flat panels, and paved the way for its struggle to survive. Solyndra argued, the Times reported, that it just needed time to get its prices down. But it never did catch up. Autumn Hanna of Taxpayers for Common Sense has been highly critical of the loan guarantee program since it started in 2005. She noted the program — backed by both Republicans and Democrats over the years — had "too few protections for taxpayers and too little rules governing the decision making." (The Government Accountability Office raised similar concerns in 2008 and 2010.) "This was a recipe for fiscal disaster, and Solyndra will likely be just the tip of the iceberg," she said. Our ruling Solyndra's story is unfinished. FBI and congressional investigations continue, and more information about the loan guarantee program may yet come to light. The TV ad says "(President Barack Obama gave) half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy." Some of this is correct, while some isn't supported by the existing evidence. First, the money wasn't Obama's to give. Solyndra's request predated his administration, and career Energy Department officials handled the deal. Second, e-mails so far don't show an administration pushing through a loan to help Obama's "friends at Solyndra." Rather, it appears the administration asked the Energy Department officials to hurry the regular process, so the administration could burnish its stimulus efforts. Third, while e-mails raised doubts about Solyndra's liquidity as the Energy Department finalized the loan, those questions were answered by an official who argued investors would step in to protect the project — red flags, yes. But awareness in the White House the company would dissolve? No. The government wasn't the only blindsided investor — private investors put up far more, and stand to lose more, than taxpayers. The Solyndra story might be one of the poor design of the Energy Department's loan guarantee program — something the Government Accountability Office has pointed out since 2008. And with the congressional investigation ongoing, we may learn more about the Obama administration's role in the loan program — perhaps better supporting the ad's claims. For now, though, information in the public record does not support the ad's claim that the Obama White House is a pay-to-play cash machine for the politically well-connected. We rate this ad's claim Mostly False.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2011-11-15T12:36:46	2011-11-02	['White_House', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-12089	Says his conviction is "a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/29/joe-arpaio/arpaio-falsely-ties-conviction-obama-administratio/	President Donald Trump’s pardon of convicted former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio drew an immediate tweet of gratitude from the man he spared from a six-month jail term. "Thank you @realdonaldtrump for seeing my conviction for what it is: a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department," Arpaio wrote Aug. 25. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com There is no question that Justice Department officials under President Barack Obama investigated and joined in legal proceedings against Arpaio, but were they driving the court process that led to his conviction on contempt of court? The court record and legal opinion say Arpaio is pointing at the wrong people. A quick recap Arpaio’s path to a guilty verdict began with a 2007 traffic stop in Maricopa County. Under Arpaio, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office used a few tactics to sweep up undocumented immigrants. They targeted places where day laborers came to find work. Deputies would follow the cars and trucks that picked them up and stop them. They had guidelines – called Law Enforcement Agency Response or LEAR – to stop any driver suspected of being in the country illegally. In 2007 Arpaio’s deputies detained Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres for nine hours. Melendres was a Mexican tourist with a valid tourist visa. Melendres sued on the basis of racial profiling. In 2011, federal district Judge G. Murray Snow issued a preliminary injunction, telling Arpaio and his department to stop detaining people without a reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed. Snow has no ties to the Obama administration. He was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2007. Snow followed up with a permanent injunction in 2013. "Any stop or detention based only on a reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country without authorization, without more facts, is not lawful," Snow wrote. Arpaio’s practices, the judge wrote, violated peoples’ constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure and equal protection under law (the fourth and 14th amendments). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals backed up all the key elements of Snow’s ruling in 2015. During this time, Arpaio said in television interviews and statements to the press that he had no intention of changing his tactics. The guilty verdict In 2016, Snow referred Arpaio for investigation of criminal contempt of court. The case went to Judge Susan Bolton on the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Bolton, nominated by President Bill Clinton in 2000, heard testimony for five days. In her ruling, she said there was no question that Snow had issued a clear order, that Arpaio knew about the order and that he "willfully violated the order." "Because the Court finds that Defendant willfully violated an order of the court, it finds Defendant guilty of criminal contempt," Bolton wrote. In his tweet, Arpaio argued that the hand of the Obama administration was at play. That overlooks the role of the courts, said law professor and federal criminal procedure expert Joshua Dressler at Ohio State University. "The matter was entirely in the hands of Judge Bolton," Dressler said. "With or without the Justice Department, the injunction existed." Arpaio’s personal attorney largely agrees. "Judge Snow kicked it off," said Jack Wilenchik. "The government prosecutors could have declined to pursue the case, but then Snow would have brought in a private attorney to prosecute the case. There’s a rule about that." The rule is Rule 42 on criminal contempt in the federal rules of criminal procedure. It says "If the government declines the request, the court must appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt." The original case began with the Melendres suit, and a Bush-appointed judge referred the case for criminal prosecution. Another judge, appointed by Clinton, picked up the case. The Obama Justice Department role Starting in either mid 2008 or early 2009 (there are Justice Department statements giving both dates,) the Justice Department began its own investigation of Arpaio and his deputies. When the sheriff’s office refused to provide documents, the department sued to get them. The parties settled, and in December 2011, the Justice Department reported that it had determined that Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office were violating the Constitution and federal law. The Justice Department sued in 2012 and reached a partial settlement with Sheriff Arpaio and Maricopa County in July 2015. In effect, Arpaio faced two parallel legal challenges: one from the federal government and one from the Melendres case, which morphed into a class-action suit. They overlapped in substance, but were legally separate. In 2015, the Justice Department joined the Melendres case to press Maricopa County to obey the judge’s rulings. However, law professor Mark Osler at the University of St. Thomas said that did not make the department a party to the suit. "Because they weren’t a party in the case, the Justice Department did not have the discretion and power they usually do — the power of controlling the charge," Osler said. "That was in the hands of the judge." Arpaio's attorney faulted the Obama Justice Department for its October 2016 announcement that it would move forward to prosecute Arpaio. "That clearly hurt Sheriff Arpaio’s chances for re-election," Wilenchik said. Trump agrees. At a Aug. 28 news conference he complained that Arpaio had been unfairly treated by the Obama administration specifically related to the election. Our ruling Arpaio said that his conviction for contempt of court was the result of a witch hunt by Obama administration Justice Department holdovers. The actual roots of the complaints that led to Arpaio’s conviction lie outside the Justice Department. A 2007 private lawsuit turned into a class action lawsuit that led a George W. Bush-era federal judge to issue an injunction against Arpaio and his department. Over several years, Arpaio publicly declared that he would not change his ways. The original judge referred Arpaio’s case for criminal prosecution and a Clinton-era judge found him guilty. The record, the law and legal opinion show the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona had control of the process, not Justice Department staff linked to the Obama administration.

pomt-01292	Republicans are "trying to impeach our president."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/30/color-change/gop-trying-impeach-obama-civil-rights-group-says/	In a last-ditch effort to mobilize voters before Election Day, Democrats and their supporters are warning that Republicans will try to impeach President Barack Obama if the GOP wins the Senate. On Oct. 28, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., wrote a fundraising letter for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee claiming that a "Republican House and Senate could go beyond shutting down the government — they could waste months of our lives on impeachment." In the South, a New York Times story noted the progressive civil rights group Color of Change echoed similar sentiments in a racially charged message aimed at minority voters. The organization took the sentiment a step further, saying Republicans are actually moving on impeachment. "Enough! Republicans are targeting our kids, silencing our voices and even trying to impeach our president," a flyer the group sent out in Arkansas said. Color of Change Executive Director Rashad Robinson defended the flyer in a statement to PolitiFact: "Republican leadership has shown an inability to contain the more fervent wing of the party that could never accept the idea of a black president." The impeachment card has proven to be effective for Democratic fundraising in the summer. But is it accurate that Republicans are trying to impeach Obama? There are no official efforts to impeach him and the prospects for impeachment, no matter what happens Tuesday, are very, very dim. However, you can find examples of a number of Republicans talking about it anyway. Understanding impeachment There’s a high bar for impeachment outlined in the Constitution. It’s defined as the act of accusing a nonmilitary federal officer of "treason, bribery, high crimes (or) misdemeanors." The process must begin in the House with the articles of impeachment, i.e. the allegations. The articles require a simple majority to pass. After the House votes on impeachment, the Senate tries the case, hearing testimony and examining evidence, and then it votes. Conviction, which results in removal from office, requires support from two-thirds of the Senate. The House has initiated 60 impeachments in its history, according to the House archives, though only twice has it impeached a president: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was removed from office because their cases did not receive enough "guilty" votes to account for two-thirds of the Senate. We looked at all bills for this Congress and found no member of the House has introduced legislation to initiate impeachment proceedings against Obama. It's worth noting that Republicans have controlled the House since 2011, meaning they've had the numbers to impeach Obama for three years, and no official effort has emerged. If they had attempted impeachment, the Democrat-controlled Senate would almost certainly not have voted to convict Obama. And even if Republicans do well in the elections Tuesday, the rosiest projections would put them well short of the two-thirds vote needed in the Senate to remove Obama from office without Democratic support. Republican leadership In order for impeachment to be a real possibility, it would need support from Republican leaders for the articles of impeachment to get considered — but this support just doesn’t exist. Neither House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell nor Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus have called for impeachment. Boehner has been the most outspoken against impeachment, possibly because the process begins in his chamber. At a July 29 press conference, Boehner said the threat of impeachment was a "scam" launched by Democrats to rally their base. "We have no plans to impeach the president," he said. "We have no future plans." On Oct. 30, spokesman Kevin Smith told PolitiFact, "Boehner has taken impeachment off the table. His stance hasn’t changed." (Boehner has, though, started the process of suing the president over implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but those plans seem to have been put on hold.) Throughout June and July, other prominent establishment Republicans and potential 2016 presidential contenders — such as Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida — spoke out against impeachment. In some cases, Republicans seem to think that impeachment might backfire; it’s widely thought that voters punished Republicans at the ballot box in the 1998 elections for impeaching Clinton. In other cases, Republicans seem to be rejecting the idea of impeachment on the merits. Obama’s actions, while disagreeable to Republicans, have not amounted to an impeachable offense — they do not "rise to the high crime and misdemeanor level" — Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said at a Christian Science Monitor event. The list of Republicans cautioning against impeachment proceedings also includes some strong conservatives, like Reps. Mo Brooks of Alabama and Raul Labrador of Idaho — who said Republicans shouldn't "even be talking about impeachment at this time." Republicans for impeachment That is not to say some Republicans have not discussed impeachment. There are Republicans in strong, red districts who said they favor impeachment and others who say it should be an option. We found about a dozen instances where lawmakers said they are receptive to impeaching Obama. Causes for consideration ranged from the attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi to fears of unilateral executive action on immigration. In May 2013, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said impeachment was "certainly a possibility" and he was "not taking it off the table." Around the same time, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., not-so-subtly hinted, "People may be starting to use the I-word before too long," while Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said that "there isn’t a weekend that hasn’t gone by that someone says to me, ‘Michele, what in the world are you all waiting for in Congress? Why aren’t you impeaching the president?’" Others are more blunt. Reps. Kerry Bentivolio, R-Mich.; Steve Stockman, R-Texas; Paul Brown, R-Ga.; and Randy Weber, R-Texas, all said Obama deserves to be impeached. Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, said impeachment may be necessary but for political purposes consideration should wait until after the November election. Often, the notion of impeachment is raised as a threat if Obama takes certain actions. For example, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, warned in July, "If the president (enacts more executive actions on immigration), we need to bring impeachment hearings immediately before the House of Representatives." In June, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cautioned that if Obama released prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, "There will be people on our side calling for his impeachment." These threats sometimes take the form of legislation. Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., filed a resolution when Obama was weighing military action in Syria that said if a president uses military force without congressional approval it "constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor." Brooks of Alabama authored a bill that would make it impeachable for a president to fail to prevent a fiscal deficit. Impeachment on the campaign trail During the 2014 campaign season, particularly in contested Republican primaries, how a candidate came down on the question of impeachment has at times become a litmus test for their conservative bona fides. Joni Ernst, now the GOP candidate for Senate in Iowa, was pressed on impeachment during a January candidate forum, according to Yahoo! News. Ernst said Obama should face "repercussions" for his (later deemed unlawful) recess appointments, "whether that's removal from office, whether that's impeachment." Similarly, Ryan Zinke, the Republican nominee for Montana’s at-large House seat, was pressed by a primary opponent on whether he would support impeachment. Zinke said he would. "So is impeachment in the cards? Let's hope we have the votes," he said. This is partly pushed by sentiments among many self-identified Republican voters, who at last tally were supportive of impeachment. According to a July CNN poll, 57 percent of Republicans backed impeachment. Overall, 33 percent of Americans favored impeachment, a number in line with polls from 1998 and 2006 when presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively, were two years into their second terms. Our ruling A civil rights group mailer said Republicans are "trying to impeach our president." No members of the current Congress have introduced legislation to impeach Obama, and Republican Party leaders have shut down the possibility. Some Congressional Republicans and candidates have called for Obama’s impeachment. But most of that rhetoric has been isolated to a few members of the party rather than a resounding chorus.

pomt-04287	"Bill Nelson actually voted in favor of higher taxes 272 times."	false	/florida/statements/2012/nov/01/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-bill-nelson-voted-higher-taxes-27/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has repeatedly said that his Senate opponent, Democrat Bill Nelson, voted to raise taxes 150 times. In the home stretch, Mack has now upped the ante in an Oct. 26 fundraising email. The subject line: "We were Wrong." "For months you've heard us say that Bill Nelson has voted in favor of higher taxes over 150 times. As it turns out, we were wrong," the email says. " I hope you'll forgive our mistake. In fact, it turns out Bill Nelson actually voted in favor of higher taxes 272 times. That's right -- Bill Nelson didn't vote for higher taxes over 150 times. He did it 272 times." Mack’s fundraising plea explains that its initial claim included about 157 votes Nelson cast in the Senate starting in 2001. Now the Mack campaign has gone back decades to cite votes that Nelson took while in the Florida House of Representatives (1973-78) and in the U.S. House of Representatives (1979-90). In this fact-check we will explore if Nelson voted for higher taxes 272 times. The Mack campaign sent us a memo showing their list of about 150 tax votes in the Senate, and they also show Nelson’s older votes on their website. We specifically examined the votes that the Mack campaign identified as the most significant while Nelson was in the U.S. House. Budget resolutions In August, we fact-checked Mack’s claim that Nelson "voted to raise our taxes 150 times" and ruled that claim False. We will recap our research from that item and update our analysis, including addressing new arguments made to us by the Mack campaign. (Read our original fact-check.) About half of the votes on that earlier 150-vote list were Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law. Mack researcher Gary Maloney said that these resolutions should count as Nelson votes for higher taxes because they are instructions to committees about what bills to pass concerning spending and taxes. He pointed to a Congressional Research Service article that explains that a budget resolution is an agreement between the House and Senate about the federal budget, and that legislation must be consistent with resolutions. "After Congress works a change in taxes or spending into a budget resolution, the next step is to pass bills that conform tax and spending laws to enforce the budget," he said. "Each budget assumes set amounts of spending and revenue in a given year." We sent Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a copy of our earlier fact-check and our disputes with Mack whether to count budget resolutions as votes for higher taxes. Ellis told us that the budget resolution issue is tricky. "It is relatively non-binding as you indicate," Ellis said in an email. "Especially if there is no final concurrent budget resolution. The only time it becomes binding is if they do budget reconciliation, which is how the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts got through the Senate. That forces the committee’s hands." Duplicative counting Mack’s tally counts multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Mack cites nine votes Nelson took in 2008 about Congressional Resolution 70, a five-year budget plan. Mack also counted multiple votes on actual legislation. It’s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments. For example, in 2001 Mack counts 15 of Nelson’s votes on H.R. 1836 -- the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. In our view, that counts as one example of Nelson opposing tax cuts -- not 15 examples. The Mack campaign argues that duplicative votes should count because there can be differences in various versions of the same bill, and Nelson could have chosen to change his vote along the way. Maloney said that Mack’s claim was about the number of "votes" -- not about the number of "bills." We also asked Ellis to weigh in on Mack’s argument about duplicative votes. "Counting multiple votes on the same legislation and all of its permutations just serves to pad the number, but in some cases isn’t completely inaccurate, just not telling the full tale," Ellis said. Defining "higher taxes" Which brings us to another point: Is opposing a tax cut the same as "voting to raise our taxes?" as Mack initially said, or, as he says now, "higher taxes"? This note by the Mack campaign about Nelson’s U.S. Senate votes explains how the campaign defined higher taxes: "The votes in this tally are votes against tax cuts as well as votes to raise taxes, votes in favor of reducing proposed tax cuts, votes for non-binding resolutions supporting taxes, votes to eliminate particular tax cut provisions while retaining others, etc. Because of this, the language must be votes ‘in favor of higher taxes’ to be accurate. Be aware that in certain instances in the votes below, a majority of Republicans voted the way Nelson did. Please also be aware that these votes cannot be characterized in a way that implies that each one would have resulted in a tax increase; this would be inaccurate." Nelson campaign spokesman Dan McLaughlin, who said that Mack used "twisted math," pointed to the last sentence in that note that said that the votes can’t be characterized as a tax increase. Mack’s original list counted several examples of Nelson opposing tax cuts. Some are minor, such as Nelson’s vote to table an amendment to get rid of the medical device tax in 2010. Earlier this year, we sent Mack’s list to a number of experts, including Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. Gordon called Mack’s list "ludicrous." "Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is not voting for a tax increase," he said. "So, I would argue the methodology represents a crazy way to look at this issue." The Mack campaign now argues that a vote against a tax cut is a vote on the side of "higher taxes." For the 272-vote claim, the Mack campaign includes a Nelson vote in the Florida House that maintained the gas tax in 1977. So that legislation kept the status quo -- and the Mack campaign argues that is a vote for "higher taxes" because if he had wanted to get rid of the tax that would be "lower taxes." Again, we turned to Ellis: "That’s fairly clever," Ellis wrote. "Although I guess you could argue that any vote to not cut taxes is a vote for higher taxes, or to not cut them further – regardless of whether it’s a tax vote or not. It’s kind of a slippery slope. So it would be more accurate to say maintain taxes rather than for higher taxes which leaves the listener/reader with an impression that isn’t accurate. Mack’s statement also omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. In 2006 and in 2010, for example, Nelson supported extending tax cuts. This year, he went along with Obama’s plan and voted in July to keep tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000, though he had said he would have preferred keeping the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $1 million. Mack’s new claim includes Nelson’s votes in the Florida House and the U.S. House of Representatives To get to its new number of 272, the Mack campaign now includes Nelson’s votes from 1973 to 1978 in the Florida state House. That list also includes some duplication: for example, there are two votes listed on the same cigarette tax bill in 1973. Some tax votes only applied to a portion of the state’s taxpayers -- for example, one related to a taxing district in the city of Boca Raton. Many of the votes were about fees, and some were obscure or only applied to a slice of residents: registration fees for barbers’ assistants, a fee for golf courses to set up temporary bars, and prestige tags for motorcyclists. Other fees had a bigger effect, such as a 1975 measure which was expected to raise $500,000 in driver’s license fees. The Mack campaign also searched the federal congressional record to obtain information on Nelson’s votes as a congressman and lists about 89 as votes for higher taxes. Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin noted that about 18 of the U.S. House votes cited by Mack were non-binding resolutions. Also, the Mack campaign includes about 38 duplicative votes, in cases when Nelson took between two and six votes on the same bill. The Mack campaign cited several key House votes of Nelson in favor of higher taxes. These included the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 and a significant tax increase in 1990. We confirmed that Nelson did vote in favor of these taxes. An interesting historical note, however, is that Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush signed them into law. Our ruling Mack said that "Bill Nelson actually voted in favor of higher taxes 272 times." After PolitiFact gave Mack a "False" rating for saying that Nelson voted to raise taxes 150 times the Mack campaign has tweaked their message to say Nelson voted in favor of "higher taxes." Mack argues that "higher" taxes aren’t necessarily the same as a tax "increase" -- a vote for the status quo or against a tax cut is choosing a path of "higher" taxes, Mack argues. We find that Mack’s new wording could still leave voters with a false impression. Nelson did take some votes that raised taxes. But Mack grossly inflates the number by counting multiple votes on the same bill, non-binding resolutions and some fees that only affected a slice of the population. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00256	"Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2018/oct/04/renee-hoagenson/hoagenson-partially-right-missouris-poor-road-qual/	Does Missouri have the worst roads in the Midwest? Renee Hoagenson, Democratic candidate for the 4th Congressional District, thinks Missouri lags behind neighboring states in road quality. In an Aug. 28 tweet, Hoagenson claimed that "#Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country." Hoagenson, who’s running against incumbent Republican Vicky Hartzler, argued the Trump administration’s plans to invest in infrastructure depends too much on privatization. Private companies would increase tolls and other costs for Missouri residents, Hoagenson claimed, and don’t create much union work. Experts we talked to agreed Missouri’s roads are severely underfunded. We’ve fact-checked other public officials’ comments about infrastructure quality, so we wanted to see where Missouri’s roads rank, and if they are as bad as Hoagenson says. Lots of road, little revenue Infrastructure experts told us there isn’t necessarily a formula for comparing state road quality. "States vary slightly by how they define their pavement conditions," said Hussain Bahia, director of the Modified Asphalt Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, in an email. We wanted to explore the evidence anyway. Let’s start with Hoagenson’s tweet, which included a graphic listing the percentage of rural roads in poor condition by state, citing the TRIP 2017 Rural Roads Report. Rural roads make up 82 percent of the state’s total but cost less to maintain than major roadways. Hoagenson specified that Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Midwest region contains 12 states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Missouri had a Midwest region high of 21 percent of rural roads in poor condition in the report. Missouri and Washington tied for 11th nationwide. "So it can be derived that we have some of the worst roads in the country," Hoagenson said in an email. The American Society of Civil Engineers issues a national infrastructure report card every four years and assigns letter grades on 16 infrastructure categories, including roads. There are some state-level report cards, but these report cards are based on data compiled by a volunteer state-level committee, which is overseen by a national committee, said Greg DiLoreto, chair of the society’s committee on America’s infrastructure. Not every state has such a committee in place, and DiLoreto made it clear it does not rank categories or states. Missouri received a C- for overall infrastructure in 2018 and a D+ for roads, with 24 percent of the state’s public roads considered to be in poor condition. Wisconsin, which did not receive a letter grade, was the worst in the Midwest, with 27 percent of its public roads in poor condition. Some of the least maintained roads in the nation are in the Northeast: 54 percent of public roads in Rhode Island are in poor condition; Connecticut’s roads are at 57 percent. Wisconsin was the only Midwestern state to edge Missouri in how much it costs motorists to drive on bad roads, also computed by the engineering society. Wisconsin’s figure is an extra $637 per motorist per year. Missouri’s $604 is second-highest in the region. Prompted by Hoagenson, we tried another way of looking at rural road quality: the road maintenance funding ratio. According to the Citizen’s Guide to Transportation, produced by the Missouri Department of Transportation, the state has the seventh-largest road system in the country at 33,856 miles, and it ranks 46th nationally in revenue per mile. To Hoagenson, that’s very lopsided. More roads, less maintenance makes sense as at least one measure, according to William Buttlar, chair of MU’s Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. In 2016, Missouri spent $13,379 per state-controlled mile on road maintenance disbursements and $2,024 on administrative disbursements, according to a report sponsored by the nonprofit, non-partisan Reason Foundation on state highway performance. Maintenance spending was 12th-lowest in the country and administrative spending second-lowest, next to Kentucky. In the Midwest, South Dakota and North Dakota had smaller maintenance disbursements than Missouri. One more measure that Buttlar pointed out was the International Roughness Index. The index measures the impact of a road’s roughness on a vehicle’s suspension; the lower the IRI, the better the road. Missouri’s IRI data show 19.58 percent of roads considered not "good" or "acceptable," the third-highest proportion in the Midwest and the 26th-highest in the country. Our ruling Hoagenson claimed that "Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country." Missouri did not rank worst in the Midwest on metrics we looked at except besides Hoagenson’s chosen graphic. That was only for the state’s rural roads. None of the measures, though, paints a smooth ride for Missouri’s roads. The state ranked near the bottom of the Midwest in nearly all important measures and fell in the bottom half of most rankings nationally. So, Hoagenson has a point that the state’s roads need work. For those reasons, we rate this claim Half-True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Renee Hoagenson	None	None	None	2018-10-04T23:24:59	2018-08-28	['Midwestern_United_States', 'Missouri']

pomt-14614	"A (state) trooper with 10 years on the force is getting $500 a year more than a trooper with 10 minutes on the force."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/feb/01/thomas-garrett-jr/tom-garrett-amiss-virginia-state-trooper-pay/	State Sen. Tom Garrett, R-Buckingham, recently explained why he was the lone Virginia senator to vote against the state budget last year. "Last year, we were the only ‘no’ vote because (Gov.) McAuliffe and leadership on both sides were telling us that we couldn’t fund our core essential functions of government -- public transportation, public education, public safety," Garrett said in a Jan. 11 interview on "The John Fredericks Show," a Portsmouth-based radio program. "There are teachers that are underpaid. A trooper with 10 years on the force is getting $500 a year more than a trooper with 10 minutes on the force, and yet they somehow found money to waste on tents for our state parks." What grabbed our attention here is that a veteran state trooper with a decade of service gets a mere $500 more than a newly badged trooper. We asked Garrett -- who is seeking the seat of retiring U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt, R-5th -- where he got his the information. Kevin Reynolds Jr., the senator’s chief of staff, told us the source is Wayne Huggins, executive director of the Virginia State Police Association, a professional organization that represents troopers. Huggins told us that the relatively flat pay scale of troopers is a "seriously demoralizing" problem that has caused many to leave the state police for better-paying jobs with local law enforcement departments. But he denied telling Garrett that the pay differential between rookies and 10-year veterans was $500. So we decided to figure out exactly what, if any difference, exists. Starting pay Troopers in most parts of the state get a starting salary of $36,207, although troopers patrolling Northern Virginia start at $45,241 due to the high cost of living there, according to figures provided by Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman with the Virginia State Police. But a trooper’s pay doesn’t freeze at that $36,207 level for a decade. As an advertisement on the State Police website notes, a year after graduating from the State Police Training Academy the salary rises to $40,482 annually. So a trooper with 10 years on the force would make almost 12 percent more than a rookie. Huggins said there are two tracks for troopers. One is that they can rise through the ranks and become a supervisor, earning extra salary. The other is to remain a trooper and, with seniority and good performance, try to rise to the ranks of "senior trooper" and "master troopers." These designations also come with a raises, but are only available to those who have been on the force for at least 12 years. Pay compression package Another thing Garrett’s statement misses is that the General Assembly last year took the first step in years to address the pay compression issue for state police. The 2014-2016 budget Garrett opposed contained a $228 salary hike for every year of continuous service as a trooper -- a payment that is only available to those who served at least three years and met performance criteria. That means the 10-year veteran’s salary would be $2,280 more than the 10-minute trooper who didn’t qualify for it. And let’s not forget the 12 percent raise after the rookie year -- worth another $4,175 annually. Our ruling Garrett said "trooper with 10 years on the force is getting $500 a year more than a trooper with 10 minutes on the force." In reality, the veteran trooper got a 12 percent raise after a year on the force. And last year’s budget provides a trooper with a decade on the force an added annual salary increase of $2,280. Altogether, that means a well-performing trooper who has been on the force a decade would earn $6,555 more than a rookie. We’re not weighing in on whether the state adequately pays its veteran troopers. But Garrett is using an inaccurate number to make the point that Virginia falls short. We rate his claim False.

pomt-12567	"For too long, Obamacare has caused high premiums and dismal coverage. ... Under Obamacare premiums in job-based coverage have increased by $3,775"	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/apr/12/vicky-hartzler/rep-hartzler-misses-trend-insurance-premiums/	Ever since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Congressional Republicans have been consistent in their criticism of former President Barack Obama’s health care law. Missouri Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, has been one of the most ardent advocates for repeal, regularly railing against the shortcomings of Obama’s health care law. Ten days before the planned Republican replacement bill was withdrawn, on March 14, Hartzler sent a tweet that said, "For too long, Obamacare has caused high premiums and dismal coverage. It’s hurting Americans all over! We need to #RepealAndReplace!" Accompanying the tweet was an image that read, "Fact: Under Obamacare premiums in job-based coverage have increased by $3,775." We wanted to fact-check Hartzler’s claim. What we found is that while health care premiums in job-based coverage have increased in the amount Hartzler claimed, experts and independent analysis reveal that Obamacare itself is only responsible for a very small percentage of that increase. The vast majority of premium increases, experts said, was due to continually rising health care costs. And, notably, the trend the in increases has markedly slowed. Accurate figures PolitiFact reached out to Hartzler’s spokesperson, Kyle Buckles, and he provided the source of the data: a Kaiser Family Foundation interactive graph published on Sep. 14. Buckles indicated that to arrive at the specific figure of $3,775, they looked at the premium increase for job-based coverage — also known as employer-sponsored coverage — between 2009 and 2015 for families. The difference in cost for those years, though, was greater than the number they cited, at $4,170. The figure from the image that Hartzler tweeted was actually the increase between 2010 and 2015 — Obama signed his health care law in 2010. So, Hartzler is correct in noting that for families the average cost of a premium in job-based coverage increased by $3,775 in Obamacare’s first five years. Impact on premiums In context with her tweet that "Obamacare has caused high premiums," it’s implied that Hartzler is claiming that the the health care law was directly responsible for the $3,775 increase in premiums. But to Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, the correlation between the law and these premium increases is tenuous. "The Affordable Care Act did require that employers provide preventative care services without cost sharing," Blumberg said, "and there were some other small changes, but those changes, the actuaries estimated that at most that would have an impact of 1 or 2 percent on premiums (in job-based coverage)." Blumberg continued, "That difference in premiums between 2010 and today, very little of that is attributable to the Affordable Care Act." Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, in an email agreed that only 1 to 3 percent of the increase could be attributed to the Affordable Care Act between 2010 and 2015. The rest, he said, "would be due to increasing health care costs." Changes in job-based coverage In addition to requiring employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health insurance, the health care law mandated several more changes, most of which came into effect in 2014. (The rule requiring that employers with 50-99 full-time employees offer coverage did not come into effect until Jan. 1, 2016.) Some other notable changes included: > The requirement that dependents under 26 could be covered. > Mandatory minimum coverage, which includes things like preventive services, among other things. > Bans on annual and lifetime dollar limits. > Ban on cost-sharing limits such as copays and deductibles. > Ban on refusing coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. Such changes made it impossible for employers to offer bare minimum coverage without facing penalties. A bigger picture In addition to the fact that the health care law is likely only responsible for 1 or 2 percent of the increase in premiums for employer-sponsored coverage, Hartzler’s numbers fail to take into account that the increase in premiums has actually slowed under the health care law. According to a Kaiser news release included with the interactive graph that Hartzler’s team cited, since 2011, when the Affordable Care Act was first implemented, the average of family premiums in job-based coverage has only increased 20 percent. Between 2006 and 2011 the increase in premium cost in the same coverage was 31 percent. And between 2001 and 2006 it was 63 percent, according to the full report and corresponding data. In the news release, Drew Altman, Kaiser Family Foundation president and CEO, said, "We’re seeing premiums rising at historically slow rates, which helps workers and employers alike." The problem with the decrease in premiums, according to Altman and Kaiser, is that, in part, they have occurred due to increases in deductibles. According to the Kaiser news release: "In 2016, 83 percent of covered workers face a deductible for single coverage, which averages $1,478. That’s up $159... from 2015, and $486... since 2011. The average deductible for workers who face one is higher for workers in small firms (three to 199 employers) than in large firms." Blumberg saw it similarly. "It looks to me very much like the increases — the trends in premiums in recent years — has not been high relative to historic increases in employer-based insurance," she said. So, according to the data available, while family premiums under job-based plans have continued to rise since the law’s implementation, they have done so at a much slower pace than at any point since 1999. Our ruling Hartzler claimed that "Obamacare has caused high premiums and dismal coverage," and that "premiums in job-based coverage have increased by $3,775." Her claim ignores a key finding of the study from which her numbers came: that the increase in premiums is dramatically slowing. She also discounted the fact that experts believe that only 1 to 3 percent of the increase in premium cost was actually attributable to the Affordable Care Act. Due to her misinterpretation of the numbers, we rate Hartzler’s claim Mostly False.	None	Vicky Hartzler	None	None	None	2017-04-12T20:30:13	2017-03-14	['None']

pomt-02287	"If you want out of the individual mandate... all you have to do now is tick off the box that says 'hardship' and you're out."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/04/charles-krauthammer/charles-krauthammer-anyone-can-get-out-individual-/	Individual mandate, schmindividual schmandate. There’s a quick, penalty-free fix for anyone who wants out of Obamacare’s health insurance requirement, says conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer. Just check a box. The one that says "hardship." That’s it, you’re done! There will be no questions, and no consequences. At least, that’s how easy Krauthammer made it sound during his April 1 appearance on The O’Reilly Factor. He and host Bill O’Reilly discussed the Democrats’ changes to the law since it passed in 2010. Krauthammer: "They decide what the law is every Wednesday morning. They've changed it 38 times. The employer mandate is out. Remember the great debate in the country for two years over the individual mandate? "The individual mandate no longer exists. They haven't said so officially, but if you want out of the individual mandate, do you know what you've got to do? "You have to say that this is a hardship. There are hardship exceptions. It means, it was meant to mean, if there's a hurricane or a tornado and you're living out of the back of a pickup truck, you can opt out. All you have to do now is tick off the box that says 'hardship' and you're out." O'Reilly: "Yes, you don't even have to explain it." Krauthammer: "You don't have to explain --" O'Reilly: "And it can be as simple as 'I don't know how to work the computer, so I can't get it.' " Krauthammer: "Right. When you have an anonymous bureaucratic computerized system and then you use the word 'honor system' as the way of describing, you are deliberately misusing the language." O’Reilly: "I think the evidence is overwhelming that you are correct." With an assurance like that from O’Reilly, we thought Krauthammer’s point merited a second look. Is it really so easy to get out of the insurance mandate by claiming a hardship? We know from a previous fact-check that the Internal Revenue Service cannot use the threat of jail time or property seizures to go after people who do not pony up the "shared responsibility payment," or what’s sometimes referred to as the "tax" for not having health insurance even though you can afford it. That fee, which will be collected in 2015 for the filing of 2014 taxes, is 1 percent of annual income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is more expensive. The fee goes up every year. Already, some people are exempt for reasons including religious beliefs, prisoners, Indian tribes, income being below the federal filing level, and undocumented immigrants. The hardship exemption comes in when you don’t fall into those categories but have a reason for not having health insurance and paying the fine. In most cases, it’s because you can’t afford it. Getting one is not as easy as checking a box. Here’s the application from the Health Insurance Marketplace, which spells out 14 categories for the hardship exemption. It also says what form of documentation (hello, proof) you need to attach in order to qualify. Categories that require some form of documentation include being evicted or declaring bankruptcy in the last six months; receiving a shut-off notice from a utility; the death of a loved one; a human or natural disaster caused substantial property damage; racking up unexpected costs taking care of a family member; applying for but not receiving Medicaid because the state of residence did not expand Medicaid access envisioned in the law; and having medical expenses you couldn’t pay in the last two years. There’s also a hardship category for people whose health plans were canceled and they find other options unaffordable. Being homeless or suffering domestic abuse are the only categories that do not require some form of documentation. But then there’s the 14th category: "You experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance." Documentation should be submitted "if possible." Is that the magical "other" category promising safe haven for people who don’t want to pay the insurance penalty? "Exemption 14 is broad, but not open ended," said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University professor who has studied the law. "My understanding is that it is meant to give (Health and Human Services) the discretion to take into account hardships not specifically listed." An unlisted hardship would have to be in the spirit of the other categories, he said, and it would not be permanent, if it’s granted at all. The Department of Health and Human Services will respond within one to two weeks to let someone know if more information is needed, the application says. If the exemption is okayed, the recipient gets a special number to include on his or her tax return. "HHS could certainly deny a hardship exemption if there was insufficient documentation or explanation," Jost said. Gail Wilensky, an expert on the law who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said Krauthammer’s point isn’t that far from the mark, especially since "the administration has shown itself to be extremely 'flexible' when it comes to any type of enforcement or timing thus far." Still, there is some explaining required. There’s a box for applicants to describe how their hardship prevented them from getting health insurance, with exceptions for people turned down for Medicaid and health policy cancellations (which are proven by copies of a denial for Medicaid or notice of cancellation). People who submit hardship exemptions without really needing one should pay special attention to step three of the application. That’s the part where you sign, under penalty of perjury, that your exemption claim is honest. Lying is a crime. "Only people who have a true, factual basis for their claims should be advised to file," said Sara Rosenbaum, George Washington University health and policy professor. Our ruling Krauthammer said people who don’t want to comply with the individual mandate should just "tick off the box that says ‘hardship’ and you're out." He is over-simplifying the process. Included in the hardship exemption application -- because there’s an application, you don’t just check a box on your tax form -- is a 14th category that reads kind of like "other." It’s meant to catch examples of hardship not delineated in the form. Documentation is requested if possible. Again, claiming it doesn’t mean you get it. You apply. And just because you ask does not mean you will receive. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Charles Krauthammer	None	None	None	2014-04-04T10:20:21	2014-04-01	['None']
pomt-11807	"The Texas unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been in 40 years & Texas led the nation last month in new job creation."	false	/texas/statements/2017/nov/16/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-makes-false-claims-about-texas-unemplo/	It’s commonplace for a governor to tout a state’s economy. Still, Greg Abbott of Texas made us wonder when he tweeted in mid-November 2017: "The Texas unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been in 40 years & Texas led the nation last month in new job creation." Abbott, a Republican seeking re-election in 2018, accompanied his tweet with a campaign video of Abbott smiling at business groundbreakings. The ad flashes headlines about companies opening facilities and adding jobs in Texas. Tagline: "And we’re just getting started." We got started fact-checking Abbott’s tweet by asking his office for his backup; we didn’t get a response. In July 2017, Abbott made a Mostly True claim about more Texans having jobs than ever. Yet we noticed that when Abbott tweeted about the state’s jobless rate "last month," October 2017 unemployment rates had yet to be revealed. To get our fix on the latest available data, we fetched Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showing that the state’s impressive 4 percent jobless rate for September 2017 tied the previous record low since 1976. According to the bureau, the state similarly had a 4 percent unemployment rate in November and December 2000, 17 years ago. The state jobless rate in fall 1977, 40 years ago, hovered at 5.2 percent. To our inquiry, a Dallas-based bureau economist, Cheryl Abbot, confirmed our read of monthly seasonally adjusted Texas jobless rates since 1976. Mark J. Perry, who teaches at the University of Michigan-Flint, agreed though Perry, by email, called Abbott’s overstatement on this point "minor." Texas Unemployment Rate (Seasonally Adjusted), 1976-September 2017 SOURCE: Website, "Local Area Unemployment Statistics," Bureau of Labor Statistics, Nov. 16, 2017 (downloaded Nov. 16, 2017) Job gains? By email, the bureau's Abbot showed that Texas didn’t lead the country in job gains for September (again, the latest month of available data). In fact, an October 2017 bureau press release indicates Texas wasn't even among the five states that experienced job gains from August to September 2017. From the release: "The largest increase in employment occurred in California (+52,200), followed by Washington (+13,800) and Indiana (+11,400). The states also were described as enjoying statistically significant month-to-month gains. "In percentage terms," the bureau said, "the largest increase occurred in Nebraska (+0.5 percent), followed by Arizona, Indiana, and Washington (+0.4 percent each)." California had a 0.4 percent gain, the release said. According to a more detailed bureau chart we checked in mid-November 2017, Texas saw a 0.1 percent decrease in jobs from August to September 2017 by going from 12,328,400 jobs to 12,321,100 jobs. The chart indicates 30 states fared better month to month though that folds in five states showing no percentage gains (or losses). There’s a more encouraging longer view. The bureau’s release lists Texas among 28 states with over-the-year increases in nonfarm payroll employment from September 2016 to September 2017. The release said: "The largest job gains occurred in California (+280,300), Texas (+256,100), and New York (+93,100)--with the largest percentage gains playing out in Nevada and Utah (+2.5 percent each) followed by Maryland (+2.4 percent)." According to an accompanying chart, Texas and Idaho each saw a 2.1 percent increase in jobs over the year, tying for fourth nationally behind Washington state, which saw a 2.2 percent percentage increase in jobs. Abbot wrote: "As you can see, the largest monthly increase in jobs in September 2017 occurred in California (+52,200). In percentage terms, Nebraska led among the states with a 0.5-percent gain. California also recorded the largest over-the-year increase during this period (280,300), followed by Texas (256,100)." Our ruling Abbott tweeted: "The Texas unemployment rate is now the lowest it’s been in 40 years & Texas led the nation last month in new job creation." The latest unemployment data posted when Abbott spoke showed Texas with a 4 percent unemployment rate in September 2017 though that didn't set a 40-year record. Rather, it tied the previous 40-year low set in two months of 2000. Abbott didn’t provide nor did we find data showing jobs created in each state in October 2017. Federal data otherwise indicate that Texas experienced a slight decrease in jobs from August to September 2017 though the state also was home to more jobs than a year earlier. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, Nov. 17, 2017: Two days after Abbott tweeted his claim about the Texas jobless rate, the federal government reported that the state had a 41-year record low 3.9 percent jobless rate in October 2017.

pomt-01411	Says Scott Brown "co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/10/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shahee-says-scott-brown-backed-measure-let-/	The U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire has been awash in claims about abortion and women’s health issues in recent days. One claim by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen caught our eye. Shaheen is facing a challenge from former Republican Sen. Scott Brown. In a news release from her campaign, Shaheen said: "I have always supported a woman’s right to choose because I know women should be making health care decisions in consultation with their doctors and their families, not their employer. Scott Brown’s record is clear: When it counts, he doesn’t stand up for women’s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms. New Hampshire women can’t trust Scott Brown, and his record is move evidence that he is wrong for New Hampshire." We noticed two claims that are related, but distinct enough to analyze separately. First, would the legislation in question have allowed employers deny women coverage for birth control? And would it have allowed employers to deny coverage for mammograms? We’ll look at the birth control claim here, and mammograms in a separate fact-check. It turns out the two issues differ a good bit. In a different Shaheen campaign news release, the campaign explained its sourcing by writing, "FACT: Scott Brown both co-sponsored and voted for the Blunt Amendment that would let employers deny women access to a range of healthcare services, including contraception and coverage for mammograms." The amendment in question was proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. It was tabled -- that is, dispensed with -- by a 51-48 vote in which a simple majority was required. Among those who voted "nay" -- that is, those who wanted to keep it under consideration -- was Brown, then representing Massachusetts in the Senate. He also co-sponsored a predecessor measure, S.1467, the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act of 2011. So Shaheen’s camp is correct that Brown acted in support of this measure. But what did the amendment say? It acted to widen the scope of acceptable actions for opting out of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on religious or moral grounds. It focuses on mandates within the law for preventive services, called the "essential health benefits package." Specifically, the amendment said employers cannot be required to cover "specific items or services" that are "contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering the plan." We agree with the Shaheen campaign that the provision is drawn broadly. While it’s not targeted at abortion or birth control per se, it is so expansively written that there’s little doubt it could be invoked on behalf of those who oppose abortion and certain types of birth control. As we explained in our other fact check, we find no evidence that anyone has expressed a religious or moral objection to mammograms, so we rated that claim Mostly False. But the case that the Blunt Amendment would have affected access to birth control is stronger. Some opponents of abortion have supported opt-out rights for employers who oppose certain types of birth control that they say work like abortifacients. In fact, this was the issue at the heart of the closely watched 2014 Supreme Court decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby. In that case, a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. The only quibble we have with the phrasing of Shaheen’s claim is that the Blunt Amendment didn’t single out birth control, which is the impression one could easily get from her statement. But since the amendment was written so broadly -- and since birth control has long been at issue for religious or moral reasons -- we don’t see this as a significant problem. Our ruling Shaheen said Brown "co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control." The amendment, which Brown supported, was written loosely enough to allow a religious-conscience opt-out for birth control -- an issue about which there has been a longstanding policy debate on religious and moral grounds. We rate the claim True.	None	Jeanne Shaheen	None	None	None	2014-10-10T11:14:13	2014-09-29	['None']
pomt-12320	"This is not the first time (the Russians) have been involved in our elections."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/jun/20/richard-burr/heres-every-time-russian-or-soviet-spies-tried-int/	Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, is leading a congressional investigation into the Russian intervention to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. And he says this scandal isn’t unique to Trump. "This is not the first time they’ve been involved in our elections," Burr said earlier this month. Burr is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which recently has hosted public, under-oath testimony of some of the Trump administration’s top officials regarding Russian election meddling. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly called allegations of Russian meddling a fictional "witch-hunt" against him, and Russian President Vladimir Putin also denies any interference. Yet the U.S. intelligence community says the Russian government did try to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Independent observers agree, as do members of Congress including Burr. In a claim we fact-checked previously, Burr said his committee’s investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia has led to more transparency than usual. We rated that True. Now, we turn our attention to this claim that last year’s meddling wasn’t anything new. Here’s the full context. A reporter asked Burr what his reaction was to Putin's denial of Russian election meddling. Burr responded: "That there is no truth to Vladimir Putin’s words. That by every judgment to this point, they were aggressively involved in the U.S. elections, Montenegro, France, they are involved in the German upcoming elections. And that this is not the first time they’ve been involved in our elections, and that America needs to have a much more definitive response to them." Most of what Burr mentioned has been widely covered already. But not the last part. So we started digging. Close but no cigar Historians agree that what Burr said probably isn’t literally true. This is the first time (at least as far as the public knows) that Russia attempted to influence a U.S. election in favor of a particular candidate. However, it is a throwback of sorts to the Cold War. "If by ‘they,’ he meant the Russians, he's incorrect," said Mark Kramer, an expert on foreign relations at Harvard University. "But if he meant the Soviet Union, then it is certainly true." And of course, there might be more out there that’s still classified or hasn’t yet been discovered. "Now who knows if Russia didn’t somehow fund one candidate or another," said Frank Costigliola, a history professor at the University of Connecticut. "But it’s unknown." We asked six historians and foreign relations scholars to consider Burr’s claim. Two said they had no idea what he was talking about. The others pointed to a handful of documented (yet relatively unknown) meddling efforts by Soviet leaders. None could identify any Russian meddling attempts. We also asked Burr what he meant. His office pointed us to an intelligence report, published in January, that concluded the Kremlin tried to help Trump and hurt his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Spy games That report is "a declassified version of a highly classified assessment" made using CIA, FBI and NSA intelligence. It said the 2016 Russian meddling was the "boldest yet" in a U.S. election. It said with "high confidence" that Russia was behind the hack and publication of embarrassing emails from the Democratic National Committee, that it hacked into U.S. voting software, and that the Kremlin funded a large pro-Trump, anti-Clinton campaign in the United States using paid social media "trolls" as well as more traditional propaganda outlets. The report didn’t completely back up Burr’s claim. It said the Russians have spied on U.S. presidential candidates before, and have used state-owned propaganda outlets like RT and RT America to cast doubts on the U.S. democratic process. But it listed no previous attempts to actually influence the outcome of an election. In fact, the report said the 2016 meddling "demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations." And while this report made only vague references to Soviet meddling, our interviews uncovered a few instances of Cold War-era attempts to either boost one candidate or harm another. Over the course of 11 presidential elections between the end of World War II and the fall of the Soviet Union, we identified three secret attempts to influence an election. • 1960: Through his ambassador to the United States, Mikhail Menshikov, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev offered Adlai Stevenson help from a secret propaganda campaign. However, Stevenson declined the offer. He lost in the Democratic primary to John F. Kennedy. • 1968: The Soviet Union’s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Dobrynin, offered to secretly fund Hubert Humphrey’s campaign against Richard Nixon. Humphrey declined the bribe. • 1976: Fearing that anti-communist Democrat Henry "Scoop" Jackson stood a good chance at winning in the wake of Nixon’s resignation, the KGB began a smear campaign. Soviet spies forged FBI paperwork to make it appear Jackson was secretly gay and sent the fake reports to newspapers around the United States during the election and for years after. Notably, the past attempts to help a candidate were arranged through the ambassador. And much of the investigation into last year has focused on meetings the current Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, had with key officials on Trump’s team before Trump became president. Some of those meetings allegedly involved former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (who in 2015 took $45,000 from RT), Attorney General Jeff Sessions (who was a top Trump advisor during the campaign) and Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior advisor and son-in-law. Our ruling Burr said that when it comes to Russian spies, "this is not the first time they’ve been involved in our elections." There’s no public evidence the post-Cold War Russian government has ever meddled at anywhere near the levels of 2016, when U.S. officials say the Kremlin tried to help Trump’s campaign. However, during the Cold War there were a few Soviet attempts to hurt or help specific candidates. Yet 2016 was the first time in 40 years the United States is known to have seen this type of interference. Since Burr’s claim has some truth to it but gives an impression that’s slightly misleading, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14278	Says Rick Scott "cut Medicaid" so people can't "get Obamacare."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/06/rick-scotts-starbucks-heckler/starbucks-heckler-claims-rick-scott-cut-medicaid-p/	It starts like a joke — Gov. Rick Scott walks into a Gainesville Starbucks — but one patron wasn’t laughing. In town on April 5, 2016, to tour the recently opened factory and headquarters for biopharmaceutical company Nanotherapeutics, Scott stopped in to the coffee chain for a cup. Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner, saw Scott and ripped into him from her seat. Among other grievances, she accused him of denying her health care coverage with his policies. "In fact, you cut Medicaid so I couldn’t get Obamacare," Jennings shouted on April 5, 2016. "You are an a------! You don’t care about working people. You don’t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here." When Scott countered that the state had created a million jobs since the recession, she said no one cared (read our fact-check on those jobs numbers). She then criticized his March signing of a bill denying funding for women’s health care clinics that performed abortions (read our check about that issue). We tried to reach Jennings by phone, text, email and even Facebook, but we didn’t hear back from her, so we don’t really know the specifics of her situation. That makes it difficult to gauge whether she was able to benefit from the health care law. But we can look at whether Scott cut Medicaid, the joint state and federal program to provide health insurance for the very poor, in a way that could have denied people health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. It’s not so much that he cut anything, but more that he hasn’t consistently supported expanding the program. That has indeed left hundreds of thousands of Floridians without coverage. The expansion debate Jennings told ABC Action News in Tampa after the incident that she is a single mother who worked part-time. That provides clues that she may fall into what is known as the Medicaid coverage gap. To understand why, let’s review how the Affordable Care Act is linked to Medicaid. The law originally wanted to cover uninsured people two different ways. One was to subsidize people who needed help buying insurance through state marketplaces or HealthCare.gov. The second was to expand Medicaid to cover a higher number of poorer people. Normally, to be eligible for Medicaid, your annual income has to be 44 percent of the federal poverty level (100 percent is currently $11,880 for an individual and $24,300 for a family of four). The plan was to extend that eligibility to all adults up to 138 percent of the poverty level. Technically the calculation under the law is 133 percent, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that. But Medicaid expansion ended up being optional after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling saying it could not be forced upon states. Currently 19 states, including Florida, have chosen not to grow the program. Recent estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 948,000 uninsured adults in Florida would be covered by an expansion. This has led to plenty of debate among lawmakers, including a meltdown during the 2015 Florida legislative session over how to cover more lower-income residents. The Senate was open to a limited expansion, while the House opposed it altogether. But now the math really starts to get tricky. If a state doesn’t expand Medicaid, people who make 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level can get marketplace subsidies to buy private insurance. Because of the way the law was written, that leaves people making between 44 and 100 percent of the poverty level out in the cold, without assistance. Those people don’t qualify for Medicaid, and can’t get subsidies to buy insurance. That’s the so-called coverage gap. According to Kaiser, there are 567,000 people under that umbrella in the Sunshine State. Chances are good that a single mother working part time could fit into that definition. Scott, a former hospital chain executive best known for resigning amid controversy over his company defrauding Medicare, has had a spotty history with Medicaid. He initially opposed expanding the program under Obamacare, then supported it during his re-election campaign, then went back to opposing it. We rated his position a Full Flop. While the Legislature is the body that would have to approve an expansion, Scott’s opinion affects the debate. (Scott’s office did not respond to our questions about Medicaid.) He has argued with Washington over the federal government ending payments for low-income hospital patients, leaving the Legislature to use state money to plug holes in the program the last two years. Scott has also asked lawmakers to eliminate automatic increases to Medicaid hospital rates. He’s also overseen the state’s controversial transition to managed care, in which private companies took over Medicaid policies as a cost-cutting measure. Florida CHAIN, a consumer health advocacy group, told us managed care organizations had actually seen a boost in funding. And there’s the aforementioned abortion bill Scott signed on March 25. That bill prevents state and Medicaid money from going to clinics that perform elective abortions, including Planned Parenthood affiliates. But these are specific issues not necessarily related to getting access to broad health care coverage under Obamacare. While many Floridians remain uninsured without Medicaid expansion, we found no evidence of an outright cut, as Jennings said. Our ruling The activist at Starbucks said Rick Scott "cut Medicaid" so people can't "get Obamacare." Her point-blank accusation that Scott cut the program doesn’t fit. But through Scott’s inaction and the Florida House's resistance to expansion, many Floridians are not benefitting from either subsidies to buy private insurance or an expanded Medicaid. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott's Starbucks heckler	None	None	None	2016-04-06T17:11:16	2016-04-05	['None']

pomt-01875	"As Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary, Mary Burke spent $12.5 million dollars to buy a vacant lot for a company that said it had no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin" and had laid off 800 workers.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-ad-says-mary-burke-helped-firm-no-pla/	In his latest TV ad, Gov. Scott Walker rips challenger Mary Burke’s attempt to attract a giant Illinois-based company to add thousands of jobs in Wisconsin when Burke ran the state Commerce Department under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. "As Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary, Mary Burke spent $12.5 million dollars to buy a vacant lot for a company that said it had no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin," the ad says. "In fact, the same company had already laid off over 800 workers when Burke closed the deal." The ad’s kicker: "Mary Burke says she’ll work to create jobs and spend our tax money wisely. But her record as Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary tells a different story." Is Walker right about his likely Democratic opponent in the November 2014 election? Did Burke really authorize an aid package for a company that "said it had no plans to create jobs" here -- after massive layoffs at the firm? The Burke campaign reacted to the ad by saying: "Everyone from local officials to the local chamber of commerce to Walker's own administration agrees that this was and is a good deal from an economic development standpoint. The grant contained strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met or infrastructure was not developed for economic development." Let’s dig into what happened. The ad focuses on a major move by Doyle and Burke in the spring of the 2006 election year. In March 2006, they announced a $12.5 million forgivable loan funded through federal community block grant funds, the largest such award in Commerce Department history. It was to support development of 500 acres acquired in Kenosha County by global pharmaceutical maker Abbott Laboratories Inc. Abbott, a major employer of Wisconsin residents based just 15 miles south of Kenosha County, had purchased parcels of land on the Wisconsin side since June 2005 for possible expansion. Doyle and Burke sought to augment that purchase with another 40 acres paid for with the $12.5 million state award. They and local officials wanted to get the land in order to block plans for a truck stop they thought could impede development in the area. Judging by the comments of Doyle and Burke at the time -- she had "full confidence" 2,400 jobs would result; he welcomed the company to Wisconsin -- you’d have thought Abbott had already announced its expansion in early 2006. But the Journal Sentinel reported Wednesday that not only did no jobs materialize, federal officials in 2013 demanded the money back. Eight years after the 2006 deal, Abbott has not developed the Kenosha County land. Abbott showed interest Did it have "no plans" to create jobs, as the Walker ad claims? In one sense, Abbott clearly had shown an interest in possible expansion in Wisconsin, as evidenced by the land purchases made with its own funds. The possibility was real enough for local officials in Kenosha County to actively work on working on paving the way for the firm. The company paid out $35 million for those parcels. But that solid interest fell short of an actual plan to build and start hiring. (The company, we should note, also signed a development agreement with the Village of Pleasant Prairie to develop that land. But that was a year after Burke’s agency made the award). The company didn’t stand alongside state officials when Doyle announced the loan in 2006. And officials said precious little about their intentions at that time. Here’s a look back: Chicago Tribune story, Feb. 14, 2006: "Abbott has acquired approximately 500 acres of land in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., in anticipation of future growth and expansion," a company spokesman said. "No specific plans are in place at this time for development of the property." Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, March 3, 2006: Abbott spokesman Jonathan Hamilton said the Wisconsin site is for future growth, without any specific plans at this time. Commerce Department newsletter, April 2006: "Abbott has purchased this land in Wisconsin in anticipation of future growth and expansion," said Dale Johnson, the company’s divisional vice president for State Government Affairs. "We are pleased to have worked with the Governor, his staff, the Village of Pleasant Prairie and the Kenosha Area Business Alliance." Those comments made clear the company was preparing for possible expansion in Wisconsin, but had no specific plan at the moment. Feds object One media story, in the Chicago Tribune in February 2006, speculated that Abbott’s Wisconsin land buys might be leverage for the company on various issues it had before Illinois lawmakers. With the uncertain timetable in mind, the Commerce Department’s aid deal was long term. If in 10 years, at least 2,400 jobs were created by Abbott in Wisconsin, the loan -- actually made to the village of Pleasant Prairie, which passed the funds to Abbott -- would not have to be repaid. In theory, that means there is still time to make the expansion happen with help from the loan. But the US Housing and Urban Development office in Milwaukee demanded the $12.3 million back in 2013 saying the development project was ineligible for the block grant dollars the state had used. The reasons the federal agency cited in its decision are relevant to judging whether Abbott stated any plans to create jobs in Wisconsin. A letter from HUD to the state in August 2013 concluded that the Commerce Department had no written commitment from Abbott to develop the property or create jobs. State officials agreed to that deal at the time. The federal agency declared that "Commerce participated in a speculative land banking venture" without ensuring that the funded activity would be eligible. Even years later, "the specific proposed use of the acquired land has not yet been identified," HUD’s Sernorma Mitchell wrote to state Department of Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch. Those comments from HUD help Walker’s case. Finally, the Walker ad also mentions layoffs, citing Chicago newspaper stories. Media in Illinois reported that Abbott cut at least that many jobs in Illinois in 2005 and early 2006. Our rating Walker’s ad said: "As Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary, Mary Burke spent $12.5 million dollars to buy a vacant lot for a company that said it had no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin" and had laid off 800 workers. There’s a hint of mischief in the ad’s language in that it can be heard to mean that Burke was so incompetent she gave money to a firm with zero interest in a Wisconsin operation. That idea is off base. But as we say at PolitiFact, words matter, and the ad’s claim closely mirrors what company officials said at the time of the award. And HUD officials found that even seven years later, no specific use for the land was proposed. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-07954	A national organization says Georgia has one of America’s toughest ethics laws.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/25/joe-wilkinson/ethics-claim-leaves-out-key-detail/	A coalition of government watchdog groups last week demanded changes to toughen Georgia’s ethics guidelines, blasting state lawmakers with fightin’ words like there’s a culture of "low-level corruption" in Georgia government. State Rep. Joe Wilkinson, chairman of the House Ethics Committee, objected to the criticism. He urged patience, noting stronger ethics guidelines just took effect this year. He also pointed out that a national organization ranked Georgia as having one of the toughest ethics laws in the nation, according to a Jan. 20 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. We asked the representative about it. Wilkinson said the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity came up with the ranking on where Georgia stands on ethics. "If I didn’t believe it was true, I wouldn’t have said it," said Wilkinson, a Republican from Fulton County. One PolitiFact Georgia reader was dubious about Wilkinson’s claim. "He told me the same thing personally when I was at the Capitol last year," said Tom Tortorici of Atlanta, who supported tougher ethics legislation. "I didn’t believe him then, and I don’t believe him now. Other states have bans and caps on lobbyists gifts. We don’t." We called the Center for Public Integrity, which puts out investigative reports on public issues. Its media relations manager, Steve Carpinelli, pointed us to a report it released in June 2009 that ranked each state on the transparency of its financial disclosure reports. The center came up with 43 questions it measured the states on. The questions included how often do state elected officials file disclosure reports, and what information are they required to report about their employers, their investments and property. The center also looked at what states have the authority to audit the disclosure reports. Georgia ranked seventh in the 2009 report. Wilkinson compares the rankings to the Bowl Championship Series, the system that decides -- often with controversy -- which college football teams are the best in the nation. But the report looked at only one aspect of ethics regulations, not everything, said William Perry, executive director of Common Cause Georgia. Perry’s group was one of the organizations that joined the call for tougher ethics guidelines. For example, Perry said measuring ethics rules should also include the power of state agencies to regulate on potential conflicts of interest, gifts from lobbyists and contributions from political action committees. Ethics regulations has been a big topic of concern under the Gold Dome in recent years. Glenn Richardson resigned as House speaker in 2009 after his ex-wife accused him of an extramarital affair with a female lobbyist. A few years back, federal prosecutors charged state Sen. Charles Walker with, among other things, using campaign contributions to pay off gambling debts. The former senator is now serving 10 years in prison. The Georgia Legislature last year passed guidelines that prohibit sexual harassment, require many local elected officials to file campaign disclosure reports with the state and make it a crime to use a state agency to attack or harass someone. Rick Thompson, former executive secretary of the State Ethics Commission, argued the Georgia Legislature has passed some bills that are "very stringent" on lobbyists and improved ethics guidelines. "We’re pretty up there with the requirements of disclosures," Thompson said. True, perhaps. The center’s 2009 report supports that viewpoint. But financial disclosures are only one area of ethics guidelines. Carpinelli said the center plans to conduct a state-by-state review of ethics laws, starting this spring. The research will take about a year, Carpinelli estimates. We followed up with Wilkinson about what the center told us. He said financial disclosure is a "major part" of a state’s ethics package. "That’s the heart and soul of ethics," Wilkinson said. Wilkinson would get high marks on the Truth-O-Meter if he had said Georgia has some of the toughest rules on financial disclosures in the nation. That’s correct, but it’s not what he said. Wilkinson’s comments about the Center for Public Integrity’s report may give some people the wrong impression about what the organization was studying. They reviewed financial disclosures, not the entire scope of ethics guidelines. We rate his statement as False.	None	Joe Wilkinson	None	None	None	2011-01-25T06:00:00	2011-01-20	['United_States']
pomt-05008	According to a national survey, transit "ridership" among people age 16 to 34 increased 40 percent between 2001 and 2009.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/18/jeff-dickerson/transportation-tax-supporter-says-transit-ridershi/	Supporters of a tax to improve the region’s roads and transit are asking metro Atlantans to think of the children. A transportation overhaul would create a better Atlanta for generations to come, said Jeff Dickerson, a communications consultant for Citizens for Transportation Mobility, which advocates for the penny-per-dollar sales tax. What’s more, it would create the kind of transportation system younger people want, Dickerson said during an online debate on PBA.org, the website for Atlanta’s public television and National Public Radio stations. "Look at this number from the National Household Travel Survey," Dickerson said. "Between 2001 and 2009 ... ridership among young people age 16 to 34 on transit increased 40 percent over eight years. Increased 40 percent? Sounds like those young whippersnappers aren’t spending much time behind the wheel of Daddy’s T-Bird. The referendum is up for a vote July 31 and would raise $7.2 billion over 10 years to upgrade roads and transit across the region. We called up Dickerson and took a closer look at the data, which comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The National Household Travel Survey tracks how and why people travel. It takes place sporadically. The most recent ones were conducted in 2001 and 2009. In April of this year, the consumer group U.S. PIRG, a federation of state public interest research groups, and Frontier Group, an environmental think tank, issued "Transportation and the New Generation," a report that analyzed data from this and other surveys. We found Dickerson used the correct percentage. The report found that the average number of miles traveled on transit by a person in this age group increased by 40 percent between 2001 and 2009. Our own analysis of NHTS data and the report’s calculation confirms this. In fact, the survey’s other findings indicate these bright young things are relying on ways to travel that don’t involve a car. The number of bike trips per person in Generation Y is up about 27 percent, NHTS data said. Walking increased about 16 percent. Meanwhile, the average number of trips these youngsters take in personal vehicles declined about 18 percent, according to the survey. The miles they travel is down 23 percent. Backers of public transit list a host of reasons why. The report says higher gas prices have pushed younger people to try other means of transportation, as have more stringent state age requirements for driver’s licenses. Darnell Grisby, director of policy development and research with the American Public Transportation Association, a transit industry group, mentioned findings by a real estate market research company that show that members of Generation Y overwhelmingly prefer walkable communities, whether in the suburbs or city. Also, the share of teenagers with driver’s licenses has dropped in recent decades. In 1983, about 87 percent of 19-year-olds had their licenses, according to a University of Michigan study. By 2008, 75 percent did. But one NHTS finding about transit use made us wonder whether the dramatic statistic Dickerson used during the debate told the whole story. While the average number of person miles that younger people travel on transit skyrocketed, the number of trips they took on transit did not. These increased by only about 4 percent It appears that 16- to 34-year-olds are hopping on public trains and buses slightly more often but are taking much longer trips. Why might this be? Baruch Feigenbaum is a transportation policy analyst for the Reason Foundation, a think tank that favors free-market solutions to policy issues. Since such a small percentage of Americans use transit on their daily commutes, a small jump in the number of people who ride buses and trains might translate into a big percentage increase. "While transit usage has increased, the gains may not be as impressive as they appear," Feigenbaum said. How do we rule? We found that the number of per capita passenger miles traveled did increase by 40 percent, the number Dickerson used. But Dickerson’s use of the word "ridership" might have led viewers to think that younger people are taking 40 percent more trips on transit. This number ticked up by only about 4 percent. By either NHTS measure, it’s fair to say that younger people are leaving Daddy’s T-Bird in the driveway and relying more heavily on transit. But Dickerson could have been much more precise. For this reason, Dickerson earns a Half True.	None	Jeff Dickerson	None	None	None	2012-07-18T06:00:00	2012-07-10	['None']

pomt-06512	Says El Paso was named America’s "Safest Large City" a year after San Antonio, Houston and Dallas had the nation’s highest crime rates.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/oct/11/jose-rodriguez/jose-rodriguez-says-el-paso-was-named-safest-large/	After mentioning El Paso in the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry continued: "It is not safe on that (Texas-Mexico) border." Democratic state Sen. José Rodríguez of El Paso countered in a press release two days later: "The reality is that El Paso was named the ‘Safest Large City in the United States’ in 2010, just one year after San Antonio, Houston and Dallas had the highest crime rates in the nation. In fact, last year, when El Paso reported just 7 murders, Perry’s home city of Austin reported 37," Rodríguez said. "Why isn’t he talking about that?" Mild beef: Rodríguez aired slightly incorrect murder counts. In 2010, five murders occurred in El Paso, not seven, and 38 murders occurred in Austin, not 37, the cities’ police departments told us. Rodríguez spokeswoman Emily Amps Mora attributed the incorrect figures to typos. Also, five was El Paso’s lowest number of murders since 1965, and 38 was an unusually high number for Austin. But was El Paso deemed the "Safest Large City" in the United States after other Texas cities led the nation in crime? El Paso’s low crime rates have been noted for years. We looked at murder rates and overall crime rates, using FBI numbers, for the five Texas cities Rodríguez named: El Paso had the lowest rate per 100,000 residents in both categories each year from 2001 through 2010. In 2010, El Paso's murder rate was 0.8 murders per 100,000 residents. Rates for the other cities ranged from 4.8 for Austin to 11.8 for Houston. The so-called "El Paso Miracle" has drawn outside attention, particularly as violence has increased next door in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, a city of 1.3 million which had more than 3,000 murders last year. The Texas Tribune, San Antonio Express-News and El Paso Times have recently written about El Paso’s low crime. Factors aired for the low crime rates include the presence of multiple federal agencies policing the border as well as the area’s high percentage of Hispanic residents (more than 80 percent), including Hispanic immigrants, a group described in a 2009 New York Times news story on El Paso’s safety as tending to be "cautious, law-abiding and respectful of authority." But "Safest Large City" is still an eye-opening title; Amps Mora said she picked it up from a Nov. 21, 2010, City of El Paso press release. The release says: "The latest rating by CQ Press names El Paso as the 1st Safest City followed by Honolulu, HI as the 2nd Safest City and New York, NY as the 3rd Safest City in the United States. This rating, developed by CQ Press, compares cities with a population of more than 500,000 people." CQ Press, a Washington, D.C.-based publisher, produces annual lists and books of crime statistics. However, it does not reward cities with "Safest" or "Most Dangerous" designations. In a Dec. 3, 2010, blog post, The Wall Street Journal said the annual reports stopped including such labels after CQ bought the reports’ publisher in 2007. In an interview, Darrel Petry, spokesman for the El Paso Police Department, told us that the department solely used the "Safest Large City" designation in the Nov. 21 press release and did not repeat it, in part because of objections to CQ’s rankings immediately raised by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Regardless, El Paso did indeed top CQ’s 2010 "Lowest Crime Rate" list for cities with more than 500,000 residents. Next, we looked at Rodríguez’s statement about San Antonio, Houston and Dallas, which Amps Mora told us was based on a 2010 Dallas Morning News blog post. The post spells out that among the nine U.S. cities over 1 million, the highest crime rates using 2009 numbers were in San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Jacksonville, Philadelphia and Phoenix. We got similar results, using FBI 2009 data for the standard categories of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft: San Antonio first, then Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York. But again: These rankings are for cities over 1 million in population. There are only nine on that list (Chicago being excluded because it counted rapes differently) -- so it would be equally valid to say that in looking at lowest crime rates, San Antonio was No. 9 in the country. So did San Antonio, Houston and Dallas have "the highest crime rates in the nation," as Rodriguez said? No, it turns out. Using crime rates per 100,000 in all cities for which the FBI collected data in 2009’s Uniform Crime Reports, the five cities with the highest crime rates were Vernon, Calif., population 90; Industry, Calif., population 930; Black Hawk, Colo., population 104; Teterboro, N.J., population 17; and Mackinac Island, Mich., population 456. San Antonio is the first of the Texas cities cited by Rodriguez to land on this list of all cities -- in 472nd place. Now, of course, that list we just rattled off is misleading, even ridiculous, because of the huge spread of population sizes among "all" U.S. cities. For a more serious comparison, we looked over crime statistics for cities with more than 500,000 residents.The five with the highest crime rates per 100,000 residents in the 2009 numbers were Memphis, Tenn.; Detroit; Atlanta; San Antonio; and Columbus, Ohio. And finally, if we use CQ Press’ rankings for cities over 500,000 -- a list adjusted with the company’s particular methodology -- the five highest-crime cities were Detroit, Baltimore, Memphis, Washington D.C. and Atlanta. Houston, the first Texas city to crop up, was No. 9. As we completed this check, we circled back to Amps Mora, who said by email that the senator's point holds. Objectively, by crime rates, she said, El Paso is safer than bigger Texas cities that also are not on the Texas-Mexico border. Our ruling El Paso has had low crime rates, and its murder rates are considerably below those of the other cited cities. But the statement is misleading in two meaningful ways. Only a City of El Paso press release named El Paso the nation’s "safest" large city--and its police department dropped the label. Also, the other Texas cities did not have the nation’s highest overall crime rates; that’s true only in comparison to a few huge cities. We rate the statement Mostly False.

He believes other countries benefit from our trade practices, while the United States suffers. The trade deficit is how much more goods and services the United States imports than it exports, Trump says it’s too high. "Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly — think of this, think of this — our trade deficit is $800 billion last year alone," Trump said in July 21 remarks at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. "We’re gonna fix that." Trump’s phrasing is a little off, but he’s got the idea right. The country’s overall trade deficit in 2015 was about $500 billion, according to Census data, but that figure includes both goods and services. Trump mentioned the trade deficit in goods, which includes all manufactured products, oil and agriculture products. The trade deficit in 2015 for just goods was $763 billion. Not quite $800 billion, but reasonably close. The reason the overall trade deficit is smaller than just the goods trade deficit is because the United States exports more services than it imports. This isn’t the highest the goods trade deficit has ever been. It ranged from $782 billion in 2005 to $832 billion in 2008. It’s possible, however, that current figures actually understate the size of the goods trade deficit because oil prices have been abnormally low, said Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank supported in part by unions. "It’s a large deficit," Scott said. "And it needs to be reduced." Our ruling Trump said, "Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly … $800 billion last year alone." In 2015, the goods trade deficit was $763 billion. Trump is pretty close.

pomt-04668	Says President Barack Obama "gives students the right to repay (federal) loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/07/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-president-let-students-pay-clear/	Former President Bill Clinton told delegates to the Democratic National Convention that there was an Obama policy they needed to share with "every voter." Health care? Jobs? No — changes to student loans. Clinton got down into details in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech to nominate President Barack Obama for a second term. Student loan legislation under Obama, he said, "lowers the cost of federal student loans." "And even more important," he told them, "it gives students the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years." He argued that would mean students wouldn’t have to drop out of college for fear they couldn’t repay their debt, and would be free to pursue jobs of "modest income" such as teaching, policing or practicing small-town medicine. We’re not checking those implications, but rather his characterization of the policy itself: Did Obama give students "the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years"? Health care and education The president signed student loan legislation in March 2010 as part of a larger package that updated his attention-grabbing health care law. Previously, the government had paid private banks fees to provide federal loans to college students. The new law got rid of the middlemen, freeing up $68 billion over 11 years for Pell Grants and other programs. It also changed loan repayment terms. The government already had in place an "income-based repayment plan" that let students cap payments at 15 percent of their income above living expenses, and forgave remaining debt if they made those payments for 25 years. Under the new law, payments dropped to 10 percent, with debt forgiven after 20 years, or half that long for some public service workers such as teachers. The changes apply to new borrowers as of 2008 and haven’t kicked in yet, though they will by early next year, said Jason Delisle, an education budget expert at the New America Foundation who worked on the Republican staff of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. ‘Clear, fixed, low’ Now, while "10 percent" may seem to fit the bill for a clear, fixed, low portion of income, the repayment plan is actually a little more complicated than that — mostly in borrowers’ favor. That’s because the plan lets borrowers deduct 150 percent of the federal poverty threshold from their incomes before calculating the 10 percent payment. So, the rate for borrowers making less than $100,000 annually with a household size of one is actually less than 5 percent of total income, Delisle calculated, while it’s nearly 9 percent for higher income households. The payments are adjusted each year based on borrowers’ income and family size, requiring annual documentation — not quite as simple as Clinton made it sound. And borrowers may have to pay taxes on the amount of their debt canceled or forgiven. Our ruling Clinton said the president gave students "the right to repay (federal) loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years." That’s a reasonable characterization of a law the president signed in March 2010 that goes into effect by early next year for newer borrowers. But Clinton’s use of the word "clear" does oversimplify a somewhat more complicated reality that students will face an annually adjusted payment requiring paperwork on income and family size.

pomt-04161	Says the Nike bill "is not a tax break ... this does not lower the taxes that Nike will pay nor does it prevent the Legislature from raising those taxes in the future."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/dec/20/john-kitzhaber/does-new-nike-bill-qualify-tax-break/	The term single sales factor doesn’t come up often in everyday conversation -- not unless you’re Gov. John Kitzhaber or the tax folks over at Nike. So, as the governor was testifying on a bill that would allow him to guarantee Nike up to three decades of a single sales tax factor, he tried to be very clear about what it represented. "This is not a tax break," he said during a committee meeting. "This does not lower the taxes that Nike will pay nor does it prevent the Legislature from raising those taxes in the future." In fact, the bill legislators debated allows the governor to guarantee a business that its tax structure will not change for a given period of time in exchange for a promise that the business will make a certain level of investment in the state. So, on paper, the bill does not represent a tax break -- it doesn’t actually change the tax code in any way. That said, much of the discussion regarding the legislation revolved around the state’s single sales factor. That’s because it was clear all along that the governor was going to use the new bill to guarantee Nike decades of that tax apportionment system. Let’s back up, though, and offer a little context. Companies can generally be taxed, to varying degrees, on three fronts: property, payroll and sales. Before 1991, Oregon weighted all three of those areas equally, but over the past 20 years or so, the state has inched toward taxing certain corporations on just their Oregon sales. That system is called single sales factor apportionment. This method can be advantageous for certain companies, reducing the amount of money they owe to the state in a given year. In theory, that reduced tax burden then attracts them to Oregon. Though there were no signs that Oregon’s apportionment system would be changing anytime soon, Nike wanted an assurance before committing to expanding further in Oregon. That’s why the governor asked the Legislature to pass a bill that would allow him to guarantee the structure for companies poised to make a certain level of investment in the state. (You can read more of those details here.) We called University of Oregon economist Tim Duy to get his take. There were two issues here, he said. The single sales factor isn’t a break in the strictest sense, but it certainly reduces the amount a company pays in taxes. The 2013-15 Oregon Expenditure Report, the document that tallies up all of the state’s tax giveaways for a biennium, estimates the state will forgo $165 million over the next two years as a result of this tax structure. Now, to be clear, this estimate is a bit squishy, if only because there’s no accounting for behavioral changes that might occur if the single sales factor didn’t exist. Certain companies, like Nike, might invest elsewhere, for instance. There’s no way of knowing for sure. The specific break that Nike gets from this system isn’t public information, but a few years back the Oregon Center for Public Policy made an estimate. Using some publicly available information, they estimated that under the single sales factor Nike shaved more than 90 percent (about $17 million at the time) off its tax bill. Obviously, that’s a considerable savings for any company. So what about the governor’s claim that this new law doesn’t represent a tax break? Well, as Duy pointed out, this is already the method by which the company was being taxed and there was no talk of changing that. "We're not actually giving up a dollar we're going to get somehow else," he said. "It's not a tax incentive or a rebate of the type we're usually thinking about it." The governor said the bill he was asking the Legislature to pass was not a tax break. That’s true, the bill does not reduce Nike’s tax burden. But it’s been clear all along that the governor would use the legislation to ensure the continuance of a sizable tax giveaway for Nike. That is an important clarification.

pomt-14641	"Anyone can die of a toothache."	true	/florida/statements/2016/jan/26/john-cortes/ignoring-toothache-really-could-potentially-kill-y/	State Rep. John Cortes, D-Kissimmee, made a biting claim about the consequences of poor dental care during debate on a bill that would change the rules for Medicaid coverage. HB 819 is backed by MCNA, a Fort Lauderdale dental benefits company that lost its Medicaid contracts with the state after the 2011 switch to mandatory managed care. The bill allows the Legislature to take dental off the list of services that managed care plans are required to offer people on Medicaid. The state would then be able to contract with vendors like MCNA to provide the dental care instead. (Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry raised eyebrows for discussing the issue with Gov. Rick Scott on behalf of MCNA without first registering as a lobbyist.) Cortes, who voted for the bill, said he wanted to make sure proper dental care would be available for children, maintaining problems can easily arise without treatment. "Anyone can die of a toothache," he said in a House Health Innovation Subcommittee meeting on Jan. 13, 2016. "Believe it or not, you can." The bill passed the committee by a 12-1 vote. Given this age of modern medicine, we wondered if Cortes was right. We decided to drill into this one to find out. The whole tooth We didn’t hear back from Cortes’ office, but unfortunately for all you odontophobes, you really should be getting checkups on a regular basis. "Yes, it is possible to die from complications with an infected tooth," Thomas Porter, a faculty member at the University of Florida College of Dentistry, told PolitiFact Florida. "Every year there are cases where the patient did not receive appropriate and timely treatment of an infected tooth. In most cases, the infected tooth starts as a localized site with pain and infection." Obviously you’re not going to die of the physical pain, but these problems can start from some form of periodontal issue or, as is most often the case, cavities. The decay leads to abscesses, which are usually infections between the tooth and the gums. "Not treated, the problem progresses and the patient becomes septic, which can lead to death," Porter said. Dr. Erin Sutton, a Fort Walton Beach dentist, pointed out the infection could either move to bone marrow or the bloodstream, causing sepsis and affecting major organs. This is not a new phenomenon, of course. Dental infections and other tooth-related problems were listed as the fifth- or sixth-leading cause of death in London back in the early 1600s. But it certainly happens today, too. The number of people who die from an untreated tooth problem is small, but the details can be harrowing. An oft-cited case is the 2007 death of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died when bacteria from an abscess infected his brain. He had two brain operations totaling $250,000 before he died, but he could have been saved with a timely tooth extraction that would have cost $80. His family had no health insurance and had lost Medicaid benefits. Kyle Willis, a 24-year-old unemployed father from Cincinnati, died in 2009 after being unable to afford a tooth extraction and prescription antibiotics for an infection. John Schneider of Mt. Orab, Ohio, was 31 when he died in 2014 after what he thought was a sinus infection but was actually an untreated abscess that eventually led to multiple organ failure. The scope of the danger was highlighted four years ago by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which found preventable dental conditions made up more than 830,000 emergency room visits in 2009. That was up 16 percent from 2006. While the number of deaths aren’t regularly examined, a 2013 study published in the Journal of Endodontics offered a quick cross-section of the issue based on one kind of condition. Researchers found that between 2000 and 2008, there were more than 61,000 hospitalizations nationally for periapical abscesses, an infection at the tip of a tooth’s root that is a common symptom of untreated tooth decay. Of those 61,000-plus stays, 66 patients died. Our ruling Cortes said, "Anyone can die of a toothache." It’s not so much that you’ll die of pain, of course, but dentists and research confirm that an untreated abscess can infect other parts of the body, either through the bones or the bloodstream. Most people won’t die from a toothache, but it’s a condition that if left untreated can lead to the worst: a fatal result. We rate the statement True.

pomt-05036	"Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/12/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-claims-money-chinese-prostitution-supports-ji/	Billionaire Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelson donates millions of dollars to Republican causes. A fired former employee of Adelson’s filed a lawsuit which alleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at properties his company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China. Adelson vigorously denies those allegations. What does any of that have to do with Rep. Jim Renacci? Even though Federal Election Commission records show that Adelson hasn’t ever donated to Renacci, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tried to use the casino owner’s legal woes against the Medina County congressman with a provocatively titled press release: "Congressman Renacci’s Re-election Funded by Chinese Prostitution Money?" "Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority," the DCCC claimed in a news release on July 2, 2012. "What will Congressman Jim Renacci do when his Chinese prostitution money comes from billionaire Sheldon Adelson?" it continued, urging Renacci to "reject the support of these groups funded by money from a Chinese prostitution strategy." As a result of redistricting, Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, Ohio, is pitted against Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat. That makes him a target for the DCCC. The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn’t spent anything so far. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle. The NRCC regularly sends out news releases that attack Sutton, Renacci’s November election rival who is from Copley Township near Akron. When we asked Renacci campaign spokesman James Slepian about the DCCC’s claim that the congressman’s re-election might somehow be funded by Chinese prostitution money, Slepian replied that there is "no money from Chinese prostitutes, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy in our campaign coffers." "The DCCC's Chinese prostitution fantasy demonstrates that they are now fully immersed in the gutter and will literally say anything to avoid talking about Betty Sutton's lockstep support for the failed Obama economic agenda," Slepian said. "This campaign needs to be about the economy and voting records, not fairy tales about Chinese hookers." The allegations that Adelson signed off on prostitution at his properties in Macau were raised last month during a lawsuit filed by former Sands executive Steven Jacobs, who was fired from overseeing those properties in July 2010. Associated Press reported that Jacobs’ lawsuit accuses Adelson of breach of contract and pushing him into illegal activity. A court filing from Jacobs says he tried to rid the casino floor of "loan sharks and prostitution" while he worked there, which upset senior executives who informed him that "the prior prostitution strategy had been personally approved by Adelson." A spokesman for the Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always "maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson’s character." In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, Adelson said there’s not a "shred of evidence" to back his former employee’s charges, and "says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the … claims even more preposterous." Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau. Do unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson’s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC’s claim that "foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority?" We don’t think so. The root of the allegation stems from a fired employee’s claim that Adelson allowed prostitution to be present in a casino in Macau. Based on that, the DCCC claims that Adelson, one of the wealthiest people in America, made political contributions with cash from prostitution revenues. And then the claim invokes Renacci’s name as part of the Republican majority that this tainted money is supposedly supporting. Renacci hasn’t accepted money from Adelson and doesn’t control contributions to the GOP groups that support him. The claim that Adelson’s donations to these other groups amount to "Chinese prostitution money" is dubious enough that inserting the word "allegedly" can’t save it. On the Truth-O-Meter, the DCCC statement rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-03830	"Nearly 25 percent of all automobile accidents are caused by texting while driving."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/mar/19/doug-holder/rep-doug-holders-texting-while-driving-stat-too-hi/	After years of dead ends, Florida lawmakers are again pushing for a law that would penalize motorists who text or email from behind the wheel. The measure, SB 52/HB 13, would make texting while driving a secondary offense, so motorists would be fined only on top of a primary offense, such as careless driving or speeding. The House sponsor of the bill, Rep. Doug Holder, R-Venice, rattled off several grim statistics about the problem in a March 13 committee hearing. One claim gave us fact-checkers pause. "Nearly 25 percent of all automobile accidents are caused by texting while driving," he said. Holder’s legislative aide directed us to the website TextingAndDrivingSafety.com. We checked that site, as well as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Distraction.org and the National Security Council. We checked in with AAA, which supports Holder’s bill. We found interesting research that resemble Holder’s claim on these sites. At least 23 percent of all crashes involved cell phones in 2011. Texting while driving makes a driver 23 times more likely to crash. About 26.2 percent of motorists admitted typing or sending an email while driving in the past month. But nowhere did we find an estimate as high as Holder’s for the percentage of crashes caused by texting while driving. Reached by phone, Holder acknowledged he messed up his numbers. He said he meant to say "distracted driving" instead of "texting while driving," but he got, well, distracted in front of the committee considering his bill. "I was not looking at my notes because I was trying to show my passion about it," Holder said. What else constitutes distracted driving? (As if you don’t know.) There’s talking on the phone and to other passengers, putting on makeup, using a GPS and adjusting music, among other driving vices. Texting is by far the worst because it demands a driver’s visual, manual and cognitive attention, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. We were curious what Florida figures were available for crashes caused by texting while driving. Texting caused nearly .1 percent of more than 256,000 crashes in 2012, according to preliminary data collected by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Crashes that resulted from distractions by any electronic communication device comprised 1.79 percent of crashes, or 4,586, in 2012, according to the same state data. The real number is likely higher. A committee analysis of HB 13 makes an important point about gathering data in Florida: It’s incomplete. For a crash report to identify texting as the cause of an accident means a motorist has to admit that to an officer. And because it is not an enforceable offense, there is no consistent way for law enforcement officers to enter it into their reports. Our ruling Holder’s statistic that 25 percent of all crashes are the result of texting at the wheel missed the mark. It would have been more accurate had he said "distracted driving" or "using cell phones." There’s a grain of truth in that texting is one of the ways a driver can be distracted. We rate Holder’s statement Mostly False.	None	Doug Holder	None	None	None	2013-03-19T10:29:50	2013-03-13	['None']
pomt-12180	Says Donald Trump was seen "looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/31/jk-rowling/jk-rowling-falsely-accuses-trump-not-shaking-disab/	Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling took to Twitter to accuse President Donald Trump of ignoring a disabled child at a press conference, but she was basing her outrage on a highly edited video that left out Trump’s greeting. Trump invited the family of 3-year-old Monty Weer to the White House on July 24, 2017, while the president gave a speech on health care reform. Monty Weer has spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spinal cord is not completely formed. He is confined to a wheelchair and requires medical treatment, but Trump said the Weer family’s options were limited because there is only one choice of health insurance provider where they live in South Carolina. Trump said there weren’t more options because of the Affordable Care Act. (The family also has acknowledged parts of the law have helped them, too.) A video circulated on the Internet after Trump’s speech, showing Trump not shaking Monty Weer’s hand as Trump walked by. The original has since been deleted, but you can watch a similar video here: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rowling saw the video and retweeted it, then tweeted several more times about her anger over the apparent snub. "Trump imitated a disabled reporter. Now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair, as though frightened he might catch his condition," she tweeted on July 28, 2017. (There’s an archived version here.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it," she continued. "So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com "That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect," she added. "How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President." Except that the unedited White House video showed that Trump did greet the boy, bending down to speak to him as he walked up to the podium (starting at about 2:18 in the video below): See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Twitter users attacked Rowling for her ire, demanding she delete the tweets and apologize to Trump, whom she regularly attacks on the social media site. As of this writing, Rowling had done neither. We tried to contact her through her publicist’s email but did not get a response. (Editor's note: After publication, Rowling deleted the tweets and apologized to the boy and his family. See the After the Fact below for more.) British journalist Piers Morgan was one of the more outspoken critics, posting numerous times that Rowling had lied about Trump. (He also attacked Chelsea Clinton, who had been fooled by the same edited video but later acknowledged her mistake.) Morgan posted an image being spread on the Internet of a Facebook status attributed to Monty Weer’s mother, Marjorie Weer, addressing Rowling and saying "Trump didn’t snub my son & Monty wasn’t even trying to shake his hand." The image said "hand shaking is not his thing" because he’s so young and that "he was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch." We traced the image to a July 30 Reddit post, but couldn’t independently verify that Marjorie Weer had actually written it on Facebook. Our ruling Rowling said Trump was seen "looking deliberately over a disabled child's head, ignoring his outstretched hand." Her tweets were based on an edited video of a White House press conference that had circulated online. The full video of the event showed Trump did greet a 3-year-old boy with spina bifida. In her rush to defend a disabled child, Rowling reacted to only a snippet of video, without taking the entire event into consideration. She also did not respond to calls for her to recant her criticism. We rate Rowling’s claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com	None	J.K.

pomt-01306	Greg Abbott has benefitted from "payday lenders who have given him $300,000 and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/oct/29/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-said/	Wendy Davis, asked if she’s unethically profited while in public office, suggested her opponent has committed infractions including one that resulted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations. Responding to a reporter at the Sept. 30, 2014, gubernatorial debate in Dallas, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee and Fort Worth state senator accused Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, her Republican foe, of selling out Texans to serve the "interests of people who make donations to his campaign." As an example, Davis pointed out "payday lenders who have given" Abbott’s campaign "$300,000 and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees." Davis was revisiting a topic she’s consistently explored: that a 2006 letter from Abbott’s state office allowed payday lenders to skirt state lending laws. After Davis’ proclaimed link between Abbott’s campaign donations and official action was described by the El Paso Times in January 2014, we found Half True her statement that Texas payday lenders were charging 1,000 percent interest. In rare instances, lenders charged 1,000 percent annual interest, but payday loan rates then averaged 465 percent. For this fact check, we gauged whether Abbott piled up hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations and then issued a ruling favorable to payday lenders, which offer low-dollar, high-interest short-term loans targeting low-income people who live paycheck to paycheck. The loans are generally for $100 and $500 and are most often issued for two weeks. They’re considered risky because low-income borrowers are relatively unlikely to be able to pay them back. Abbott campaign contributions To our inquiry about the $300,000 described as given to Abbott, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas emailed us records of Abbott campaign contributions as filed in campaign reports at the Texas Ethics Commission covering Sept. 16, 2002 nearly through July 2014. Our own sampling of state records showed Abbott’s campaign fielded: --$80,000 from Trevor Ahlberg, CEO of Irving-based payday lender Cash Store, in eight installments from Aug. 16, 2006 to June 16, 2014; --$57,500 from Roderick Aycox, founder of Georgia-based payday lender LoanMax, in five installments from Nov. 12, 2009 to June 9, 2014; --$30,500 from Cash America International Inc. PAC in 14 contributions from Sept. 16, 2002 to July 29, 2014; --$30,000 from Ace Cash Express Inc. PAC, in eight donations from Oct. 5, 2005 to July 29, 2014. Then again, according to Petkanas and state records, less than 5 percent of the tallied payday-lender donations, or $13,000, had come in by Jan. 12, 2006, which was the date Abbott’s office issued the ruling criticized by Davis. By phone, Petkanas said Davis did not mean to say in the debate that all the $300,000 was given before Abbott’s office ruled on payday lending. Texas Payday Lenders: Regulation and Evasion There's a lot of background to state actions involving payday lenders. In 1999, then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, Abbott’s predecessor, filed lawsuits against selected payday lenders, saying the companies were dodging state laws regulating interest rates. Separately, a "usury" provision in the Texas Constitution caps interest rates on short-term loans from unlicensed lenders at 10 percent. Cornyn, saying lenders were getting away with interest rates of up to 1,000 percent, said: "This kind of abusive payday lending is illegal in Texas, and those companies who continue this practice will face serious consequences." An October 2000 report by the Sunset Advisory Commission found that "in recent years, different types of lending businesses have attempted to evade regulation" including payday lenders. It recommended the Legislature "authorize" the "Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner to regulate payday loans" in order to "help control unlawful interest rates." In 2001, state lawmakers agreed to changes in law bringing payday lending under the office’s regulation and directing the Texas Finance Commission to adopt rules guiding the industry. According to a May 2001 bill analysis by the House Research Organization, the requested rules "would prohibit a lender from using a device, pretense, or subterfuge to avoid regulation of the lender’s transactions, including by recharacterizing fees on a loan as a purchase of a good or service." Resulting additions to Texas law include a chart specifying acceptable fees for payday loans of various dollar amounts and durations. But in subsequent years, according to Austin American-Statesman news reports, Texas payday lenders found a way around the law by partnering with out-of-state banks, which financed payday loans out of the reach of Texas laws. State and national legislators then raised concerns about payday lenders dodging the restrictions; the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation cracked down in 2005, limiting the number of payday loans a bank could issue and constricting the profitability of partnerships between payday lenders and banks. That’s when Texas payday lenders, under pressure from regulation, started transitioning to a new business model, called a credit service organization (CSO) in summer 2005, the Statesman reported In January 2006. Its news story said Texas payday lenders ditched partnerships with FDIC-regulated banks and began working with "third-party unregistered lenders." It also said Texas "payday lenders got a boost recently from Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott" in the form of a letter affirming the legality of the CSO model. Between 2004 and 2014, payday lender storefronts increased more than tenfold in Texas, the El Paso Times reported Feb. 4, 2014. Abbott’s interpretation of state law Next, we looked at the Abbott "ruling" declared by Davis. It turned out to be an aide's legal analysis. In 2005, the attorney general’s office, headed by Abbott, fielded two requests to review the legality of payday-lender CSOs, agency spokesman Jerry Strickland said by email, one an August 2005 verbal request from the consumer credit commissioner, who inquired after a court case raised questions about whether the state had any sway over CSOs. In Lovick v. Ritemoney Ltd., the plaintiff accused payday lender Ritemoney Ltd. of disguising illegal interest fees as service charges. A state district judge, Rhesa Hawkins Barksdale, wrote that "Texas law does not construe such credit service fees as disguised interest," and the complaint was dismissed. Strickland said the other request for Abbott’s judgment came in writing Sept. 8, 2005 from then-state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso. Shapleigh wrote that as a CSO, "a payday lending company dodges both federal guidelines restricting payday loans and the interest-rate limits established by the Texas Finance Commission. As the state’s leading enforcement agency, it is imperative that your office investigate this new business model and take necessary enforcement actions against businesses purposefully and illegally skirting Texas laws." On Jan. 12, 2006, Barry McBee, the state’s first assistant attorney general, signed a letter responding to the commissioner, Leslie Pettijohn, saying there was "nothing patently illegal" about payday lender CSOs under state law and there was no statutory limit to the fees they could charge. McBee’s letter pointed out that, in keeping with state law, payday lender CSOs were charging the maximum-permitted 10 percent interest on loans plus service fees to arrange the loan between a borrower and third-party lender. He wrote that, according to Chapter 393 of the Texas Finance Code, there is not "any limit on the amount of fees" a CSO can charge in such transactions. "Any discussion of whether the use of this model is the best public policy choice for the State of Texas," McBee wrote, "is one that must be addressed by the Legislature and has not been explored by this office." Legislative Review In the 2013 legislative session, lawmakers debated reforming payday lending practices, but attempts stalled. Expert Analysis By phone, Don Baylor, a former senior policy analyst for the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, said that after the Lovick v. Ritemoney ruling, payday lenders remained uncertain if they could legally operate as CSOs. But, Baylor said, "it’s fair to say the OAG letter provided enough regulatory certainty for the entire (payday lending) industry to jump on board with the CSO model." Baylor also said that after the Lovick ruling, "the attorney general doesn’t have the authority to prohibit loans from being made under the CSO model." He credited the explosion of payday lender CSOs to ambiguous wording in the 1987 Credit Services Organization Act, which was written to help Texans improve credit scores and not with payday lenders in mind, he said. "Payday lenders found the CSO costume and dressed up in the costume," said Baylor. "It’s a very creative way they came up with to get around the constitutional usury limits." Our Ruling Davis said payday lenders gave Abbott $300,000 in campaign donations "and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees." This statement references a 2006 legal analysis -- not a ruling -- from a top state aide to Abbott that tracked with a court ruling permitting payday lenders to charge unlimited fees in spite of state caps on related interest. Clarification is needed in that only 5 percent of the described $300,000 in donations occurred before the analysis was issued. Regardless, Abbott's office reaffirmed a way for politically supportive payday lenders to squeeze Texas borrowers. We rate this statement Mostly True.

"We got him: Obama just broke federal law in attempt to take over presidency from Trump," said the headline on March 18, 2018, on Universal News Portal, a blog promoting sensational headlines. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Obama tried to overthrow the current president. In the article, Obama is falsely accused of being obsessed with taking Trump down by establishing a shadow government outside the White House that recruits active members to protest Trump’s every move. While there have been protests against policy decisions made by the Trump administration, there is no evidence to suggest that Obama influenced or administered them in any way. There is also no proof of an established shadow government, which has been referred to as a conspiracy theory by several news outlets. Obama is also accused of urging senators not to repeal Obamacare without Trump’s knowledge and of following Trump to the G20 Summit in Germany in 2017, which PolitiFact already debunked last year. Obama’s spokesperson told us that he did not attend the event, nor was he in Germany at the time it took place. There have also been no reports of Obama meeting with senators to discuss fighting the repeal of Obamacare. The alleged crime in the fake news story is that Obama is supposedly held secret meetings with world leaders. Since Obama is now out of office, doing so would be considered illegal under the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States or foreign governments. While Obama has met with some world leaders, such as President Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, it was part of a longstanding tradition of former presidents traveling overseas after leaving office to try and attract donations and support for their foundations, libraries and presidential centers. Obama has also leisurely traveled and made speeches abroad since he has left his presidency. We found no evidence of any illegal action taken by Obama since he has been out of office or any attempts to illegitimately take over the presidency. We rate this post Pants on Fire.

pomt-08640	Tom Barrett "voted for the largest tax increase in history ... raising taxes on gas and Social Security."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/17/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-tom-barrett-/	In the battle for the Wisconsin statehouse, Republicans are working overtime to tar the Democrat who would be governor as "Tom the Taxer." It’s a common tactic on the campaign trail, and may be especially potent this year amid massive job losses and economic uncertainty. In an ongoing series of TV ads set in a noisy sports bar, the Republican Governors Association blames Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett for business closings and hits him for raising taxes as mayor as well as in Congress. In the first version of the ad, the bartender says: "An ongoing argument around here is what makes Tom Barrett the all time worst ... more taxes or less jobs? Barrett has raised taxes every year he’s been mayor, and before that he voted for the largest tax increase in history ... raising taxes on gas and Social Security." Barrett was indeed a member of Congress in 1993, when lawmakers passed and President Bill Clinton signed a giant revenue bill. The measure squeaked by 218-216 in the House. It’s known as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Barrett voted for the bill, part of a party-line vote in the Wisconsin delegation. And, yes, the measure increased gas taxes 4.3 cents per gallon, and increased the taxable portion of Social Security benefits. No dispute about any of that. But was it really the largest tax increase in history? We started with the Republican Governors Association, which produced the ad. RGA spokesman Mike Schrimpf cited a New York Times story from 1996 that touched on tax increases while analyzing debates in the Clinton-Dole election. He told PolitiFact Wisconsin: "According to the New York Times, ‘the 1993 measure was the largest tax increase in American history.’ " The Times story does say that, but the full sentence contains a key phrase ignored by Schrimpf and the RGA. Here’s the full sentence (italics added): "So in actual dollars, the 1993 measure was the largest tax increase in American history." And here’s the next sentence: "But adjusted for inflation, it was smaller than the one in 1982" -- a measure signed by President Ronald Reagan. The Times story took no position on the wisdom of comparing tax laws passed 11 years apart based on raw dollars unadjusted for inflation. But we do. As PolitiFact National has noted in previous items on similar statements on the size of tax increases, economists prefer calculating tax increases as share of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product. The GDP is the value of a country’s overall economic output of goods and services at market prices. It’s common sense, experts say. U.S. Treasury spokeswoman Sandra Salstrom notes the political discourse over taxes and spending very seldom mentions actual dollar figures. "Why not? Because, even after accounting for inflation, federal spending has increased in almost every year," Salstrom told PolitiFact Wisconsin. "So almost every year the federal government sets a postwar high in spending." But each increase does not have the same effect, she noted. A tax change of $10 billion, for example, would affect taxpayers much more in 1970 than in 2009. The federal government, in the widely cited Treasury Department study on more than six decades of tax increases, says that of several possible approaches, the GDP measure is probably the best is because it eliminates the effects of inflation, real economic growth and the size of total federal receipts. That study compares major revenue bills from 1940 to 2006, measuring each tax bill’s predicted share of GDP after four years. The clear winner: the Revenue Act of 1942, one of several major tax bills enacted to pay for World War ll. It’s more than twice the size of the runner-up, a 1941 act. The 1993 hike that Barrett backed and Clinton signed comes in as the ninth-biggest increase in the period, significantly below the 1982 act signed by Reagan, which ranked fifth. Partisans have tussled for years over what constitutes the all-time biggest tax-boosting bill. And we expect that barroom arguments will persist. But the evidence is clear: While Barrett voted for a big tax bill, it’s not the largest in American history, based on its actual share of economic output, which economists and the Treasury Department say is the most valid approach. The increase is evidently the largest in raw dollars, though, so the Republican Governor’s Association has at least one barstool leg to stand on. We rate the RGA’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02572	"I played in a game here against the Pittsburgh Steelers where there was 23 inches of snow. … We played in at least 15 inches of that."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/30/curtis-martin/curtis-martin-says-he-once-played-game-15-inches-s/	Former New York Jets running back Curtis Martin took to ESPN’s Herald Square set recently with a message: Stop worrying about the weather for Super Bowl XLVIII. Martin said he was excited to see football’s big game being played outside in a northern city, and that the elements are part of professional football. He then told the audience about how things were back in his playing days. "I played in a game here against the Pittsburgh Steelers where there was 23 inches of snow, and they couldn’t get all the snow," Martin said. "We played in at least 15 inches of that. The only thing you could see on the field were the lines that they would clear out." 1) That sounds like a lot of snow. 2) We’re not expecting anything close in East Rutherford, N.J., for the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos. 3) The story Martin told is pretty exaggerated. The Steelers did play Martin’s Jets in the snow in East Rutherford on Dec. 14, 2003. Martin had a statistically great game, rushing for 174 yards while adding 54 yards receiving.The Jets won 6-0 on two Doug Brien field goals. The size of the snow pile, however, apparently has grown in Martin’s mind since the game was played a decade ago. Most media reports say the teams played in several inches of snow before the snow became freezing rain in the second half. Weather history from Weather Underground, which relies on airport weather data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, says that about 4 inches of snow fell in the East Rutherford area on Dec. 14, not 23 inches. The New York Daily News also reported 4 inches of snow that day, saying: "four inches of snow, then sleet turning to rain and 30-mph wind gusts." And here’s how Jets kicker Brien described a second-quarter field goal at the time to New York’s Journal News: "There was 4 inches of snow on the ground. I was fortunate that we had a timeout and the line was able to clear away a pretty good space for me, and that was big." Lastly, while the NFL is very good about making sure videos of their games do not appear on the Internet, there is photographic evidence that there was not 23 or even 15 inches of snow that day. We have a photo of Brien’s 41-yard field goal, and we have an image of Martin in what appears to be a few inches. Our ruling Former Jets star running back Curtis Martin said he once played a game in 15 inches of snow. This is one of those stories that gets more unbelievable as the years pass.

pomt-11750	Says Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum "wants to make Florida not a sanctuary city but a sanctuary state."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/dec/06/adam-putnam/does-andrew-gillum-want-make-florida-sanctuary-sta/	Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam is using the controversial topic of sanctuary cities to drum up Republican support in his bid for governor. At a campaign stop in Jacksonville, Putnam warned voters that one of his Democratic opponents wants a statewide expansion of policies that prevent the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally. "There’s a candidate running for governor who wants to make Florida not a sanctuary city, but a sanctuary state," Putnam said Nov. 30. "That’s crazy talk." There is no specific legal definition of sanctuary cities, but the term generally describes jurisdictions that to some extent limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials or don't honor their detainer requests. With that in mind, we wondered: Does a Democratic gubernatorial candidate really want to make Florida a sanctuary state? Putnam’s team singled out Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum as having this plan. But nothing on Gillum’s website calls for a move on this scale, and Gillum’s team says "sanctuary state" is not an accurate description of what Gillum envisions for Florida. So what’s the deal? Putnam’s team pointed to a tweet and multiple news articles where Gillum criticized President Donald Trump’s January 2017 executive order to penalize cities that don't comply with federal immigration agents by withholding federal funds. The next day, Gillum took to Twitter and posted a lengthy statement to attack Trump’s decision as "inconsistent with our highest values," adding the United States can "protect national security interests and have a secure border without criminalizing people who are here undocumented." Those examples didn’t show Gillum calling for a statewide sanctuary law or policy similar, so we asked the Gillum campaign for more insight on what he wants to do. "The commissioner accused Andrew of something that he never said," spokesman Geoff Burgan told PolitiFact Florida. As Tallahassee mayor, Burgan said that Gillum was clear that local law enforcement agencies are not Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In other words, Gillum believes local law enforcement should be focused on enforcing the laws of their city, not deporting undocumented immigrants. Gillum’s campaign website says that he will "continue to fight mass deportation policies" and calls for an end to Trump’s attack on "cities friendly to immigrants." "Andrew believes that a decision between security or compassionate immigration policy are false choices; we can have them both," it reads. "As Governor, Andrew will use every effort to protect Florida from President Trump’s attacks on immigrants." As of November 2017, Tallahassee is not considered a sanctuary city by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws and regularly updates a map on its website detailing what it considers sanctuary cities, counties and states. Jessica Vaughan, the center’s director of policy studies, said Gillum’s statements to the Tallahassee Democrat indicate that he is a "sanctuary-sympathizer" who has adopted the language of people who support sanctuary policies. But while his rhetoric may raise concerns to her group, Gillum has not gone as far as articulating a policy mimicking other states that do have the unofficial classification as a "sanctuary state." The group considers six states, including California and Illinois, as having statewide sanctuary policies. In 2014, California adopted the Trust Act, which prohibited local law enforcement agencies from holding individuals solely based on their immigration status, unless certain criteria are met. That criteria includes factors like whether the immigrant has a serious or violent felony conviction or a specific sexual crimes conviction. For what it’s worth, none of the other Democratic candidates for governor — former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, Chris King from Orlando and Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine — have specifically said they want to make Florida a sanctuary state, either. We couldn’t find any instances of those candidates speaking out against Trump’s 2017 executive order, but in June, Graham tweeted about a House bill known as "No Sanctuary for Criminals Act." This piece of legislation cut funds for cities that protect immigrants. "While Trump is attacking the press, the House is attacking immigrants & voting to defund law enforcement agencies – potentially many in FL," Graham tweeted, adding that she voted against similar legislation in 2015. Our ruling Putnam said Gillum wants to make Florida a "sanctuary state." Putnam's comment is extrapolated from Gillum's vows to fight back against Trump's attack on sanctuary cities. As mayor of Tallahassee, Gillum criticized Trump’s executive order threatening to suspend funding to sanctuary cities, and Gillum’s campaign said as governor he would support an approach like in Tallahassee that emphasizes immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not a local one. But Gillum has not offered a specific statewide policy for not cooperating with detainer requests from immigration enforcement officials. His position is murkier than Putnam describes.

pomt-12478	"40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/03/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-new-book-says-women-are-primary-earne/	Despite the large number of women in the American workforce, society still treats them as an "anomaly," first daughter Ivanka Trump wrote in the introduction to her new book, Women Who Work. "Forty-seven percent of the U.S. workforce is made up of women; 70 percent of all mothers support ourselves or contribute financially to our family’s bottom line; and 40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners," Trump wrote. "Yet we still say ‘working woman’ as if she were an anomaly. We never say ‘working man.’ " There are a few statistics in that passage, but we wanted to hone in on one of them: that women are the primary earners in 40 percent of American households. In the notes section of her book, Trump referenced a widely cited 2013 Pew Research Center report that looked at households with children under the age of 18. The report found that in 2011, women earned most or all of the family’s income in 40 percent of these households, adding up to about 13.7 million "breadwinner moms." That’s quadruple what it was in 1960 — 11 percent. The Pew figure is a little more specific than what Trump wrote because it only looked at households that had kids, not those that don't have kids. But in context, it's clear Trump was referring to the Pew report — especially because she referred to the same statistic later in the book when talking about being a working mom herself. "As much as motherhood is a joy to so many of us, it is also the greatest predictor of wage inequality between men and women in our country," she wrote. "Forty-seven percent of the U.S. labor force is female; 40 percent of women are their family's primary breadwinner." "The fact is correct," said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan and former chief economist at the U.S. Labor Department. We couldn't find any comprehensive data that spoke to how many households total, including those without kids, had women as the primary earners. Of the families where the woman is the primary breadwinner, Pew found that 37 percent are married women who earn more than their husbands, while 63 percent are single mothers. And the households with a married primary breadwinner, with a median family income of $80,000, are wealthier than the single mother households, which have a median family income of $23,000. The Pew report is the most recent independent report we could find speaking to this issue. But we also came across a 2016 report by the liberal Center for American Progress that had similar findings. According to the Center for American Progress, 42 percent of mothers were the sole or primary breadwinners in their households in 2015. And 22.4 percent were co-breadwinners, earning one-quarter to one-half of their total household income. Even though women’s share of the labor force grew dramatically throughout the latter half of the 20th century, it has stagnated in recent years, at least in part because of a lack of family-friendly labor policies, said Casey Schoeneberger, communications director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Our ruling Ivanka Trump said, "40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners." A widely cited Pew report found that in 2011, 40 percent of American households with children under 18 had women providing most or all of the family’s income. A report by a liberal think tank found similar results looking at 2015 data. The context of Trump's statement shows that she had working moms in mind. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-06059	"In the past year, Floridians, not government, created almost 135,000 new private sector jobs. We netted more than 120,000 total jobs in the first 11 months of 2011; the third most of any state in the nation."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/10/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-job-growth-third-most-any/	Gov. Rick Scott boasted about job growth, his signature issue, during his second annual state of the state address Jan. 10, 2012. "In the past year, Floridians, not government, created almost 135,000 new private sector jobs. We netted more than 120,000 total jobs in the first 11 months of 2011; the third most of any state in the nation." Were Scott's numbers right? James Miller, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, pointed to his department's December press release based on BLS data that showed 120,200 net jobs between January and November 2011. That includes 134,800 private sector jobs added, but 14,600 government jobs lost. We turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify. Data from the BLS shows total nonfarm seasonally adjusted jobs in Florida grew from about 7.16 million to 7.28 million, or an increase of about 120,200 between January and November 2011. So that gets us to Scott's claim about netting more than 120,000 total jobs. But the BLS would call that a 10-month change -- not an 11-month change because those numbers start with January and don't show how many jobs were added between December and January. Scott might have wanted to look at the first 11 months of 2011 rather than the 12-month net change because he was sworn into office Jan. 4, 2011, and 11 months of data is available for that year so far. Scott appears to have lopped off the December 2010 job loss figures from before he was governor. The BLS provides data for states' 12-month net jobs change, which was 110,500 for Florida for private jobs and 98,000 for total nonfarm jobs (both not seasonally adjusted.) Those figures put Florida third behind Texas and California. Florida is the fourth most populous state in the country behind California, Texas and New York so its not particularly impressive that it would net the third most number of jobs. And by focusing on the number of added jobs rather than the unemployment rate, Scott is able to tell a more positive story. Florida's unemployment rate was 10 percent for November. Only four states had a higher rate -- California, Nevada, Mississippi and Rhode Island. Illinois and North Carolina tied with Florida. Our ruling Scott said, "In the past year, Floridians, not government, created almost 135,000 new private sector jobs. We netted more than 120,000 total jobs in the first 11 months of 2011; the third most of any state in the nation." Scott's figures are correct, although what he has done here is point to a 10-month job change. We also question how significant it is that Florida ranks third for new jobs, given that we're one of the largest states population-wise. Our unemployment rates would suggest we still have quite a way to go. Still, Scott's numbers are on track. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-13603	"I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-mischaracterizes-nato-change-and-his-/	During what his campaign billed as a major foreign-policy address in Youngstown, Ohio, Donald Trump seemed to take credit for pushing NATO toward a sharper focus on terrorism. "If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end," Trump said. "Our new approach -- which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East -- must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally." He went on to add, "We will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats." Trump has indeed mused publicly that NATO might be "obsolete" because the alliance is "not meant for terrorism." But we wondered whether he was correct to say that the U.S.-led military alliance has "changed their policy and now (has) a new division focused on terror threats." As it turns out, we found very little accurate with this statement. What change at NATO is he referring to? We didn’t hear back from Trump’s campaign, and unlike other portions of the prepared speech, this particular claim was not documented with footnotes. However, when we checked with experts on NATO and terrorism, several said the likeliest change that Trump would have been referring to was the creation of an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Trump has previously tweeted out a Wall Street Journal story on the news and said the alliance "made the change without giving me credit." The new position was officially announced in a communiqué released on July 9, 2016, by member-state representatives at a summit in Warsaw, Poland. Here’s what the document said: "To position the Alliance in responding to evolving threats, NATO intelligence reform must be an ongoing, dynamic process. ... To improve NATO's ability to draw on a wide range of intelligence resources, we have agreed to establish a new Joint Intelligence and Security Division to be led by an Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence and Security. The new Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence and Security will direct NATO's intelligence and security activities, ensuring better use of existing personnel and resources, while maximizing the efficient use of intelligence provided by Allies." Was this a major change? Not really, experts say. "NATO members have been complaining about sharing of intelligence for generations," said Stephen M. Saideman, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Canada who had a fellowship on the U.S. Joint Staff at NATO in 2001. "Every year or two, there is a discussion about how to improve intel sharing." This change, he said, was "not that important." Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, agreed. "While the top position is new, it seems most of the staff will come from an internal reorganization of NATO bureaucracy, rather than new additions," he said. "This is because the summit communique describes this new NATO division as making ‘better use of existing personnel and resources.’ " More to the point, Trump’s comment gives the impression that NATO hadn’t been responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. That’s not true at all. NATO involvement in counter-terrorism issued its first formal declaration on terrorism in 1980, and it became a significant issue for the alliance on Sept. 11, 2001, said Lisa Sawyer Samp, a senior fellow in the international security program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "NATO invoked Article 5, its collective defense provision, the day after the 9/11 attacks and has focused on dealing with this threat ever since, including most importantly by deploying troops for the past 12 years in Afghanistan," said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as Ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. At its peak, NATO and its partners sent about 40,000 troops to Afghanistan, Benitez said, and this year, there are still about 4,000 troops from NATO allies in Afghanistan. "It is impossible to argue that NATO has not played an overwhelmingly important role in the war on terror," said Timothy Andrews Sayle, an assistant professor of modern global security at the University of Toronto. It’s worth noting that, according to experts, NATO’s structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counter-terrorism. "Allied warfare is exceptionally difficult and fraught with problems of coordination and compatibility," Sayle said. Intelligence sharing has been especially challenging -- a shortcoming that the new position was designed to ease. NATO’s post-9/11 terrorism blueprint did undergo one major overhaul -- but that occurred in 2012, several years before Trump started running for president. The overhaul, as announced at a summit in Wales, states that "the Alliance strives at all times to remain aware of the evolving threat from terrorism; to ensure it has adequate capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist threats." "So it took about a decade to update the initial post-9/11 framework for dealing with terrorism," said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center. Did Trump have anything to do with it? Despite Trump’s desire for credit, this is the part where his statement goes off the rails. Trump strongly implies that NATO acted because of his concerns. But experts agree that nothing of the sort happened. For starters, experts said, leaders of the NATO countries feel little warmth for Trump, suggesting that they wouldn’t do anything to bolster his prospects of becoming president. "It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign," Fay said. "Like his claim that he was against the invasion of Iraq, this is another reflection of the Republican nominee living in a foreign policy world of his own creation." Even more important are the structural obstacles -- namely, that an alliance as broad as NATO tends to take longer to get all its members to sign off on strategic changes. "This is almost certainly just an odd coincidence," Sayle said. "The position would be the result of a very long slog by those who have favored the idea against those who may believe the alliance too large and diffuse to be effective – or safe – for sharing detailed intelligence." Saideman agreed. "NATO never works fast on anything, and most of the major changes are timed to be announced at summits like the Warsaw Summit or smaller meetings where defense ministers and foreign ministers meet." Finally, NATO rejected the notion that Trump had anything to do with the change in a statement to Politico. Our ruling Trump said, "I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats." The change he’s apparently referring to -- the creation of a new senior post and division for coordinating intelligence sharing -- is just the most recent incremental change in how the alliance handles counter-terrorism, a topic it has addressed, in big ways and small, for more than 30 years. There is no evidence that the change was made in response to Trump’s complaints about the alliance. Experts said such changes typically require a longer gestation period so that all member nations can get on board.

pomt-04590	President Obama campaign surrogate Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley "acknowledged that we are not better off than we were four years ago."	half-true	/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/21/chris-devaney/tennessee-gop-chairman-says-obama-surrogate-admits/	The pace of the nation’s economic recovery continues to be one of the most heavily debated issues as the presidential race enters its final stretch. Republican Mitt Romney and his supporters have been trying to gain the upper hand in that debate by asking voters the same question that Ronald Reagan effectively used against Jimmy Carter in 1980: Are you better off than you were four years ago? One of President Barack Obama’s top campaign surrogates, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, "acknowledged that we are not better off than we were four years ago," Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Chris Devaney wrote in a posting on the party’s web site on Sept. 4. To back up the claim, the party’s state executive director, Adam Nickas, directed us to O’Malley’s Sept. 2, appearance on CBS News’ "Face the Nation." The program, moderated by Bob Schieffer, was broadcast live on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. Instead of paraphrasing the exchange in question, we’ll let a transcript from that pertinent segment of the broadcast speak for itself: Schieffer: Can you honestly say that people are better off today than they were four years ago? O’Malley: No, but that’s not the question of this election. The question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush brought us the Bush job losses, the Bush recession, the Bush deficits, the series of desert wars, charged for the first time to credit cards, the national credit card … When Schieffer pointed out that Bush is not on the ballot, O’Malley replied: "Yeah. But we are making progress" and are coming out of "the deep, deep hole." O’Malley’s remarks lit up the web and the blogosphere. But the next day, he gave a different answer during a CNN panel discussion when moderator Soledad O’Brien referenced his earlier response on "Face the Nation." Again, here is a transcript of the pertinent exchange: O’Malley: Here’s the reality of our situation as a country. We are clearly better off as a country because we are now creating jobs rather than losing them. O’Brien: But you said no … O’Malley: But Soledad, we have not recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession. That’s why we need to continue to move forward. Is there anybody on this panel that thinks we’ve recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession? I don’t think anybody could say that. But clearly, we’re moving forward. We’re creating jobs. Unemployment is down. Job creation is up. And those positive movements would not have happened without the president’s leadership. A few days later, on Friday, Sept. 7, O’Malley appeared on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" and said he didn’t mean to say that Americans were not better off when he made his earlier remarks. O’Malley said he had been "word-spliced" on "Face the Nation" and that Americans are indeed doing better. "Yes, of course we’re doing better when America is creating jobs, and we are creating jobs," he said. He again said the United States has not recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession and insisted that is what he was talking about on "Face the Nation." In fairness to Devaney, O’Malley’s appearance on "Morning Joe" happened three days after Devaney had posted his comments on the GOP web site. But O’Malley’s CNN appearance, in which he backed off of his earlier statement, came the day before Devaney had posted his comments. Our ruling During his "Face the Nation" appearance, O’Malley did, in fact, say Americans are not better off than they were four years ago, but he made clear he felt this was the fault of the Bush administration, not Obama’s. He further clarified his beliefs in a CNN interview the next day and in another television interview three days later. In those follow-up interviews, O’Malley said that while not all jobs lost during the recession have been recovered, Americans are still better off because the country is creating jobs instead of losing them. Chairman Devaney correctly cited O’Malley’s original remarks but failed to mention that the governor had said the opposite in subsequent interviews. We understand that, especially in the hyper-partisan atmosphere surrounding a presidential election, politicos are going to cherry-pick comments that make their side look good and the other guy look bad. Still, we rate Devaney’s claim as Half True.	None	Chris Devaney	None	None	None	2012-09-21T14:50:21	2012-09-04	['Barack_Obama', 'Maryland']
pomt-12247	Medicaid "is contributing to 70 percent of our budget deficit right now. It’s the one that is in our lap because of Obamacare."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/12/pat-toomey/medicaid-driving-budget-deficit-pat-toomey-said/	Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., defended the Senate health care bill’s curbing of Medicaid spending by calling Medicaid the single-biggest driver of the federal budget deficit. Toomey said the proposed cuts to Medicaid spending would slow the growth of entitlement programs, which he claimed are "driving the fiscal train wreck we’re on" in a Morning Joe interview on July 10, 2017. Medicaid "is the one that is growing most rapidly, and is contributing to 70 percent of our budget deficit right now. It’s the one that is in our lap because of Obamacare," Toomey said. Is Medicaid the primary culprit behind the federal budget deficit? We found Toomey is playing parlor games with budget figures. 'Misleading' numbers When we asked Toomey’s office for evidence that Medicaid is contributing up to 70 percent of the deficit, they pointed out that spending on Medicaid is equal to 70 percent of the deficit. They divided projections on Medicaid spending in 2017 ($389 billion) by the estimated budget deficit ($559 billions) to get 69.6 percent. The figures come from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. The problem is, that same calculation can be made with any federal program to reach a different conclusion. Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed with Toomey’s arithmetic. But, he said, the framework of the calculation is misleading. "I’m not a fan of creating a link between the deficit and any program, Medicaid or otherwise ... but it happens all the time," Mitchell said. Dividing Medicaid spending by the budget deficit makes little sense to Dean Baker, the co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. By the same logic, Baker said, "since we will spend $634 billion on the military this year, defense spending is more than 100 percent responsible for the deficit. No one would take this argument seriously about the military and the deficit, nor should they take his argument seriously about Medicaid and the deficit." Defense spending would account for 113 percent of the deficit, non-defense discretionary spending 103 percent, and Medicare 101 percent if we were to divide spending by the deficit in the same way Toomey did. "Clearly, there’s something misleading about the calculation you’re making when things are adding up to 300 percent or more," said Ben Sommers, a health policy and economics professor at Harvard University. Toomey’s office made a more nuanced argument about their calculation, though, discussing Medicaid in the context of entitlements and net spending. "Unlike the other entitlement programs, Medicaid has no dedicated revenue stream, so it is taken solely out of general revenue or the deficit. Therefore, when direct revenue streams are taken into account, Medicaid spends the most on net," said Kasia Mulligan, the communications director for Toomey. Medicaid looks worse compared with Medicare or Social Security because its federal share is wholly financed by general revenues, whereas Medicare is partially covered by payroll taxes and premiums, according to Diane Rowland, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. General revenues still help finance Medicare and Social Security, however. Discounting payroll taxes and premiums, Medicare represents 34 percent of the deficit and Social Security 17 percent (using Toomey's rationale). This would make Medicaid the biggest contributor within entitlements, but entitlements aren’t the only contributors to the deficit. Defense spending is also wholly financed by general revenues, and surpasses Medicaid in the amount it contributes to the deficit. "All spending has to be paid for with tax revenue from some source, or it contributes to the deficit," Sommers said. "There’s no way to say that a dollar spent on Medicaid is any more responsible for the deficit than a dollar spent on defense or discretionary spending or anything else the government does." Is the Affordable Care Act to blame? Toomey blamed Medicaid spending on the Affordable Care Act, but the new law isn’t entirely responsible for Medicaid’s entire costs. Elderly people and those with disabilities account for two-thirds of Medicaid spending and low-income children account for one-fifth; two groups that were unaffected by the Medicaid expansion introduced by the Affordable Care Act, Rowland said. Medicaid spending has been growing faster than Medicare or Social Security in recent years, as Toomey said, but per-capita costs are actually growing at a slower rate than for Medicare or private insurance. An increased number of people covered by Medicaid is responsible for higher costs. The cost of this increased coverage was covered by taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act that added to the general revenue so as not to grow the deficit. Toomey’s team told us that he has been concerned about Medicaid spending both before and after the Affordable Care Act. Toomey maintains that Medicaid was not on a sustainable fiscal path even before Obamacare was enacted. Our rating Toomey said that Medicaid is contributing to 70 percent of our budget deficit. The truth is, Medicaid spending annually is about 70 percent of the size of the federal budget deficit. The same logic, if applied to defense spending, would mean defense spending contributes more than 100 percent to the deficit. Experts say both comparisons are flawed and misleading. Blaming the Affordable Care Act for the rise in Medicaid spending isn’t entirely right either, as the majority of Medicaid spending was already in place before the law, and taxes were imposed to offset the Medicaid expansion’s strain on the deficit. Toomey's claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.We rate this statement Mostly False.

Anybody who has bought hamburger lately knows how prices have increased. But did you pay 29 percent more for your Memorial Day meal? And is the president to blame? Bachmann's campaign did not respond to our inquiries for the source of their figures, but Internet searches took us to a New York Post article titled "That cookout will cost you 29 percent more this year." The May 24 story reported that hosts of a typical Memorial Day cookout, which includes a menu of hamburgers, hot dogs, lettuce, tomatoes, potato salad, ice cream and coffee for 12 people, would spend an average of $199 – about 29 percent higher than May 2010. Lettuce prices have increased 28 percent during that time, reporter Paul Tharp wrote in the story. "Want tomatoes on that burger?" Tharp wrote. "It'll cost you 86 percent more than last year." But the 29 percent was based on New York-area prices. Tharp told us in an e-mail that his team got the prices of the selected items at New York area grocery stores and compared them to the May 2010 and May 2011 regional prices listed in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index. The CPI is the country's most widely used measure of inflation. "The BLS came up with the price histories, and our onsite price-checks in supermarkets provided the latest price updates," Tharp said. These numbers showed the average increase at about 29 percent, he said. But PolitiFact found the national numbers were much lower. According to last month's CPI survey, the price of ground beef has jumped 13.6 percent since May 2010. Frankfurters have increased by 8 percent; coffee by 16 percent; lettuce by 7.8; tomatoes by 2.4; and ice cream by 5.6 percent. Potatoes, the main ingredient in potato salad, has increased by 15.9 percent since May 2010. (The CPI survey doesn’t measure potato salad). We averaged those increases and came up with 9.9 percent -- a substantial increase, but much lower than the 29 percent that Bachmann claimed. Overall, food has increased by 3.6 percent from last year, according to the CPI listings. Is Obama responsible for the increase in food prices? Not much. Industry experts told us that food prices are affected by many different factors ranging from weather, energy costs for transportation and production, and supply and demand. Bill Cook, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that environmental conditions, including dry cattle pastures in parts of the United States and droughts in Colombia have affected the price of products like beef and coffee. An increase in the wealth of countries across the globe, especially China and other Asian nations, has boosted the demand for food, driving up costs, Cook said. Experts told us that the occupant of the White House doesn't have much impact on the price of food. "Although policies can have an impact on food prices, it seems to be the case that most ups and downs in food prices over the years are a function of the underlying supply and demand factors that go into the system," said Ephraim Leibtag, deputy director of research for the federal Economic Research Service's food economics division. Lately, high energy costs have also played a big role. The price of fuel, used to process and transport food, has risen dramatically. On May 30, regular gas averaged about $3.74 per gallon across the country – about $1 more than May 30, 2010. President Obama has acknowledged the cost of high gas prices. Last month, he announced efforts to conduct lease sales in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, as well as to extend drilling leases off the Gulf of Mexico and off the Alaskan Coast. But analysts say the president isn’t to blame for the high oil prices. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that tracks energy prices, credits political events in the Middle East and Africa, as well as changes in inventory levels and improving economies across the globe among the factors contributing to the price of crude oil. "Oil prices are responding more to fundamentals in the marketplace, as well as the economic downturn," said Mary Welge, a senior editor with Oil Price Information Service, an industry news publication. "I can't remember the last political decision pertaining to oil companies that might have had a real influence on oil prices." Our ruling Bachmann says Obama is to blame for a 29 percent increase in Memorial Day barbecues, but she's way off on both counts. Her figure comes from a New York Post article that relied on prices in the expensive New York metro area; national figures show the increase was much lower, about 9.9 percent. And she blames Obama for the increase when experts say he and his policies have little, if any, impact on food prices. We find her claim False.

pomt-07947	"The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/25/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-state-union-response-says-us-debt-will-s/	In his response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned that government spending has reached a tipping point. "We face a crushing burden of debt," Ryan said. "The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy and grow to catastrophic levels in years ahead." We at PolitiFact and our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio have both considered essentially identical claims from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The most recent of those statements, which came during a speech in the House of Representatives on Jan. 5, 2011, was that "our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy." In its most basic interpretation, the United States government’s total debt at the start of the year was $14 trillion, according to the Treasury Department’s interactive "Debt to the Penny" website. The size of the United States economy, measured by the gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services, was $14.745 trillion in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent quarter for which data is available. This number comes from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis databases. Using these numbers, it would appear that the eclipse is about to start. But since GDP estimates are not as current as the debt numbers, we wanted to see how big the debt was at the end of the third quarter of 2010. Going back to Treasury’s calculator, we got a debt figure of $13.668 trillion by putting the date at Oct. 31, 2010. That means $13.6 trillion in debt against a $14.7 trillion economy, which to us signals the onset of an eclipse. Economists and analysts who are reading this by now are shouting, "Wait!" We understand. There is an alternative measure of debt known as "public debt," which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself. Using this measure instead, the debt-to-GDP comparisons are much smaller. By the end of 2010, public debt is projected to be 60.3 percent of GDP, and by the end of 2012, it's projected to be 66.6 percent. If current practices aren’t changed, public debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures were cited by President Barack Obama’s national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December. Some economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt, because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector. But one measure "isn’t more 'right' than the other," Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group, told us last March. "Boehner may be cherry-picking, but I don’t think he’s misrepresenting in any way." Even if the smaller number -- public debt -- were to approach a total eclipse in a decade, "to me, that counts as 'soon,'" said Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. That’s because it can take five to 10 years for congressional decisions "to turn the budget ship around," he said. We'll note that these numbers have been growing for decades, roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency. Under Ronald Reagan, debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 33.4 percent to 51.9 percent, and under George H.W. Bush, it grew from 51.9 percent to 64.1 percent. It declined under Bill Clinton, from 64.1 percent to 57.3 percent, before rising from 57.3 percent to 69.2 percent under George W. Bush. It's expected to soar during Obama's first four years from 69.2 percent to 100.8 percent. We'll also note that these numbers could change over the course of the next two years, depending on economic conditions and policy choices. Still, we considered Boehner's statistics valid, and Ryan's formulation is equally solid. So we rate his statement True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2011-01-25T23:59:50	2011-01-25	['None']

pomt-04247	Says the Multnomah County Library system "is the second busiest in the nation."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/16/libraries-yes-committee/mulnomah-county-library-system-second-busiest-nati/	Just over a week ago, voters approved a new library taxing district, securing funding for the Multnomah County Library well into the future. During the campaign to persuade voters to mark "yes" on their ballots, the Library Yes! Committee made a number of arguments in the district’s favor. One of the most ubiquitous was the oft-repeated fact that the Multnomah County Library was the "second busiest in the nation." Given that Portland doesn’t even crack the 25 largest cities in the nation (by population), this fact has always struck us as pretty interesting. During the campaign season, we were a bit distracted with various other claims, but now that things are bit quieter, we thought we’d come back to this one -- if only for curiosity’s sake. We e-mailed Liz Kaufman, who handled media requests for the library district campaign, and she quickly followed up with a handy breakdown of statistics about the Multnomah County Library and its peer institutions, compiled by the American Library Association. The association doesn’t track how "busy" a system is per se, but it does check the circulation -- or the total number of items issued in a given year. By that measure, the Multnomah County system is, indeed, the second busiest with 23,946,498. We followed up with a phone call to the association for good measure and spoke with Macey Morales, their media point-person. She cautioned that their figures came from the Public Library Associations’ survey. "A total of 1,300 libraries from the U.S. and Canada voluntarily complete the survey, so the report reflects a sample of public libraries in North America," she wrote in a follow-up e-mail. That said, the Multnomah County system does have the second highest circulation in the most recent survey. The New York Public Library comes in first -- although to be fair, that system has some 87 branches compared to Multnomah’s 18. A quick aside: We also have the second highest circulation per capita. In that category, we were edged out -- 33 to 34 per person a year -- by Ohio’s Cuyahoga County Public Library. Morales did point us to one other source, the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The institute does a more complete library census, looking at some 9,000 systems. The catch there is that their figures take a while to get published. They’re currently waiting on 2010 figures. A report released by the institute in December 2009, said Multnomah County Library boasted the third highest circulation rate in the country -- there’s no mention of who is first or second. Those figures, of course, would be somewhat dated compared to the other survey -- though potentially more complete. It’s often said that the Multnomah County Library system is the nation’s second busiest. The most recent available statistics from a survey used widely in the industry backs up the claim.

pomt-09202	Halliburton gave Dick Cheney a $34 million payout when he left the company to join the presidential ticket.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/24/chris-matthews/chris-matthews-says-cheney-got-34-million-payday-h/	The oil-services and infrastructure giant Halliburton is a favorite target for critics of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who used to be the company's CEO. During the presidency of George W. Bush, the company's Iraq War-related contracts attracted wide attention. Now, the company's role in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has brought Halliburton back into the headlines. During a May 20, 2010, appearance with Jay Leno on the Tonight Show, MSNBC host and political commentator Chris Matthews revived the Cheney-Halliburton connection while discussing the spill. At one point in the interview, Leno said, "All right, a lot going on in politics with this BP thing. This is the one-month anniversary. Where are we? Who’s the lying scum here?" Matthews responded, "Yeah, it’s the scariest thing I’ve ever seen, and, you know, I don’t know where to start. I mean, Halliburton. Sound familiar? Cheney. Cheney was head of Halliburton. When he got to be vice president, when he was signed for vice president, the oil company gave him a $34 million signing bonus to become vice president of the United States." We'll grant Matthews some artistic license with his comment. We know he doesn't mean that Cheney literally got a signing bonus for becoming the vice presidential candidate, as a newly signed free agent would in baseball. But we thought it was worth checking whether Cheney did in fact end up with a $34 million payout when he stepped down as CEO to join Bush on the ticket in 2000. We looked at a personal financial disclosure form that Cheney signed on Sept. 1, 2000. This is the filing made once someone joins a national presidential ticket. It represents the candidate's holdings and income as of August. In the portion addressing Cheney's compensation from Halliburtion, the file lists the following categories and dollar amounts as of that date: • Salary/bonus (gross): $4,721, 947 • Deferred salary: $1,042, 441 • Senior executive deferred compensation contributions: $654,804 Meanwhile, on May 15, 2001, Cheney also signed a second disclosure form that is supposed to update the August 2000 filing so that it covers the full year. In this filing, Cheney disclosed the following Halliburton income: • Salary/bonus (gross): $821,896 • Elective deferred salary: $403,166 • Stock equivalent unit bonus: $396,213 • Senior executive deferred compensation contributions: $53,692 • Elective deferred salary lump sum payout: $1,140,160 • Restricted stock imputed income: $7,560,000 • Nonqualified stock option income: $21,964,254 • Senior executive deferred compensation payout: $2,797,128 However, we were unclear about whether the totals from the May 2001 filing, which amount to $35.1 million, should be added to those from the August 2000 filing, which amount to $6.4 million, or whether the amounts in the two filings overlap somewhat. Experts we spoke to expressed uncertainty on this question as well. So we decided to take the most cautious approach and only use the numbers from the second filing, which covers the whole year. That still leaves a total of $35.1 million earned from Halliburtion reported on the May 2001 filing. Of that total, just over $800,000 represents salary and bonus, which Cheney would have earned regardless of whether he joined the ticket or not. Many of the other categories were subject to some calculation and/or negotiation, as would happen in the case of any CEO who left a position early, so it seems fair to call the rest of the income he received an exit package. So, if you subtract the salary and bonus from the larger amount, voila -- you get $34 million and change. So Matthews is right. A footnote: Cheney's timing was impeccable. As the disclosure forms indicate, he held a large number of stock options, which means he had been given the right to purchase shares of the company for an old (and, hopefully for the holder of the options) lower price than the current market value. When the holder chooses to exercise those options, they can buy the shares at the low price and then sell them at the market price, pocketing the difference. It's not clear when Cheney sold his stock options, but it likely was within weeks of his being named to the ticket -- a period when Halliburtion shares hit their 2000 peak, in the low-to-mid $50 range. By November 30, 2000, the stock had fallen to $33 a share. If he'd waited until then to sell, his payday would have been one-third lower, or roughly $14 million rather than $22 million. But Cheney does appear to have had timing on his side, so we find Matthews' statement -- that Cheney had a payday of $34 million -- to be accurate. If anything, it may have been a bit low. Either way, we give it a rating of True.	None	Chris Matthews	None	None	None	2010-05-24T17:36:23	2010-05-20	['Dick_Cheney']

pomt-07190	"Rhode Island continues to have the highest rates of substance abuse in the country."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/09/ian-lang/social-service-provider-says-rhode-island-has-high/	When state lawmakers this year took up legislation to create a high school program in Rhode Island for teens in recovery, they heard sobering testimony from the head of the agency that would run it. Ian Lang, chief strategy officer of The Providence Center, a provider of mental-health and substance-abuse services, painted a disturbing portrait of addiction problems in Rhode Island. "Rhode Island continues to have the highest rates of substance abuse in the country," he told members of the Senate Education Committee while describing plans to locate the small school in one wing of the center’s building on Hope Street. Do we really have such a serious substance abuse problem? In his remarks, Lang cited statistics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Its sponsor, the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, says the survey "is the primary source of statistical information on the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco by the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 or older." The survey, begun in 1971, is conducted in door-to-door interviews with a representative sample of the nation’s population. About 900 people in Rhode Island respond annually to the questionnaire, parts of which are administered confidentially with computers. Lang, citing survey estimates, testified that "over 11 percent of Rhode Islanders 12 and over use illicit drugs, the highest rate in the nation, and that Rhode Island has the highest percentage of persons 12 years and over needing but not receiving treatment for illicit drug use, at 3.3 percent. We also have the lowest perceived risk of substance abuse in the country, according to national statistics." When we contacted Lang to discuss the survey results, he did some checking and realized he had actually cited old data. The most recent state-by-state comparison is based on the 2007-2008 surveys. (The federal agency is a couple years behind and will release 2009 data later this year, a spokeswoman said.) Still, Lang said, Rhode Island continues to have among the worst substance-abuse rates in the nation. "I think a lot of it has to do with the location... between Boston and New York and the easy availability of drugs and the urban environment we live in," he said. "It’s a lot easier to get around here than if you were in the middle of nowhere....If you look at our sister states, it’s not just a problem in Rhode Island, it’s a problem in the Northeast," Lang said. We decided to check the survey results ourselves. They turned out to be far more complex than we imagined. And troubling. To begin with, states are not ranked individually. Instead, they are grouped into one of five "quintiles." So when Lang says Rhode Island’s rates are the "highest" in the nation, he’s using the survey definition, which is falling among the 10 worst states in any particular category. We found that Rhode Island not only landed among the worst states in one category Lang cited -- the percentage of those 12 and over who have used illicit drugs in the past month -- we actually had the highest individual score. Rhode Island’s rate was 13.3 percent. (Oregon was second, at 12.1 percent.) We wondered why Lang would select everyone 12 and over instead of focusing on the population that would be served by the recovery high school. The survey, after all, includes a category for youths ages 12 to 17. So how does Rhode Island rank in that category? Still in the highest fifth and, according to our review, second of all states, at 12.4 percent. (Vermont is highest, at 13 percent.) Lang also cited survey estimates of how many people in Rhode Island need treatment for substance abuse, but aren’t getting it. For ages 12 and up, Rhode Island was in the "highest" group (ranking second at 3.9 percent). Again, we checked the rate for those ages 12 to 17, and the state remained in the top fifth, in sixth place at 4.9 percent. Lang also highlighted the study’s examination of attitudes in Rhode Island toward drug use, namely whether people consider monthly marijuana use and weekly binge drinking to be risky. The numbers generally indicate our state is more accepting than others of such behavior. We decided to look into two areas of the survey that Lang didn’t mention, and turned up more troubling statistics. Turns out that Rhode Island topped all states for marijuana use for all age groups: an estimated 10.9 percent of residents 12 and older had used marijuana in the month prior to the survey. It also was tops for alcohol consumption by youth, including binge drinking. Finally, we wondered whether the National Survey Lang cited is really the most authoritative. We put that question to Robert Morrison, executive director of the National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors. "The national survey on drug use and health is one of the most widely used surveys in the country to get a picture of substance abuse in the nation," he told us. In summary, the federal study Lang relied upon has a 40-year history and the statistics he cited were accurate. And when we delved into a variety of other categories from the same survey, we found that in many instances, Rhode Island has the "highest rates of substance abuse in the country" -- an alarming distinction. We rate his claim True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-02280	A poll taken "a few months ago" found "70 percent approval or higher" for the Act 10 collective bargaining law.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/06/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-recent-wisconsin-poll-shows-70-a/	During a radio interview on April 1, 2014, Gov. Scott Walker claimed that a poll taken "a few months ago" showed "70 percent approval or higher" for Act 10, the collective bargaining reform law that spurred massive protests in Madison and an attempt to remove him from office. Statewide polls typically get widespread news coverage. But we don’t recall any recent headlines about 70 percent support for Act 10, which sharply curbs collective bargaining for most public employees and makes the employees pay more for their pensions and health care. Walker's claim is important because he is counting on support for the law in his effort to win re-election in November 2014. So let's see what the governor is talking about. Act 10 Walker largely credits Act 10 for shoring up state and local government finances. The measure has been vilified for repealing most collective bargaining for public employee unions, both at the state and local government levels. But even Walker’s Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, who thinks Act 10 went too far on that score, is among critics who say the law nevertheless took a necessary step in requiring most public employees to pay more for their benefits. Walker signed the bill two months after taking office, in March 2011. Because of reaction to it, he faced a recall election in June 2012. The timing is important in assessing Walker's claim. It has been more than three years since Act 10 became law and nearly two years since it was the focus of the recall. In other words, it hasn't been a hot topic for pollsters for some time. And public opinion can change. The claim Walker made his statement about support for Act 10 to Jay Weber, a conservative radio talk show host at WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee. Weber began the interview by praising a number of Walker’s tax cuts, including a trim to property taxes. Then he alluded to Walker’s race with Burke. Weber cited results from a statewide Marquette Law School poll released on March 26, 2014, six days before the interview, and asked Walker about his approval rating. The poll had shown 47 percent of registered Wisconsin voters approved of how Walker handled his job. That was down from 51 percent in the previous Marquette survey, done two months earlier. The new poll, Weber said, "showed that there was strong approval for the tax cut -- who wouldn’t want their taxes cut? -- but it didn’t translate into a bump in your approval ratings. So, what does that tell you -- you need to sell this before fall?" "Yeah, I think so. I think a combination," Walker said before citing another poll result, albeit with a number of qualifiers. "If you look at that, the previous poll that was taken a few months ago also showed, I think, there was something like -- if I remember right -- something like 70 percent approval or higher for our reforms, the reforms that are commonly called Act 10, the budgetary reforms which allowed not just the state but local governments to balance their budgets as well." Cleaned up, here’s the claim we’re checking: A poll taken "a few months ago" -- so, roughly early 2014, or perhaps late 2013 -- found "70 percent approval or higher" for Act 10. The evidence Neither the March 2014 Marquette Law School poll cited by Weber, nor the January 2014 version Walker seemed to allude to, included any questions about Act 10. So we wondered which survey Walker was relying on to back his claim. Walker press secretary Laurel Patrick told us the governor was referring to a question in the Marquette poll from late May 2012. That's nearly two years ago. That question asked: "As you know, last year a number of changes were made concerning state employees, state spending and policies. For each, please tell me if this is something you favor or oppose -- requiring public employees to contribute to their own pensions and pay more for health insurance?" The results were: Favor – 75%; Oppose – 22%; Don't Know – 3%. On other questions, however, support was not that high: 55% said they favored limiting collective-bargaining for most public employees and 50% said they preferred the change to collective bargaining rather than going back to the old law. (Another school that does regular statewide polling in Wisconsin is St. Norbert College near Green Bay. Like Marquette, it has not polled on Act 10 since May 2012. The results at that time: 59 percent favored allowing public employees to collectively bargain for wages and 60 percent favored bargaining for health and retirement benefits.) In any case, the Marquette results Walker cites are from nearly two years ago, not a few months ago. And no publicly released poll has asked Wisconsinites about Act 10 since then, according to Marquette Law School poll director Charles Franklin and St. Norbert College political science professor Wendy Scattergood, an associate with the St. Norbert College Survey Center Wisconsin. As for what the level of support for Act 10 there may have been a few months ago, Franklin told us the results could be the same, but: "We simply don't know." Our rating Walker said a poll "taken a few months ago" found "70 percent approval or higher" for his Act 10 collective bargaining law. No known poll has asked Wisconsinites about Act 10 in the months leading up to Walker's statement on April 1, 2014, and his staff did not cite one. One poll question from May 2012 found 75 percent support for one part of the law, but what the level of support for Act 10’s various provisions might have been a few months ago is strictly speculation. We rate Walker's statement False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-04-06T05:00:00	2014-04-01	['None']
pomt-08392	Says he "stood up to his own party by voting against the budget to stop runaway government spending."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/23/jim-sullivan/jim-sullivan-says-he-voted-against-his-own-party-s/	In 2006, Wauwatosa Democrat Jim Sullivan won a Wisconsin state Senate seat long held by Republicans and helped his party take back control of the Senate. In the 2010 race, Sullivan faces a tough challenge from state Rep. Leah Vukmir, a Wauwatosa Republican. Control of the Senate is again in play. But Sullivan is running against his own party, declaring in a flier mailed to voters that he "stood up to his own party by voting against the budget to stop runaway government spending." So, is Sullivan a budget-busting maverick? Let’s quickly break down Sullivan’s claim into two parts, then add some context. Sullivan "stood up to his own party by voting against the budget": Sullivan’s campaign said the flier’s reference is to the 2009-’11 state budget, which the Senate approved, 17-15, in June 2009. Sullivan was the only Democrat to vote no. Sullivan’s budget vote was to "stop runaway government spending": Different people may define "runaway" spending differently. The $62 billion budget in question raised spending by 6.2 percent over two years and raised taxes and fees by $1.92 billion. While Sullivan cites a specific vote in his literature, he is making a broader point: that he has worked in Madison to rein in spending. For example, in citing his budget vote in a separate mailer, Sullivan says he "wants our children to inherit a future free of wasteful government spending." So, let’s take a closer look at Sullivan’s record, which in four years includes votes on two budgets and one "budget repair" bill. On the 2007-’09 state budget, approved in the Senate, 18-15, Sullivan voted yes along with the rest of his fellow Democrats. That budget raised taxes and fees by $763.2 million over two years. In February 2009, Sullivan joined the rest of the Senate Democrats to pass a "budget repair" bill. Among other things, it raised taxes on businesses by $215 million and on computer software sales by $66 million over three years. Four months later, Sullivan voted against the 2009-11 budget -- the vote previously noted and cited in his literature. During the course of the budget debate, he did not propose or support any amendments to the 2009-’11 budget that would have reduced spending. We asked Sullivan’s campaign if there were instances, other than his 2009-’11 budget vote, in which Sullivan broke ranks with Democrats in an effort to control spending. The campaign did not provide any. Observers noted that, given the Democrats’ three-vote majority in the Senate, Sullivan’s no vote did not affect the party’s ability to get its budget passed. Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee governmental affairs professor, said the two-year budget bill is the most important vote state lawmakers take. And leaders of the political party in power can exert great pressure on members to ensure that their budget passes. But Lee, a former Democratic state senator, said he also witnessed cases in which a party would not fight an individual senator’s budget vote against the party, if that senator faced a tough bid for re-election. In Madison parlance, it’s called getting a pass. So let’s review. Sullivan is telling voters in a campaign mailing that he "stood up to his own party by voting against the budget to stop runaway government spending." He was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the 2009-’11 state budget, which raised taxes and spending. But Sullivan’s vote didn’t threaten his party’s effort to pass the budget, he made no attempt to reduce spending in the plan and, on the previous budget and a budget repair bill, he voted with fellow Democrats to raise spending. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06628	"The average state pension, including managers, is $23,000 a year; and just $14,000 for local government workers."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/18/hetty-rosenstein/union-leader-hetty-rosenstein-claims-average-pensi/	Public employees in New Jersey have to contribute more toward their pensions, but according to union leader Hetty Rosenstein, the average worker isn’t receiving much money during retirement. Rosenstein, state director of the Communication Workers of America, recently made that claim when hers and other unions filed a lawsuit challenging a new state law that demands workers pay more toward their pension and health benefits. "New Jersey made a promise to its public workers: work hard, serve the people of New Jersey, and take a salary that is less than what you might earn in the private sector – and you can look forward to a secure and stable retirement," Rosenstein said in an Aug. 31 press release. "It is not lavish: the average state pension, including managers, is $23,000 a year; and just $14,000 for local government workers." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Rosenstein’s pension estimates need some clarification. Depending on when workers retired and how long they served, some average pensions are higher than what she claimed. Before we talk about payments, let’s briefly explain New Jersey’s pension system. The state has five major pension funds covering various public workers. Rosenstein told us her figures refer to the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or PERS, the fund covering most CWA members. Data on state workers from the New Jersey Department of the Treasury back up Rosenstein’s claim that her members mostly belong to PERS. Pension amounts vary, depending on a worker’s salary and years of service. On top of pensions, most public workers also receive subsidized health benefits in retirement. Now, let’s explain how Rosenstein arrived at her estimates. Rosenstein referred us to the average payments made by the state under PERS in the year preceding July 1, 2009. According to that data, which includes most retirement types, the state paid, on average, $22,034 to retired state workers or their beneficiaries. The average annual payment made on behalf of retired local workers was $14,028. More recent data show similar average payments. Those figures support Rosenstein’s statement, but looking at state payments is just one way of measuring average pensions. Another way is looking at the average annual benefits due to retirees when they retired. That measurement is different than what Rosenstein cited, because it reflects what workers would be paid on a full-year basis. The state payment data includes part-year payments made to new retirees. When we consider the average annual benefits at the date of retirement, Rosenstein’s numbers fall short for new retirees. As of July 1, 2010, the average annual pension among four types of retirement under PERS was $21,145 for all state retirees and $13,579 for all local retirees. Those figures exclude cost-of-living adjustments granted after retirement. Those numbers are close to Rosenstein’s estimates, but the average annual pension for "new retirees" -- people who had retired within the previous year -- was $30,199 for state workers and $20,075 for local workers. Still, average benefits can be weighted down by people with fewer years of service, said Bill Hallmark, an actuary with the American Academy of Actuaries. To judge the lavishness of a pension, one should consider benefits paid to full-career employees, he said. In fact, Treasury data shows that nearly half of PERS retirees in the two largest retirement groups left their jobs after 25 or more years of service -- and some of those folks are taking home the largest pensions. In the year preceding July 1, 2010, here’s the average annual pensions for new retirees with at least 25 years of service who opted for a special retirement: $39,551 for state workers and $33,828 for local workers. It’s also worth noting that the average annual pension in two other funds covering a small number of CWA members in state government are higher than the estimates provided by Rosenstein. Our ruling Rosenstein claimed average pensions are $23,000 for state workers and $14,000 for local government workers. Her numbers are mostly accurate when you consider the average annual payments made by the state under PERS, and also when you look at the average annual benefits for all retirees at the date of retirement. But new retirees in PERS are receiving larger pensions than what Rosenstein suggested. Also, some CWA members are members of other pension funds where average pensions are even higher.

pomt-05806	Other states have considered or have sunset advisory commissions; the federal government has the ability, too.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/22/bruce-starr/do-other-states-federal-government-have-legislativ/	Oregon Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, was shut down by Democrats on the floor when he tried to extract a dead bill from committee. The legislation? To create a legislative committee to regularly review the need for state agencies, or else the agencies would expire on a rolling basis. In a remonstrance -- otherwise known as an expression of protest or complaint -- he said that such a committee would strengthen the legislative body. "It is, without question, a process that this Legislature hasn’t contemplated in the past," he said. "Other states have. The federal government does. It would allow accountability in the process. Mr. President, and I would urge that in the future legislatures, that we consider this particular issue in a way that would be bipartisan and recognize the goal is to strengthen the Legislative Assembly." Do other states regularly allow agencies to lapse unless lawmakers approve them? Does the federal government have such a commission itself? Majority Democrats in the Senate voted down Starr’s motion without discussion, but the questions for PolitiFact Oregon remained. In a follow-up interview, Starr said he got the idea from Texas, which has had a long-running sunset commission. He also clarified that the federal government does not have one commission overseeing multiple agencies, but that Congress regularly reviews certain spending provisions. And Starr owned up, as he did on the floor, to the reality that he didn’t expect the idea to move. An online search shows that the Texas Legislature created the Sunset Advisory Commission in 1977 "to identify and eliminate waste, duplication, and inefficiency in government agencies." The 12-member commission reviews more than 150 government agencies every 12 years. Florida created one in 2006. California did in 2010. Minnesota followed last year when its 2011 Legislature created a Sunset Advisory Commission, which will periodically review state agencies and make recommendations on whether the agency should continue to exist. Most commissions and boards would expire automatically unless authorized; larger agencies would not expire automatically. "Sunset committees" were something of a trend in the 1960s and 1970s, when many state legislatures were struggling for equal footing with the other branches of government, says Brenda Erickson, a senior research analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 1977, the Oregon Legislature created a sunset committee, the Associated Press reported, and hired staff to review nine state agencies slated to be killed by mid-1980 unless the 1979 Legislature voted to keep them. Legislators voted to kill the committee in 1993. Erickson said many states found the sunset schedule hard to maintain. "Given staff limitations, they found it difficult to keep up," she said. "They modified the sunset review period, and extended it, or removed it and transitioned into this (performance) review." Most states have some kind of legislative authority to audit or review executive branch agencies, according to a 2008 survey conducted by NCSL. According to the Council of State Governments' Book of the States 2011, which uses 2009 data, about half of states have a sunset-type body. Congress is a different story; attempts to create an oversight commission haven’t succeeded. Republicans appear keener on the idea than Democrats. So there is no one commission currently in Congress that regularly reviews the need for federal agencies. But many, if not most, spending provisions for farms, defense, aviation, etc., technically require reauthorization or review every few years to continue. "The federal government does terminate a fair number of programs each year," said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, but generally this is done through the appropriations process. Most of those are "small demonstration projects," he said. The left-leaning group doesn’t like the idea of a congressional sunset commission, but that’s neither here nor there for us. We’re not going to weigh in on whether the idea has merit. Starr said on the floor that other states have sunset oversight commissions, or had considered them. He said that the federal government does. His language on the floor was broad, although the bill in question, Senate Bill 1590, has some very strict dates on abolishing agencies. What do we know? Sunset committees were very popular with state legislatures, then became not as popular, and now may be making a comeback. It’s accurate to say that other states have contemplated the idea or have one. But it’s not accurate to suggest that the federal government has an oversight commission. The ability to review specific spending every few years isn’t the same thing as a broad-based commission with the power to kill agencies. Starr acknowledged as much in an interview with PolitiFact Oregon. His language on the floor was a little foggy and he clarified his comments in an interview. We don’t find this to be a significant piece of missing information, but feel readers should know the difference. We find the statement Mostly True.

pomt-08836	I've shut down pill mills.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/11/pam-bondi/ag-candidate-pam-bondi-says-shes-shut-down-pill-mi/	In the race for the Republican nomination for attorney general, former Hillsborough County prosecutor Pam Bondi continues to contrast her courtroom experience with the political experience of opponents Jeff Kottkamp and Holly Benson. One of the distinctions Bondi makes is that while Kottkamp, the lieutenant governor, and Benson, the former secretary for the Agency for Health Care Administration, can talk about taking on criminals, she's actually done it. Take pill mills for examples. Doctors illegally writing prescriptions for painkillers is a big issue in Florida and has been a focus of current Attorney General Bill McCollum. The issue also has been a centerpiece of Kottkamp's campaign. Though Kottkamp oversees the Governor's Office of Drug Control, Bondi notes that she has been on the front lines as a prosecutor. "You've heard General McCollum talk about pill mills," Bondi said to a group of Republicans on April 28, 2010, in Clay County. "(I) prosecuted them. Dealt with them. Shut them down." She's made the claim, or a claim close to it, several times during the campaign. We heard something similar when Bondi came to speak June 3 to the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club in St. Petersburg. We wanted to see if Bondi, in her nearly two decades as a prosecutor, has shut down pill mills. Bondi worked as an assistant state attorney for Hillsborough County from 1992 to 2009 where she says she prosecuted thousands of cases, including murder, rape and drug cases. Her campaign office said she participated in the prosecution of multiple drug trafficking cases involving prescription medications. "At the time, they weren't called 'pill mills,' but she investigated and charged pain clinic doctors for trafficking and controlled substances," said Bondi spokeswoman Kim Kirtley. Kirtley said Bondi had trouble remembering the names of the specific cases. But the spokeswoman did point PolitiFact Florida to a 2008 case to make Bondi's point that she has shut down pill mills. The case involves Dr. John Mubang, who was arrested in Hillsborough County on July 16, 2008, and charged with trafficking in prescription drugs while he worked as an internal medicine doctor at a Tampa medical facility he owned and operated. According to law enforcement officials, Mubang prescribed controlled substances to patients without a valid medical reason. Medical records show that Mubang prescribed drugs to at least five people who subsequently died from accidental overdoses. The investigation and arrest was coordinated among the state attorney's office, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. We found no reason to doubt Bondi's involvement in the case. Her name, for instance, is included on the FDLE press release announcing the arrest. We should note, however, that Bondi did not represent the state attorney's office at pre-trial hearings. Mubang is currently free on bond awaiting trial. And, here's the rub, he's back to prescribing drugs. Bondi's response: 'Unreal" Bondi called PolitiFact Florida in the middle of filming a television commercial when she heard Mubang was back publicly soliciting clients. "He was shut down. He reopened in a different way," Bondi said. "This helps illustrate the tremendous problems we have with pill mills. The guy is on an ankle bracelet! Can you believe that? It's unreal the problem we have in our state with pill mills." In a front-page story published in June 2010, the St. Petersburg Times updated Mubang's story. "As Mubang awaits ... trial on felony charges of trafficking in illegal drugs and prescribing controlled substances without medical necessity, he is free to keep seeing patients and dispensing drugs," the Times reported. "His state Health Department license record consumers can see online shows not one single blemish -- no complaints, no discipline." The article noted that Mubang was advertising his services in news publications, including the Times' free daily tabloid, tbt*, and has been touting his willingness to see patients without an appointment. "The audacity of a doctor who's currently being prosecuted to go back and do it again is outrageous," Bondi said. The Mubang story illustrates just how hard it can be to permanently shut down pain clinics. Bruce Grant, director of the Governor's Office of Drug Control, describes pill mill doctors as nothing more than drug dealers in white lab coats. The clinics themselves are often run by someone else, who simply finds a down-on-their-luck doctor to write out the prescriptions. Catch one bad doctor, and another can step in. It's difficult, Grant says, to pin a case on the people with the money behind the clinics. And clients are unlikely to testify against a doctor prescribing drugs. In fact, most say the doctor is under-prescribing, Grant says. That means investigations center almost always on undercover work. "These are not easy things to stop," Grant said. "Our laws are set up to allow things to happen, not to stop them." Grant's office and law enforcement officials have started to work closely with the Department of Health to temporarily suspend the licenses of doctors who are believed to be prescribing drugs illegally. Eulinda Smith, a spokeswoman with the Department of Health, provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of the current doctors and health care providers whose licenses have been suspended by emergency action. Mubang is not included. Our ruling Bondi said that as a Hillsborough prosecutor she's shut down pill mills and offered the case of Dr. John Mubang as an example. But Mubang's story highlights how difficult it is to stop pill mills, and in fact, is an excellent example of the problem the next attorney general will face. Mubang was shut down briefly following his arrest, but he's back in business pending trial. To be sure, PolitiFact Florida searched Hillsborough County court records to find other specific cases Bondi may have been involved with. So did Bondi, who maintains that she has prosecuted other cases involving doctors who prescribed medicine illegally. But she couldn't find another specific case for us to analyze. We couldn't either. That leaves us to judge her claim based on the evidence she's provided. As such, we rate Bondi's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2010-08-11T14:52:02	2010-04-28	['None']
pomt-14306	Says Chris Abele "has had five years and he’s done nothing" about the Estabrook Dam.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/01/chris-larson/chris-larson-says-chris-abele-has-done-nothing-abo/	The fate of the Estabrook Dam on the Milwaukee River has played an outsized role during the 2016 campaign for Milwaukee County Executive. That’s especially true because, despite a 6-year-old order from the state Department of Natural Resources to either repair or replace the 80-year-old structure, and a circuit court order declaring the dam a nuisance, the issue has not been resolved. County Executive Chris Abele wants to tear the dam down, but the County Board has voted to repair the structure. When Abele challenger Chris Larson was on the board, he voted to repair the dam, but now says he’s willing to consider removing it because public sentiment seems to have changed. But Larson, a state senator, also has been sharply critical of Abele’s leadership on the issue. Both are Democrats running for the nonpartisan office in the April 5, 2016 election. Abele "has had five years and he’s done nothing" about the dam, Larson said during a March 29, 2016 appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club. That echoed what he wrote in a March 15, 2016 email to supporters: "The current county executive has provided no leadership in forging a consensus on what to do with the dam, he has no urgency in addressing this problem." Is Larson correct that Abele has "done nothing" on the matter? The options There are two major alternatives before county officials. Removal: The Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups, has urged the removal of the dam. They note that the removal of the North Avenue Dam, a few miles downstream, led to improved water quality and a thriving fish and wildlife population. Advocates also argue the Estabrook Dam primarily benefits a small number of property owners who enjoy the impoundment, or lake, that the dam creates. They say that is unfair -- even illegal -- because a public facility is creating benefits for a few private property owners. Repair: The Milwaukee River Preservation Association, a group that includes riverfront property owners, and others, including County Board Chairman Theo Lipscomb, favor repairing the dam. They argue the dam creates an important water recreational area and say its removal could lead to the release of toxins built up behind the structure over the decades. Under orders by the federal government, the county hired a consultant, AECOM, to conduct an environmental assessment of the dam. The $250,000 report, released in early 2015, did not recommend an option. But it did note public sentiment at meetings held in September 2014 was about 2-to-1 in favor of removal and said that over time it would cost twice as much to repair and continue operating the dam than it would be to remove it. The report also cited the environmental benefits to allowing water to flow freely and called removal the most "environmentally protective alternative." The report was conducted during Abele’s tenure, under orders from the federal government, because it was believed, at the time, that the feds owned an island that is connected to the dam. Abele’s tenure There’s considerable disagreement between Abele and some members of the County Board -- especially Lipscomb, who represents the area -- over how to address the dam. If you had to describe Abele’s record on the dam in one word, it would be "hamstrung." On at least two occasions involving the 2015 budget, Lipscomb succeed in getting the board to insert money into the county budget -- first to repair the dam and later to build a fish passage, which is a component of one of the rebuilding options. Abele vetoed both, with one overridden and one sustained. In between the votes and vetoes, Abele’s parks department sent a memo to the board urging it to take action and noting the board itself had changed its position from remove to replace several times. Abele also sent the board a resolution to remove the dam, noting that repairs had become increasingly expensive. And Abele’s chief of staff, Raisa Koltun, followed up with several emails to Lipscomb, but the matter was never scheduled for a vote. Beyond the stalemate with the County Board, Koltun said Abele has worked to forge a consensus with local units of government that have an interest in the dam, including the city of Milwaukee, villages of Shorewood and Brown Deer and the Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewerage District. He has also worked with groups like the Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited and the Milwaukee Riverkeeper, as well as pursued private and federal funding to help pay for the dam’s removal. Our rating Larson says Abele has had five years in office and "done nothing" about the Estabrook Dam, with an earlier statement blaming him for a lack of consensus. But records and news accounts show Abele has been consistent in wanting the dam removed, has taken steps to make his wishes known and to build support for removal among nearby communities and other groups. Along the way, he has been thwarted by the County Board. Larson’s statement was that Abele has done nothing. That rates False.	None	Chris Larson	None	None	None	2016-04-01T14:01:56	2016-03-29	['None']
pomt-00303	Says Brett "Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey exposed for ties to Big Pharma abortion pill maker… effort to derail Kavanaugh is plot to protect abortion industry profits."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/25/blog-posting/no-christine-blasey-ford-isnt-linked-abortion-pill/	Several headlines on the internet claim Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, had an ulterior motive. "Kavanaugh accuser worked for pharma company that sold ‘abortion pill’ for alternative uses," a Sept. 21 headline on Patriot News Alerts read. (Kavanaugh has denied the accusation.) Others took it further. "Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey exposed for ties to Big Pharma abortion pill maker… effort to derail Kavanaugh is plot to protect abortion industry profits," a Sept. 20 headline on Natural News read. Abortion rights advocates worry that Kavanaugh would reverse Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion. These stories suggest that Ford went after Kavanaugh because of a special interest in protecting abortion-inducing drugs. That’s a big stretch. Ford worked as director of biostatistics for Corcept Therapeutics, a California pharmaceutical start-up, from 2006 to 2012, according to an archive of her since-deleted LinkedIn page. Corcept published six papers under her name. But claiming that Corcept sells an abortion pill is like saying a road salt company sells food seasoning. The company sells Korlym to treat Cushing's syndrome, a rare, deadly condition characterized by high cortisol levels. Korlym’s main ingredient, mifepristone, blocks the effect of cortisol. That ingredient has another use. Just like it blocks cortisol, mifepristone blocks progesterone, which is crucial to the development of a pregnancy. In a medication-induced abortion, mifepristone is administered first and another drug, misoprostol, follows. That empties the uterus by causing cramping and bleeding. The latter drug, misoprostol, can and is used alone for abortions. However, the combination of both drugs is typically used for greater effectiveness and fewer side effects. Mifepristone, on the other hand, is not administered alone to induce abortions. In some other countries, it is used alone as emergency contraception, according to Clare Flannery, a professor of endocrinology and reproductive sciences at Yale University. That’s not an abortifacient, according to Flannery, because it plays a role before the sperm and egg implant in the uterus. (Pregnancy occurs after implantation.) In order to induce an abortion in the United States, a low dose of mifepristone is used only once in combination with misoprostol. Korlym patients take up to four times that dose of mifepristone daily for months or even years. Korlym was the first drug the Food and Drug Administration approved for Cushing’s syndrome. "Mifepristone was developed in 1980, but there was so much political concern for its use in aiding abortions, that its other therapeutic potentials were overlooked and companies were nervous to pursue it for other conditions," Flannery said. The company explicitly warns about the drug’s potential to terminate a pregnancy. "Korlym should never be taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant," a banner on the website reads. "Taking Korlym during pregnancy will result in the loss of a pregnancy. A pregnancy test is required before starting Korlym or if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days." Our ruling A headline said, "Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey exposed for ties to Big Pharma abortion pill maker… effort to derail Kavanaugh is plot to protect abortion industry profits." Ford worked for a pharmaceutical company that sells Korlym, a drug that treats Cushing’s syndrome. The main ingredient in that drug is used in combination with another drug to induce abortions, but the doses differ. The company does not promote the drug for abortions; in fact, it requires that doctors rule out pregnancy in order to administer the drug. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-09376	"The average cost for health insurance in Florida went from about $600 a month for an individual to about $150 a month."	false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/29/charlie-crist/crist-touts-cover-florida-cost-saving-health-care-/	In their first U.S Senate primary debate, Gov. Charlie Crist and former House Speaker Marco Rubio bragged about accomplishments and sparred over differences. Crist highlighted his work on Cover Florida Health Care, an effort to provide low-cost coverage to the state's nearly 4 million uninsured, as a way to criticize the health care law recently put on the books in Washington. "The real problems with health care are access and affordability. And we have approached those in Florida," Crist said. "We negotiated with the private sector. We reduced the cost to those who were uninsured. We were able to provide access. And the average cost for health insurance in Florida went from about $600 a month for an individual to about $150 a month. No tax dollars involved. No government mandates. I think Washington could learn a lot from Florida." The program, which was started in 2008, allows individuals who have been without coverage for at least six months to pick from plans offered by six insurance companies. Each provider was chosen by the state through a competitive bidding process, and each offers at least two options — one with catastrophic and hospital coverage, and another plan that can provide less coverage. According to Cover Florida Health Care's Web site, individual plans can be purchased for as little as $23 a month or as much as $800 a month, depending on age, gender and level of coverage. Patients pick and choose between various options offered through the six insurers. So, for example, a woman who is between 19 and 29 years of age can pay $130 a month for a plan that includes no deductible, $10 copays for doctor visits, but no hospital inpatient coverage. Amid the contentious health care debate, Cover Florida has been a go-to talking point for Crist. Already PolitiFact Florida has checked three claims on the plan. In October 2009, Crist said "it's about $900 a month to get health coverage. We've reduced that, on average, to about $150 a month." We found his claim False because he was comparing the cost per family to the cost per individual. In his March 2010 State of the State address, Crist said Cover Florida offers "basic coverage for about $150 a month, instead of the typical $600 a month" We found this claim Barely True because he was cherry-picking the numbers. In a March 2010 radio ad, Crist said "thousands already enrolled and climbing." We ruled this Half True because the program had just over 5,000 participants in December 2009, with a monthly growth under 200. Crist's current claim is nearly identical to the one we checked from his State of the State address. Again, he's more or less correct that some Florida residents can get coverage from Cover Florida for about $150 on average. But the $600 figure for average Floridians still isn't holding water, and an explanation from Crist spokeswoman Andrea Saul isn't all that convincing. First, we wondered if Crist was referring to some sort of Florida-specific average, as his statement in the debate implies. In an e-mail, Saul said he was not. Instead, she sent us an April 2008 press release about Crist's meeting with Floridians struggling to pay health care costs. One participant, Belinda Boncaro, said she paid $670 per month for her health insurance. "The best information is of course from individuals sharing their stories," Saul wrote. In fact, it's likely that the cost of an individual plan is quite a bit lower. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average monthly cost per individual is actually about $400 a month. And a study by eHealth, which offers coverage to people on the individual market when they cannot get employer coverage, said the average monthly cost is $161. That number is lower than the employer-provided cost because the policies typically have higher deductibles or fewer benefits. Also, insurers in the individual market can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. Crist's overall point has some truth to it: You can get basic coverage from Cover Florida for $150. But he's once again done some artful cherry-picking. There are two statewide Cover Florida plans that offer hospitalization -- Blue Cross Blue Shield with an average cost $148 for a single person, and United Healthcare, which averages $327. He chose the lowest figure and a very high number for the private market ($600, when studies show it would cost more in the range of $160-$400). So, in theory, the most expensive plan under the state's program isn't that much less expensive than the national average. Furthermore, his spokeswoman told us that the $600 figure is not a national or even state average. Rather, it's the rough estimate for the monthly cost of one person's health care. And that means it's not a reliable or significant number. Because Crist used two numbers to set up a false comparison that implies Cover Florida Health Care is much less expensive than other plans when it is not, we rate this False.

pomt-10425	McCain "voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/19/moveon/waterboarding-one-aspect-of-larger-measure/	MoveOn.org has targeted Sen. John McCain in a lengthy 10-point e-mail it sent to supporters, urging them to forward it to everyone they know. In its third point, MoveOn brought up the issue of torture: "His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban," the e-mail states. We'll agree with MoveOn that McCain is known as a vocal opponent of torture. He is the rare elected official who has personal experience on this issue: He was tortured when he was a prisoner of war for 5 years in Vietnam. McCain has also been persistent in arguing that waterboarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, is torture. "It's in violation of the Geneva Conventions. It's in violation of existing law," he said at a November 2007 debate in St. Petersburg, Fla. The Bush administration, however, has said that waterboarding is legal under certain circumstances. (It will not specify publicly what those circumstances are.) The Central Intelligence Agency has publicly acknowledged waterboarding. Michael Hayden, head of the CIA, said three people have been waterboarded since Sept. 11, 2001, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, thought to be the mastermind behind the attacks. The CIA has not waterboarded anyone for the past five years, Hayden said. MoveOn's e-mail claiming that McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding refers to a measure passed in February 2008 that would have forced the CIA to follow the Army Field Manual, which specifically forbids waterboarding, as well as other actions: forcing a detainee to perform sexual acts or pose sexually, placing hoods over the heads of detainees, threatening detainees with dogs, or using temperature extremes to cause physical trauma, among other things. McCain opposed the measure on the grounds that the CIA should not have to follow the same guidelines as the Army, and it should have the flexibility to use valid techniques not mentioned in the field manual, McCain said. "None of those techniques would entail violating the Detainee Treatment Act, which said that cruel, inhumane and degrading treatments are prohibited," he told reporters in February, defending his vote. Before his vote, McCain had praised the standards set out in the field manual. "I would hope that we would understand, my friends, that life is not 24 and Jack Bauer," McCain said at the debate in St. Petersburg, Fla. "Life is interrogation techniques which are humane and yet effective. And I just came back from visiting a prison in Iraq. The army general there said that the techniques under the Army Field Manual are working and working effectively, and he didn't think they need to do anything else." MoveOn's statement that the bill McCain opposed "bans waterboarding" is a problematic summation. The bill would have banned waterboarding as one of its effects, but it also would have made other changes to how the CIA conducts interrogations and required the CIA to follow the Army Field Manual. It was not a straightforward up-or-down vote on waterboarding alone. It's true that McCain voted against the measure, it passed anyway and Bush vetoed it. We couldn't find any examples of McCain going out of his way to congratulate Bush. Given the many nuances of the bill, we find MoveOn's claim to be Half True.

pomt-00776	The Georgia Legislature’s last day of session ends at midnight.	false	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/10/david-ralston/session-isnt-over-until-fat-gavel-bangs/	Sine die. Pronounced with a twang under the Gold Dome as sigh-knee die, the Latin phrase refers to the final day of business in the legislative session. The witching hour arrived on sine die in Georgia last week with House members already having celebrated adjournment with cheers and tossing up files the way new graduates throw their caps. Across the hall, though, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle kept the state Senate in session. Minutes after midnight, Senators passed a tax break for Mercedes-Benz that also included as much as $350,000 in breaks for the private Baptist college where the bill’s lead negotiator serves as a trustee. "Typically, the Legislature ends by midnight of the last day so as not to exceed the constitutionally mandated 40-day session," according to Atlanta Journal-Constitution coverage of the last-minute deals. House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, was more blunt in his comments before adjourning that chamber. "For time eternal, this day has ended at midnight," Ralston said. "It is going to end at midnight today in the House even though I understand the other chamber may stay later." On the Senate floor, no one referenced such a deadline. But Ralston’s implication is clear: History dictates the session’s final day -- and eligible votes -- ends at midnight. In a "never say sine die" sort of mood, PolitiFact Georgia jumped in to see whether the vote, and the $1 million-plus in tax breaks (on top of the breaks to the private college) that came with it, will stand. The leap took us back to 1777, the first time the body known as the Georgia General Assembly began operations under direction of the state constitution. The Legislature – made up of both the 180-member House and 56-member Senate – convenes on the second Monday of January every year and "may continue in session for a period of no longer than 40 days in the aggregate each year," according to the state constitution. There are no court cases on the issue, and the state attorney general has never weighed in on how to count those days. But at the request of PolitiFact Georgia, the attorneys who advise lawmakers on legislation and legal issues offered an opinion on how to interpret that mandate. In a letter to Cagle, legislative counsel Wayne R. Allen noted the distinction is that the "days" in question are legislative days, not calendar days. A calendar day would run from midnight to midnight. Under that definition, and with the mandate for an early January start, the Legislature would work only through mid- to late February. It doesn’t of course. That’s because Georgia meets by legislative, not calendar, day. By definition, that is a day in which the body holds a floor session. The day ends only when members vote to adjourn, according to the book "Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure." The Senate could therefore remain operating on legislative Day 40 "without regard to the hour or calendar day," Allen wrote. The National Conference of State Legislatures confirmed that interpretation. At least 11 states besides Georgia limit session length by counting legislative days. The remaining states operate by calendar days or specific dates that lawmakers can meet, said Brenda Erickson, a senior research analyst with the group. "You used to see tactics, like covering the clock or holding it from moving, but the courts have ruled you can’t do that," Erickson said. "And that really applies to those states with a date-specific or calendar day count. " So that famous 1964 photo of state Rep. Denmark Groover from Macon hanging off the House railing, trying to stop the clock during a heated debate on congressional redistricting? It didn’t matter. The clock crashed to the floor in the stunt – but the session continued. Likewise, when House Speaker Tom Murphy grew angry at the governor and state Senate in the 1980s, he was able to stop all business with an adjournment vote before dinnertime, said former state legislator George Hooks, a Democrat from Americus. "It has never created a problem in the past," Hooks said. "You work as needed. You try to make it before midnight, but it doesn’t end until that gavel comes down and we say ‘sine die.’ " So the state Senate’s wee hour vote last week? Ralston implied that there is a midnight deadline for action. Most years, the chambers do end their work before midnight. Legal experts in the state and nationally agree, though, that no such clock watching is needed. Lawmakers meet for 40 legislative days, which end only when the chambers adjourn. We rule Ralston’s statement False.	None	David Ralston	None	None	None	2015-04-10T00:00:00	2015-04-02	['None']
pomt-13874	President Barack Obama attended "an Islamic madrassa."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/05/pat-robertson/pat-robertson-misleadingly-says-obama-was-schooled/	Pat Robertson says President Barack Obama won’t take Islamic nations to task for harboring terrorists, and the big reason dates to the president’s early school years. "The truth is, we have a president, we have a president whose stepfather was a Muslim, whose stepfather, in Indonesia, put him in an Islamic madrassa," Robertson, a religious broadcaster based In Virginia Beach, said during the June 27 edition of his television show "The 700 Club." We checked on whether Obama really did attend an "Islamic madrassa." Let’s start with some basics. "Madrassa" means school in Arabic, but in English, the word has taken on additional connotations. Merriam Webster’s defines it as a "Muslim school, college or university that is often part of a mosque." The Congressional Research Service, in a 2008 report, defined a madrassa as an Islamic religious school. Revelations that some terrorists developed radical political beliefs at madrassas have led to accusations that the facilities "promote Islamic extremism and militancy, and are a breeding ground for terrorism," the research service said. The report also notes that others believe madrassas "have been blamed unfairly for fostering anti-U.S. sentiments." Moments after saying Obama attended an "Islamic madrassa," Robertson added: "Now, Obama has visceral dislike for the standards that we have in this country. What he thinks is, America is an oppressor, and he thinks that the nation of Islam, the Islamic countries, at least should not be in any way called out for the actions that they have." Rumors and charges about Obama’s early education have been circulating since he began running for president in 2007. Generally, they accuse Obama of attending a madrassa espousing a rigid form of Islam that’s hostile to the West. They refer to the president’s school days in Indonesia from 1967 to 1971, when he was ages 6 to 10. In his 2006 autobiography, "The Audacity of Hope," Obama wrote that in Indonesia, he first attended a Catholic school and later went to a "predominantly Muslim school." In an earlier 2004 autobiography, "Dreams from My Father," Obama wrote that he spent two years at a Catholic school and two years at "a Muslim school." He described himself as a youngster who was not very interested in either religion. "In the Muslim school, the teacher wrote to my mother that I made faces during Koranic studies," Obama wrote in 2004. "My mother wasn’t overly concerned. ‘Be respectful,’ she’d said. In the Catholic school, when it came time to pray, I pretended to close my eyes then peek around the room. Nothing happened. No angels descended." When the rumors arose about Obama’s Indonesian education, his campaign issued a news release saying he never was a Muslim and was raised in a secular household. Obama has said he became a Christian in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. Several news organizations sent reporters to the school in question and found it was a public school that didn’t promote one particular religion. "This is a public school. We don't focus on religion," Hardi Priyono, deputy headmaster of the school, told CNN in a 2007 interview. "In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don't give preferential treatment." The school provides some religious study. Priyono told the Chicago Tribune in 2007 that Muslim students learn about their religion, while Christians are taught about their faith. The article said that when Obama attended fourth grade in 1971, there was two hours of religious study a week. "At holidays, the school made a practice of teaching students about different religions," the Tribune reported. "Students from all religions celebrated Christmas with a Christmas tree and carols. They celebrated the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha by handing out a sacrificed goat to the neighborhood's needy." A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs told The Associated Press in 2007 that allegations Obama attended an Islamic school were baseless, saying the future president went to "a public primary school that is open to people of all faiths." We reached out to Robertson for evidence Obama attended an "Islamic madrassa." Chris Roslan, a spokesman for the Christian Broadcasting Network, told us Robertson would address our question on air. On the June 29 broadcast of "The 700 Club," Robertson said he felt a need to clarify his statement. He walked back his previous comments but only up to a point. Robertson paraphrased from Obama’s autobiographical accounts of his time in Indonesia. "He said he spent two years in a predominantly Muslim school in Indonesia where he studied Islam," Robertson said. "So I want to correct that was not a - but in Arabic, a madrassa is a school. That’s what the term in Arabic is. You say ‘school,’ and it translates as ‘madrassa,’ but it’s become now a training ground of Islamic, and apparently, we’re not sure that the president attended one of them, so I want to correct that and let everybody this is precisely what he said - ‘I went to a predominantly Muslim school in Indonesia’ where he studied Islam," Robertson said. Co-host Wendy Griffith said, "He studied Islam, but he says he’s a Christian." "Yeah, well sure," Robertson replied, raising his palms. Our ruling Robertson said Obama attended an "Islamic madrassa." The Congressional Research Service notes that madrassas are Islamic religious schools and in recent years sometimes have been defined as breeding grounds that promote Islamic extremism and terrorism. Robertson plays bait-and-switch with definitions. He says the president attended an "Islamic madrassa" while accusing him of being weak on terrorism, protective of Islamic nations, and viewing the U.S. as "an oppressor." He dials it back when pressed for details, noting that madrassa, in Arabic, simply means "school." Robertson has a slight leg to stand on in that Obama, as a child in Indonesia, went to a public school where a majority of the students were Muslim. In a 2004 memoir, Obama described it as a "Muslim school." And the future president, as part of the curriculum, spent two hours a week in classes about Islam. But Robertson doesn’t tell his viewers the larger part of the story: The school was non-sectarian; it celebrated Christian and Islamic holidays; and that the school offered separate religion classes where Muslim and Christian students could learn about their faiths. So we rate Robertson’s misleading statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/604c3bd5-ce40-4a99-ab56-76cc73b7713f	None	Pat Robertson	None	None	None	2016-07-05T08:52:44	2016-06-27	['Islam', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-05402	"When housing and transportation costs are combined, Atlanta’s cost of living -- typically perceived as relatively low -- ranks as 7th worst out of 51 metros nationally."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/04/citizens-transportation-mobility/atlanta-cost-living-worse-advertised-group-says/	If you think living in the Atlanta area is cheaper than more glamorous metros like New York City or Los Angeles, Citizens for Transportation Mobility has some bad news for you. The cost of getting around town is so high that it’s not, according to a 20-page advertising supplement the advocacy group published in Georgia Trend magazine. This, they argue, is one reason metro Atlanta needs to support a 1-cent sales tax to fund an overhaul of the region’s transportation system. "When housing and transportation costs are combined, Atlanta’s cost of living -- typically perceived as relatively low -- ranks as 7th worst out of 51 metros nationally," the ad said. Seventh-worst? And here we were, feeling smug about paying less for a mortgage on a three-bedroom house than our Yankee cousins shell out to rent a studio apartment. Is this true? If voters approve this tax hike July 31, it would raise an estimated $7.2 billion to build transportation projects across the region. About $1 billion would go to projects with a more local focus. Backers argue the transportation special local option sales tax, also known as T-SPLOST, would reduce congestion and bring jobs to town. Opponents think it would cost too much and pay for the wrong projects. We fished around for data on Atlanta’s cost of living and found a new but widely used measure called the "H+T Affordability Index." Certain urban planners consider it to be a better measure of a town’s cost of living because it takes transportation into account. It’s published by the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a Chicago-based nonprofit that researches and promotes "sustainable" communities, or ones designed to provide a better quality of life, help the environment and be affordable. Its index is based, in part, on mathematical models. The U.S. Census Bureau tracks yearly costs for housing but not transportation. So the index uses mathematical models created with the help of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution to estimate transportation costs. The methodology was peer-reviewed and published by an academic journal in 2008. The index has been well received. Last year, the planning agency for the Washington area used the H+T approach to study that region’s affordability, while the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it is building on the model to create its own affordability index. In February, the Center for Neighborhood Technology released a ranking of annual transportation costs for the nation’s 51 metro areas with populations of 1 million and up. It found that if a typical American family moved to the New York City metro area, they’d spend nearly $10,160 per year on transportation. That’s the cheapest on the list. The most expensive is Birmingham. If a typical family moved there, their costs would rise to $14,930. Atlanta is eighth-highest, or one notch less expensive than Citizens for Transportation Mobility said in its ad. Yearly costs topped $14,300, But this particular H+T ranking addresses transportation costs only -- not housing and transportation costs combined. The group, however, does have that information. So we built our own list. Incomes, the price of housing, the number of cars a household owns and other factors vary by metro area. This means that comparing dollar values for these expenses may shed little light on the true impact of these costs. A better approach is to look at what percent of income a typical metro household spends on housing and transportation. The H+T index calculates these percentages, so we ranked them for the nation’s 51 largest metro areas. Our analysis found that metro Atlanta ranks as the 16th-most-expensive area in the country. The typical metro Atlanta household spends more than 52 percent of its income on housing and transportation combined. This is higher than the national average, which is slightly more than 51 percent. The Washington metro area was the cheapest at 43 percent. Households in the Miami area spend the most at 60 percent. Some areas of metro Atlanta are vastly more affordable than others, according to the index. In parts of the Roswell area, households spend nearly 80 percent of their incomes on housing and transportation. In parts of downtown Atlanta, that number plummets to 21 percent. In short, Citizens for Transportation Mobility missed the mark. Its ad said that metro Atlanta is the seventh-most-expensive major metro area when you consider housing and transportation costs combined. It’s not. Metro Atlanta is the 16th-most-expensive, according to H+T index data. Sixteen out of 51 isn’t great. And it reinforces the group’s overall point that transportation costs significantly add to the cost of living in metro Atlanta. But it’s not as bad as Citizens for Transportation Mobility said. It earns a Half True.	None	Citizens for Transportation Mobility	None	None	None	2012-05-04T06:00:00	2012-04-16	['None']

pomt-09254	Says in 2003 Texas cut "$10 billion out of the entire budget, yet we put $1.8 billion more into public education. We put $800 million more into health and human services."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/may/05/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-2003-texas-cut-10-billion-budg/	Though state lawmakers could confront a projected revenue shortfall of more than $11 billion when they come into session in January, Gov. Rick Perry rejects "the idea that Texas is going to hell in a hand basket." Been there, done that when the state closed a similar gulf in 2003 and cut "$10 billion out of the entire budget," Perry said in an April 15 interview with the online Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine. "Yet," Perry said, "we put $1.8 billion more into public education. We put $800 million more into health and human services." That's some triple play: $10 billion in budget cuts while pumping an additional $2.6 billion into schools and health and human services. Are those numbers on the money? Perry has talked up those cut-and-spend results before, although the spending totals he floated were lower. In a June 2003 opinion piece sent newspapers, for instance, Perry wrote that despite the "tough budgetary times, we increased spending on vital health care programs by $1.1 billion and on public education by $1.2 billion." Let's start with the budget cuts he proclaims in the Tribune interview. Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's re-election campaign, told us Perry was referring to closing the $10 billion revenue shortfall that Texas faced in 2003 — "not literally cutting those funds from the budget." In January 2003, lawmakers started the legislative session in a ditch after State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn issued a grim forecast, saying state revenues for the 2004-2005 budget period would fall short of estimated expenditures by $7.4 billion. Add looming expenses — a health plan for local school district employees plus projected health and human services needs — and the state was facing a $9.9 billion state revenue shortfall, Strayhorn said. To cover the projected shortfall in the months remaining in the 2003 fiscal year, the Legislature trimmed $1.4 billion in budgeted state spending, while spending $450 million from the rainy day fund. Lawmakers also passed a 2004-2005 budget that appropriated $1.8 billion less in state funds than had been spent during 2002-03, according to the Fiscal Size-up published by the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on state spending. They added $811 million from the rainy day fund. And they used $1.3 billion in federal aid, part of fiscal relief made available to states in response to economic difficulties in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001. Other steps: Members voted to extend a tax on telephone customers originally levied to pay for technology in schools and hospitals, raise fees for certain state services and use creative accounting to defer state payments to the next budget period.. So, the Legislature closed the $10 billion shortfall in 2003 via various mechanisms. Their cuts in state spending totaled $3.2 billion. Next, let's look at whether the 2004-2005 budget gave additional aid to public schools ($1.8 billion) and health and human services ($800 million), as Perry says. Frazier noted that the state ended up spending $34.8 billion on public education in 2004-05, up $1.9 billion from 2002-03, according to the Fiscal Size-up. Unsaid: the 2004-05 budget signed into law by Perry in 2003 only provided for an $893 million increase in public education spending. The additional $1 billion he touts wasn't available when the Legislature was balancing that budget — it came from supplemental appropriations and additional federal aid doled out by the 2005 Legislature. Another wrinkle: State funds don't account for any of the $893 million increase that Perry mentions. In fact, the 2004-05 budget cut state expenditures on public schools by $1 billion. According to the Fiscal Size-up, the budget made up for that cut (and more) thanks to a $1.3 billion infusion of federal education aid. Next, let's look at health and human services. Frazier pointed out that overall spending on health and human services increased by $1.3 billion in the 2004-2005 budget, according to the Fiscal Size-up, which is more than what Perry said in his recent interview. Some 77 percent of that increase was federal funds (for items like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program). According to the Fiscal Size-up, lawmakers appropriated $6.8 million less in state funds for health and human services than was spent in the 2002-2003 budget. Whew. Where does this leave Perry's recent statement? As Perry's campaign notes, Perry did not sign off on $10 billion in budget cuts in 2003, contrary to what he said in April. All in all, the Legislature trimmed $3.2 billion in total spending for the 2004-2005 budget cycle, counting $1.4 billion cut from the 2003 budget. What about Perry's claims about boosting the budget for education and health and human services together by $2.6 billion? We find that total funding in those categories in the 2004-05 budget increased by $893 million and $1.3 billion, respectively — not quite what Perry claims. Federal funds fueled the increases, enabling lawmakers to appropriate $1 billion less in state money to public education and $6.8 million less to health and human services. We rate Perry's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Former presidential candidate and conservative pundit Pat Buchanan credits Trump’s rise in part to his willingness to address one of the country’s hottest issues. Appearing July 26 on NBC’s Meet the Press, Buchanan said people are feeling the "conquest of the West by massive third-world immigrations coming from refugees and border jumpers and all the rest of them." José Díaz-Balart, host of MSNBC's The Rundown with José Díaz-Balart and a Telemundo anchor, challenged Buchanan’s comments during the show’s panel discussion with some food for thought. "The invasion is from within," Díaz-Balart said. "The majority of the Hispanic population and the growth is U.S.-born." He added, "Sprinkle that on your oatmeal, or probably on your huevos rancheros." We wanted to check his points: Are most Hispanics in the United States born here? And do U.S. births account for the majority of the growth in the Hispanic population? The answer to both questions is yes. U.S. Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein directed us to the latest information available from the American FactFinder. There were about 54 million Hispanics in the United States in 2013. Of this number, about 32.9 million were born in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, which works out to 61 percent of the overall Hispanic population. Another 2.1 million are considered native to the United States, meaning they were born in Puerto Rico, abroad to American citizens or on a U.S. military base. Adding in this group brings the share of U.S.-born Hispanics to 65 percent. Either way you read it, Diaz-Balart’s point stands. The trend holds when measuring the Hispanic population’s growth from July 2013 to July 2014. Over the course of the year, the Hispanic population increased by about 1.2 million. The natural increase (which refers to the number of domestic births minus the number of deaths) accounts for about 73 percent of this 1.2 million population jump. An additional note: These numbers include both documented and undocumented Hispanics. According to Bernstein, the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask about an individual’s legal status, so these specific divisions cannot be determined. Our ruling Díaz-Balart said, "The majority of the Hispanic population and the growth is U.S.-born." Census Bureau data support him on both counts. We rate his claim True.

pomt-15154	"We’re the most highly taxed nation in the world."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-most-highly-taxed-nation-worl/	During a recent interview on Fox & Friends, Donald Trump offered a digression on tax policy -- at times an unorthodox one, at least for a Republican. For instance, Trump said that hedge fund managers -- some of them the billionaire counted as "friends" -- are "not paying enough tax." He also rejected a flat tax, an idea supported by some Republicans, countering that progressivity in the tax code is important. "As you make a certain amount of money, I think you should have to graduate upward" in tax rates, Trump said. Then he shifted gears again, articulating a more traditional Republican argument in favor of lowering taxes. "Look, we’re the most highly taxed nation in the world — that’s why taxes have to go down, business has to come back, jobs have to be back," he said. A reader asked us if the United States is the "mostly highly taxed nation in the world," so we decided to check it out. Trump’s press office did not respond to an inquiry. We should note that a more specific claim would have been largely accurate. We have given a Mostly True rating to the claim that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. (The statutory corporate tax rate ranks as the world's highest, but widespread deductions and exclusions tend to lower the effective rate below the comparative level for other countries.) But Trump's comment doesn't cite the corporate tax rate, and he seemed to be discussing overall tax rates when he said the United States is "the most highly taxed nation in the world." When we asked tax experts what they thought was the best yardstick for comparing different countries, they pointed to two possible criteria. One was tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The other was tax revenue per capita. Both measures are calculated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 advanced industrialized nations. We found that for both measurements, many of the United States’ industrialized peers had higher levels of taxation in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available. Taxes accounted for about 25 percent of the United States’ gross domestic product -- but if that sounds like a lot, it was only enough to rank the United States 27th out of 30 countries studied. The five with the highest percentages were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Sweden, each of them with taxation accounting for more than 42 percent of gross domestic product. Only South Korea, Chile and Mexico had lower levels of taxation per GDP than the United States. When looking at tax revenue per capita, the United States ranks somewhat higher, but still far from the top. Taxes per capita in the United States totaled $13,482, according to the OECD data. That ranked 16th out of 29 countries for which data was available for 2013. The five with the highest per-capita amounts were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, with amounts ranging from $23,000 to $48,000. Eleven countries had per-capita amounts less than $10,000, including Hungary, Chile and Turkey, the bottom three on the list. While it probably makes the most sense to compare the United States to other advanced, industrialized nations, there is one additional data source that includes the full roster of countries -- the World Bank. In the World Bank’s comparison of 115 countries for 2012, the U.S. ranked 12th from the bottom in taxation as a percentage of GDP. Among the countries with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), some wealthy oil-producing nations (Oman and Kuwait) and handful of very poor countries (including Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). Bottom line: Trump is wrong by all the data sets we looked at. Our ruling Trump said the United States is "the most highly taxed nation in the world." Depending on the measurement you use, the United States is either in the middle of the pack or on the lighter end of taxation when compared to other advanced industrialized nations.

pomt-02922	Passage of a referendum on an aquarium for Clearwater means "NO future funding for our neighborhoods."	false	/florida/statements/2013/nov/02/friends-clearwater-pac/aquarium-referendum-means-no-more-money-neighborho/	On Tuesday, Clearwater voters will decide whether the city charter should be amended to allow officials to begin negotiations with the nonprofit Clearwater Marine Aquarium for a lease of city-owned property downtown where a $160.5 million aquarium could eventually be built. Supporters and opponents have filled mail boxes with rival fliers touting the benefits or risks of the idea. One recent flier paid for by the Friends of Clearwater political action committee, which opposes the aquarium idea, lists eight reasons to vote no. One particular reason in the list caught our eye: "NO future funding for our neighborhoods." PolitiFact Florida decided to fact-check the claim that if the referendum passes, there will be no future funding for Clearwater neighborhoods. Officials we spoke with said the statement is false, and even opponents admit it is based on speculation. "That’s just a bizarre statement," said Howard Warshauer, a longtime activist and vice president of the Clearwater Neighborhoods Coalition. Warshauer opposes the aquarium plan, but said the mailer’s cut-and-dried claim is inaccurate. "Obviously, the city will go on funding neighborhoods," he said. Clearwater Marine Aquarium officials have said they intend to ask for city funds from two sources if the plan to build the aquarium advances: the city parking fund and a portion of taxes raised in the downtown Community Redevelopment Area. The city parking fund isn’t typically used for neighborhood projects, which are things such as parks, recreation facilities, traffic calming and community policing. The city uses the parking fund for parking projects and Clearwater Beach lifeguards. The city is planning to use parking fund money to build a downtown parking garage — a project which presumably would benefit the downtown neighborhood. What about the aquarium’s potential use of property taxes raised in the downtown CRA? Would that mean "No future funding for our neighborhoods"? The money the aquarium wants would come from the annual tax increment raised in the district. The tax increment is new tax revenue collected if property values rise after the date the district is established. This year, that was $1.7 million in the downtown Clearwater district. CMA plans to ask the city for half of that increment revenue for 20 years, but would need the agreement of city and county officials. By state law, that money can’t be spent outside the boundaries of the district, which are roughly Drew Street on the north, the waterfront to the west, Chestnut Street to the south and Highland Avenue to the east. So Countryside, Island Estates, Sand Key, Morningside Estates or any other neighborhood outside the district wouldn’t be eligible for that money anyway. But Warshauer says a broader argument about the proposed aquarium’s financial impact on neighborhoods has some validity. "There is an unknown factor here. How much money is going to be spent on traffic impact if this aquarium is built and if it is successful?" Warshauer said. CMA officials contend that a successful aquarium will increase property values downtown, therefore pouring more tax increment revenue into city coffers and helping to pay for any infrastructure improvements downtown necessitated by a successful tourist attraction. Tina Wilson, the city’s budget director, said the city has $1.8 million budgeted for street resurfacing citywide. If streets needed to be improved because so many people were drawn to the aquarium, the costs could be paid for out of the resurfacing fund, any available tax increment revenue, or a variety of other funds, including reserves, the Penny for Pinellas sales tax or the general fund. But the city hasn’t discussed options yet, Wilson said. No one, including referendum opponents, has a crystal ball to predict what the city will spend in future years for neighborhood projects or for downtown improvements. But since the aquarium plan is to seek only half of the increment revenue, and only for 20 years, the remaining half of that revenue would theoretically remain available for projects benefitting the downtown neighborhood. And use of those dollars downtown wouldn’t hurt other neighborhoods in the city, since those dollars can’t legally be spent elsewhere. There is no proof that approval of Tuesday’s referendum — which would only authorize the city to negotiate a lease and doesn’t ensure construction of the aquarium — will mean no future funding for Clearwater neighborhoods. The opponents’ statement is based on speculation, with no foundation in fact. We rate it False.	None	Friends of Clearwater PAC	None	None	None	2013-11-02T18:00:00	2013-10-21	['None']

pomt-13724	Says he and Bernie Sanders have "very similar" views on trade	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-and-bernie-sanders-are-very-s/	The same day the Democratic National Convention opened and Bernie Sanders supporters booed Hillary Clinton in large numbers, Donald Trump sought in North Carolina to win over some of those unhappy Democrats. When it comes to trade policies, Trump is feeling the Bern. "We have one issue that’s very similar, and that’s trade," Trump told The News & Observer before a campaign rally in Winston-Salem on Monday. "He and I are similar in trade." Trump has been trying this tactic out since it became clear he and Clinton would be squaring off in the general election. Last month, Trump even quoted Sanders in attacking Clinton. And in Winston-Salem, a city which has seen many of its tobacco and textile factory jobs wither away over the past few decades, Trump further embraced Sanders’ views. Both men have said some of the country’s major trade deals hurt blue collar workers. But we wanted to look into whether their opinions on what’s good, what’s bad and what should be done really are "very similar," as Trump said. NAFTA One of the most well-known trade deals, the North American Free Trade Agreement, passed in the U.S. with bipartisan support in 1993 and went into effect in 1994. It repealed tariffs, which are taxes on imports, for goods shipped between Mexico, Canada and the United States. Democratic President Bill Clinton signed it after his Republican predecessor, George H.W. Bush, started the negotiations. Both parties supported it in Congress. Now, however, it’s facing bipartisan opposition. Both Trump and Sanders have used the word "disaster" to describe NAFTA, saying it has led to the loss of hundreds of thousands American jobs. They have different philosophies for dealing with it, however. Trump has suggested directly violating the terms of NAFTA by setting a 35 percent tariff on goods imported into the United States from Mexico. "We will either renegotiate it or we will break it," Trump said in September. Sanders has said he would renegotiate NAFTA but wouldn’t violate it. "I believe in trade," Sanders said in April. "But I believe in fair trade, not unfettered free trade." TPP Both Trump and Sanders have criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal between 12 countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. Like NAFTA, it would cut tariffs in an effort to spur trade. It was signed earlier this year but has not yet gone into effect. Opposition to the TPP is a key position of the AFL-CIO. It’s not often that Republican presidential nominees find themselves agreeing with organized labor, but in this case Trump does, as does Sanders. Their solutions are the same: The United States should withdraw. They both cite some of the same worries, like the loss of American jobs, concerns about ultra-low wages overseas and the increasingly powerful role of the United Nations. "U.S. sovereignty will be undermined by giving corporations the right to challenge our laws before international tribunals," Sanders wrote in a policy paper on the TPP. "It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own," Trump said in a speech last month. China Both Trump and Sanders accuse China of manipulating the value of its currency. The U.S. Treasury hasn’t officially done so, although in April it put China on watch along with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Germany. Both also criticize China’s inclusion in the World Trade Organization and the normalization of U.S.-China trade relations in 2000. They differ in how to use domestic policy to bolster the U.S. position, however. Trump said the U.S. should lower its corporate income tax rate to better compete with China and keep jobs here. Sanders disagrees and would collect more corporate tax revenue in order to create jobs via new infrastructure projects. They also differ in the longevity of their anti-China views. Trump has, for years, outsourced labor to China for various Trump brand products – Trump ties, cufflinks and some shirts are made in China, PolitiFact found recently. Trump has explained his avoidance of American manufacturing companies by saying "they don’t even make this stuff here." However, our friends at FactCheck.org found that to be false. Sanders has opposed the normalization of trade relations with China since the start. Then-Rep. Sanders said on the House floor in 2000 that "it is not a good deal for American workers. American workers should not be asked to compete against desperate people in China who are forced to work at starvation wages, who cannot form free trade unions, who do not even have the legal right to stand up and criticize their government." Our ruling Donald Trump, in an effort to win over Bernie Sanders supporters, said their policies on trade are "very similar." There are some notable differences. Sanders has always opposed normal trade with China. Trump says he’s opposed, although he outsources some of his own manufacturing to China. The two also have different ideas for dealing with NAFTA and on the role corporate tax policy plays in trade. Yet in the grand scheme of things on the campaign trail, both men have consistently argued for protectionist trade policies as opposed to free trade. Some details differ, but they agree on the broad philosophy of opposition to free trade deals.

A headline on the US Political website states, "Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by the Clintons." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Our efforts to reach the writer were unsuccessful. "Why would Brazile have to fear for her life after the Rich murder — if, as we’ve been told, it was simply a robbery gone bad?" states the article. "Does she suspect someone of the murder? Does she suspect the Clintons?" We found nothing in Brazile’s recent book that pins the Rich murder on the Clintons. Near dawn on July 10, 2016, 27-year-old Rich was found with two fatal gunshot wounds near his home in Washington, D.C. Rich was had been working on voter access projects for the DNC. Weeks later, Rich’s death became intertwined with WikiLeaks after it released hacked emails from the DNC. WikiLeaks head Julian Assange suggested in a Dutch television interview that Rich might have been murdered. In "Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House," Brazile wrote about the grief and fears she felt in the aftermath of Rich’s murder, even closing the blinds in her office so a sniper couldn’t see her. Brazile wrote that she felt some responsibility for Rich’s death. "I didn’t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights," she wrote. She speculated about the motivation behind his shooting but wrote that police believed he was a victim of a robbery. "With all I knew now about the Russians’ hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder," she wrote, though stating that the FBI told her they didn’t see Russian fingerprints on the case. "Besides that, racial tensions were high that summer and I worried that he was murdered for being white on the wrong side of town." She also wondered "had he been killed by someone who had it out for the Democrats? Likely not, but we still didn’t know." Brazile dismissed the WikiLeaks conspiracy theory: "Some Trump supporters were promoting the baseless conspiracy theory that Seth had been murdered by the DNC because he was the one who had leaked our emails to WikiLeaks." We attempted to contact Brazile through her website but did not get a reply. The headline on the US Political website states "Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by the Clintons." The article refers to Brazile’s book in which she speculates on the motivations behind the DNC staffer’s murder, but she doesn’t point the finger at the Clintons. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-08549	A bill to save teacher jobs is completely paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes.	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/01/zack-space/space-forgets-mention-food-stamp-cuts-letter-anti-/	Short-term memory loss was rampant among many Democrats in Congress in August, when they passed a $26 billion bill to provide money to help states avert teacher layoffs and health program cuts. They said the measure was paid for entirely by closing corporate tax loopholes, and they studiously avoided mentioning an even bigger source of money for the bill: a nearly $12 billion cut in future food stamp spending. Taking money from the poor to pay for teachers was not a discussion they relished. Memories have not improved over time, as a Sept. 2 letter from U.S. Rep Zack Space shows. Space, from Ohio’s 18th Congressional District, wrote to Jack Frech, who heads the Job and Family Services agency in Athens County, to defend the legislation after Frech called and left message for the east-central Ohio congressman. Space responded by saying the bill is "providing badly needed funding for teacher jobs." Frech had worried about the growing ranks of poor and low-income Ohioans in this sluggish economy. But the activist in him got especially fired up when he learned that Congress was going to help states and local communities meet their needs for teachers and health care providers who serve the poor -- while cutting back on an earlier expansion of food stamp spending. So he contacted Space, and Space responded with his letter on Sept. 2. Space wrote that threatened teacher cuts, and their effect on students, would have been "intolerable." Three hundred teachers in his district alone had been in jeopardy, Space wrote. "This bill will save teacher jobs immediately, and it is completely paid for -- by closing an egregious tax loophole that encourages American companies to ship jobs overseas," Space’s letter said. "It goes without saying that we could badly use that money here at home to ensure all our children get a decent education. I refuse to support policies that sell out our children, our future, to overseas corporate interests." Space told Frech in the letter that " I recognize that you had reservations about this provision; however, I wasn’t elected to simply stand on the sidelines while Ohio teachers are pushed out of the classroom." This sounds noble enough. For purposes of discussion, PolitiFact Ohio will put aside any dissent from Republicans over whether the move to save local teacher jobs was the right thing for Congress to do at this time, because that’s not Frech’s point. Nor is his point whether a teacher-layoff crisis really loomed, a debate that continues with a recent Columbus Dispatch survey of the state’s largest school districts that found many had no layoff plans and put the money aside in case they need it later. Frech’s complaint is simpler: Did Congress really have to take the money from a program that helps the poor? Couldn’t it have found the money somewhere else? Because we were in touch with Frech when reporting on this issue this summer, Frech shared the letter with us, as he has with others. Frech is a leading anti-poverty voice in southeastern Ohio. So what of Space’s claim in the correspondence that the teacher bill was completely paid for by closing the corporate loophole? The Plain Dealer has been through that one before, and noted its fallacy on Cleveland.com. PolitiFact’s national operation has been through it, too, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the same claim in a press release. As PolitiFact said on Aug. 13, several days after Pelosi’s statement: "According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, the corporate tax changes in the bill that Pelosi is referring to will amount to $9.8 billion between 2010 and 2020. These are a mix of tax policies that only a CPA could understand, from ‘rules to prevent splitting foreign tax credits from the income to which they relate’ (worth almost $4.3 billion in newly captured revenue) to ‘denial of foreign tax credit with respect to foreign income not subject to United States taxation by reason of covered asset acquisitions’ (worth more than $3.6 billion), to ‘limitation on the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to section 956 inclusions’ (worth $704 million). "But that $9.8 billion in corporate tax cuts won't cover the full $26 billion cost of the bill. The bulk of the money comes from something Pelosi's office chose not to mention in the press release -- almost $12 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (more commonly known as the food stamp program) beginning in 2014. Another $1.1 billion would come from cuts to advanced refundability of the earned income tax credit starting in 2011. The earned income credit is a tax credit that benefits the working poor. Several billion dollars more would come from a variety of spending cuts known as rescissions." Pelosi and other Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, have said separately that they hope to restore the food stamp funding before the cuts kick in in 2014. And Pelosi’s office in July at least offered a fact-sheet on the teacher bill’s funding that included the food stamp cuts. Space’s letter to Frech was silent on that, however. PolitiFact gave Pelosi’s statement a Barely True rating, noting that at least her office had provided details of the food stamp cuts in other settings. But we have seen no instances of Space acknowledging the food stamp cuts. Space, like most other Ohio Democrats, was silent on the cuts when a group of the Ohio members held their own news conference after the Aug. 10 vote, hailing its passage. Had Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights not broken that press conference silence by mentioning the cuts, the lawmakers would have moved on without breaking stride. That’s not saying they are happy to pare back federal spending on the poor. When the subject is brought up by reporters, most say they voted for the bill reluctantly, choosing among the limited options that congressional leaders and the White House gave them -- options they say they were forced to swallow in order to make the bill budget-neutral. That was the only way to win key Republican votes in the Senate. Stuart Chapman, chief of staff to Space, told us in an e-mail that "no one has been a more aggressive advocate for the dispossessed in in Southeastern Ohio than Congressman Space." Space has fought for other anti-poverty programs, he said, a point reiterated by a phone call we received soon after speaking with Chapman, from Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Second-Harvest Foodbanks. Hamler-Fugitt said that Space works hard to help the poor. But Hamler-Fugitt agrees with Frech’s point as well -- that "we’re all outraged" at the way the food-stamp cut was passed. That gets us back to Space’s letter. Frech, well-recognized in southeast Ohio for his work, had contacted Space to complain about one facet of one bill. Space not only neglected to address it; he wrote something that was untrue by saying the teacher-aid bill was paid for entirely by closing a tax loophole. And Space certainly knew about the food-stamp cut, if for no other reason than he was present at the news conference where Fudge raised the issue. That doesn’t make him the grinch who stole food stamps. It merely makes him one more member of Congress who has tried not to talk about it. Chapman, the chief of staff, told us that a letter to a constituent is not intended "to be a manual of every facet of legislation." But Frech didn’t want a manual. By ignoring Frech’s concern -- and passing right over the bill’s single biggest funding source -- Space’s letter took on the air of gamesmanship. Hide and seek, anyone? When we run a statement through the Truth-O-Meter that not only is false but also suggests that someone is playing games, we start looking for the matches. We rate Space’s statement to an Ohio anti-poverty advocate Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.	None	Zack Space	None	None	None	2010-10-01T06:00:00	2010-09-02	['None']

It’s only when you actually moved toward plotting and acting on it that you become actionable and arrestable. These guys know that, and they use it against us." The FBI had investigated the shooter Omar Mateen in recent years after he claimed to co-workers that his family had connections to the al-Qaida terror network. But probes led to nothing. Is Rubio correct that radical speech in itself is not a crime? We contacted Rubio’s spokespersons and did not get a reply. We were curious what the laws said about radical speech and if he was speaking accurately. Radical speech Multiple legal experts told us that Rubio’s point is generally correct because speech is protected by the First Amendment, which states: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances." Courts have decided that certain speech is not protected by the First Amendment such as "fighting words" (speech that would likely draw someone into a fight.) But radical speech is not included in that list. "The First Amendment protects radical speech," said University of Chicago Law professor Geoffrey Stone who has written about the dangers of compromising First Amendment freedoms. Experts said that Rubio omitted one key exception which stems from the 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case Brandenburg vs. Ohio involving a member of the Ku Klux Klan, The U.S. Supreme Court found that all speech is protected "except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action." So that means Americans have a right to advocate lawlessness -- such as overthrowing the federal government -- as long as they avoid inciting imminent illegal action as narrowly defined by Brandenburg. "For example, if a mob has seized a person they think murdered a child and X starts shouting ‘hang him, hang him,’ that would satisfy Brandenburg," Stone said. "Radical speech doesn't come close." So verbally supporting ISIS alone isn’t a crime. "The Supreme Court’s thinking is that people have a First Amendment right to associate with even the worst and most degraded organizations," said Loyola law professor Alexander Tsesis. "The government is prohibited from simply assuming ideological affinity will ‘lead to imminent violence,’ or that it is truly threatening for that matter. Those assumptions must be backed by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt." However, there is a separate statute that says it is illegal to provide material support to a terrorist organization. That could include "instructing the foreign terror organization about how to gain standing in a community or religious center. That’s an expressive act, but one the government has a compelling interest to prevent from achieving its supportive purpose," Tsesis said. While many people may conclude certain radical speech is offensive, it is generally protected. And there are good reasons for that, said Lee Rowland, a senior attorney at the ACLU. Whether something is "radical speech" or "hate speech" is in the ears of the listener. For example, some politicians and members of law enforcement have suggested that the Black Lives Matter movement engages in hate speech against police officers. Martin O’Malley, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said that Donald Trump is promoting hate speech with his comments about immigrants. "The fact that our Constitution robustly protects speech, including speech we find abhorrent, is a feature, not a bug," Rowland said. However, in the age of terrorism and the internet, some have raised the question about whether Brandenburg can survive or whether we should find ways to limit free speech. Our ruling Rubio said, "In America, radical speech is not a crime." Radical speech is protected by the First Amendment and is not a crime. However, there are limited exceptions for when speech incites imminent crime or when communications specifically aid acts of terror. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af1d6810-61b4-42c1-ad69-8ef452cf3af7	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-06-15T11:00:00	2016-06-13	['United_States']
pomt-11117	Says that "when federal bureaucrats wanted to prohibit the use of wooden cheese boards, which help make tens of millions of pounds of cheese a year" she "stepped in, helped eliminate the regulations."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/07/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-tammy-baldwins-very-cheesy-ad-cuts-mustard/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is in a bruising political battle that includes third-party groups pouring millions of dollars into the race. Baldwin will face the winner of the Republican matchup between Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir, R-Wauwatosa. Baldwin started running TV ads in February, highlighting her work on "Buy America" legislation and prescription drug costs. In a follow-up ad, launched April 16, 2018, Baldwin turned to a quintessential Wisconsin issue … Yes, wooden cheese boards. The ad starts with the warning: "This is gonna be a cheesy ad … a very cheesy ad." Then it turns to Baldwin who says: "When federal bureaucrats wanted to prohibit the use of wooden cheese boards, which help make tens of millions of pounds of cheese a year, something had to be done." The ad then shifts to Thorp, Wis., cheesemaker Marieke Penterman, known for the Penterman farm’s "Marieke Gouda" cheese, who says: "Tammy Baldwin stepped in, helped eliminate regulations and stood up for businesses like ours." Is the claim in the Baldwin cheese ad gouda? Or is it, as critics claim, a little overripe? Baldwin’s evidence At the center of the ad is a 2014 cheese board brouhaha. It started after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspected several New York state cheesemakers and cited them for using wooden surfaces to age cheeses, stating the practice was unsanitary. That inspection and report caused alarm in the artisan cheesemaking community. On her campaign website, under the headline "Standing Up for a WI Way of Life," Baldwin describes it this way: In 2014, the FDA wanted to prohibit the use of wooden boards used for aging cheese, quintessential to some of our state’s best products. In fact, the Wisconsin Cheesemakers Association estimated in 2014 that 33 million pounds of cheese were aging on wooden boards in Wisconsin. Tammy took immediate action. She pressured the FDA and pointed out the "serious ramifications for Wisconsin’s world-renown cheesemakers who have safely aged their cheeses on wooden boards for generations." The FDA soon backed down on restricting use of wooden boards for aging. Critics say Baldwin’s bureaucracy-busting claim is overblown. The National Republican Senatorial Committee issued a news release that said, in part: "In the new spot, Senator Baldwin goes on about her record ‘eliminating regulations’ and taking on ‘federal bureaucrats’ in the cheese industry. Get a grip. There’s never been an industry Senator Baldwin didn’t want to tax, regulate or burden with new legislation." Conservative WISN talk show host Jay Weber dismissed Baldwin’s action as "she wrote a letter," adding: "More accurately, her staff did, and she signed it. Baldwin did literally the minimum she could. She didn't 'step in' anywhere." To be sure, Baldwin’s claim is actually a minimalist one. Not that she was responsible for the change, only that she "stepped in" and "helped eliminate the regulations." What happened and what did Baldwin do? When we asked the Baldwin team for more specifics, a spokesman pointed us to a Baldwin website page featuring statements on various dairy industry issues. But it basically repeats the information included with the ad: And when the FDA tried to tell Wisconsin’s world-renowned cheesemakers to stop using traditional wood boards for aging, Tammy stepped in and told the regulators to back-off. Working hand-in-hand with Wisconsin’s dairy industry, Tammy successfully pressured the Washington regulators to reverse their decision. The Baldwin site also references several news articles about the issue, including a Wisconsin State Journal piece from June 12, 2014. The article notes that in a letter the day before to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, Baldwin sought clarification on the agency’s cheese board policy: I am writing in regards to disturbing reports that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is pursuing policies to end the use of wooden boards in cheese aging. This has raised great concern among Wisconsin’s cheesemakers, who are currently aging 33 million pounds of cheese on these boards and whose businesses rely on this process. If these reports are true, the FDA should immediately cease any efforts to end the use of wooden boards in cheese aging. In addition, I am requesting that the FDA clarify its policy on cheese aging and enter into a transparent discussion about the role that wooden boards play in cheese processing and food safety. At the time, the FDA released a statement clarifying its policy: Recently, you may have heard some concerns suggesting the FDA has taken steps to end the long-standing practice in the cheesemaking industry of using wooden boards to age cheese. To be clear, we have not and are not prohibiting or banning the long-standing practice of using wood shelving in artisanal cheese. Nor does the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) require any such action. Reports to the contrary are not accurate… At issue is a January 2014 communication from the agency’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets’ Division of Milk Control and Dairy Services, which was sent in response to questions from New York State. The FDA recognizes that this communication has prompted concerns in the artisanal cheesemaking community.... In the interest of public health, the FDA's current regulations state that utensils and other surfaces that contact food must be "adequately cleanable" and "properly maintained." Historically, the FDA has expressed concern about whether wood meets this requirement and these concerns have been noted in its inspectional findings. However, the FDA will engage with the artisanal cheesemaking community, state officials and others to learn more about current practices and discuss the safety of aging certain types of cheeses on wooden shelving, as well as to invite stakeholders to share any data or evidence they have gathered related to safety and the use of wood surfaces. We welcome this open dialogue. In a June 10, 2014 article, the Associated Press noted that "The FDA’s statement was issued in response to a letter written by Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection secretary Ben Brancel urging FDA officials to take a second look at its policy." The article did include Baldwin’s on a list of Wisconsin officials who contacted the FDA on the issue, along with Gov. Scott Walker, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) and state Sen. Dale Schultz (R-Richland Center). In addition to making phone calls and writing the letter to the FDA, Baldwin, along with U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and others, introduced an amendment that aimed "to require the commissioner of Food and Drugs to issue guidance before using funds to limit or prohibit the use of wood boards for cheese aging or ripening," a Baldwin staffer said. The larger legislation, and amendment, did not get a vote on the Senate floor. Finally, we turned to the FDA itself on whether its stance on wooden cheese boards has changed. The agency issued this statement: The FDA does not prohibit the practice of using wood shelving in cheesemaking. Over the past 4 years, the agency has engaged in extensive dialogue with the artisanal cheesemaking community on food safety practices after stakeholders, including Congress, asked for clarification on agency requirements. Among other things, the American Cheese Society (ACS) worked with the FDA to provide clarity to their members and food safety guidance on this topic, which can be found in the ACS Best Practices Guide for Cheesemakers. The FDA, ACS, state and local governments, among others, all share the same goal: to ensure that the cheese Americans enjoy is safe. Our rating In a TV ad, Baldwin said that "when federal bureaucrats wanted to prohibit the use of wooden cheese boards, which help make tens of millions of pounds of cheese a year" she "stepped in, helped eliminate the regulations." Baldwin’s actions in the cheese board dustup included phone calls, a letter to the FDA and the introduction of an amendment, all of which helped prompt a clarification of its cheese board policy. The FDA says the regulation dealing with sanitary practices was never eliminated, though the agency’s clarification of its policy did allow the cheesemaking to continue. For a statement that is accurate but requires clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-08459	John Raese's wife "is registered to vote in Florida so she can't even vote for him."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/14/joe-manchin/joe-manchin-attacks-john-raese-wife-registered-vot/	In what's becoming a familiar story, a longtime public official is facing a significant threat from an upstart challenger. In this case, the race is for the U.S. Senate seat for West Virginia formerly held by the late Robert Byrd, a Democrat. Gov. Joe Manchin, also a Democrat, was considered the favorite, but John Raese, a Republican businessman, has been showing strength in the polls. So Manchin recently released a harsh attack ad against Raese. Here's how it goes: "John Raese thinks we're hicks. His people hired actors from Philadelphia to attack Joe Manchin and told them to dress 'hicky.' It's insulting and he didn't even apologize. Then there's the fact Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes. Obviously, we're not good enough for him. Raese's wife is registered to vote in Florida so she can't even vote for him. Why should we?" There's a lot to unpack there. Let's start with the "hicky" charge before moving onto our fact-check. The "hicky" incident arose from an attack ad against Manchin that the National Republican Senatorial Committee put together. The ad shows three men in a diner talking about how they don't want to vote for Manchin because he would support President Barack Obama. The men are wearing flannel shirts and trucker hats, but other than that, it seems like a straightforward "man on the street" type of ad. The controversy came when Politico reported on the advertisement looking for actors in Philadelphia to portray the men at the diner. "We are going for a 'Hicky' Blue Collar look," read the casting call for the ad. "These characters are from West Virginia so think coal miner/trucker looks." "Clothing Suggestions" included jeans, work boots, flannel shirt, denim shirt, "Dickie's type jacket with t-shirt underneath," down-filled vest, "John Deer [sic] hats (not brand new, preferably beat up)," "trucker hats (not brand new, preferably beat up)," according to Politico. Several days after those descriptions came to light, the NRSC fired the firm that was responsible. We weren't as interested in the 'hicky' controversy as we were in the claims about Raese's Florida connections. We asked the Raese campaign for a response, but we didn't hear back. So we started by checking the voter registration rolls in Florida, which are public records. We quickly determined that Raese's wife, Elizabeth Raese, is registered to vote in Palm Beach County. She has been registered since 2001 and last voted in the 2008 election, according to the Palm Beach County Supervisor of elections. We also cross-checked her address with the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser. Property records indicate Elizabeth and John Raese own a 6,934 square foot home purchased in 1999 and with a market value of $2.67 million. The 2010 record also shows that the Raese's receive a homestead exemption, which indicates that the home is an owner's primary residence. We spoke with officials at the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser's office. They confirmed that the Raese's did qualify for the exemption for the 2010 tax year, and that Elizabeth Raese is registered to vote in Florida and holds a Florida driver's license. John Raese is listed as "owner non-resident" in the appraiser's records. The officials confirmed that it's possible for a married couple to jointly own property and claim an exemption when only one spouse is the Florida homeowner. It might seem strange to have a spouse who is an official resident of a state different from your own, but the Raese's wealth may account for the arrangement. Raese's campaign biography states, "Despite a long list of business accomplishments throughout a lifetime, John is most proud of his family – wife Liz and two wonderful daughters Jane and Agnes. Liz is the founder of the Conservative Women of West Virginia, a growing group of activists charting a conservative path for the Mountain State." (Press reports indicate his children attend a private Christian school in Florida.) The ad further states that "Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes." Florida does not have a personal income tax and West Virginia does, but this claim is impossible for us to check: Tax information is confidential unless a candidate chooses to release it. Raese hasn't done that. But a campaign spokesman told the Charleston Gazette that Raese does pay taxes in West Virginia. "John Raese is a West Virginia resident. Period. He pays income and property taxes there, and any attempts to claim otherwise are acts of desperation by a hopelessly listing campaign," said spokesman Kevin McLaughlin. The Gazette also reported that Raese owns a home in Morgantown, W. Va., listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and that he is registered to vote in Monongalia County. Raese has run for office before and had his residency questioned by opponents. But Raese's campaign biography and independent press reports indicate that he is a longtime West Virginia resident. He serves as president and CEO of Greer Industries, a steel and limestone company founded by his grandparents and headquartered in Morgantown, W. Va. Manchin's ad tries to make voters question Raese's loyalty to West Virginia. It's hard to make a case that Raese isn't someone with longtime ties to West Virginia. On the other hand, it's true that his wife is registered to vote in Florida, and that's the fact we're checking here. Public records confirm she is registered to vote in Florida and receives a homestead exemption on her property. So we rate Manchin's statement True.

pomt-03357	Says health insurance premiums will rise under Obamacare.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/16/americans-prosperity/afp-ad-says-premiums-will-rise-under-obamacare/	The conservative organization that spent more than $33 million in the last election to defeat President Barack Obama and other Democrats has turned its sights to undermining support for the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. The group, Americans for Prosperity, launched a television ad in Ohio and Florida. The ad is called "Questions" and in it, Julie, a pregnant mother, talks about her concerns about Obamacare. With a backyard swing set in the background, Julie says: Two years ago, my son Caleb began having seizures. The medical care he received meant the world to me. Now? I’m paying more attention. And I have some questions about Obamacare. If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know my family’s going to get the care they need? And what am I getting in exchange for higher premiums and a smaller paycheck? Can I really trust the folks in Washington with my family’s health care? In this fact-check, we focus on Julie’s question, "What am I getting in exchange for higher premiums?" That line presents higher premiums as a certainty, effectively saying "premiums will rise." Whether that’s true in Julie’s case and anyone else’s depends on several key factors: age, income, and perhaps most important, how they get their insurance today. PolitiFact is wary of broad claims on the future of premiums under the Affordable Care Act. When House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, said everyone would pay less, we rated that False because some people would see higher rates. The ad doesn’t tell us much about Julie except that she already has insurance. We asked Levi Russell, spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, whether her current insurance is through the large-group, small-group, or individual markets. We got no details. Russell said "Julie’s questions about the impact of Obamacare are universal, which is why we’ve chosen not to get into details on her particular insurance coverage." That would be fine, but if Julie is the Every Woman then her conviction that her premiums will go up is a sweeping statement that needs to be put in the context of the different markets. Cori Uccello, senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, said there are many factors that will shape how people like Julie fare under the Affordable Care Act. The best thing would be if she gets her insurance through a large employer. "If they're in the large group market, they wouldn't pay more in premiums," Uccello said. We contacted the Insurance Commission in Washington state. They run that state’s exchange, the online shopping tool for small-group and individual plans. Stephanie Marquis, a spokeswoman for the commission, said they will post their final rates in about two weeks. If Julie lives in Washington and is insured under a small-group plan, Marquis says she would do pretty well. "It’s likely the rates will stay close to the same," Marquis said. "Our essential health benefits that all plans must include are based on benefits already included in most small employer plans. Also, guaranteed issue in the small employer market. People cannot be charged more today, if they’re sick." Employers provide most of the insurance in this country. About 60 percent of everyone under 65 is covered through either a large-group or small-group plan, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, an independent think tank. Statistically, if Julie has insurance today, it’s most likely in one of those markets and the ad should not assume that her rates will rise. About 22 percent of people under 65 are with a government program, either Medicaid or a children’s program, S-CHIP. The individual market represents the smallest slice of people with insurance, about 7 percent. In citing support for the claim that premiums will go up, Russell focused on the individual market. He said rates in California will be 64 to 146 percent higher. We were unable to confirm that. Russell also pointed to a Wall Street Journal article. He said the article covered at length the prospect of "rising premiums for many Americans." First, we note that in his response, Russell softened the claim in the ad, which assumed that premiums would go up without any qualification. Russell changed that to premiums going up for many people, not everyone. The WSJ looked only at the individual market. It used the proposals from insurance companies that want to participate in the exchanges of eight states. The WSJ found that, "Healthy consumers could see insurance rates double or even triple when they look for individual coverage under the federal health law later this year, while the premiums paid by sicker people are set to become more affordable." This could be considered a split decision for the AFP ad. If Julie has a child with a medical history, and buys her insurance with no help from an employer, the article suggests she might do well under Obamacare. On the other hand, if she were young and with a very healthy family, she might pay more. This article is one of the first to assess actual rates, as opposed to predicted rates -- studies that amount to informed guesswork. But while better, the analysis is using proposed not final numbers. Some states, such as Oregon, have seen companies lower their rates after they first submitted them. And other studies analyzed similar data but reached different conclusions. The consulting group, Avalere Health, looked at proposed rates in nine states and saw middle range plans, so-called Silver tier, that had premiums lower than predicted by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress. Costs varied widely, from $205 a month in Oregon to $413 in Vermont for a 40-year-old nonsmoker. The state you live in has a significant effect on how the Affordable Care Act changes rates. In Washington state, Stephanie Marquis said her office was surprised with the numbers insurance companies put on the table. "Several carriers predicted rate changes as high as 70 percent," Marquis said. "Yet that’s not what they filed. Many people will pay slightly more or the same for much better coverage." When the Washington Insurance Commission compared those proposals with the rates a private insurance company changes today, it found people in their 20s were paying about $50 more each month, while people in their 40s and 60s were saving $22 to $268 a month. Experts have always expected younger workers in the individual market to pay more. The Congressional Budget Office said the price tag for this sort of health insurance plan was likely to go up by 10 to 13 percent. However, the CBO noted that a significant number of the people getting their insurance this way would have incomes low enough to qualify for tax credits that would lower the effective cost. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated these tax credits would help about 80 percent of them, although even with that subsidy, many in this group would still see rate hikes. The WSJ article did not take the tax credits into account. Bob Laszewski, the CEO of the consulting firm Health Policy and Strategies Associate, is pessimistic on rates in the individual market. "A family’s costs are much more likely to go up," Laszewski said. He said the insurance plans will be better than some offered today and that coupled with other changes will make plans more expensive. On the other hand, he could make no projection for Julie. "We don't know anything for sure regarding any specific person. If this person lives in (New Jersey), they might just see their premiums go down," Laszewski said. Current law in New Jersey tends to push rates higher, making savings under Obamacare more likely. For the most part, uncertainty dominates the picture. "It is premature to say who will see increases and who will see decreases," Cori Uccello with the American Academy of Actuaries said. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity produced an ad that claimed that health insurance premiums would go up under Obamacare. To make a universal statement, the group both wants us to accept certain details about a woman, Julie, and disregard others. Chief among these is how she gets her insurance today. Statistically, she is most likely to fall into groups that are likely to do well under Obamacare. The most detailed supporting document focuses on the group that represents just 7 percent of today’s insurance market. The individual market is the one most likely to see rate hikes but the ACA provides tax credits to cushion the impact of those hikes. While most states have yet to announce their final rates, every expert we spoke to agreed that some people will pay more. The message a casual viewer would take from the ad is that everyone's rates are going up. But that's not true, based on what experts told us. The AFP ad cherry picks the facts and draws a conclusion beyond what the evidence supports, but it will prove accurate for some people. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-07592	Says "legislation pending in the House would effectively limit or eliminate ‘time-and-a-half’ for people who work overtime."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/25/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-pending-legislation-w/	Ohio House Democratic Leader Armond Budish has vowed to "fight like hell" against the plan to narrow public workers’ collective bargaining rights, known as Senate Bill 5. Behind the tough talk is a strategy to enlist more than the union workers who have become the face of the SB 5 opposition. Budish and Democrats want all middle-class, working Ohioans to join the fight. Budish’s message to recruits: Republicans are engaged in a full-scale war against the middle class. The Beachwood Democrat issued a warning in a letter to The Plain Dealer published March 17. "For example, legislation pending in the House would effectively limit or eliminate ‘time-and-a-half’ for people who work overtime." Budish’s claim piqued PolitiFact Ohio’s interest because time-and-a-half has been a standard pay scale for overtime work for decades. The legislation Budish referenced is House Bill 61, which two Republicans introduced in January. A House committee recommended the bill for approval earlier this month, although all Democrats on the committee voted against it. The bill has not been up for a full floor vote yet. The pending legislation would allow certain workers to receive one hour of compensatory time – paid time off – rather than overtime wages for each hour worked exceeding 40 in a week. Federal and state labor laws require most employers pay time-and-a-half for overtime. HB 61 would allow workers to accumulate up to 240 hours of comp time. At the end of a year, employers would have to pay overtime wages for any unused comp time. There are two key issues in Budish’s claim. Does the bill allow employers to abuse their authority and force workers to take comp time instead of overtime wages? How many Ohio workers would HB 61 affect? Let’s start with the second issue. HB61 would cover private employers (with some exceptions) with annual gross sales between $150,000 and $500,000, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission. About 10,000 members of the Ohio chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business have self-reported gross receipts between $100,000 and $500,000, said Chris Ferruso, legislative director for the organization. Businesses with sales above $500,000 already must comply with federal overtime laws. "A lot of this is aimed at very small businesses," said Tony Seegers, director of Labor and Human Resources Policy for the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. "It’s not going to be a lot of employers, but it’s going to be some of the smaller ones." The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio NFIB support HB 61. As for the first issue, HB 61 supporters note that workers would get to chose between comp time and overtime pay. The bill says employers cannot require workers to take comp time. And workers are supposed to initiate the exchange for comp time. The bill also bars employers from threatening, intimidating or firing workers who want overtime wages. Columbus attorney Fred Gittes called the voluntary nature of the bill "a charade." Gittes’ argument speaks to the core of Budish’s claim that the bill "would effectively limit or eliminate" time-and-a-half pay for overtime work. Gittes argues that employers could force their workers to take comp time instead of overtime because the bill lacks teeth to discourage the from doing so. He testified against the bill on behalf of the Ohio Employment Lawyers Association. Employers would have a financial motivation to press workers to take comp time. Comp time would be awarded on a one-to-one ratio for extra hours worked. An employee who worked two extra hours, for example, would get two hours of comp time. That’s a cheaper arrangement than paying time-and-a-half for each overtime hour worked. Gittes argues that the penalties are too weak for employers who break the rules. The bill has no provisions to help a worker get his job back or to recover lost wages. Instead, employers who force workers to take comp time would be fined double the worker’s hourly wage for the number of comp time hours involved in the violation, plus attorney fees and court costs. Federal overtime laws include employer penalties that allow a worker to regain their job and wages lost from the time of their firing. Gittes said he has discussed with the bill’s sponsors the inclusion of such language, but it has not been added. The monetary difference resulting from stiffer penalties could be vast. Take, for example, the case of a worker with a $10 per hour wage who was fired for refusing to accept 200 hours in comp time. If the worker prevailed in court, under HB 61, he would be awarded about $4,000. If the same worker won a lawsuit under federal labor laws, he could win his job back and wages covering those that were lost from the point of termination. "What employer will continue to pay time-and-a-half for each hour of overtime if they can effectively force employees to agree to take comp time at their normal rate of pay?" Gittes said in his testimony to the House Small Business and Economic Development Committee. So where does Budish’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter? Budish is correct that the bill would provide a means to limit time-and-a-half pay. And while Gittes’ conclusion is tinged with cynicism, unscrupulous businesses do exist. But voluntary choices made by employees also could limit time-and-a-half. Budish’s statement simply describes the affected group as people who work overtime, but the changes in HB 61 would only have an impact on smaller businesses. That’s information that provides clarification. We rate Budish’s statement as Mostly True.	None	Armond Budish	None	None	None	2011-03-25T06:00:00	2011-03-17	['None']

McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of (Iraq)."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/21/barack-obama/mccains-record-on-iraq-eager-to-attack/	Sen. Barack Obama, speaking to veterans, lashed into his opponent for poor military judgment, alleging Sen. John McCain had fixated on Iraq immediately after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. "Sen. McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, and that — as despicable as Saddam Hussein was — posed no imminent threat to the American people," Obama said on Aug. 19, 2008. "Two of the biggest beneficiaries of that decision were al-Qaida's leadership, which no longer faced the pressure of America's focused attention; and Iran, which has advanced its nuclear program, continued its support for terror, and increased its influence in Iraq and the region." Obama's analysis of the war's consequences aside, we checked the record to see whether he had fairly characterized McCain's views about Iraq after 9/11 and in the run-up to the war. As a military veteran and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain was a prominent voice in late 2001 as the nation grappled with how to respond to the attacks. On Sept. 12, 2001, he appeared on Hardball with Chris Matthews, where Matthews asked whether the appropriate response should be "a legal matter or a military matter." "I think it's both," McCain replied. "As — as we stated, the — a nation has the right to defend itself, No. 1. But No. 2, these organizations could not flourish effectively unless they had the help and assistance and safe harbor of these nations. And it isn't just Afghanistan — we're talking about Syria, Iraq, Iran, perhaps North Korea, Libya and others." That comment was not particularly specific to Iraq. But in an Oct. 18, 2001, appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, with the nation on edge about the anthrax mailings and in the early stages of the campaign in Afganistan, McCain singled out Iraq. After sharing his views about how events were unfolding in Afghanistan, McCain told Letterman: "I think we'll do fine. The second phase — if I could just make one, very quickly — the second phase is Iraq. There is some indication, and I don't have the conclusions, but some of this anthrax may — and I emphasize may — have come from Iraq." In January 2002, while touring the flight bridge of an aircraft carrier on the Arabian Sea, McCain shouted: "Next up: Baghdad!" He fleshed out his views in a speech at a NATO security policy conference in Munich on Feb. 2, 2002. "Terrorist training camps exist on Iraqi soil, and Iraqi officials are known to have had a number of contacts with al-Qaida. These were probably not courtesy calls," he said. "Americans have internalized the mantra that Afghanistan represents only the first front in our global war on terror. The next front is apparent, and we should not shrink from acknowledging it. A terrorist resides in Baghdad, with the resources of an entire state at his disposal, flush with cash from illicit oil revenues and proud of a decade-long record of defying the international community's demands that he come clean on his programs to develop weapons of mass destruction." We should note that McCain suggested on several occasions that he would prefer alternatives to full-on invasion and occupation as a means of displacing Saddam Hussein, such as on Meet the Press on July 14, 2002: "I have always strongly felt that you must try the option of opposition from within — arming, training, equipping and helping oppositions from within; the Kurds in the North, the Shiites in the South," McCain told the late Tim Russert. "At least try that option before we send Americans into harm's way." But two days later on Face the Nation, he made clear that if it took war to remove Hussein, he was all for it. "Look, we need a regime change in Iraq," he said. "If we can do it on the cheap by having operations involving just Special Forces and some air power and opponents within, either the Kurds in the south, Shiites in the north [sic], then that's fine. But we have to be prepared to do whatever is necessary to bring about this regime change. I think we also ought to prepare the American public in — in — by way of informing them that Saddam Hussein has these weapons, continues to attempt to improve the — their capability and would not be reluctant to export them to other countries." He continued, "So we need to keep telling the American people that as well, as well as basically — if I may be so blunt — frightening them — frightening and scaring them every day." In early 2003, with calls for invasion of Iraq growing more insistent, McCain's was among the most fervent voices. "Sept. 11, 2001 showed that al-Qaida is a grave threat," he wrote in a Feb. 14, 2003 opinion piece in USA Today. "Saddam Hussein has the ability to make a far worse day of infamy by turning Iraq into a weapons assembly line for al-Qaida's network. ... Saddam is an international felon who has repeatedly violated the terms of his parole and is planning further crimes with his terrorist accomplices. He must be brought to justice once and for all." The record clearly supports the contention that McCain "was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11" — indeed he singled out Iraq on Letterman — and became a "leading supporter" of the war, as Obama said. We find his claim to be True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-21T00:00:00	2008-08-19	['Iraq', 'John_McCain']

pomt-13317	Says Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez "has passed one bill in her 20 years in Congress, and that was to rename a post office."	half-true	/california/statements/2016/oct/06/kamala-harris/claim-loretta-sanchez-passed-one-bill-20-years-tec/	California’s U.S. Senate candidates Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez attacked one another’s records, or lack thereof, during Wednesday’s debate in Los Angeles. Harris is California’s attorney general. Sanchez is an Orange County congresswoman. They are competing to replace retiring U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. All three are Democrats. One claim by Harris on Sanchez’s Capitol Hill tenure stood out: "My opponent has passed one bill in her 20 years in Congress, and that was to rename a post office." We decided to check this provocative claim, and whether any context was missing. Our research To back up the statement, Harris’ campaign pointed to Sanchez’ record at congress.gov, the official website for federal legislative information. It shows Sanchez has, indeed, sponsored only one bill that became law: A 2001 measure to rename an Orange County Post Office. It also shows Sanchez has co-sponsored 179 bills that have become law. Bills are often co-sponsored by dozens of members of Congress at the same time. Sanchez responded during the debate: "It’s pretty obvious to me that my opponent doesn’t understand the Congress at all," Sanchez said. "You don't pass a bill on its own necessarily in the Congress; you pass it by putting it into bills." Sanchez has a point: A search on congress.gov shows some of her colleagues, even some who have served longer than Sanchez, have introduced only a handful of bills that became law. Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters of Los Angeles, for example, has served since 1991 and sponsored only three bills that became law. Even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has served since 1987, sponsored only seven bills that became law. Pelosi has, however, co-sponsored more than 400 measures now on the books. In an article after the debate, the Los Angeles Times described the issue this way: "Relative to the number of bills that are filed, few actually pass as standalone legislation and become law. Members often insert legislation into broader bills in hopes of increasing chances it will pass. In fact, many of the day-to-day bills that do pass are to rename post offices — because they are not controversial. Attacks about the naming of post offices have been a staple of congressional debates across the country, especially as Congress has done less and less actual legislating in recent years." Sanchez’s military bills During the debate, Sanchez claimed she’s placed "17 different pieces of legislation into one bill" under the National Defense Authorization Act. The McClatchy news service reported in March that Sanchez "has been successful at getting her amendments into the National Defense Authorization Act, the sprawling budget that sets policy for the Department of Defense." It added that Greg Jacob, former policy director of the Service Women’s Action Network, said his group often went to Sanchez for assistance in fighting the epidemic of sexual assault in the military. "Congresswoman Sanchez has always been at the leading edge of the fight in regard to this issue," Jacob, a Marine Corps combat veteran who closely tracked her work on the Armed Services Committee, told McClatchy. This is not the first time an opponent has attacked Sanchez’s legislative record. Van Tran, who challenged the congresswoman in the 2010 House race, criticized Sanchez "for getting only a single bill passed during her time in Congress, a measure to name a post office in Santa Ana." Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris claimed her opponent Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez "has passed one bill in her 20 years in office, and that was to rename a post office." That’s technically correct. But it ignores the fact that relatively few standalone bills introduced by members of Congress are passed on their own. Many are added as amendments to larger bills. Long-time Democratic House members Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi have sponsored a combined 10 bills that became law during their careers. Sanchez has co-sponsored nearly 180 bills. And she’s been praised for successfully introducing policy bills that were later included in the nation’s military budget. There’s technical truth to Harris’ statement. But it takes things out of context and leaves the wrong impression that Sanchez has done next to nothing on Capitol Hill. We rate Harris' claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-10988	"In Houston, Texas, there are more brothels than there are Starbucks."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/jul/13/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-houston-home-more-brothels-starbucks-t/	Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, seeking re-election, responded to a supporter’s question about campaign messaging by talking about sexual exploitation and a ubiquitous brand of coffee shops. "In Houston, Texas, there are more brothels than there are Starbucks," Abbott said during a June 27, 2018, fundraising conference call with supporters, according to a recap by Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman. We wondered if Abbott's claim holds up by the numbers. A Children at Risk statement Abbott’s campaign, responding to Herman, said the comparison originated with Robert Sanborn, president and CEO of the Houston-based nonprofit Children at Risk. In January 2018, Sanborn was quoted telling the Houston Chronicle for a news story: "We have more brothels than we have Starbucks in our city." A brothel is a building where prostitutes are available. Houston’s illicit sex business, the Chronicle story said, "includes top-dollar call girl agencies, legions of street walkers, hundreds of massage parlors fronting for sex shops and cantinas where a beer can be followed by a ‘date’ in a room behind the bar." RubMaps website Sanborn told the newspaper there were over 400 storefront sex businesses operating in Houston--an estimate Children at Risk traced to posts on Rubmaps.com, "where patrons rate and review illicit massage proprietors," the story said. Alfred T. Tribble Jr., an FBI supervisor who oversees the human trafficking unit in Houston, told the paper: "Houston is fertile ground for trafficking because of its proximity to the border, its sexually oriented businesses, its diversity and the demand for sexual services." Seeking elaboration on the brothel count, we reached Jamey Caruthers, an attorney for Children at Risk, who pointed us to the group’s April 2018 report stating that statewide by the group’s analysis, over 35,000 children were attending 55 schools within 1,000 feet of a suspected illegal massage business, which the report describes as fronts for human trafficking and sexual exploitation. "The women trapped in these places are made to provide sexual services to as many as ten men a day through force, fraud and coercion," the report says. As of April 5, 2018, the report says, the group identified 689 suspected illegal massage businesses in Texas which the report says were listed on the RubMaps site as open; not labeled by users as "non-erotic;" and that had at least one customer review. By this sift, the report says, Harris County, home to Houston, had the largest concentration, with 259, followed by Dallas (97), Bexar (69), Collin (53) and Tarrant (52) counties. In July 2018, Caruthers told us by email that suspected sites in Houston alone were counted if RubMaps showed the businesses having Houston street addresses. Caruthers said the Houston-specific count of such businesses has been around 200 since December 2017. "Today it is at 221 (these numbers fluctuate based on new locations opening, closures, and Rubmap’s own internal changes which we are not privy to. Also, savvy owners will go on the site and mark their business as ‘closed’ in order to avoid scrutiny by law enforcement)," Caruthers wrote. We turned to the RubMaps site, which headlines its first page: "Where Fantasy Meets Reality." Text on that page says RubMaps’ unverified entries showing the location of each business, photos and reviews are entirely user-generated. "Therefore, it is unknown whether these locations are accurate, if the pictures actually depict the locations, or if the reviews are factual," RubMaps says. Next, we clicked to a search page and fetched a list of 576 Houston massage parlors which we winnowed to 224 businesses by specifying that "kissing" be available. That was enough searching for the Truth-O-Meter’s purposes. Houston police estimate Separately, we reached James Dale of the Houston Police Department’s vice division who said by phone and email that the department identifies brothels by focusing on massage parlors, sometimes based on calls from neighbors. Dale also said the department partners with Children at Risk in battling brothels. Dale said reports filed by police investigators covering October 2015 into July 2018 indicate the city is home to some 274 "nuisance locations" including apartment buildings and 214 "known" massage parlors. Police have pressed prostitution-related cases involving 47 of the parlors, Dale said. Starbucks stores in the Bayou City Caruthers told us that at the time of its report, Children at Risk employed the online Starbucks Store Locator and an enthusiast’s website, starbuckseverywhere.net, to ascertain there were 98 Starbucks stores in Houston. For our part, we counted 51 Houston stores by using the Starbucks locator website yet close to 100 Houston stores specified on the enthusiast’s site. We emailed Starbucks without drawing a reply about its Houston stores. Meantime, the Starbucks enthusiast, who told us his full name is Winter, responded by email that as of June 5, 2018, he’d confirmed 155 Starbucks stores in Houston--93 owned by the company and 62 licensed to other vendors. We asked Dale, of Houston’s police department, if it could be that Starbucks stores in Houston outnumber local brothels. "There are a lot of massage parlors out there. They open up all the time. We do our best to look into them," Dale replied. "I don’t want to say there are more massage parlors or more Starbucks right now. The numbers (of massage parlors) fluctuate greatly," Dale said. Our ruling Abbott said Houston has more brothels than Starbucks stores. Of late, Houston police have tied prostitution-related cases to less than 50 sites while Houston is home to 155 Starbucks stores. However, police have identified more than 200 massage parlors and other places where prostitution likely occurs--a count supported by our own search of Houston parlors listed on the Rubmaps site. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-01439	Says Mark Warner "has supported restrictions on veterans’ second amendment rights."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/oct/06/national-rifle-association/nra-says-warner-backed-restrictions-veteran-gun-ri/	Editor’s note: A version of this Truth-O-Meter that appeared in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Sunday, Oct. 5, was posted with the wrong rating. The National Rifle Association says U.S. Sen. Mark Warner is soft on two issues dear to many Virginians -- guns and veterans. "Mark Warner has supported restrictions on veterans’ second amendment rights," the NRA wrote in a flyer that hit mailboxes in September. We wondered if the NRA is on target. The statement is based on the Senate’s consideration of the Safe Schools, Safe Communities Act of 2013, introduced in the wake of shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults. The legislation, backed by President Barack Obama, sought to greatly expand background checks on potential gun buyers and put new limits on assault rifles and high capacity magazines. The bill failed to overcome a filibuster. The NRA’s claim zeroes in on an unsuccessful amendment that would have changed the method for putting veterans on a federal list of people banned from buying firearms because of mental health. Warner and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., voted against the measure. The amendment was fashioned after a bill introduced two years earlier by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and then-Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., to end what they called "the arbitrary process through which the government strips veterans and other Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiaries of their Second Amendment rights." Federal law bans the purchase of firearms by people who have been ruled by a judge to be mentally defective or involuntarily committed to a mental institution or incompetent to handle his own affairs. Some states, including Virginia, share the rulings with the FBI and the individual’s name is listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Veterans, however, are subject to additional scrutiny. They can be found mentally incompetent to own guns either by the courts or a VA examiner. Since the 1968 Gun Control Act, the VA has equated mental capacity to manage finances with mental stability to own and purchase firearms. The NICS was created in 1998. If a VA examiner determines a veteran cannot manage his finances – take the VA benefit check and make necessary payments – the VA appoints a fiduciary. It could be a spouse or family member. But once a veteran is so judged, the VA submits the veteran’s name to the FBI for inclusion on the national list of people banned from buying arms. Burr said veterans were being held to a different standard than others. His amendment would have stripped the VA of its role and put determination of a veteran’s mental stability solely in the hands of judges. During debate, Burr said 129,000 veterans have been deemed mentally incompetent by the VA. "Let me suggest that the current process is arbitrary," he said. "It doesn't look at whether they represent a danger to themselves or to others. It is in no way relevant to whether the individual should have access to firearms." The same standard for other Americans should be applied to veterans, he said. "Clearly, after an appropriate determination, if a veteran, or any other American, is found to be a harm to themselves or has a mental disability, we would all agree that person should be disqualified from gun ownership," Burr said. Burr’s measure was among six amendments offered to the gun control bill. Some, like Burr’s, were narrow in scope. Others sought to overhaul the entire bill. Warner’s campaign spokesman, David Turner, told us his boss voted against Burr’s measure because he favored an overhaul amendment offered by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa. The measure, which beefed up criminal backgrounds checks and offered grants to encourage states to participate in the national data base, was introduced as a compromise on gun control. The legislation Warner backed also sought a middle ground on veterans. It required the VA to send a letter to veterans deemed mentally incompetent explaining the impact the ruling has on their gun rights and their options for contesting it. The amendment would have set up an appeals process through courts or an independent board. As things stand, veterans have no opportunity to appeal a decision requiring a fiduciary outside of the VA. Senators said during the 2013 debate that fewer than 200 veterans have had their incompetency rulings reversed by the VA. Our ruling The NRA says Warner "has supported restrictions on veterans’ second amendment rights." As proof, it cites the senator’s 2013 vote against an amendment that would have ended a VA policy of submitting the names of veterans it deems mentally unstable to the the FBI for inclusion on a national list of people barred from buying guns. People who didn’t serve in the military, by contrast, can only be declared mentally unfit to buy a gun by a judge. So there’s a basis for the NRA’s claim: Warner voted against abolishing a restriction on buying guns that only affects veterans. What the NRA ignores is that Warner voted for a different amendment that would have opened a appeals route for veterans outside of the VA -- to judges or an independent board. While Warner did not back the change desired by the NRA, he did support a policy change. The NRA’s statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-09687	"There were more people at the Air and Space Museum" than at a rally against the health care bills.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/12/bob-beckel/beckel-says-protest-against-health-care-bill-drew-/	Counting people at Washington protests has always been a tricky business. Groups have always boasted of huge crowds, but police estimates were often much lower. That sparked such controversy that police don't do the counts anymore. Without an official police count, organizers are free to claim big numbers, with only the news media to offer an independent assessment. Such was the case for a protest against the Democratic health care bill on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 5, 2009. The weekday event featured dozens of Republican members of Congress and a boisterious crowd that carried, among other things, a banner showing a photograph of dead Holocaust victims with the label, "National Socialist Healthcare, Dachau, Germany, 1945." As usual, there was debate about the size of the crowd. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., a conservative firebrand who urged her supporters to attend, told Fox News' Sean Hannity on the day of the rally that 20,000 to 45,000 people attended. In the blogosphere, meanwhile, liberals dismissed the idea that more than a few thousand people showed up. A few days after the rally, Bob Beckel, a Democratic consultant and Fox News contributor, said Bachmann's estimate was inflated. "Well, I was down at that thing," Beckel said on Hannity's Nov. 9 show. "You said there were 20,000 people there. There were more people at the Air and Space Museum that day than were [at the rally]." We wondered if Beckel was right, so we checked with the National Air and Space Museum. A spokeswoman told us there were 9,771 visitors that day. Estimating the size of the rally is more difficult. We called the Capitol Police, which has jurisdiction over the area where the rally was held, and a spokeswoman said that the department did not make a crowd estimate. So we are left with reports in the news media. A news story in the Washington Post put the number at "an estimated 10,000," while Dana Milbank, a columnist with the Post , said 5,000. Politico , a daily publication that that covers politics, said there were "at least 10,000" attendees. Most other newspaper accounts, including stories in the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press, pegged attendance at "thousands" of people. We asked two reporters who covered the event how they came up with their number. Politico 's Jonathan Allen explained his methodology for us in considerable detail. "I used a pretty simple method for my estimate," Allen told PolitiFact. "The biggest portion of the crowd on the lawn was penned into a stone-walled area that looks a bit like the top part of a trapezoid. I counted people, roughly ticking off by tens, across the narrow top and got to 180. Then I went down one leg of the wall to count how deep the full line of people went, getting to between 50 and 60. I multiplied 180 by 55, knowing that because I was dealing with an angle greater than 90 degrees at the junction of the walls that my number would actually undercount the people in the space. The product of the two numbers is 9,900. I added because of the shape of the area and because there was another section of the crowd numbering in the low hundreds." He concluded that "it was at least – but not too much more than – 10,000," adding, "I had another reporter with me, who agreed with the methodology. For anyone watching on television, it should be remembered that it’s a huge lawn that takes tens of thousands of people to fill. If it looked empty, that’s because it’s a big space. I’ve been going to sporting events and political rallies for more than 30 years, and I have a pretty good sense of crowd size. That said, if someone can produce an aerial shot and count the people and prove me wrong, I’m happy to correct the error." We also talked to Noam Levey, who covered the event for the Los Angeles Times . "We based our estimate on a combination of observation and interviews," Levey said. "Particularly helpful was Clark McPhail, an emeritus professor at the University of Illinois, who has been doing crowd estimates on the Mall for years by calculating densities in set areas of the Mall. At our request, Clark looked at photos of the event to come up with his estimate that about 5,000 people were there." We followed up with McPhail. He said that the only elevated photograph of the rally that he was able to secure led him to estimate a crowd of 5,000, but McPhail added that the photograph he used was imperfect. It was not taken from as high an angle as he would have liked, and it was unclear whether it had been taken at the moment of maximum attendance. When we explained Allen's methodology to McPhail, he praised it as being statistically sound. "It's absolutely a credible way of counting," McPhail said. "In fact, I train observers to do it that way." We find no support for the much larger estimates from Bachmann, who did not respond to our e-mails. And as a leader of the rally, she would benefit from a larger estimate. So, in the absence of an official count, we'll take McPhail's lead and give Allen's methodology some credence. That means the number of people attending the rally and visiting the Air and Space Museum was about the same. If he's right, it's by just a small margin. If he's wrong, it's also by a small margin. So we find Beckel's claim Half True.	None	Bob Beckel	None	None	None	2009-11-12T15:04:36	2009-11-09	['None']
pomt-09816	The government is "going to have the right to get into your bank account with the health care bill and make transfers without you knowing it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/08/rush-limbaugh/health-care-bill-transfers-limbaugh/	On his radio program on Aug. 28, Rush Limbaugh continued to hammer the Democrat-backed health care bill, claiming ominously that it would allow government "the right to get into your bank account...and make transfers without you knowing it." A similar claim was included in a widely circulated chain e-mail that contains numerous distortions about the health care bill. We examined the claims in depth and reported on many of them here. Limbaugh has raised this issue several times. On Aug. 6, 2009, a caller to his radio program said, "Listen, of all the scary things in this health care bill, Rush, the scariest thing is this: The government, if this passes, will be able to go into your bank account or anybody's bank account — I just read this last night — anybody's bank account, take the money out to fund this monstrosity. Did you know that?" Said Limbaugh, "He's right, folks, he's right. That is in the House bill." The provision in question is in Section 163 of the House bill (page 59) , under the heading "Administrative Simplification." It broadly sets out goals for standardizing electronic health records. The legislative summary says the intent in the section is "to adopt standards for typical transactions" between insurance companies and health care providers. Edwin Park, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the intent is to set standards for electronic communication between health providers and insurance companies and has nothing to do with an individual's bank account. So for example, a doctor would have access to real-time information about a patient's co-pays and whether a particular procedure or medication is covered under their plan, how much is owed, and so on, he said. Much of that already happens today, he said, but it would standardize electronic records so that with out-of-network transactions, everyone is using the same coding and standards. Park's interpretation is shared by Health Care for America Now, which is lobbying for health care reform. According to the group's Web site, the provision "continues the discussion of administrative standards, and authorizes electronic transfers of money within the government. In no way does this provision grant the government access to individual bank accounts." But some say the wording of the bill is ambiguous, and does appear to allow for the possibility of addressing electronic health payments from a patient's individual bank account. Robert Book of the Heritage Foundation pointed to a clause in Section 163 that states that it would "enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice." Some interpret that as a vehicle to allow people to pay their health bills through automatic deductions from their personal bank accounts. And in an e-mail sent out by David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, in which he sought to debunk some of the "lies and distortions" that have circulated in e-mails about health care reform, he seems to suggest that's exactly what is being contemplated. "No, government will not do anything with your bank account," Axelrod wrote. "It is an absurd myth that government will be in charge of your bank accounts. Health insurance reform will simplify administration, making it easier and more convenient for you to pay bills in a method that you choose. Just like paying a phone bill or a utility bill, you can pay by traditional check, or by a direct electronic payment. And forms will be standardized so they will be easier to understand. The choice is up to you – and the same rules of privacy will apply as they do for all other electronic payments that people make." On the White House Web site, Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, spoke to the issue, saying, "Individuals, not the government, will be in charge of their bank accounts, just like they are today." We read Section 163 and found nothing that would require patients to participate in electronic payments. So Limbaugh is wrong that the bill would allow the government "the right to get into your bank account." The choice would be up to the person if they'd like to allow electronic withdrawals from their bank accounts. John S. Hoff, deputy assistant secretary for Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush, doesn't see much to support the critics' claims. But the bill was written in such an ambiguous way, he said, that it opens the door for this kind of speculation. Perhaps, he said, the provision is intended only to deal with standardizing electronic communication between health providers and insurance companies, he said. But the wording "seems to contemplate getting money from (an individual's) account electronically." Still, he said, "I think there is something that would protect you, that would allow you to block access to your account. It doesn't say that they could force you to do it. Does this override your relationship with the bank? No, I don't think so. Suppose you didn't want electronic transfers, you could tell the bank not to do it." Dr. Glenn Laffel, senior vice president of clinical affairs at Practice Fusion, which provides free, Web-based electronic health records, read the wording of the bill and came away confused. "At best, it's vague and ambiguous," Laffel said. "At worst, it would empower the government to do something that isn't right. It's something that needs to be addressed." So in summary, some of the experts we talked to said the wording of the bill is ambiguous enough to allow speculation like Limbaugh's that the government might be able to tap into an individual's bank account to square health payments. But there's nothing in the bill that suggests this program would be required. And while it sounds ominous to say the government could get into your bank account, the same is true for utility and mortgage companies for whom customers have given permission to extract regular electronic payments directly from their bank accounts. The way Limbaugh says it, it sounds like the government would require this program (that it would "have the right") to get into your account, that the government could do it without your permission. And we find no basis for that claim in the bill. We also think Limbaugh exaggerates when he says the government could then transfer money in your account without you knowing it. If you sign up for electronic withdrawal, you know about it. And so we rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2009-09-08T13:03:27	2009-08-28	['None']

pomt-11919	"We're the highest developed nation taxed in the world."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/18/donald-trump/once-again-trump-overstates-us-tax-ranking/	As he presses for sweeping tax reform, President Donald Trump continues to paint the nation’s current tax burden in superlative colors. And he continues to struggle to get it right. In an interview, Mike Sacks, national political correspondent for E.W. Scripps, brought this up with Trump. Here’s that exchange: Sacks: "You've repeatedly said that we're the highest taxed nation in the world when that's been seen as objectively false. With the credibility you need to pass tax reform, why --" Trump: "Some people say it differently, they say we're the highest developed nation taxed in the world." Sacks: "Then why don't you say it that way?" Trump: "Because a lot of people know exactly what i'm talking about, and in many cases they think I’m right when I say the highest. As far as I'm concerned I think we're really essentially the highest, but if you want to add the ‘developed nation,’ you can say that, too. But a lot of people agree that the way I'm saying it is exactly correct." Does adding the "developed nation" label make the claim more accurate? No. When Trump has said before that America has the highest corporate tax rate, he’s on pretty firm ground and we’ve rated him Mostly True. The statutory tax rate for corporations is 35 percent, the highest among countries like Japan, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other European nations. Now to be clear, the tax rate on paper and the effective tax rate are two different things. Thanks to the thousands of deductions and exemptions in state and federal tax codes, according to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report, the effective average corporate tax is 22 percent. That puts the country in the middle of the pack among our economic peers. As for the tax burden across the board for individuals and companies alike, economists generally rely on a couple of yardsticks. One is the total tax burden compared to the size of the economy and the other is the tax burden per person. The most recent numbers come from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for 2015. The countries it compares include the group that are generally seen as "developed nations." As a percentage of GDP, the U.S. tax burden -- covering all levels of government -- ranks 28th out of 32 countries. We ran the numbers based on federal revenues alone, and the rankings stayed about the same. On a per-person basis, America ranks 13th out of 31 nations. We asked the White House if they had other numbers. We didn’t hear back, but if we do, we’ll update this fact-check. Our ruling Trump said that the United States is "the highest developed nation taxed in the world." Looking at tax collections relative to the size of the U.S. economy and the number of people, the numbers tell a different story. The United States ranks 28th in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP and 13th on a per-capita basis. Trump said his view is "exactly correct." In fact, it is exactly incorrect.

pomt-04556	"We have more people working in the state of New Jersey today than we've ever had in our history."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/27/jennifer-beck/jennifer-beck-claims-more-people-are-working-new-j/	With a jobless rate that continues to inch up in New Jersey, some state officials are focusing on more optimistic labor data. But after a report last week that showed the state’s unemployment rate ticked up to 9.9 percent as 5,300 jobs were added in August, a Republican lawmaker trying to accentuate the positive fumbled her facts. "We have more people working in the state of New Jersey today than we've ever had in our history, " state Sen. Jennifer Beck told NJToday on Sept. 20. "So we still have a struggle with those that are unemployed and looking, but we know businesses feel positive about what's going on in our economy and they're looking to hire and we got to keep working at it." With a nearly double digit jobless rate, are more people working in New Jersey now than ever before? That’s not true. Beck said in an e-mail that she misspoke, saying she "meant to say ‘workforce’ instead of ‘working.’" But the key takeaway, she said, is "that there are positive signs for our economy in the midst of some negative ones." The labor force, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, includes employed people and those unemployed but looking for a job. People who are unemployed and not seeking work are not counted. In June the number of people in New Jersey’s labor force was the highest ever, but that figure dropped in July and again in August. Also, as a percentage of the state’s population -- excluding individuals younger than 16 years old, people who are institutionalized and active duty service members -- there’s instances dating to the late 1980s of greater participation in the labor force than now. As for employment, the state isn’t setting any records. The number of employed residents -- as well as the number of jobs in New Jersey, which the federal labor department measures in a separate survey -- peaked in the beginning of 2008 before falling precipitously during the last recession. From December 2007 through June 2009 -- the official start and end of the last recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research -- more than 140,000 New Jersey residents lost their job. At the same time, the state shed more than 190,000 jobs overall, according to data from the federal labor department. Any gains since then have not been substantial enough to push the state above pre-recession peaks. In August, according to preliminary data, less than 4.13 million New Jersey residents were employed, down from nearly 4.29 million in February 2008. The state had roughly 4.1 million jobs -- including public and private sector employment -- in January 2008. Now, the state has more than 3.9 million jobs overall. So the raw numbers prove Beck wrong. But it’s also important to compare labor data as a rate to account for the size of the population, which could impact employment figures. For decades, New Jersey’s employment rate was better. In August, according to preliminary data, about 90 percent of people in the state in the workforce -- that is either employed or looking for work -- had a job. That’s the smallest percentage since March of 1977. Our ruling Beck said, "we have more people working in the state of New Jersey today than we've ever had in our history." That’s wrong. New Jersey has not created enough jobs or put enough residents back to work to surpass the state’s 2008 employment peak. And for decades the state’s employment rate was higher than it is now. We rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Jennifer Beck	None	None	None	2012-09-27T07:30:00	2012-09-20	['New_Jersey']
pomt-09865	The health care reform plan would set limits similar to the "socialized" system in Britain, where people are allowed to die if their treatment would cost more than $22,000.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/06/club-growth/club-growths-health-care-ad-campaign-misleading/	Like other groups criticizing health care reform, the conservative Club for Growth is using the August recess to try to stop the congressional effort to create a government-run health insurance option. Part of the Club's strategy will include a $1.2 million ad campaign aimed at Democrats who may be wavering about the plan. In the ad, a man weeps over someone lying in a hospital bed while the announcer says, "$22,750. In England, government health officials decided that's how much six months of life is worth. Under their socialized system if a medical treatment costs more, you're out of luck. That's wrong for America." That footage is interspersed with shots of the Capitol building and the whole thing is set to some very ominous music. You can watch it here. The carefully worded ad doesn't directly say that the government is planning to put a price on our lives, but the implication is clear: The reform plan will lead to callous decisions that would allow people to die if they face a costly treatment. So that's what we're going to check — whether the reform plan would impose those kind of caps on treatment. At its heart, the Club for Growth's ad criticizes a medical approach known as comparative effectiveness research, which aims to find the most effective treatments for the lowest cost. Such research became a flashpoint during the stimulus debate, when the Conservatives for Patients Rights portrayed the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research, a new board created by the stimulus bill to find the best health treatments, as being modeled after the British system. In fact, the board is very different from the British system, where government entities run the health care system and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence — NICE for short — determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. The stimulus emphasized that the board is not meant to "mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer" and that none of the board's reports or recommendations "shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment, coverage, or treatment." So we gave the Conservatives for Patients Rights claim a Barely True . Once again, some Republicans have started linking the general premise of comparative effectiveness and what NICE does in Britain to describe how a government-run plan in the United States would discriminate against people who are older or very sick. Here's one such comment: "I don't know for sure, but I've heard several senators say that Ted Kennedy with a brain tumor, being 77 years old as opposed to being 37 years old, if he were in England, would not be treated for his disease, because end of life — when you get to be 77, your life is considered less valuable under those systems," said Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, in a news conference with reporters. NICE is an element in the Club for Growth ad as well. The ad refers to a December 2008 article in the New York Times that followed the case of Bruce Hardy, a British man who was denied a $54,000 drug by British health authorities. The article said the drug could have delayed his cancer progression for six months. Under NICE policies, the government would only pay about 15,000 pounds — or $22,750 — to save six months of Hardy's life. (NICE's limits are well known and have been widely discussed in the medical community.) The agency generally considers treatments cost-effective if they are less than $34,000 a year, according to an article in the New England Journal of Medicine. But sometimes the agency will accept treatments that cost far more than that. So the Club for Growth's claim that NICE has a price limit of $22,750 for six months of life is roughly accurate, said Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that is often in step with the Club for Growth. But "does the (Obama health care) legislation say it's going to do what Britain is doing? The answer to that is no," said Cannon. Nevertheless, Cannon doesn't believe that the ad is too far off, pointing to a proposal by the White House that would create an independent group of health experts that would look for inefficiencies in Medicare coverage. "With the government assuming an even larger majority in health spending, it becomes very hard to argue that they won't have to ration... [Club for Growth] is implying that this is where it would lead and that's valid." But at this point, that proposal is not included in either the House or the Senate bill, so we believe it's quite a stretch for the Club for Growth to suggest it would be part of the health reform plan. Dr. Sean Tunis, a former top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid under the Bush administration and current director of the Center for Medical Technology Policy, says the ad is misleading. "We have a public plan now, and that's Medicare," Tunis said. "And Medicare doesn't put a price on life. ... That seems like a fallacious connection to me." The only initiative from the Obama administration along those lines is the increase in funding for comparative effectiveness research through the stimulus. That data would be used to help doctors and patients make better drug and procedure decisions, not dictate treatment, he said. So, back to the Club for Growth ad. Although our experts agree that it gets the NICE statistic correct about the British practice, the ad's main point about cost limits is incorrect. There is no such practice in the comparative effectiveness program, nor is it part of the current health reform proposals pending in Congress. The House and Senate bills under consideration would not require the government to decide how much a person's life is worth. As a result, we give the Club for Growth a False.

pomt-04567	A poll conducted in Egypt revealed that 80 percent of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/26/barry-hinckley/us-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-80-percent/	In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and protests throughout the Middle East over the YouTube video that disparaged Mohammad, some critics of U.S. foreign policy have questioned the aid we give to such countries. One was Barry Hinckley, a Republican running against U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. A Sept. 14 story posted on 630WPRO.com reports: "Hinckley said a poll conducted in Egypt revealed that 80% of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States." The story headlined "Hinckley calls for elimination of U.S. aid to Libya, Pakistan, and Egypt," which Hinckley references on his Facebook page, quotes the candidate as saying, "It makes absolutely zero sense to further burden our own economy to give billions of dollars to a country that doesn't even want it." said Hinckley. He said Whitehouse characterized the idea of cutting foreign aid to Egypt as a "blunder." "I believe that it is a far greater blunder to continue sending billions of dollars to nations that violently attack American lives and property," Hinckley says in the story. We gave Hinckley a False ruling in April when he asserted that President Obama gave $1.5 billion to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood (that's the amount of aid going to Egypt, most of it to the military), so we were interested in whether 80 percent of Egyptians really do want U.S. aid to stop. We e-mailed Hinckley's campaign manager and spokesman, but didn't get a response. So we went looking ourselves, and found a Gallup poll conducted in Egypt between Jan. 31 and Feb. 7. The key question: Do you favor or oppose the U.S. sending economic aid to Egypt? The survey of 1,000 Egyptians, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points, found that 82 percent opposed U.S. aid, a rate that has been growing since Gallup began asking the question in April 2011, when 52 percent were opposed. The survey also found that the results don't just apply to aid from the United States. Opposition to aid from international organizations such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund went from a low of 32 percent in September 2011 up to 57 percent during the February 2012 survey. Opposition to aid from other Arab governments has been increasing as well, but not to the point where more Egyptians oppose it or support it. The rate of opposition went from 22 percent in September 2011 to 39 percent in the February poll. Why the growing opposition? Gallup said in its March 29, 2012, analysis that public antagonism toward the aid rose after non-government, pro-democracy groups from the United States and Europe, working in Egypt, were accused of illegally accepting foreign funds and trying to foster unrest. As the Gallup report says, "The murky circumstances and arrangements that resulted in the prosecution, travel limitations, and then sudden departure of U.S. citizens facing trial in Egypt has only inflamed Egyptians' sense of distrust and suspicion regarding such organizations and what U.S. funds mean for Egyptian sovereignty." Forty-three people from those groups, including some Egyptians, were accused of such things as paying activists to incite protests in Egypt to destabilize the country. The latest survey was done shortly after they sought refuge in the U.S. embassy and before many were allowed to leave the country after posting bail. We also found a second study that asked the question in a different way but produced a similar response. That poll of 1,000 Eyptians, conducted March 19 to April 10 by the Pew Research Center, found that 61 percent said both U.S. military and economic aid have a harmful effect on Egypt. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. Our ruling Barry Hinckley, in raising questions about whether the United States should be giving foreign aid to countries such as Egypt, said that 80 percent of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States. A Gallup poll taken in February shows that he's right in the ballpark. We rate his statement as True. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-05318	Says he represents or has represented about half the San Antonio-rooted district in which he seeks election.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/may/17/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-he-represents-or-has-represente/	Appearing with fellow Democrats seeking a new U.S. House seat, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin defended his decision to run in the 35th Congressional District, which snakes from downtown San Antonio north into southeastern Travis County. On the April 13, 2012, edition of KLRN-TV’s "Texas Week," Doggett pointed out that this is the second decade that the state’s ruling Republicans, including Gov. Rick Perry, have tried to knock him out of the House by drawing district lines seemingly to his disadvantage. Doggett, who is not seeking re-election in his newly Republican-leaning 25th Congressional District, said that, in contrast, "the district that I am running in for re-election to Congress is the district that has more of my current constituents than any other district in the state. I represent or have represented about half of the district; the other half is new." Sylvia Romo of San Antonio, the Bexar County tax assessor-collector, objected, saying that 55 percent of the 35th district is in Bexar County. Inaccurate, Doggett said, and then the program’s host, Rick Casey, offered up that 47 percent of the district is in Bexar County with 31 percent in Travis County; that is where Doggett resides. "But I don't just represent Travis County," Doggett replied. "I represent Lockhart and San Marcos and Kyle. And when you include the areas that I serve in Congress, it's just under half of this total district." Phew. Is Doggett right? By email, Doggett campaign spokeswoman Ashley Bliss-Herrera passed along a population analysis of the 35th district from the Texas Legislative Council, which helps state legislators draft legislation. Bliss-Herrera said the analysis shows that nearly 315,300 of the district’s nearly 698,500 residents, or 45 percent, live in the Travis, Hays and Caldwell county portions of the district. And, she said, Doggett has represented those areas before. We provided Bliss-Herrera with another population analysis by the legislative council indicating that about 41 percent of the 35th district’s residents were previously in the 25th district now represented by Doggett. According to the council, the 35th district also sweeps in residents of the 10th, 20th, 21st, 23rd and 28th congressional districts that will be moot after the next Congress is sworn in. Bliss-Herrera said the latter analysis does not account for parts of Travis County in the 35th district that Doggett has represented in the past. Doggett was initially elected to succeed Rep. J.J. "Jake" Pickle in 1994, representing what was then the 10th district taking in nearly all of Travis County. This wrinkle seems believable, though we were unable to confirm as much from available legislative council data. All told, then, it’s evident that Doggett has represented 41 percent of the district he seeks to represent. It’s also plausible that he’s represented 45 percent. That’s approaching half. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Lloyd Doggett	None	None	None	2012-05-17T16:57:13	2012-04-14	['None']
pomt-08047	"The Greenest County in America."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/03/dekalb-county/dekalb-greenest-county-nation-claim-gets-muddy/	In metro Atlanta, the land of smog alerts and farmland-turned-to-suburbs, one local county makes a bold claim about its efforts to be environmentally conscious. DeKalb County, its website says, is "the greenest county in America." Let's put that on some recycled paper and send it to each of the county's estimated 750,000 residents. DeKalb's communications director, Burke Brennan, sent PolitiFact Georgia an e-mail making the case for the county. It includes: the claim DeKalb has the only public landfill in Georgia doing a methane gas-to-electricity program, producing enough power to fuel as many as 4,000 homes. the county has acquired more than 3,000 acres of new parkland and greenspace over the past eight years; a huge feat, DeKalb says since it is more than 85 percent developed. a claim DeKalb has 48 miles of hiking and biking trails, the most of any county in Georgia. all newly-constructed buildings that cost more than $5 million to build are LEED projects, a third-party certification program that a structure is environmentally efficient. the county received a $14.9 million federal grant to fund programs designed to reduce the use of fossil fuels in its transportation vehicles. the Atlanta Regional Commission recognized DeKalb in December 2009 as one of its first Green Communities. "In DeKalb County, we are taking the lead on sustainability ... we are one step closer to being the greenest county in America," DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Burrell Ellis said in 2009 when the county was honored by the ARC. Many folks we discussed this claim with used phrases like "bold" or "ambitious" to describe DeKalb's audacity, not willing to publicly dismiss it. Some were willing to criticize the claim. "That's all a good case for them to be one of the greenest counties in Georgia," said Mark Woodall, Georgia chapter chairman of the Sierra Club, which claims to be the largest grassroots environmental organization in the state. "DeKalb being the greenest county in America seems pretty unthinkable." Being "green," means many things these days. Some organizations have occasionally released surveys rankings America's greenest cities, but we found few similar rankings of counties. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to improve health and health care for Americans, earlier this year looked at the environmental health of each U.S. county. One category was physical health. The foundation used data put together by researchers from the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the physical health of each county. The criteria included how many days the air was unhealthy, the number of days the air was unhealthy due to ozone, access to healthy foods and how many liquor stores were in a county. DeKalb ranked near the bottom of Georgia counties, 153rd, in terms of physical health. Some categories that DeKalb is bragging about are difficult to compare. In other areas, such as the number of LEED-certified buildings, Dekalb has competition. Gwinnett had three LEED-certifiied structures, according to the U.S. Green Building Council. DeKalb is an Energy Star partner -- a federal effort to protect the environment through energy-efficient practices -- but so are Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta. On hiking and biking trails, DeKalb may run into some argument about having the most in Georgia. Cobb County, for example, lists about 75 miles of trails within its cities and unincorporated areas. It was suggested we look at Arlington County, Va. to find another county that could make a case it is greener than DeKalb. The county has a page on its website with more than a dozen awards and recognition for its sustainable community and environmental efforts. Arlington won two National Association of Counties Achievement Awards this year for its recycling efforts. That organization also named Arlington its Outstanding Civil Engineering Project award in 2006 for its Green Building Program. Other counties, like Boulder, Colo., have goals such as reducing outdoor water use by 50 percent by using indigenous plants and recycling 50 percent of construction waste. DeKalb's case was muddied in December when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined $453,000 for 836 sewage spills over the last five years. The EPA estimates there are about 40,000 spills from the nation's 25,000 sewage systems a year. California officials reported about 2,000 spills into the San Francisco Bay in 2008. Brennan noted the day after the fine was announced, county commissioners voted 6-1 to spend $1.345 billion to make repairs to its water and sewer system, nearly twice as much money as the EPA recommended. DeKalb taxpayers will pay higher water and sewer bills to help fund the work. Despite the fine, Brennan stuck by DeKalb's claim. "Nobody here is claiming perfection, but based on the programs, awards, designations and initiatives DeKalb has in place and ongoing, I am sticking with the motto 'DeKalb is the greenest county in America,' " Brennan told us in an e-mail. "After all, 'Cowboy Capital of the World' was already taken," added Brennan, referring to Oakdale, Calif. DeKalb has certainly tried to make its mark as an environmentally conscious county.

pomt-04307	"We borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/30/clint-eastwood/clint-eastwood-says-ad-us-borrows-4-billion-day-mu/	In an ad from American Crossroads, Clint Eastwood tells the country it "just couldn’t survive" another four years of President Barack Obama: "We borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China," he says. The message, part of a $12.6 million ad barrage, is running in seven states, including Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia. Images of unemployed workers and foreign-marked shipping containers accompany Eastwood’s gravelly narration: In the last few years, America's been knocked down. Twenty-three million people can't find full-time work, and we borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China. When someone doesn't get the job done, you've got to hold them accountable. Obama's second term would be a rerun of the first, and our country just couldn't survive that. We need someone who could turn it around fast, and that man is Mitt Romney. There's not much time left, and the future of our country is at stake. It’s been more than a year since we’ve checked similar claims that the country borrows $4 billion a day — something we found Mostly True. We wondered: Is that still the case? And do we borrow "much of it" from China? We asked American Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio for evidence for the ad’s claim. "I'm going to let you take a crack at that and get back to me," he said. We sent him a brief roundup of what we had found so far. We didn’t hear back. How much we borrow The federal government doesn’t literally borrow money every day, but through periodic bond auctions. So we assumed the ad used an average. Here’s one way to do the math on $4 billion a day. The total federal debt on the day the ad was released, according to the Treasury Department, was $16.2 trillion. On the day Obama took office, it was $10.6 trillion. That’s a gain of $5.6 trillion — about $4 billion a day. There are a few nits to pick with this math. First, we’re not currently borrowing that much. Over the last year, the average has been about $3.4 billion a day, not $4 billion. Second, that’s using a measure of the entire federal debt — including the big chunk we owe ourselves that’s held by government accounts such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. "Debt held by the public" is the the amount the federal government has actually borrowed to finance deficits. And the amount added to the public debt since Obama took office averages about $3.7 billion a day, not $4 billion. Still, this part of the claim is pretty close. ‘Much of it from China’ Then there’s the part about China. This is where the ad’s claim gets goofy. If we assume Eastwood’s talking about what’s been added to the entire federal debt since Obama took office — the amount that averages $4 billion a day — here’s how much as of August China owns: 7.7 percent. If someone told you that there were two pieces to our recent debt, one piece under 8 percent and one piece above 92 percent, then asked you which of those pieces represented "much of it," what would you say? We’re guessing the non-Chinese piece. Still, China is the No. 1 foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities. (About a third of our total debt is held by foreigners.) So the main concern about U.S. public debt held by foreigners is mainly what might happen if they all stopped buying. It could drive up U.S. interest rates, said Wayne Morrison, a specialist in Asian trade and finance for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Does that give China some sort of leverage? Or what if they sold off their U.S. securities all at once, sparking some kind of financial crisis? "Many economists argue that such a move is highly unlikely," Morrison told PolitiFact. If China tried a big selloff, it would drive up supply of U.S. Treasuries and drive down their value — tanking the value of China’s own holdings. Our ruling Eastwood, speaking in a recent American Crossroads ad, warns that, "We borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China." That amount is the rough daily average of all U.S. debt added since Obama took office, including the type the government owes itself. It’s not the current rate, which has been somewhat lower. And while China is the No. 1 foreign holder of U.S. securities, it purchased less than 10 percent of that debt. This claim is only partly accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04938	"The largest number of bankruptcies in our country are really as a result of health care."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/29/patrick-kennedy/former-us-rep-patrick-kennedy-says-most-bankruptci/	Former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy went on the WPRO Morning News on July 13 to talk about the Middle East and the national health-care overhaul. When asked about the "political tension surrounding Obamacare," Kennedy said people such as his father, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, President Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney don’t have to worry about their health care. "In other words, when my brother Teddy had life-threatening cancer, my father realized that they had to worry about his survival, but they didn’t have to worry about him being bankrupted because he was trying to save his son’s life," Kennedy said. "Many Americans are worried that when an illness strikes the family, not only is it an illness, but it's a threat of bankruptcy. And the largest number of bankruptcies in our country are really as a result of health care." Given the continuing debate over the health-care overhaul, we thought that claim was worth checking. When we asked what he based that statement on, Kennedy, a Democrat who served eight terms representing Rhode Island in Congress before stepping down two years ago, could not cite a specific study or group making that claim, but he said, "I’ve been in a million rallies on health care. It’s the most well-versed thing out there." While job losses or foreclosures might have been big contributors following the 2008 financial crisis, Kennedy said, over time "it’s pretty well understood that personal bankruptcy’s largest cause was because of the medical crisis," and "no one has contended it’s anything other than that. Whether it is the cause of the final bankruptcy or a contributing cause, there’s no question it’s involved in a major way." To check Kennedy’s claim, we first called the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonpartisan research and education group based in Alexandria, Va. Public affairs director John Hartgen said anecdotal evidence indicates medical reasons are "definitely a big cause" for bankruptcies, "but also death of a spouse, credit card debt, loss of a job, and you have a housing crisis now." He said the institute does not have its own data to quantify the reasons for bankruptcies, but he pointed us to a study by Harvard researchers and a report by the Institute for Financial Literacy. The Harvard study, published in the American Journal of Medicine in 2009, has attracted a lot of attention in part because one of the researchers was Elizabeth Warren, the former Harvard Law School professor who is now the Democratic candidate challenging U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., for the seat once held by Kennedy’s father. The study, which follows a similar Harvard study in 2001, was based on "the first-ever national random-sample survey" of 2,314 bankruptcy filers and it concluded that, "Using a conservative definition, 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical." But "that’s not the end of the story," as PolitiFact National said in 2009 when it gave then-Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a Half True for saying that "62 percent of all personal bankruptcies were caused by medical problems." PolitiFact National noted that in the Harvard study, 29 percent of respondents attributed their bankruptcy to medical bills from illness or injury. But when respondents were asked if medical-related issues such as lost income due to illness or the mortgage of a home to pay medical bills contributed to their bankruptcy, that figure rose to 62 percent, giving some support to Kennedy’s claim. "The statistic that we think is most reliable is the percentage of people who say medical bills were the reason for their bankruptcy, and that number is 29 percent," PolitiFact National said. But, again, that’s not the end of the story. The Institute for Financial Literacy, a nonprofit financial education and counseling organization based in South Portland, Maine, has been compiling a demographic profile of American debtors since 2006. It surveyed credit-counseling clients seeking bankruptcy protection, asking them to identify their "causes of financial distress." They could choose more than one cause, so the percentages equal more than 100 percent. In the most recent report, issued in September 2011, "overextended on credit" was the leading cause of financial distress at 70.5 percent, followed "reduction of income" at 64.9 percent, "unexpected expenses" at 56.6 percent, "job loss" at 43.5 percent, "illness/injury" at 30.9 percent and "divorce" at 15.5 percent. "The institute has surveyed over 200,000 individuals in the past five years and what we find interesting is not so much what changed, but what has not," the report said. For example, it said that causes such as "illness/injury" have remained "rather consistent," while causes such as "job loss" have become a bigger factor. Our ruling Patrick Kennedy said "The largest number of bankruptcies in our country are really as a result of health care." While Kennedy didn’t cite any data to back his assertion, he could have relied upon the Harvard study to provide some support for his statement. But the Institute for Financial Literacy report undercuts the claim, with 70 percent of respondents citing credit problems and only 31 percent "illness/injury" as the leading cause of their bankruptcies. Since the matter is not nearly as clear-cut as Kennedy presented it, we rate his claim "Half True."	None	Patrick Kennedy	None	None	None	2012-07-29T00:01:00	2012-07-13	['None']

pomt-13495	"I was totally against the war in Iraq."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/donald-trump/trump-repeats-wrong-claim-he-opposed-iraq-war/	The long shadow of the Iraq War continues to color presidential politics. In a forum focused on national security, Democrat Hillary Clinton was questioned about her Senate vote in favor of action against Iraq. She in turn noted that Donald Trump initially supported the war. When it was Trump’s turn, the Republican nominee denied the charge. "I was totally against the war in Iraq," Trump said during the NBC News event. "You can look at Esquire magazine from '04. You can look at before that." Well, we have gone back further than the 2004 interview Trump mentioned, and the record tells a different story. Trump has a hard time getting past a September 2002 interview with shock jock Howard Stern. Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion. Trump responded, "Yeah, I guess so." Trump dialed that back a bit in another interview in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. "Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know," Trump said. "He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned." So Trump put the economy ahead of confronting Iraq, but he didn’t speak against going to war. At most he suggested waiting for the United Nations to do something. A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave different takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that "the war’s a mess," according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, "The market’s going to go up like a rocket." The earliest evidence of Trump’s outright opposition to the war came in that August 2004 article in Esquire: "Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way," Trump said. Trump has been challenged many times in this election to explain his early acceptance of the war. In a February 2016 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump said that he didn’t know what he meant during his 2002 conversation with Stern. "That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head." Trump said. Our ruling Trump said he was "totally against the war in Iraq." While he came to that position when the war became difficult, earlier on he was more accepting of military action. In 2002, asked if America should go to war, he said, "I guess so." Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said the president should be more focused on the economy, but he didn’t speak against launching an attack. Trump didn’t speak often about the Iraq War before it happened, but what he said did not add up to the sort of opposition he describes today.

pomt-03032	Says "between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/09/earl-blumenauer/can-6-20-bicycles-fit-single-car-parking-space/	U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer has been associated with many causes during his 17 years in Congress. Bow ties come to mind, as does his support for protecting public lands. As founder and co-chair of the Congressional Bicycle Caucus, Blumenauer has been a leading voice in trying to establish the bicycle as a viable form of urban transportation. On the "Bike and Pedestrian Issues" page of his official website, he says that cycling improves health, is good for the environment and reduces transportation costs. One assertion in particular jumps out. It says, "Between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car." PolitiFact Oregon wondered whether that’s true. At first glance, the notion of up to 20 bicycles jammed into a single parking space seems a little much. To get an explanation, we called Blumenauer’s Washington, D.C., office and talked with spokesman Patrick Malone. Malone said the figure came from a paper published in 2011 by researcher Thomas Gotschi. "Costs and Benefits of Bicycling Investments in Portland, Oregon" was published in the Journal of Physical Activity & Health. A close reading does not reveal statistics addressing how many bicycles fit into a parking space. One section includes a sentence reading, "The millions of miles traveled by bike reduce road and parking capacity demand, which is much more costly to provide for cars than for bikes." It’s followed by a footnote, which took us to a second study, published this summer by the Victoria (B.C.) Transport Policy Institute. That 59-page study, written by Todd Litman, states, "10-20 bicycles can typically be stored in the space required for one automobile." Malone also referred to the bike corrals scattered around downtown Portland that hold 12 bicycles each, all in the amount of room needed to park a car. Then, noting two-tiered indoor bike parking available at Portland State University, he added, "If you took the bike corrals we have now and put in double-decker parking with locks and lift assists, you could double that." Scott Cohen, the Portland Bureau of Transportation’s transportation demand management specialist, said Portland has 99 bike corrals. The portion that holds bicycles is 17 feet long and accommodates up to 12 bikes. A standard marked car-parking space is 20 feet long and about 10 feet wide. None of the corrals is the two-tier type mentioned by Malone. So 12 is the highest number of bicycle anyone will see in an area the size of a parking space. Two-tiered bike racks are available online but are primarily designed for commercial storage and retail bike storage and display. Several commercial racks hold as many as 20 bikes in 20 feet, but they need to be mounted to a wall or ceiling and aren’t really designed for outdoor use. Portland-based Alta Planning & Design, which has rolled out its Bicycle Share program in eight cities in the U.S. and abroad, says its racks fit about 10 bicycles in the length of a parking space. What if people simply stood their bikes next to one another or heaped them in a pile? Could 20 bikes fit inside a parking space then? Probably, but those options seem highly unlikely in the United States, and Malone didn’t mention them. Twelve bicycles can be locked safely in downtown Portland bike corrals, but 20 stretches the limits of anything in use -- in Portland and nationwide. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center says streetside bike corrals should accommodate 10 to 12 bikes. The Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals recommends spacing so that no more than 12 fit into a parking spot. As for the mechanical lifts available at PSU: Those won’t be showing on city streets anytime soon. City policies allow only one-tier corrals, and businesses that already pay the city $2,600 to install one seem unlikely to want to pony up more. Blumenauer’s office does cite a study with a footnote leading to another study that says 10 to 20 bikes can fit into a single parking spot. The congressman’s website also gives a range of 6 to 20 bikes, while 12 can commonly fit in corrals. So we find his statement Half True.

pomt-11869	Says the diversity visa lottery program is "a Chuck Schumer beauty."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/01/donald-trump/was-diversity-visa-program-schumer-beauty-donald-t/	The morning after a vehicular terrorist attack in New York City killed at least eight people and injured a dozen others, President Donald Trump blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose constituents were among the casualties. Trump on Nov. 1 tweeted, "The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Hours later at a news conference, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Trump’s tweet was "not helpful" and "wasn’t even accurate as far as I’m concerned, about the bipartisan law that was passed." What do the facts really show? It was misleading of Trump to fully place the lottery program on Schumer’s shoulders. He did sponsor immigration legislation that contained the lottery system. But Trump's tweet ignores the support the measure earned from Republicans as well as Schumer’s more recent actions to rescind the lottery. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com A picture of suspect Sayfullo Saipov is displayed during a news conference about the attack along a bike path in lower Manhattan that is being called a terrorist incident on Nov. 1, 2017, in New York City. (Getty) What is the diversity visa program? Trump said the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, entered the United States from Uzbekistan under the diversity visa program. The roots of the diversity visa program stem from consequences of a landmark overhaul in 1965 that led to large numbers of immigrants from Asia and Latin America. It moved from a country-by-country quota system to neutral country-of-origin selection criteria for green cards. By the late 1970s and 1980s, a large group of Irish nationals, primarily on the eastern seaboard, had arrived on temporary visas and overstayed, remaining illegally in the country. Irish-American and Italian-American members of Congress joined forces to pass the Immigration Act of 1990, creating a system that would effectively help distant Irish and Italian relatives of those immigrants come to the United States and live permanently and legally. "This lottery was created for Irish and Italians by Irish and Italian Americans, but after a while the beneficiaries lost interest in it," said Anna O. Law, Herbert Kurz Chair of Constitutional Rights at CUNY Brooklyn College. "The countries that are very enthusiastic about the program are in Africa." An annual random lottery system began selecting applicants in 1995 from countries that had low immigration levels in the previous five years, with a cap of 55,000 immigrant visas a year to recipients who meet education or work requirements. The cap is now 50,000, after Congress decided to allocate 5,000 of the 55,000 annual visas to people eligible for the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act program. Trump wants to eliminate the diversity visa program and shift to a merit-based immigration system. Schumer was involved in the program’s creation. But there’s more to the legislative story. What was Schumer’s role in creating the lottery? Enacting a diversity lottery had a long and winding road in Congress. It was driven by Democrats but earned Republican votes from many recognizable names today. The White House pointed us to a bill -- H.R. 4165 -- that was introduced on March 1, 1990, when Schumer was serving in the House. Schumer was the lead sponsor of the bill, which had many provisions, including language on diversity visas. That bill received hearings in the House but was eventually rolled into another bill, H.R. 4300. The Democratic-controlled House passed the bill on Oct. 3, 1990, by a margin of 231-192. By party, Democrats supported it 186-65, while Republicans went 47-127. Schumer voted yes -- along with four other Republicans still serving in the House. The four were Dana Rohrabacher of California, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Chris Smith of New Jersey and Don Young of Alaska. Another yes vote came from future Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a frequent Trump ally. Meanwhile, the Senate pursued a companion bill -- S. 358 -- that included the diversity lottery provision, sponsored by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. On Oct. 26, 1990, the Democratic-controlled Senate approved a conference report -- a version of the bill to be taken up in both chambers with identical language -- by an 89-8 margin. Republicans who supported the measure included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who was then a first-termer, and current Republican Sens. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Orrin Hatch of Utah, John McCain of Arizona, and Richard Shelby of Alabama (who was then a Democrat). In addition, Trump’s director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, voted for the conference report. The House approved the conference report the following day, by a 264-118 margin. This time, a majority of House Republicans voted for the measure, 93-64. The Republican yes votes included Rohrabacher and Ros-Lehtinen, along with two other GOP lawmakers still serving, Joe Barton of Texas and Fred Upton of Michigan. The House passage sent the measure to the desk of President George H.W. Bush. On Nov. 29, 1990, Bush signed it, saying he was "pleased" to do so. "This act recognizes the fundamental importance and historic contributions of immigrants to our country," Bush said upon signing the bill. "Most members of Congress wanted mainly to increase the number of European immigrants, whom they felt were underrepresented in modern U.S. immigration," said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "As it turned out, the overwhelming majority of diversity visas have gone to Europeans and Africans in roughly equal numbers, far more than to immigrants from any other continents." Schumer’s efforts to eliminate the lottery Whatever responsibility you attribute the program's existence to Schumer, Trump’s tweet ignores his more recent efforts to eliminate the program. During the 2013 effort to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul, Schumer was one of the bipartisan "gang of eight" that negotiated a bill that, among other things, would have eliminated the diversity lottery. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who also belonged to the "gang of eight," replied to Trump’s tweet by offering his support for Schumer. "Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms. I know, I was there," Flake tweeted. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com That bill passed the Senate, 68-32, but it died when members who support low levels of immigration, predominantly Republicans, prevented any action in the GOP-controlled House. Our ruling Trump said the diversity visa lottery program is "a Chuck Schumer beauty." Schumer did introduce legislation, 27 years ago, that included initial language establishing the diversity visa lottery. However, Schumer was hardly the only politician with a role in its passage. The bill was signed by a Republican president, and the final version of the legislation received majority Republican support in both chambers of Congress, In fact, McConnell and several other Republicans still in office voted for the bill. Moreover, Trump’s tweet ignores that Schumer, just four years ago, worked to pass a bill that would have ended the lottery, but it died due to Republican opposition in the House.

She's sold lots of her own books ($10.5-million in royalties from 2000-2007, according to her tax returns), and she has inspired dozens more by her friends and enemies. At a forum on faith issues in Grantham, Pa., on April 13, 2008, Clinton was asked about her comments that she had felt the presence of the Holy Spirit. She replied that since she was young, she had felt the presence of God many times. She added, "You know, I am someone who has talked a lot about my life. You know more about my life than you know about nearly anybody else's, about 60 books' worth, some of which are, you know, frankly, a little bit off-base." She has mentioned the 60-book figure several times before. We wondered if she was right. We don't normally rely on Wikipedia as a primary source for PolitiFact because it's open-to-all-editors approach raises questions about its accuracy, but we found it has the most complete list of Clinton books. It conveniently separates them into volumes by Clinton herself, as well as those that take an anti-Clinton and pro-Clinton approach. From Clinton herself there is It Takes a Village and Living History, not to mention her senior honors thesis, "There Is Only the Fight...": An Analysis of the Alinsky Model." The pro-Clinton books include The Case for Hillary Clinton and Hillary's Turn: Inside Her Improbable, Victorious Senate Campaign. The anti-Clinton market must be considerably more lucrative because it has four times the pro-Clinton offerings. The anti-Clinton books include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Can She be Stopped? and Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House. The "mostly neutral" books include Carl Bernstein's A Woman in Charge and Judith Warner's Hillary Clinton: The Inside Story. We also found some intriguing scholarly studies: The Rhetorical Construction of the Female Politician in Newspapers: How National Newspapers Portrayed Katherine Harris and Hillary Clinton During Controversial Times and Hillary Rodham Clinton as 'Madonna': The Role of Metaphor and Oxymoron in Image Restoration. We checked the count on WorldCat.org, an online catalog of books. We only counted books in English, which meant we excluded Hillary Clinton: die machtigste Frau der Welt, and we skipped The Hillary Clinton Voodoo Kit: Stick It to Her, Before She Sticks It to You! because it sounded more novelty item than literature. Our WorldCat search came up with 48 books. Wikipedia's list was more complete: 69 books if you include the scholarly studies, 58 if you don't. So Clinton was in the ballpark.

pomt-03211	"State law says that once the state appraises a piece of property, they can only pay it a certain amount above appraisal."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/26/kasim-reed/mayor-correct-state-stadium-spending-limitations/	Plans to build a new $1 billion stadium in downtown Atlanta may sound like a project with limitless cash. But there are boundaries concerning what can be spent, according to a key player in the effort. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed recently took to the radio to discuss the fractured negotiations with Mount Vernon Baptist Church’s leaders to buy its property. The land on which that historic church sits is necessary to build the new sports facility on a preferred site. State officials have said they cannot offer any more than the highest appraised value it receives, $6.2 million in this case. The church initially said a fair price is about $20 million. PolitiFact originally rated Reed’s claim False. But state Attorney General Sam Olens disagreed, saying the mayor was correct. Reed, too, asked us to rethink our rating. PolitiFact decided to do more digging and reconsider its original ruling, drawing in more expertise. (You can read the original fact-check by going to this link: http://www.politifact.com/georgia/kasim-reed-stadium/.) The mayor said the state, specifically the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which is in charge of negotiations with the church, can only offer a certain amount of money. Reed explained during an Aug. 7 interview with Sports Radio 680 The Fan. "The state has some limitations on what they can pay above the appraised price. ... We’re not going to be able to pay Mount Vernon $19.5 million because of the constraints that the state has in what they can pay," Reed said on the station’s program "The Front Row." The mayor went into more detail about a minute later. "State law says that once the state appraises a piece of property, they can only pay a certain amount above appraisal," Reed said. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the mayor is correct. Is the state limited on how far it can move the financial goal posts to strike a deal with the church? The Atlanta Falcons have been working with the city, the GWCCA and others on a deal to build a new stadium, replacing the Georgia Dome, which is owned by the state. The city would prefer to build the new stadium on land south of the Dome, in large part because of its accessibility to MARTA rail lines. In order to build on that site, the city would need land where two longtime churches stand, Friendship Baptist Church and Mount Vernon. The initial deadline to work out a deal with the churches was Aug. 1. Although the city struck a deal with Friendship, the GWCCA was unable to do so with Mount Vernon. Reed held a news conference Aug. 6 asking all involved to continue the discussions. The $6.2 million value is included in a two-page revised appraisal letter completed July 30 for the state. The letter provides an "as-is" value for the church. The letter lists the value for the church at $30 per square foot, or roughly $3.4 million for 113,000 square feet. An additional $2.8 million is included for parking revenue. Reed’s communications director, Sonji Jacobs, referred to language in the Georgia Constitution, known as the Gratuities Clause, to explain the mayor’s point. State Properties Commission spokeswoman Cindy Presto referenced the same language in the constitution -- Article III, Section VI, Paragraph VI(a) -- when we contacted the agency seeking help. It reads: "Except as otherwise provided in the Constitution, (1) the General Assembly shall not have the power to grant any donation or gratuity or to forgive any debt or obligation owing to the public, and (2) the General Assembly shall not grant or authorize extra compensation to any public officer, agent, or contractor after the service has been rendered or the contract entered into." Said Jacobs: "Basically, if the state does not pay appraised value, it could be thought to be providing an unearned benefit, which is not allowed under Georgia law." Olens said in an email to PolitiFact that his office has for decades interpreted the Gratuities Clause in the state constitution as limiting the state to "paying fair market value for property, absent some additional source of value that the state receives from the transaction." The Attorney General’s Office believes there’s no gray area concerning state guidelines on appraisals, said Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for Olens. "It’s a black and white issue," she said. Kane said the appraisal value, absent a special circumstance, is considered the fair-market value that can be paid for a property. The proposed $1 billion stadium, she said, is not considered a special circumstance. When there is a dispute in appraisals, the state agency in some cases may accept the higher appraisal, Kane said. "But as a general matter, the highest appraisal is the limit of what an agency may pay absent special circumstances," she said. "No such dispute exists here, and there are no special circumstances." The Attorney General’s Office has been involved in the negotiations with Mount Vernon. Kane said her office is unaware of any instances in which the state Supreme Court ruled contrary to attorney general opinions concerning the Gratuities Clause. The attorney general is the top attorney for state agencies, Olens said. He said the GWCCA must abide by attorney general rulings like this one. Olens is correct if a state agency is buying the property, Emory University law professor Frank Alexander said. "An attorney general’s opinion under Georgia law is the opinion of the attorney general. It is usually seen to be binding for the AG’s clients, which are the state agencies," Alexander said. GWCCA spokeswoman Jennifer LeMaster said the sole purchaser of the Mount Vernon property would be the state, or the GWCCA as the state agency involved in the negotiations. On the purchase price guidelines, the agency defers to the attorney general, she said. Reed has worked independently to reach a deal with the church, announcing recently that Mount Vernon would agree to $15.5 million. But any amount over the $6.2 million would have to come from another party, likely in the form of a gift, LeMaster said. Will the deal for Mount Vernon be limited only to the $6.2 million in state money? Or will "some other resources," as Reed described them in the interview, come into play. Stay tuned. Reed’s statement is based largely on the state attorney general’s interpretation of a portion of the Georgia Constitution, which is appropriate because the land will be purchased by a state agency. Given that, we reverse our earlier ruling. We rate Reed’s statement True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2013-08-26T00:00:00	2013-08-07	['None']

pomt-06485	Says "There are now Occupy Wall Street camps in hundreds of cities across the United States."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/15/sam-adams/portland-mayor-sam-adams-occupy-wall-street-protes/	Portland Mayor Sam Adams re-opened Main Street in downtown Portland Thursday morning, but wouldn’t elaborate on what he would do with campers who have occupied two public squares for more than a week now and plan to do so indefinitely. They are part of the Occupy Wall Street protest that started Sept. 17 in New York. "There are now Occupy Wall Street camps in hundreds of cities across the United States," Adams said, "and mayors and police chiefs across the United States are having to make practical day-to-day decisions about keeping the peace, protecting people's legal rights to freedom of expression and at the same time keeping this city and all cities moving." We know Occupy Wall Street protests have spread wildly and widely, but were there actually protest camps in hundreds of U.S. cities? That struck PolitiFact Oregon as a touch on the big side. We set out to find out just how many cities are involved in this growing movement. It turns out answers vary. The website for "Occupy Together," which serves as a hub for people sympathetic to the protests, says there are "Occupy Together Meetups" in more than 1,500 cities. But an "Occupy Wall Street" post Friday says protests have spread to a much smaller "over 100 cities." ABC World News anchor Diane Sawyer put the figure at more than 250 U.S. cities (before getting ridiculed for saying it had spread to more than a thousand countries). A CBS News report pegged the spread at 145 cities. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Mayors didn’t have an estimate of cities with protests -- camps or otherwise. You get the picture. So we contacted the mayor’s spokeswoman, Amy Ruiz, who added one more figure to the mix: a link to an Oct. 4 post on DailyKos, which mapped "Occupy" groups in 200 cities, categorized by state. Those turned out to be links to Facebook pages and websites, and there were close to 300 organizations. But the post didn’t quite back up the mayor’s assertion about camps. While some linked to groups with occupying camps, like the one in Portland, others were a lot less developed. Next, we scoured Associated Press stories, looking for local reports of "Occupy Wall Street" events. In the last week we found about 65 cities mentioned, from Trenton, N.J., to Seaside, Ore. The number of cities with protest camps is smaller, with some over-nighters to start Oct. 15. (Check out Occupy Eugene.) Again, a strikeout. Finally, we found an interactive map on Mother Jones’ website. As of Friday afternoon, it listed more than 200 locations, including a handful outside the United States. Again, the notes for each city range from a call to observe the global Oct. 15 event in the Tri-Cities, Wash., to reports of protesters arrested in at least a dozen cities. (Portland is in that rare group.) So, where did that leave us? We called Ruiz. She said the mayor stands by his statement that there are hundreds of U.S. mayors trying to figure out how to balance speech rights with public safety as Occupy Wall Street events spread nationally. But she clarified that he was referring to the entire range of protests, from full-fledged to nascent. "Hundreds of mayors are dealing with this issue," Ruiz said. That could be. But hundreds of mayors are not dealing with indefinite "occupation" camps, at least not yet. And that was the word that triggered our fact check. The thing is, we don’t know how many mayors are dealing with Occupy Wall Street events, whether it’s more than 100, which is not hundreds, or in the 200 to 300 range, as some sites say. Throw in Adams’ specific claim about protest camps, and we rule the mayor’s statement Mostly False. As of Oct. 13, there were not camps in hundreds of cities across the United States. But there may be hundreds of mayors dealing with the issue. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-02448	"I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout. I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/27/ted-nugent/ted-nugent-cnn-i-conduct-federal-raids-dea-and-atf/	Until last week, Ted Nugent was best known as a rock musician, a bow hunter, and an ardent supporter of gun rights. But his recent description of President Barack Obama as a "subhuman mongrel" eclipsed all of that, especially at a time when he has campaigned on behalf of a Texas Republican candidate for governor. Those words are rooted in Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda and the writings of white supremacists. The uproar drew a terse apology from the singer of hits such as "Cat Scratch Fever." But in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, he insisted that he had not drawn on the rhetoric of racist literature. At least for the word "mongrel," Nugent said the word was used in his time in law enforcement. "I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout. I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers and heroes of law enforcement. "And we are re-arresting fugitive felons let out of their cages after murdering and raping and molesting children, carjacking. And we keep going after these guys. "The adrenaline is something like you will never experience, I hope you never have to experience it, but when we are done with these kinds of raids, we get together and our hearts are broken that we have to face these monsters. We call them mongrels. We call bad people who are destroying our neighborhoods mongrels." Is Nugent a cop? Does he "conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers?" We wanted to know. 'I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout' Lake County, Mich., is located about 90 miles north of Grand Rapids. It has about 11,500 residents and describes itself as "an outdoor recreation paradise." Nugent is a reservist for the county sheriff's office, Sheriff Robert Hilts told us. But, "He’s never joined us for any raids. Fortunately, we don’t have those sorts of problems up here." Hilts said Nugent has no authority or official responsibilities. The only activity involving Nugent that Hilts could recall was raising money on behalf of the department and for a local boy who has cystic fibrosis. "We’re always searching the woods for a hunter that’s lost or hurt," Hilts said. "He helped us buy a four-wheel drive offroad vehicle so we could reach people faster." 'I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers' Nugent does not seem to be a cop in the way most people would understand that word. The picture was about the same for the federal agencies Nugent named. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) told us, "We are not aware of him conducting any raids with us." We asked the Texas Department of Public Safety on what occasions Nugent had joined Texas Rangers on raids. Press secretary Tom Vinger said, "In regards to your question about the Texas Rangers, that did not occur." Joe Moses, a 22-year veteran special agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told us they have no record or recollection of Nugent participating in any of their operations. However, when there are special projects that involve many federal, state and local agencies, they wouldn’t necessarily know the name of everyone who showed up. At the same time, Moses said there are strict standards for who is involved in an actual raid. "You would not have someone who didn’t hold the status of a police officer or federal agent participate in such an operation," Moses said. The process of arresting a person or collecting evidence must withstand challenge in a courtroom. It is not a place for the inexperienced, Moses told us. The FBI said it could neither confirm nor deny Nugent’s participation in a raid. When we reached out to Nugent, an assistant did not provide evidence that Nugent participated in raids with the FBI, the DEA or the ATF. Instead, Nugent’s assistant Linda Peterson wrote, "Ted has been active in the following: U.S. Marshal Service FALCON fugitive task force arrest raids in Texas …" That’s not quite what it sounds like, either. Nugent and a film crew "went on a ride-along with a U.S. Marshals-led task force in Waco, Texas, in 2005," agency spokesman Dave Oney said. Oney believes they were shooting footage for Nugent’s television show Spirit of the Wild. With the U.S. Marshals, observers work under clear limits. "They cannot go with us into private residences," Oney said. "So, he would have had to remain in the vehicle or on the sidewalk or some other public area." That ride-along took place about nine years ago. No law enforcement agency told us that Nugent has any current role in their efforts to apprehend felons. Other evidence While Nugent’s response to our questions was brief, we did find his description of being at an FBI handgun training facility built around video simulations. The article is undated, but in it Nugent wrote he had recently taken part in Operation FALCON with the U.S. Marshals. Nugent found the training experience very realistic. "Let me tell you, when the room goes dark and the video begins to roll, you become so totally engulfed in the scenario that you are 100 percent psychologically living the event as if it is real life," he wrote. "It is no longer a video as far as your mind tells you." It is possible this may have shaped his recollections. Our ruling Nugent said he is and has been a cop in Michigan and that he conducts raids with several federal and state law enforcement agencies. He said "we are re-arresting fugitive felons" and painted a vivid picture of being with agents immediately afterward. "When we are done with these kinds of raids, we get together and our hearts are broken that we have to face these monsters," Nugent said. The single piece of this narrative that Nugent confirmed is one ride-along with U.S. Marshals in 2005. He is not a cop in Michigan by any conventional meaning of the word. No agency said that he presently plays any role in any of their raids. Nugent may have been passionate but his words take him far beyond the facts. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

obry-00028	On July 26, Foxconn Technology Group announced plans to invest $10 billion to build a new factory in Wisconsin. The unveiling of the plan was made at the White House, with Foxconn chairman Terry Gou along with President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Gov. Scott Walker, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. In light of Walker’s 2018 re-election campaign as well as a national concern over the health of American manufacturing, the news was significant. State officials later negotiated an agreement calling for the Taiwanese manufacturer to receive up to $3 billion in state tax subsidies — an incentive that some elected officials, primarily Democrats, questioned as the tax breaks were written into law. The deal for the new LCD screen manufacturing complex has since passed the Legislature and was signed by Walker, cementing Foxconn as the largest foreign recipient of state subsidies in the nation. As the deal headed toward final approval, political leaders chimed in on the impact, both positive and negative of the plant, which is to be built in Mount Pleasant in Racine County. 	mostly true	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2017/12/04/wisconsin-leaders-both-praise-and-decry-foxconn-deal-we-examine-their-claims/	None	None	None	Max Bayer	None	Wisconsin leaders both praise and decry Foxconn deal; we examine their claims	December 4, 2017	None	['United_States', 'Wisconsin', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'White_House', 'Taiwan', 'Mike_Pence', 'Foxconn', 'Racine,_Wisconsin', 'Donald_Trump', 'Paul_Ryan', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']

pomt-09646	The "post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/09/eugene-robinson/robinson-claims-fall-ussr-meant-big-drop-greenhous/	This week, world leaders are meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, to try to hammer out a global climate accord. Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson had this to say about the upcoming summit in his Dec. 1, 2009, column: "When the Copenhagen climate summit convenes next week, the European nations that have led the crusade against global warming will be able to report that the continent has met the targets for carbon-emission reductions set in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. There may be shoulder dislocations from all the self-congratulatory back-patting," Robinson wrote. "But the Kyoto targets were well on the way toward being met before they were even established. The targets are based on 1990 emissions levels -- after the Soviet Union and the East Bloc had been fouling the air for years with their antiquated, carbon-spewing heavy industries. When the communist regimes -- and their creaky economies -- collapsed in a heap, emissions from the former Soviet-dominated zone fell by nearly 40 percent. ... This post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim." Like Robinson, we expect the next 10 days to be full of complicated discussion about carbon emissions and reductions -- and a lot of boasting by the United States, Europe and other countries about all they're doing to slow climate change. So his claim about emissions reductions in former Soviet territory intrigued us. But before we dig into this statement, a little background on the meeting in Copenhagen will be useful. It's arguably the most important climate gathering since 1997, when participating countries adopted the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan. Collectively, 38 industrialized countries -- otherwise known as Annex B countries -- committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels. At the time, 15 of those countries were members of the nascent European Union. The rest included Canada, Australia, and a handful of Eastern European countries recently liberated from the former Soviet Union; the protocol refers to these nations as "economies in transition." The United States never ratified the treaty. In fact, according to data from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Web site -- an international treaty written in 1992 meant to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations -- our emissions have increased 17 percent over 1990 levels. The protocol went into force in 2005, and it expires in 2012. So, world leaders are gathering in Copenhagen with the hope of laying the groundwork for the next round of emissions reductions. However, it's unclear what will actually be accomplished at the meeting. Congress has been slow to act on a cap-and-trade bill , which was initially considered the United States' strongest bargaining chip. And negotiations haven't been helped by news of hacked e-mails between climate scientists at Climate Research Unit that skeptics say show disagreement on the seriousness of global warming. Historical data from the UNFCCC show that greenhouse gas emissions in Eastern Europe dropped dramatically after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. For example, Ukraine's annual carbon dioxide emissions dropped from 715 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1990 to 426 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1994. All the experts we spoke with agreed this drop was due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. They also told us that a specific drop of "nearly 40 percent" was also in the ballpark. We asked Robinson, and he pointed us to this post on the Green Grok, a respected blog about environmental issues maintained by the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, that includes a chart of emissions reductions derived from the most recent UNFCCC data. Indeed, in 2007, emissions from eastern European countries were still about 37 percent below 1990 levels, according to the blog. They agreed that Robinson's second point -- that the "post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim" -- has some truth to it. But they also told us that the story is more complicated than Robinson makes it seem. Emissions in Europe have fallen for several reasons, said Michael Levi, director of the program on energy security and climate change for the Council on Foreign Relations. For example, during the 1990s, the United Kingdom switched from coal energy to natural gas, which helped trim emissions. And Europe's population has remained relatively flat. But more importantly, Europe has had some pretty serious policies in place to reduce emissions, Levi said, including a carbon trading plan and incentives for alternative energy production. "Overall, [Robinson's] point is correct, but it's overstated," he said. Prasad Kasibhatla, associate professor at Nicholas School, agreed. "The essence of the claim by Eugene Robinson is indeed correct," he wrote us in an e-mail. "According to the latest year of reporting (2007), emission reductions in the EU-15 were driven largely by large reductions in Germany and the U.K. Part of the large reductions in Germany were driven by reunification with East Germany and part of the large reductions in the U.K. were driven by switch from coal to natural gas due to reforms of energy markets." Those variables paired with new climate change policies have reduced emissions in Western European countries by 4 percent, according to UNFCCC data. In an e-mail, Robinson agreed that he may have glossed over that point. "The EU countries did reduce emissions by 4 percent; I gave them credit for holding emissions down but perhaps not enough credit for the actual reduction." We also think it may have been more accurate for Robinson to clarify that the "Europeans" included the transitioning economies from the former Soviet bloc. But Robinson argued that his overall point stands. "The point I was trying to make, and I still believe it's valid, is that the Soviet bloc collapse created a huge, one-time fall-off in emissions that makes the numbers look better than they otherwise would against the Kyoto targets," he wrote. With that point, we concur. Our experts tell us that it's widely understood that the fall of the Soviet Union meant major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. But they also said that Robinson glosses over important points in his statement, including that many European Union countries have taken key steps to slow climate change. We give Robinson a Mostly True.	None	Eugene Robinson	None	None	None	2009-12-09T16:34:41	2009-12-01	['Europe', 'Post-Soviet_states']
pomt-11297	"Out of 860 bills (Sen. Bill Nelson has) introduced in Congress, only 10 have passed."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/apr/20/republican-party-florida/florida-republicans-attack-sen-bill-nelsons-legisl/	Florida Republicans unveiled a website that portrays U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., as a do-nothing career politician. "Out of 860 bills he’s introduced in Congress, only 10 have passed," said the website No More Nelson, sponsored by the Republican Party of Florida. The Republican attack coincided with Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s announcement that he would take on Nelson in November. It’s a common strategy to attack incumbents for not having many of their bills signed into law. Our review found that Nelson has not sponsored many bills that became law. But the simple pass-fail ratio omits other ways in which members of Congress can influence legislation, and there are significant problems with the GOP’s choice of words and numbers. Mangling Nelson’s legislative record It is not surprising that these figures, easily extracted from Congress.gov, found their way into a soundbite. But they are a trap. It is difficult to extract quantitative takeaways from the qualitative work of legislating. Nelson’s Congress.gov profile includes links to about 860 measures that Nelson sponsored. Narrowed to those that became law, there are 10 results. But the Republicans’ comparison is flawed. While they referred to the 860 count as "bills," less than half were bills. The remainder were amendments or resolutions, including a designation of National Tourism Week (which passed) and a more meaty action to help Medicare users pay for prescription drugs (which never reached a vote). Narrowing the data to only sponsored bills shows about 360 results. The larger GOP tally also includes dozens of duplicates for when Nelson introduced the same or similar bill more than once. For example, Nelson introduced the Truth in Caller ID Act three times in 2006, 2007 and 2009 before it became law in 2010. The Republicans should have been more precise in the second half of the claim, too: The party said only 10 bills from Nelson "have passed." Those were actually the 10 measures that made it into law. There’s a broader category of legislation that "passed" one chamber even if it didn’t become law. By that count, Nelson had 77 measures that passed the Senate and seven that passed the House. The broader view includes minor measures such as naming a courthouse, recognizing the Negro Baseball League and commending the Marlins for winning the World Series. When a bill passes one chamber, it is largely out of the member's control whether that bill passes the second chamber. Most major bills are worked out between committee chairs and members in leadership. The problems with the 10/860 ratio don’t end there. The Republicans stuffed the pot to include 860 Nelson’s bills, resolutions and hundreds of amendments. But their tally does not address the outcome of Nelson’s hundreds of amendments at all, focusing only on the 10 enacted bills or resolutions. Nelson’s Congress.gov profile shows that dozens of amendments were approved in the Senate by unanimous consent or voice vote — a sign that they weren’t controversial — and a handful were approved in roll call votes. But the 10/860 comparison doesn’t capture that success. Bottom line: If the Republicans wanted to make an apples-and-apples case, then they should have only looked at bills sponsored. "The Republican claim appears to be a jumbled mess," said Steven Smith, a Washington University in St. Louis political scientist. "Legislative provisions that are counted for the 860 tally also should be counted among the provisions approved by the Senate or both houses of Congress. They are not, and so (it) understates the success of the senator’s efforts." The Republicans have been more careful about describing bills "passed" versus "enacted into law" in other places. On Twitter, for instance, the Republicans said Nelson’s "batting average = .012 bills signed into law." We can see their math (10/860). But congressional experts said aside from being misleading, it’s also meaningless. "Members introduce bills for many reasons — to lay out markers, to set the stage for something that has to incubate for a long time, to make a statement," said Norman Ornstein, an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute. "Conflating bills, amendments and resolutions is not fair. And getting something through one house is a big step — especially if the other party controls the other house. I wonder what the same standard would show for Marco Rubio or the other Republicans in the Senate." We did, too. Following the same formula as the GOP, we looked at Rubio’s 476 pieces of sponsored measures and found three bills that became law. Remember, using the Republicans’ methodology, we should count Rubio’s hundreds of amendments in that 476-measure total but exclude the outcome of the amendments. Rubio’s "batting average" would be .006 for sponsored legislation signed into law. Pointing this out isn’t to pick on Rubio, but to show that the attack is a lousy way to evaluate any lawmaker’s record. Counting enacted bills doesn’t tell the full story The numbers also don’t show the many other ways to evaluate the effectiveness of a member. Members can lobby colleagues to include language in other bills, hold hearings, negotiate agreements or provide constituent service (for example, help with getting Social Security benefits). A member may enact a single bill, but it could be an incredibly important law. Or a member might enact a lot of bills that are minor, such as renaming post offices. "Measuring the number of laws per member, or the ratio of laws to bills, is a terrible way to assess his/her success as a member of Congress," said University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger. Nelson’s office pointed to several examples in which he played a role in legislation even if he didn’t sponsor a bill that passed. Nelson worked with former Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., to enact legislation to ban oil drilling off much of Florida’s Gulf Coast through 2022. Nelson was the cosponsor of a bill by Martinez, but a few months later it evolved into a separate bill that included a buffer off Florida’s coasts until 2022 — without Nelson’s name. Nelson’s office also showed PolitiFact about a dozen examples of bills Nelson sponsored in the Senate but a similar version, often in the House, was signed into law. For example, Nelson sponsored a bill to extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for one year. The House version to extend the act for 10 years became law in 2013. Smith said that the Republicans failed to acknowledge the reality of being a legislator in the minority. "It is difficult for a minority party member to get credit for legislative activity when the majority party wants to deny him a high success rate," he said. "I find the Republican claim to be virtually meaningless." Nelson enjoyed majority Democratic control in the House from 1979-91. He has been in the U.S. Senate since 2001, including stretches when Democrats were in the minority and majority. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said out of 860 bills Nelson has introduced in Congress "only 10 have passed." The Republicans have boiled down Nelson’s legislative record into a sound bite that has several holes. Those 860 measures are not all bills, but also amendments and resolutions. While the Republicans said Nelson only had 10 bills that "passed," that number refers to bills and resolutions enacted into law. Nelson "passed" more bills than that during his time in both chambers. What’s more, the GOP’s math did not factor in the outcome of Nelson’s successful amendments. The Republicans omit ways in which Nelson — or any other member — can exert influence on legislation, or when a similar idea is that he didn’t sponsor is signed by the president. We see how any politician’s legislative scorecard invites a mathematical analysis. But this takeaway of Nelson’s time is woefully flawed. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03763	Says rabid animals from other states carry "different strains of rabies" that Florida "vaccines and serums don’t affect."	false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/04/marion-hammer/nra-lobbyist-marion-hammer-says-rabies-vaccine-doe/	Marion Hammer, 35-year lobbyist of the National Rifle Association, is a powerful force for gun rights in Florida. So it surprised us to see her speak up at a Florida Senate committee discussion about, of all topics, animal shelters. The measure at hand would require animal shelters and animal control agencies that accept public money to keep records for the cats and dogs they take in and what happens to them. Many facilities don’t keep this kind of data and do not make the information public upon request, making it hard to grasp the scope of rescue efforts, according to a committee analysis of SB 674. Hammer is executive director of the United Sportsmen of Florida, an advocacy group she founded that values hunting. Essential to hunting are hunting dogs, which are vulnerable to bites from rabid animals. Animal "dumping" by no-kill animal shelters endangers hunting dogs, sheepdogs, cattle dogs, trial dogs and so on, she said. She thinks the bill requiring shelters to keep records of their animal intake will lead to accountability and less risk for domestic pets. "Most people don't know, for example, that animals that come from other states, like Texas, carry different strains of rabies," she told the Senate Community Affairs Committee on April 2. "And those strains of rabies are entirely different from Florida's, and our vaccines and serums don’t affect those other strains of rabies." Anyone who has watched Old Yeller knows the tragic fate awaiting an unvaccinated family pet infected by a rabid animal. We wondered, though, if Hammer was right about rabies vaccines not being effective against rabid animals from other states. Rabid rundown The viral disease is passed on through saliva, affecting the brain and eventually leading to death. Cases of human rabies are rare in the United States, though humans are most likely to contract the disease from wild mammals, such as bats, skunks, raccoons and foxes, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Rabies is preventable by a vaccine made from killed virus. The vaccine is given in a series of three to five shots in the shoulder. For those wondering, the vaccine cannot cause rabies. (Read more about how the vaccine is made here.) There are different strains of rabies based on the animal that tends to contract it, and these variants can cross species, said Dr. Kimberly May, a veterinarian and American Veterinary Medicine Association spokeswoman. The canine rabies strain, for example, is no longer in the United States, but dogs and other mammals can still be infected by strains from other animals. Moving animals from state to state can increase the risk of bringing in variants of the rabies strain, said Dr. Julie Levy, director of the Maddie’s Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Florida’s College of Veterinary Medicine. She pointed to two Florida examples, including in 1994, when rabid coyotes were brought from Texas for foxpen hunting in Florida. It led to an outbreak among unvaccinated hunting dogs, resulting in the vaccinations of 29 people and euthanization of dozens of dogs and wildlife, she said. About the vaccine? Hammer "couldn’t be more wrong about rabies," May stressed. The protections offered by rabies vaccines do not vary by region. "A dog vaccinated against rabies in Florida is also considered vaccinated against rabies in Illinois," she said by email. "Or Texas. Or any other state." Levy agreed, saying the vaccines are highly protective. "That is why dogs and cats that are well-vaccinated against rabies are protected against the strains that are carried by wildlife," Levy said. "The bigger risk would be introducing new strains into our wildlife reservoirs, because wildlife is not vaccinated." We posed the question to Dr. Charles Rupprecht, research director for the Global Alliance for Rabies Control. Same answer: "All licensed human and animal vaccines will protect against all rabies virus variants in the New World." After reading our inquiry, Hammer called her veterinarian. She had checked with him before the meeting to confirm what an Alachua hunting dog breeder told her about varying strains of rabies from Texas. But she forgot to ask about the vaccine part. "Now they’ve got it worked out so it that vaccine works for just about everyone," she said after talking again with her vet. "I just didn’t take it far enough." Our ruling Hammer claimed rabies strains carried by animals in other states "are entirely different from Florida's, and our vaccines and serums don’t affect those other strains of rabies." Her claim about vaccines was rebutted by veterinarians and disease experts. Even more, she admitted not fleshing out her talking points before the committee meeting. We rate her claim False.

pomt-13885	"During the (Benghazi) attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/30/sean-hannity/hannity-misleads-claim-about-benghazi-stand-down-o/	Was the United States’ military response to the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, hampered because the State Department couldn't decide what the troops should wear? That's one of the suggestions that Fox News host Sean Hannity offered in summarizing the Republican-written report on the crisis, released June 28 by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. "During the attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times, and we needed, you know, permission from the Libyans to actually save Americans, and that's what they were discussing" in Washington, Hannity said on his program that evening. For this fact-check, we'll look at the alleged stand-down order and whether troops were told to change their clothes four times while the attack was under way. The short answers, based on the committee's report: The stand-down order was actually an order to wait while CIA officials tried to make sure its security team didn't get into a firefight with friendly militia. The order for troops to change clothes was unrelated and came hours after everyone had already been evacuated from Benghazi, not "during the attack." We'll go through this chronologically. All times are Libyan. Washington was six hours behind. The ‘stand-down’ order The attack on the mission compound began at 9:42 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2012, when seven American staff members were inside, along with five diplomatic security agents. In addition, the United States was using local militia to help provide protection, so there were three armed members of the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, who lived on the compound and helped provide security, and five unarmed members of the Blue Mountain Guard Force. According to the Benghazi committee report, a frantic call for help immediately went out to the CIA annex about a mile away. The annex security team, known as the GRS, started getting their gear together as annex officials made fruitless calls trying to contact the local groups, including the February 17 militia, they had been working with. Their goal: find out who was involved in the fight and whether they could get additional equipment. With the sounds of gunfire in the distance and occasional tracer bullets flying overhead, the security team was eager to get going. Yet the officer in charge — the chief of base — was telling them to wait because the calls to the militias were not being answered. He and his deputy, who are unnamed, said they didn't want the team mistakenly getting into a firefight with friendly militia forces. Although sending the security squad and all the heavy weaponry from the annex to the mission would leave the annex defenseless, according to the report, the top officials at the annex gave them the green light, according to the testimony. At 10:05 p.m., 23 minutes after the frantic call from the mission, the annex team was rolling. Kris Paronto, a former Army ranger, is one of the men who rushed to the compound from the CIA annex to help bring people back. "Thirty minutes we were told to wait," he told Hannity June 28. "Twice the word 'wait' was used. Once the words 'stand down' was used. But to me that's semantics." Not exactly. The dictionary definition of a stand-down order means your force is no longer on alert or operational. The chief of the annex was adamant that he never told the security team to actually stand down — only to wait. While members of the security team reported hearing the phrase "stand down," the narrative in the GOP report offers no evidence that, contrary to Hannity's claim, the team was told it wasn't going to be sent to help. Assistance from Tripoli It was around the time the annex security team was departing that U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and communications specialist Sean Smith apparently died from smoke inhalation from a diesel fire set by the attackers. They had been taking refuge in a safe room in the compound. Just after 11 p.m., President Barack Obama gave clear directions to do everything possible to save Americans, according to the report. At 11:23 p.m., with Stevens missing, State Department personnel were evacuated to the CIA annex. At 12:30 a.m., a six-man security team was dispatched to Benghazi from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. They had no official transportation and had to use a private plane. By 1 a.m. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had unequivocally ordered troops to deploy. At the time, another mob was gathering at the CIA annex where people had been evacuated. At 1:30 a.m., the six-member Tripoli team arrived at the Benghazi airport, but it took hours to arrange transportation to the annex. There was a delay because they wanted to get to Stevens, who was reportedly in a hospital. When they learned that he had been pronounced dead, they had to figure out which militia group at the airport could safely get them to the CIA annex. They arrived just in time to help repel an attack at 5:15 a.m., where mortar fire hitting the roof killed personal security specialists Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both former Navy SEALs. Coincidentally, it was Libyan forces who were former loyalists of Muammar Gaddafi, whose regime was toppled a year earlier, who got the Americans out of the compound to the Benghazi airport in 50 heavily-armed security vehicles, the report says. A CIA operative stumbled onto the group while trying to get help. The first flight of survivors to Tripoli left at 7:31 a.m., flown by the private aircraft used by the Tripoli embassy team. The second plane, provided by the Libyan Air Force, left for Tripoli at 9:54 a.m. The attacks were over. The clothing controversy hadn't begun to unfold. Three-hour delay over clothing? Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams (FAST) based in Rota, Spain, had been ordered to Benghazi and Tripoli. Those Marines turned out to be anything but fast. They had no way to get to Libya. The call for a C-130 transport came in the middle of the night to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. But none of the personnel were on alert, so it took hours to assemble that team. At the time the last of the evacuees had left Benghazi, the Marines were still waiting for transport. Two planes touched down around noon. They were loaded by 1 p.m. And then, according to the GOP report, they sat there. Neither the Republican report nor the minority report released by Democratic members on June 27 offers a solid explanation for the three-hour delay. The GOP report quotes the platoon commander, who is not named, as testifying that the Marines were told multiple times to change from camouflage to civilian attire and back again. In all, there were four changes. There was indecision because some officials didn't want it to appear that the arrival of the Marines constituted a United States invasion of Libya, which might have sparked violence, officials said. "State was very, very concerned about what the footprint would look like in Tripoli. They didn’t want it to look like we were invading," according to testimony by Navy Vice Adm. Kurt Tidd, who was then director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But why that took three hours to resolve is a mystery. A transcript of the platoon commander's interview shows that he was getting his information from his company commander in the next plane. The committee did not interview the company commander. It's also not clear why the troops, who were carrying both sets of clothing, didn't just take off and change into the appropriate attire just before landing. We posed that question to the White House and Department of Defense, and didn't hear back. Finally, just to add to the confusion, the newest account differs in its details from a House Armed Services Committee report, again authored by Republicans, from February 2014. It said that General Martin Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee that once the FAST team got under way, it landed at a "forward-basing location" so the Marines could change into civilian clothes." The latest report makes no mention of a stop. The FAST team arrived in Tripoli at 8:56 p.m., 23 hours after the attack. Our ruling Hannity said, "During the (Benghazi) attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times." Hannity is mashing up two different incidents. There was no order to give up on the rescue effort altogether; rather, security personnel held their position about a mile away for 23 minutes as they gathered equipment and attempted to make contact with personnel on the ground. Separately, several hours later and in Spain, Marines did get in and out of uniform over a period of three hours as officials debated how they should respond. The delay occurred after the surviving Americans and those who had been killed already had been evacuated to Tripoli. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e1f49fc-15c1-4e74-8c4e-2b4471ba85c7	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2016-06-30T16:53:32	2016-06-28	['None']

pomt-02541	Says Bill O’Reilly spoke 40 percent of the words in an interview with President Barack Obama.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/06/dana-milbank/milbank-oreilly-said-40-words-obama-interview/	At least among Fox News viewers, nothing boosts audience like taking President Barack Obama to task. The day after Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had an interview with Obama, O’Reilly picked up an additional 1 million viewers for his show The O’Reilly Factor. The president sat down with O’Reilly right before the Super Bowl, and the tone of the conversation itself stirred up a flurry of reactions. Here’s a small example from a moment when O’Reilly pressed Obama on the administration’s response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. O’Reilly: If (Ambassador to the United Nations) Susan Rice goes out and tells the world that it was a spontaneous demonstration... Obama: Bill... O’Reilly: -- off a videotape but your... Obama: Bill... O’Reilly: -- your commanders and the secretary of Defense know it's a terror attack... Obama: Now, Bill... O’Reilly: Just... Obama: -- Bill... O’Reilly: -- as an American... Obama: -- Bill -- Bill... O’Reilly: -- I'm just confused. Obama: And I'm -- and I'm trying to explain it to (you), if you want to listen. No wonder that many observers described the interview as testy. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank called it "the roughest and nastiest exchange" of the three times that O’Reilly has interviewed Obama. "He interrupted the president 42 times in 10 minutes," Milbank said on MSNBC’s Politics Nation. Of all the words uttered in this 10-minute interview, 40 percent were uttered by O’Reilly." We wanted to check Milbank’s numbers. Not on the interruptions, but on the word count. We pulled out our digital centrifuge and separated the O’Reilly and Obama utterances. According to our research, O’Reilly delivered 787 words to Obama’s 1,484. This gave O’Reilly 35 percent of the conversation. That’s a little lower than Milbank said but more or less in the same ballpark. We reached out to Milbank and did not hear back. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare this with another one-on-one interview between the president and a journalist. A couple of days before Obama sat down with O’Reilly, he did the same with CNN’s Jake Tapper. We subjected that transcript to the same rigorous methods and found that Tapper spoke 23 percent of the time, leaving the president the other 77 percent. The precise word counts were Tapper -- 849 and Obama -- 2,886. Milbank’s point was that O’Reilly’s interview was almost as much about O’Reilly as it was about the president. We don’t know about that, but we can say that O’Reilly spoke about 50 percent more than Tapper did in his interview. The topics in the two interviews differed greatly. O’Reilly brought up Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Tapper focused on issues like immigration reform, legalization of marijuana, spying by the National Security Agency, and security at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. O’Reilly had a second installment of his time with Obama that aired the night after the Super Bowl. Milbank’s comment came on the same night, so we’re counting only the segment that had aired publicly at that point. For the record, in the second installment, O’Reilly asked the president about African-American children raised in single-parent households, school vouchers, the Keystone pipeline, a contraceptive coverage exemption for Little Sisters of the Poor, and veterans benefits. Our ruling Milbank said O’Reilly said 40 percent of the words during his interview with the president. That was a little high. By our count, 35 percent would be more accurate. O’Reilly spoke decidedly more than Tapper did in his time with Obama. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05040	The health care law "imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/jul/11/american-commitment/health-care-law-largest-tax-increase-history-middl/	A new ad attacks Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., on the health care law and claims to have "the facts." But then it trots out a series of well-worn distortions. "Florida patients and seniors deserve to know what are the facts about President Barack Obama’s health care law," the ad says. "Fact: Bill Nelson was the deciding vote. The bill could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised. Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage. Tell Bill Nelson: Protect Florida patients, repeal the health care law." The ad is from an outside spending group called American Commitment, which said on its website that it supports "free markets, economic growth, constitutionally limited government, property rights, and individual freedom." It’s a 501(c)4, so it doesn’t have to disclose its donors. (For more details about American Commitment’s connections and spending, check out this report from the Washington Post.) We fact-checked the claim that Nelson was the deciding vote in another fact-check, rating it Mostly False. We've also looked at claims about cutting $500 billion from Medicare (Mostly False) and millions losing coverage (False). Here, we’re fact-checking whether the health care law "imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class." We asked American Commitment for evidence for its charges, but we didn’t hear back. We found the same claim, though, on several conservative blogs. Their basis for making the claim focused on the tax penalty that’s part of the health care law, the penalty imposed on people who go without health insurance. The individual mandate as tax penalty Here’s how it works: Starting in 2014, individuals who do not have health insurance and who aren't exempt (say, for cases of hardship or religious belief) will have to pay an annual penalty of at least $95. The amount increases, though, up to $695 in 2016. After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- up to 2.5 percent of household income. Critics of the law have pointed out, correctly, that some people who make less than $250,000 will be subject to this tax penalty. During the 2008 campaign, Obama pledged not to raise taxes on families who make less than that. The blogs said that 75 percent of the people who pay the penalty are in the middle class, so that makes it the biggest middle-class tax increase in history. This is a logical fallacy -- just because 75 percent of the households who pay the tax are in the middle class, that doesn’t automatically make it the largest middle-class tax increase in history. But let’s set that problem aside for moment so we can explore who’s paying the mandate. Then we’ll get to other problems with the ad’s claim. Who pays the individual mandate’s tax penalty The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation -- two nonpartisan federal offices -- have estimated that about 4 million uninsured Americans will have to pay the penalty, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019. The CBO projections show that 76 percent of the people paying the penalty will have a household income of 500 percent of the federal poverty level or below. For a family of four, that comes to about $120,000. We should note that there is no standard definition of "the middle class." We looked at projections from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center for what the federal income distribution will look like in 2016. A chart from the center estimates that the threshold for the top 20 percent of income in 2016 will be $123,970. So statements like these essentially define "middle class" as the bottom 80 percent of the income scale. But there’s a different way to look at who pays the penalty, and that’s as a tally of dollars paid, rather than the number of households. The CBO projected that the bottom 80 percent will pay 46 percent of the tax dollars collected as a result of the mandate. That’s compared to 55 percent of revenues that will come from the top 20 percent. This presents a different picture of how the financial burden of the mandate will be borne. There’s a big difference between the "middle class" carrying 75 percent of the burden rather than 46 percent of the burden. Two tax experts -- Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center and William McBride of the Tax Foundation -- agreed with our analysis when we looked at a similar claim. They also indicated that, it’s more appropriate to use dollars paid than the number of households that have to pay the penalty. Other taxes dwarf the mandate Now we come to another problem with the ad’s claim -- whether the tax increases in the law are the largest in history. It’s true that some middle-class people will pay the tax penalty for not having insurance. But as we noted earlier, that penalty is intended to encourage people to get insurance. It’s not intended to raise enough money to pay for the bulk of new spending in the health care law. Other tax increases do that. Most of those tax increases are on the wealthy and the health-care industry -- not the middle class. Starting in 2013, high earners -- defined as households making make more than $250,000 or single people making more than $200,000 -- will see their Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Also, people at these income levels pay a new tax on investment income of 3.8 percent. The 10-year tally: $210.2 billion. That easily outpaces $4 billion per year that comes from the individual mandate. For other new taxes in the law, it’s less clear how the burden will fall. These taxes include annual fees on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion over 10 years); a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers ($27 billion over 10 years); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion over 10 years); a higher floor for medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns ($15.2 billion over 10 years); and an excise tax on indoor tanning services ($2.7 billion over 10 years). Also, there’s a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called "Cadillac plans," which begins in 2018, raising $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. Largest tax increase? Finally, the health care law is not the largest tax increase in history. We looked into this topic in detail when we fact-checked Rush Limbaugh’s statement that the health care law is "the largest tax increase in the history of the world." That detailed analysis can be found here, but the bottom line is this: Depending on your rounding, tax increases resulting from the health care law are about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. The health care law’s tax increases are smaller than tax increases signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961. It’s true that the tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993. But they are not the largest in the history of the United States. Our ruling The ad calls the health care law "the largest tax increase in history on the middle class." Actually, the law is not the largest tax increase in history, and most of its taxes fall on the wealthy and the health care industry.

pomt-06588	"This is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/26/herman-cain/cain-jobs-recovery-worst-great-depression/	Voters want jobs, and Georgia’s own GOP presidential contender Herman Cain wants them to know he has a plan to create them. Cain pitched the plan, which calls for 9 percent corporate, personal and national sales taxes, during the Sept. 7 presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. It was his central focus during the Tampa, Fla., debate five days later. And in case anyone didn’t get the point, Cain presented his plan in a Sept. 15 Wall Street Journal op-ed as a foil against President Barack Obama’s recently proposed jobs bill. Cain portrayed himself as a capable business leader, and Obama as an ideologue with little concern for the American worker. Cain’s evidence was the economy’s performance during Obama’s tenure. "This is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression," Cain’s op-ed said. The worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression? Yes, things are bad. But are they that bad? We contacted Cain’s spokeswoman for more information, and she recommended we go to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the main federal agency in charge of measuring jobs activity and other economic trends. We did, and found that PolitiFact National’s Truth-O-Meter had been there ahead of us. In June, our sister site wrote about a jobs claim made by Cain’s Republican primary rival Mitt Romney. "This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover," Romney said on the campaign trail in Tampa, Fla. PolitiFact National assessed Romney’s history two ways: by the number of jobs created, or changes in the unemployment rate. The jobs creation measure is a straightforward number. But unemployment is a little more complicated. The rate is influenced by whether people are looking for a job -- or so discouraged they’ve dropped out of the labor market. A recovery can coax job market dropouts to get back into the hunt. This means it’s not unusual for the unemployment rate to rise as a recovery begins. Since the Great Recession ended about 23 months before Romney made his statement, PolitiFact National assessed each recession based on the 23-month period after it officially ended. PolitiFact National used dates from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is the nation’s unofficial authority on when recessions begin and end. They stopped at World War II, because monthly BLS data doesn’t go further back than that. Our sister site found Romney’s claim False because, depending on which measure you use, there were either two or four recoveries that were weaker than the current one. A lot can change in a few months, so we updated those calculations with the newest jobs data. Our results were very similar. Let’s consider job creation. Since the end of the recession in June 2009, the U.S. gained 639,000 jobs. But in two of the 12 recoveries we reviewed, the U.S. actually lost jobs. From November 2001 to January 2004 under President George W. Bush, the economy lost 481,000 jobs. And from July 1980 to September 1982 under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, the U.S. lost 661,000 jobs, according to BLS figures. Now for the unemployment rate. Unemployment has decreased by a modest 0.4 percentage points since the end of the most recent recession. But we found three recoveries where unemployment actually rose in the same amount of time. From November 2001 to January 2004, unemployment crept up by 0.2 percentage points. Between March 1991 and May 1993, under President George H.W. Bush, it rose by 0.3 percentage points. And between July 1980 and September 1982, it jumped by 2.5 percentage points. This means that as of August, there are either two or three recoveries since the Great Depression that were weaker than the current one, depending on which measure you use. This is very similar to June’s results. As we mentioned in our item on Romney, none of this is to suggest we’re in a strong recovery. The data do show that this one is weaker than most. In this regard, Cain does have a point. But it’s inaccurate for Cain to say, "This is the worst jobs recovery since the Great Depression." It’s a weak recovery, but not the worst. We therefore rate Cain’s claim False.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-09-26T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['None']
pomt-10946	"In Wisconsin, abortion is still a crime."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/25/kelda-helen-roys/governor-hopeful-kelda-roys-claim-abortion-crime-w/	If someone gets caught robbing a store in Wisconsin, that person could go to jail. After all, robbery is a crime in Wisconsin. What about abortion? With the first television ad in her campaign for governor, released July 19, 2018, Democrat Kelda Roys contends that "abortion is still a crime in Wisconsin." Since the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade recognized a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion in 1973, abortion has been legal in the United States. That includes Wisconsin, where more than 5,000 of the procedures are performed every year. So, it’s highly misleading to call abortion a crime in Wisconsin. And yet, Roys has a point. The ad Roys, an attorney and former executive director of the abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin, narrates her 30-second ad. The ad opens with video clips of President Donald Trump announcing his nomination of federal appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court and then Trump signing a document. While those are shown, Roys says: "Just when you think it can’t get any worse, it does." Then Roys is shown writing on a pad of paper and she says: "In Wisconsin, abortion is still a crime." More images of Roys appear as she says: "And I can’t believe that I’m having to fight the same fights that my grandmother fought." The ad could leave the impression that a woman getting an abortion is committing a crime. Federal law vs. state law When we posed Roys’ claim to former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Janine Geske, a professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, she confirmed, in light of Roe vs. Wade, what seems obvious: "It’s not a crime in Wisconsin. Abortion is legal." When Roy was asked to back up her claim, she cited Wisconsin law — which has made performing an abortion a crime since 1849. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The nonpartisan state Legislative Reference Bureau has noted Roe vs. Wade "rendered unenforceable the criminal penalities" in the state law. But it is still on the books. Current state law on "crimes against life and bodily security" includes a section on abortion. It states: "Any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child is guilty" of a felony. Some exceptions are provided to save the life of a mother. "If it's in the criminal code, it's a crime," Roys told us. So, does it matter that Wisconsin’s statute criminalizing abortion is still in place? The crux of Roys’ claim As the opening of her TV ad suggests, what Roys is getting at is what may happen if Roe vs. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. That’s a prospect that many fear with Kavanaugh’s nomination — even if, as PolitiFact Florida found, his position on Roe is not clear. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. If Roe were overturned, regulating abortion would revert to the states. Experts with the pro-abortion rights Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin and with the anti-abortion Wisconsin Right to Life agreed that the Wisconsin law still being on the books is important. Indeed, abortion-rights advocates have fought, as recently as 2017, to get the statute removed, while abortion foes have succeeded in keeping it in place. If Roe were ever overturned, the Wisconsin statute would again be in effect — although there are questions about whether it would be used immediately. There likely would be litigation over that, said University of Wisconsin Law School professor of law and bioethics Alta Charo. Wisconsin is one of seven states that would revert to pre-Roe state law if Roe were overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports women’s access to abortion. Our rating Roys says: "In Wisconsin, abortion is still a crime." Abortion has been legal throughout the country, including in Wisconsin, since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Roe vs. Wade case in 1973. It is the law of the land, so to flatly declare that abortion is a crime in Wisconsin is misleading. But current Wisconsin statutes still include a provision — made unenforceable by Roe — that generally makes performing an abortion a felony. And that’s important, should Roe ever be overturned. In sum, Roys’ claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-07444	"For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/21/jean-schmidt/rep-jean-schmidt-says-32-every-33-pregnant-women-w/	Soon after taking control of the House of Representatives, Republicans opened a new front in the abortion war by attempting to block Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal money. Federal law already prohibits tax dollars from paying for abortions, but Republicans argue that the $363 million that Planned Parenthood gets each year for Title X family planning services actually subsidizes abortions indirectly because money is fungible. The April 14 measure that would have stripped federal funds from Planned Parenthood passed the House by a 241-185 margin but failed in a 42-58 U.S. Senate vote. During debate over the bill, Democrats portrayed Planned Parenthood clinics as a major provider of many types of health services to low income women, while Republicans claimed that Planned Parenthood steers pregnant women into getting abortions. "For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion," Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Cincinnati-area Republican, said in a speech in the House of Representatives. That ratio got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. So we asked her office where the numbers came from. Schmidt was president of Right-to-Life of Greater Cincinnati before she was elected to Congress and currently chairs the House Pro-Life Women’s Caucus. She referred us to reports produced by several anti-abortion organizations, including Americans United for Life, Concerned Women for America, Liberty Counsel Action, Family Research Council Action, and the Chiaroscuro Foundation. All stated that roughly 98 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services to pregnant women consist of abortion. They derived their information from a March 2011 fact sheet from Planned Parenthood. That fact sheet says the group performed 332,278 abortions in 2009, referred 977 patients to other agencies for adoptions, and provided prenatal care to 7,021 patients. The anti-abortion groups came up with the 98 percent figure by comparing the number of abortions to the number of procedures in the other two categories. Schmidt’s 32 out of 33 statistic works out to 97 percent - the approximate percentage her sources provided. But there are problems with that calculation. First, it assumes that pregnant women only go to Planned Parenthood for one of those three options. Planned Parenthood representatives say that interpretation overstates the ratio of abortions among its pregnant clients. It ignores other statistics, such as the 1,158,924 pregnancy tests the group provided, and the fact that those 332,278 abortions were just 3 percent of the 11,383,900 total procedures that Planned Parenthood health centers provided that year to its 3 million patients. Thirty five percent of its services consisted of providing contraception and another 35 percent consisted of testing for sexually transmitted diseases and treatment. The fact sheet stats also don’t reflect the fact that only a tiny proportion of Planned Parenthood centers around the country provide prenatal care - just 63 out of more than 800, said Tait Sye, a spokesman for the organization. Those that don’t offer prenatal care refer pregnant women to other health care providers for those services, and Planned Parenthood doesn’t keep track of those referrals. And the 7,021 figure for prenatal clients that was used in the calculations doesn’t include pregnant women who went to Planned Parenthood for prenatal care and were sent to outside obstetricians. The group doesn’t "ask the pregnancy status of every woman that walks into Planned Parenthood," and plenty of pregnant women use the organization for other services, like breast exams, Sye said. Consequently, he says it’s "impossible to calculate an accurate percentage if you don’t know the total number of pregnant women it is based on." In an emailed statement, Planned Parenthood Vice President for Communications Stuart Schear called Schmidt’s assertion "a meaningless and unverifiable statistic since Planned Parenthood does not collect information on the pregnancy status of every female patient who comes into our health centers." When Schmidt was asked about the points made by Planned Parenthood’s spokesmen, she said the group "obfuscates the truth by comparing apples to oranges – or services to patients." "They say 90 percent of the services they provide are preventative, but more than 10 percent of their patients are provided an abortion," Schmidt said in an email. "They say they don't know the number of pregnant women they serve. It shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Whether a patient is pregnant or not should be one of the first questions they ask." Schmidt is correct that women of childbearing age are routinely asked whether they might be pregnant when they visit a doctor’s office. Sye acknowledged that Planned Parenthood’s intake form contains a question that asks whether female patients are pregnant. "But, we don’t tally the number of women we see every year who are pregnant or not pregnant," he said. PolitiFact recently fact checked a statement Sen. John Kyl made about Planned Parenthood. In that item we noted a few caveats that are worth repeating. First, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of "services" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. So Schmidt does have a point about citing services, rather than patient numbers. Second, it’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith. What certainly is true is that without knowing the total number of pregnant women that Planned Parenthood sees, it is impossible to compute an accurate ratio for how many of them get abortions. PolitiFact places the burden of proof on the speaker. In this case, Schmidt cannot meet that burden because information needed for that showing is unknown. Anti-abortion groups and Schmidt can try to fill the information vacuum by using Planned Parenthood’s incomplete data to come up with their own number. But that doesn’t mean that their number is correct. The fact sheet shows that Planned Parenthood does a sizable number of abortions. But the ratio she cites (97 percent) is extreme. Sye noted that just 63 out of more than 800 Planned Parenthood centers provide their own prenatal care. That means that pregnant women seeking prenatal care from more than 700 centers would be referred to outside providers. Women seeking prenatal care are not likely to be seeking an abortion, and none of those women are included in the totals cited by Schmidt’s sources. Schmidt’s claim also overlooks that pregnant women who "walk into" a clinic could be there for any reason, not just for pregnancy-related services. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Schmidt’s statement False. Comment on this item.	None	Jean Schmidt	None	None	None	2011-04-21T06:00:00	2011-04-14	['None']
pomt-02423	"American Hustle shows the FBI making real-life bribes to Washington politicians. I know, because as your U.S. senator, I turned them down."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/04/larry-pressler/larry-pressler-recalls-role-rejecting-abscam-bribe/	American Hustle -- a movie based on the story of Abscam, the late-1970s FBI sting that ensnared more than a half-dozen politicians for accepting bribes -- got shut out at the Oscars despite snagging 10 nominations. But the movie is living on as an issue in a 2014 U.S. Senate race. Larry Pressler, a former U.S. senator from South Dakota now running as an Independent for another term in the chamber, is airing a campaign ad touting his role in the Abscam scandal. The twist is that Pressler is touting his honesty in the face of illegal offerings. "American Hustle shows the FBI making real-life bribes to Washington politicians," Pressler says to the camera in the ad. "I know, because as your U.S. senator, I turned them down." Pressler left office in 1997; since then, he's worked as an attorney and taught at universities. In his current race, he's widely considered an underdog to the Republican frontrunner, former Gov. Mike Rounds. Given all the attention American Hustle has been attracting since its release, we couldn’t resist taking a second look at the decades-old scandal. First, let’s recap what happened in Abscam. The case involved representatives of "Arab sheiks" -- actually, undercover FBI agents -- offering politicians payoffs that were intended to secure them casino licenses in New Jersey. The operation resulted in the convictions of Sen. Harrison Williams, D-N.J., six members of the U.S. House, and a number of local officials. The movie tells the somewhat fictionalized story of how the operation was undertaken on behalf of the FBI by a con man whose name in real life was Mel Weinberg. (Here’s an article about the real-life events that inspired the movie.) So how does Pressler fit in? It turns out that his role was largely happenstance. Pressler, then a first-term Republican who had weighed a run for president in 1980, was "presented to the agents as a sudden substitute for the legislator they expected, who had decided against attending such a meeting," according to John Good, the FBI supervisor who oversaw the Abscam operation, in a July 23, 1982, New York Times article. Here’s how Pressler recalled what happened, in a first-person article published last year in the Huffington Post. In the fall of 1979, shortly after I concluded my dark-horse candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, a prominent Washington, D.C. socialite, who was serving as one of my volunteer fundraisers, informed me that some wealthy people were eager to meet me and talk about contributing to my campaign deficit. As a relatively unknown first-term senator from South Dakota, I had few deep-pocketed supporters, and so I jumped at the chance to follow up on my fundraiser's promising lead. However, since it was illegal for a member of Congress to discuss fundraising on federal property, I agreed to meet the prospective donors in a home they were renting a short distance from the Capitol. On the appointed day, we arrived at a two-story redbrick colonial home on fashionable W Street. Inside, the house was furnished with exquisite antiques, elegant chandeliers and, as I would later learn, a battery of hidden television cameras and microphones. … One of the FBI imposters I met that day was a swarthy man who appeared to be from the Middle East. He told me that he represented a prominent sheik who was seeking entry to the United States for himself and a number of his associates and who needed special bills passed by Congress to allow them to avoid the usual immigration procedures. He then offered to make an under-the-table payment if I would play ball. "Wait a minute!" I said. "What you are suggesting may be illegal. I would never do anything in exchange for a campaign contribution." And with that, I stormed out of the house. Ultimately, Pressler was never charged in Abscam, since he was one of the few officials approached who rejected a bribe outright. His actions won him plaudits from Federal District Court Judge George C. Pratt in upholding the convictions of seven Abscam defendants: Neither Pressler nor another target "apparently knew he had been brought before the sheik's representatives to be offered money in return for a promise of favorable legislative action," Pratt wrote. "However, neither one was overwhelmed by the circumstances, and each declined the offer. Pressler, particularly, acted as citizens have a right to expect their elected representatives to act. He showed a clear awareness of the line between proper and improper conduct, and despite his confessed need for campaign money, and despite the additional attractiveness to him of the payment offered, he nevertheless refused to cross into impropriety." CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, at the time the epitome of credibility in the media, singled out Pressler’s actions for praise. And U.S. Senate historian Donald Ritchie told PolitiFact that he considered the ad’s claim to be correct. Syndicated cartoonist Jim Berry even drew a cartoon of Pressler being greeted by the Greek philosopher Diogenes, who was known for carrying a lantern in the hopes of finding an honest man somewhere in the world. The caption was, "Senator Pressler? I am Diogenes. I've been looking for you." Our ruling Pressler said that "American Hustle shows the FBI making real-life bribes to Washington politicians. I know, because as your U.S. senator, I turned them down." Pressler’s retelling fits with the description of the facts published in the media at the time -- actions that drew praise from a federal judge who wrote that Pressler "showed a clear awareness of the line between proper and improper conduct" and "refused to cross into impropriety."

pomt-13651	Because of the Trans-Pacific Partnership "we’ve got a country like Malaysia taking really serious efforts to crack down on human trafficking."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/aug/05/barack-obama/obama-claims-positive-relationship-between-trans-p/	Trying to rally support for the oft-criticized Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Barack Obama said it will go a long way to improving human rights conditions across the globe. Specifically, he said during a press conference with Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Loong, it will curb human trafficking in Malaysia. "The same is true for things like human trafficking, where we've got a country like Malaysia taking really serious efforts to crack down on human trafficking," Obama said. "Why? Because TPP says you need to." We’ve rated two other claims from this press conference (a Mostly True on tariff cuts and a Half True on Vietnamese labor rights). Here, we look at the situation on the ground in Malaysia. Trafficking in Malaysia Malaysia has long been classified a human trafficking-destination by the U.S. State Department. In its 2015 "Trafficking in Persons" report, the State Department said Malaysia was guilty of debt bondage, unfair recruitment, wage fraud and passport confiscation. Trafficking in the construction industry has long made Malaysia stand out, said Eric Edmonds, an economics professor at Dartmouth University. Sex trafficking is not as big a problem there, he said. The State Department has classified Malaysia among countries working toward better compliance with correcting human trafficking problems. This leads us to the TPP. Consistency plan The White House pointed us to the "consistency plan" negotiated between the United States and Malaysia, which sets out changes Malaysia must make in its legal codes and procedures before the agreement can enter into force. The plan also establishes a bilateral committee to handle any compliance complaints. Provisions within the plan include: preventing employers from withholding employees’ passports, ensuring fair recruitment practices, allowing trafficking victims to move freely between shelters and allocating resources to labor law enforcement and data collection. Prior to the TPP being finalized in October, Malaysia has taken other efforts to combat human trafficking. In June 2015, Malaysia amended its law to improve treatment of trafficking victims. Among the changes, Malaysia gave victims better access to government shelters, transitional housing and more victim-friendly restitution procedures. Cathleen Ciminio-Isaacs, a research associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a group that has been described as pro-trade, noted this was an example of complying with the TPP. Edmonds added Malaysia has worked to prevent trafficking in the construction industry, by pulling construction visas. If workers can’t come into the country via construction visas, it is unlikely trafficking will occur, he explained. "A way to evaluate the success of the anti-trafficking factors is when we stop doing the things that allows there to be trafficking," Edmonds said. He said that this action would qualify as a "crackdown," when defined as a serious effort having an impact. While pulling visas is not contained in the consistency plan, Edmonds said the administrative change came "at the behest of the Obama administration." He added that, although the cause-effect relationship between the TPP and these actions is "loosy goosy," the TPP "absolutely" had a strong influence on legal changes that occurred while negotiations were underway. ‘Serious effort’ Experts we spoke to had slightly varied opinions on what a "serious effort to combat human trafficking" entails. But there is something being done. John Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, had a stricter interpretation of Obama’s claim, saying "serious efforts" would require actual results on the ground. He said results, at least as of now, are lacking. "Malaysia has promised to crack down on human trafficking," he said. "Are they cracking down on human trafficking? No, not yet. They have a long way to go. The best way to describe the president’s language is he’s premature." He added that it is likely Malaysia would change its legal code, but that implementation is a trickier proposition. Case in point, Sifton said, the number of prosecutions brought against trafficking in Malaysia is low. In 2015, the State Department reported, there were 38 prosecutions, down from 54 in 2014. There were seven convictions, up from three in 2014. The White House emphasized, however, that statistical evidence of declining trafficking, given the nature of the crime, will be hard to come by. Other experts said there is a "serious effort" happening. Alison Brysk, Mellichamp professor of global governance at the University of California, Santa Barbara, agreed that on-the-ground enforcement action hasn’t changed much. However, that doesn’t mean "serious efforts" aren’t being taken. Looking at the consistency plan, she said some of the provisions — such as its withholding passport provisions — are "relevant and meaningful" in terms of improving enforcement practices. "If Malaysia is doing all of these things, than that is movement in the right direction," Brysk said. Our ruling Obama said Malaysia is "taking really serious efforts to crack down on human trafficking" due to the TPP. Malaysia has been drafting changes to its legal code, experts told us, and already made legislative and administrative changes to combat human trafficking. Even if human trafficking numbers haven’t yet changed, experts said what Malaysia has done constituted a "serious effort," and that the TPP had an influence.

pomt-02171	The Rhode Island Parole Board "never received an objection from the attorney general" to the parole of convicted murder Alfred Brissette.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/30/dawson-hodgson/dawson-hodgson-says-ri-attorney-general-peter-kilm/	When the Rhode Island Parole Board granted parole to convicted murderer Alfred Brissette in November 2013, its decision was widely criticized. Among the critics was Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, whose office issued a statement at the time saying Brissette’s crime was "so egregious that the Parole Board should have come to a different conclusion." Now, state Sen. Dawson Hodgson, who is running against Kilmartin for attorney general, is criticizing the Democratic incumbent’s actions in the case. "When the press went to the parole board and said ‘how can you let an animal like this loose,’ they responded by saying, well, we never received an objection from the attorney general or from the victim’s family,’" Hodgson, a North Kingstown Republican, said in a March 27 interview on the public-access TV show "State of the State." "Nobody was there to speak for somebody who couldn’t speak for herself," Hodgson said. We wondered whether Hodgson had his facts straight. First, a little background. In June 1999, Brissette and Marc Girard, both 25, were arrested and charged with luring Jeannette Descoteaux from her hometown of Woonsocket to the woods of Burrillville where they beat her to death. Brissette hit her multiple times in the head with a lug wrench. Girard went to trial, was found guilty by a jury in 2001 and sentenced to life. Brissette pleaded no contest to second-degree murder in 2004 and was sentenced to serve 35 years in prison. (The sentence included the time he spent since being imprisoned at the Adult Correctional Institutions since 1999.) The judge in the case, Judith Savage, excoriated Brissette, describing him as a thrill killer who simply wanted to see someone die. Brissette was initially granted parole in June 2012, with a projected release in December, but concerns about whether he could meet the conditions of the release prompted the board to delay his release until November 2013, about 14 years after he was first jailed. The board cited Brissette’s clean prison disciplinary record, and his participation in ACI rehabilitation programs and the programs set up to monitor and support him after release. Was Hodgson right that Kilmartin hadn’t objected to Brissette’s parole? "That is correct," Kilmartin spokeswoman Amy Kempe said. The Brissette parole exposed a flaw in the parole process that has since been corrected, Kempe said. At the time, she said, the attorney general’s office would get a list of inmates up for consideration, sometimes as few as 10 days or so before the board met. The prosecutors in the office would review the list to determine whether they should raise any objections. If that list had two dozen or more names, the review could take time, she said. Brissette’s case was 14 years old, and none of the prosecutors who worked on it were still employed by the department, so no one raised an objection, Kempe said. Since the Brissette case, Kempe said the attorney general’s office now gets the parole lists a month or even two months ahead of time, which gives the office enough time to investigate each request. It also gives the office staff time to prepare an argument for its position, Kempe said. That was important, she said, because if the attorney general’s office simply opposed every parole request automatically, the office’s objections would become commonplace and lose their credibility. Parole Board Chairman Kenneth Walker declined to explain why the board approved Brissette’s release other than to say the board has confidence in the program devised for him. He said the lack of a recommendation from the attorney general had no effect on the board’s decision. Our ruling Dawson T. Hodgson said Attorney General Peter Kilmartin’s office didn’t oppose the parole request of convicted murderer Alfred Brissette. Kilmartin’s spokeswoman and the chairman of the parole board confirmed that was correct. We rule Hodgson’s statement True.	None	Dawson Hodgson	None	None	None	2014-04-30T00:01:00	2014-03-27	['None']

A good example is this tantalizing statistic, posted on the city of Portland’s Safe Routes to School program summary page: "Nationally, 50% of children who are hit by cars near schools are hit by cars driven by parents of other students." The figure also is contained in a how-to safe routes guide put out by the state. The claim is repeated in other Portland safe routes newsletters and in brochures, sometimes with the "national" modifier, sometimes not. And while the number on its face seems to make sense -- who is most likely to be driving near schools than parents? -- the figure begged even more questions: How many children are hit by cars each year? What is the sample size? And how did they track the numbers to figure that parents of other children were involved in half of those cases? In short, is this percentage accurate? PolitiFact Oregon set to find out. First up, a call to the Portland Bureau of Transportation. Spokesman Dan Anderson consulted with Gabriel Graff, a city safe routes organizer. Anderson said the city doesn’t track the number of children hit by cars near schools, so we have no idea whether the national number is true in Portland. But Anderson did come up with a source for the statistic: the Safe Routes to School National Partnership, an advocacy group launched in 2005 to score money and support from Congress for safer roads to school. (Its 500-plus members include cities, counties, bike shops and pedestrian friendly planners.) The footnote on the group’s "National Statistics on School Transportation" cites yet another source: "Washington State Department of Transportation; cited in Safe Routes to School, National Highway Transportation & Safety Administration, 2002." So on to the Washington State Department of Transportation. There we found Charlotte Claybrooke, the person responsible for coordinating the safe routes program in our neighbor state. She said she was unaware of any study and wrote: "Unfortunately, I can't be of much help except to say that I've tried to run that statistic down before and could not find a reference to substantiate it." Washington does not use the figure. At the same time, we checked with Julie Yip, the safe routes coordinator at the Oregon Department of Transportation. Yip did an online search and came up with a report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which repeats the figure and sources "Kallins, Wendy. Safe Routes to School. US Department of Transportation: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration." Ah-ha, a name -- albeit misspelled -- of someone who may have conducted the study or seen it first hand. Wendi (not Wendy) Kallins, we learned, launched the original safe routes pilot in Marin County, California, and still lives there. We asked via e-mail whether she had details of the original study. She wrote: "I get lots of inquiries about this one - it came from Washington state and I subsequently cannot find the original document I got it from. I believe it came from a school traffic calming document back in the ‘90's. Since I can't verify it, I don't recommend using the stat unless you can track down the original." We asked Kallins whether she was comfortable with the fact that public agencies and public policy groups were using the figure in their literature. Her response? "I can't speak for them. They may have tracked down the original source." But it’s clear that Portland and Oregon have not. Yip said she would stop using the figure, since the National Center for Safe Routes to School, which is not the same as the partnership, could not verify the figure and does not use it. Anderson said the city will scrub the statistic from its website barring last-minute evidence. The message remains the same, he said. "Reducing the need for children to be driven to and from school means fewer cars on the road and fewer opportunities for crashes." Fewer people could argue with that. We acknowledge this is not a statistic that will alter how much Congress spends on safer roads. (By the way, Oregon received more than $6 million of $612 million for 2005-2009.) We’re not suggesting that proponents of safer roads have trumped up a figure to champion a cause. But the twisted tale of this claim is a case study in how falsehoods get passed along with good intentions and nothing to back them up. Just because a statement keeps getting repeated doesn't mean it's true -- even if a source is cited. We find the claim False. Comment on this item.

pomt-11915	"And I think that his engagement with Congress is something that never happened under President Obama. They were never allowed to debate it. They were never allowed to discuss it. So, now Congress is going to be fully engaged on the threats of Iran."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/19/nikki-haley/haley-wrongly-says-congress-had-no-input-iran-nucl/	Defending President Donald Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said Congress now has a voice on the issue that it didn’t have in the past. Trump’s decision allows Congress to potentially kill the agreement or tack on new conditions. "He's saying to Congress, can we make it better?" Haley told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on an Oct. 15 broadcast of This Week. "And I think that his engagement with Congress is something that never happened under President Obama. They were never allowed to debate it. They were never allowed to discuss it. So, now Congress is going to be fully engaged on the threats of Iran." This was an early criticism of the agreement. After the United States, Iran and other foreign governments came to an agreement on the framework for the Iran deal, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress appealed to Obama to let them have a say in it before the final deal was reached. Here, we are fact-checking Haley’s claim that Congress was "never allowed" to debate or discuss the agreement. Congressional responsibility in the Iran deal Much of the responsibility for U.S. foreign policy falls under the authority of the executive branch. Congress does play a significant role, however, in foreign trade and commerce, immigration, foreign aid, the defense budget and any declarations of war. The Senate authorizes treaties and confirms the president’s cabinet nominees. To avoid needing Senate approval for an agreement with a foreign power, the president can simply avoid calling the agreement a treaty. The Obama administration said the Iran deal was neither a treaty nor an executive agreement. Instead, the State Department said in a letter that the deal "reflects political commitments" between the seven nations involved. When the president negotiates a deal that is not deemed a treaty, Congress -- if it wants a say on the deal -- must convince the president to give the legislative branch the power to approve or block the final deal. That’s exactly what Congress did when it passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, a bill that had bipartisan support and allowed Congress the right to review any agreement reached in the negotiations. Obama initially threatened to veto the bill but did not. Senators considered a separate, and ultimately unsuccessful, measure that would have given them the the power to block the agreement through a resolution of disapproval. A procedural vote on the resolution fell short of the 60 votes needed to override a Democratic filibuster. Despite the resolution’s failure, by passing the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Congress was able to have some authority and say in the final agreement. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who spearheaded the bill, has touted the legislation for taking "power back from the president" and forcing the executive office to be transparent. "There’s no question the prior administration made every effort to bypass Congress and implement the agreement without congressional review or approval," Corker said in an emailed statement. "That is why we overwhelmingly passed INARA, which required the administration to submit the full details of the agreement to Congress and established a process for a debate and vote on the deal." It should also be noted that Obama administration officials went on the record about the Iran deal during congressional hearings and briefings, allowing members of Congress to bring up questions and concerns with the White House in a public debate setting. Further, the review act imposed a requirement that the president recertify the deal every 90 days. In other words, every three months the president must ensure the following: Iran is abiding by the rules of the agreement, Iran hasn’t taken action to advance its nuclear weapons program, the waiver of sanctions on Iran are still appropriate. "This kind of ongoing management I think is unusual and represented quite a compromise by President Obama," said John Glaser, the director of foreign studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. Glaser pointed out that the Obama administration would not have been able to handle "all of the subtlety, secrecy, and nuance that was required" to negotiate the Iran deal if it had involved Congress from the beginning. Haley, we should note, backtracked a bit in an interview on Meet The Press, when moderator Chuck Todd pointed out that the reason the Iran deal has a certification process is because Congress added constraints. Haley responded: "And Congress did that because President Obama didn't give them the authority to be a part of that decision. So they did it to try and control the situation and not let it get to a bad problem." She didn't add similar caveats during the ABC interview. Our ruling Haley said Congress was never allowed to debate or discuss the Iran nuclear agreement while Obama was in office. Though Congress had to fight for the right to disapprove of the deal, the passage of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 allowed Congress to not only vote on the deal but to also hold public hearings and debate. The Senate ultimately did not have the votes to block the deal, but the act included a requirement for the president to frequently monitor Iran’s progress in meeting the agreement’s conditions. So Congress did have input, even if Obama initially tried to avoid it. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08265	Electric utility FirstEnergy's annual revenues are greater "than the GDP of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, or 15 African nations."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/10/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-chides-firstenergy-rate-plan-noti/	Roughly 361,000 electrically heated Ohio households were shocked last year when Akron-based FirstEnergy began phasing out discounted rates it had provided for decades to "all electric" customers whose households run exclusively on electricity. FirstEnergy has said those customers need to pay the actual costs for the services they receive, and the longtime discounts can’t continue because of electricity deregulation and new conservation mandates, The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio took up the issue after some families complained of doubled electricity bills, and has held hearings on the subject throughout the state. At an Oct. 25 hearing in Sandusky, Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur told PUCO the discounts should remain, and noted they were part of a longtime all-electric marketing scheme in which the company agreed to provide lower rates to customers who forfeited alternative utility choices. As part of her statement, Kaptur asked: "Are we to believe that a corporation such as FirstEnergy, with annual revenues of approximately $1 billion -- that’s a thousand million dollars a year, more than the GDP of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, or 15 African nations -- are we to believe that such a giant corporation cannot afford to keep its promises to senior citizens and working families in all-electric homes and apartments?" Do FirstEnergy’s revenues actually exceed the gross domestic product of so many countries? We decided to do some digging. FirstEnergy’s most recent annual report says its total revenue for 2009 was nearly $13 billion, down from $13.6 billion in 2008. Kaptur’s $1 billion statement significantly understates the company’s yearly revenues, but she’s correct to state those revenues exceed the gross domestic product of many countries. According to statistics compiled by the World Bank, FirstEnergy’s yearly revenues are greater than the 2009 gross domestic products of 85 nations including Iceland ($12.1 billion) Haiti ($6.7 billion) and the Kyrgyz Republic ($4.6 billion). It’s also higher than the gross domestic product for 29 African countries: Zambia, Botswana, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Namibia, Madagascar, Mali, The Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, Burkina Faso, Chad, Benin, Niger, Rwanda, Malawi, Guinea, Mauritania, Swaziland, Togo, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Liberia, Seychelles, The Gambia. Comoros, and Sao Tome and Principe. FirstEnergy spokeswoman Ellen Raines said the company’s $13 billion yearly revenue doesn’t reflect what it pays for expenses like taxes, infrastructure maintenance, electricity generation, and employing 14,000 workers. "We have a vast and complex infrastructure that is used to provide electric service to 4 ½ million customers," said Raines. "We invest every day in helping ensure that service is safe and reliable." FirstEnergy is committed to finding a resolution to the electricity rate issue that is "fair to all our customers," said Raines, adding that said current rates for all-electric homes will continue through the winter heating season. Asked why Kaptur said FirstEnergy’s yearly revenues are $1 billion instead of $13 billion, Kaptur spokesman Steve Fought took the blame. He said he did the research and intended to write that the company’s monthly revenue, not yearly revenue, was $1 billion.. After The Plain Dealer inquired about the discrepancy, he corrected the version of the statement that appears on Kaptur’s website. "I have to take responsibility for that," said Fought. "Looking back on it, I wish I had just referred to FirstEnergy's annual revenues instead of trying to break it into a billion dollars a month. In trying to make the numbers more understandable, I succeeded only in making them more confusing." Fought said Kaptur’s point is still valid despite the mistake: "FirstEnergy has plenty of money to keep their promises to all electric customers." PolitiFact Ohio isn’t in the business of playing "Gotcha!" We recognize sometimes people can misspeak. Her staff had the correct revenue number, and Kaptur's mistake certainly didn’t lead to exaggeration. In fact, she understates the number of countries that have smaller GDP. Her underlying point, that FirstEnergy has sizable annual revenue, is accurate. So we’re not downgrading her on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate Kaptur’s claim as True. Comment on this item.

pomt-00922	Ninety-five percent of the money used for union-operated worker training centers comes from employers.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/27/kurt-bauer/business-leader-says-95-percent-union-worker-train/	Listening to supporters and opponents of right to work laws talk about worker training -- and who pays for it -- can be a mind-bending experience. They talk right past each other. That was the case at a Feb. 10, 2015, discussion about right to work sponsored by the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club. The panel featured Kurt Bauer, leader of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby, and Steve Lyons, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Contractor Coalition. Bauer and his group back right to work. Lyons and his group, which includes about 400 firms in construction contracting, are opposed. Lyons noted that many skilled trades such as carpenters, plumbers and operating engineers provide training to their members at union-run centers across the state -- and argued such training would be hurt if the state passes a right-to-work law. Union members "gave $30 million to these facilities," last year, Lyons said. "From the training perspective, it’s great that some of these unions do train -- not all of them do -- the trades do," Bauer countered. "But it’s paid for by employers. That won’t change -- 95 percent comes from employers." Bauer then added: "That’s one for PolitiFact." Lyons replied: "Absolutely. Bring it on." We are here to serve. Is Bauer right that 95 percent of the money used for union-operated worker training centers comes from employers? More about the programs This is all tied into the right to work debate because worker training, particularly in the trades areas, is expensive. It’s also important to ensure that quality and safety standards are met and maintained. These are the folks building houses and highways, for instance. And much of the training is done at union-operated worker training centers around the state. Since trades workers are typically the ones affected by this provision, understanding how those unions work is key to this issue. Picture a construction project that requires iron workers. Contractors on the project may tap a union to provide iron workers for the job, but those workers are not permanent employees of the contractor. They may work on a building project one day, and switch to a bridge project the next. Thus, training programs have grown up around the unions. A right to work law would mean workers no longer would be required to pay dues to a union. The concern, as cited by Lyons, is that over time this could mean fewer union members and therefore less money available for training. He takes it a step further and notes the training would then have to be done by the state’s taxpayer-supported technical colleges. Bauer’s claim is that this is largely irrelevant, since nearly all the money for training comes not from unions, but employers. The reality is more complicated. Unions decide each year how to allocate the training money deducted from their paychecks. Think of it in terms of a payroll deduction for, say, a flexible spending account, parking or some other item. It may be handled administratively by the employer, but the money is the employee’s to spend. "The money is held by the companies and then given to the various union training funds," said Tim Peterson, vice president of James Peterson Sons Inc., a fourth-generation highway construction contractor based in Medford. "However, active members of the trade unions allocate money out of their negotiated pay to fund the training trust funds." A member of the Contractor Coalition, Peterson agreed that the money starts with the employers, usually as a set amount per hour of pay. But the workers decide how the money is used, he said, adding: "If employees elect to reduce or stop directing money to the training funds, those dollars will go to increase the employees’ wages and will not be redirected to the employers." End of story? Not quite. Scott Manley, vice president of governmental relations for WMC, said the best evidence the training money comes from employers is the tax returns filed by the nonprofit entities that the unions use to manage the training money. "According to tax forms filed by unions with the IRS, businesses pay about 95% of the operating cost for union training programs," Manley said in an email. "Although the amount paid may be negotiated with the unions who do the training … it is businesses that actually make the payment." Manley added: "Employers pay to have workers trained because it is in their best interest to have skilled employees." Right to work laws, he added, "will not change employers’ need for skilled labor or their willingness to pay for it." Howard H. Simon, an accountant with the Chicago-based Calibre CPA Group, the company that prepared the tax returns for the job training fund, took a different view of the tax documents. He provided a list of about three dozen state-based training funds, and the sources of the money. One example: The Appleton-Oshkosh Electrical Workers Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee. The list "demonstrates that employees of the various trade organizations listed contributed over $31 million to their training funds (in a one-year period)," Simon said in a memo to Lyons. "It’s a private contract…between the private sector business and the private sector union," Lyons said. "And it’s a voluntary contract. And in those contracts ... the individual employees determine how much they’re going to give." Our rating Bauer says that employers pay 95 percent of the cost of union workers to receive training. That may be true in a technical sense, and on an IRS form, but it’s not that simple. The money in question belongs to the workers -- it’s part of their compensation. And they decide how to allocate it each year. The statement contains some element of truth but leaves out important information that would lead to a different impression. In our book, that’s Mostly False.	None	Kurt Bauer	None	None	None	2015-02-27T05:00:00	2015-02-10	['None']
pomt-03223	"Only in Washington would politicians spend $27 million to teach Moroccans how to make pottery."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/21/karen-handel/pottery-class-claim-takes-truth-spin/	The race to fill retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ seat is in full swing with candidates on both sides of the aisle jockeying for early position among their competitors. A common theme, particularly among the GOP candidates, has been the need to rein in wasteful government spending. Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel has taken this topic to another level. Handel began a daily blog, titled "Only in Washington," detailing alleged wastefulness by the federal government. Handel is planning to chronicle "42 ridiculous things that happen only in Washington," and this week she reached the halfway point. PolitiFact Georgia perused the 20 or so completed entries and found some to be quite interesting. For example, Day 8’s item: "Only in Washington would politicians spend $27 million to teach Moroccans how to make pottery," Handel said. "While Morocco is no doubt a lovely place, we have families in Georgia that are being hurt by high taxes fueling out of control spending … What’s worse is that the program was deemed a failure …," she continued. Almost $30 million for pottery classes in any country sounded outrageous. We decided to dig a little deeper to determine whether these costs were accurate. A press release accompanying each day’s item includes sources that Handel’s team has used to make the statements. For the Day 8 item, the sources included a couple of news stories about the spending that Handel’s spokesman provided. The claim has been repeated by politicos before, including conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly. Earlier this year, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked into this claim as a portion of a three-part statement made by a congressman from that state about government spending. The congressman was found to be incorrect for overstating this portion of his claim about the pottery class spending. Much of the background about this claim originated from a similar aggregation of alleged wasteful federal government spending done by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn. Each year, the Republican senator from Oklahoma releases an oversight report of "unnecessary, duplicative and low-priority projects spread throughout the federal government" in a document called the Wastebook. Coburn’s Wastebook 2012 highlights the pottery classes as an example of wasteful spending, but notes that only part of the $27 million of a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) project went toward the classes. In 2009, USAID began a $30 million, four-year plan to help increase the economic competitiveness of Morocco. The plan included five projects, with the Morocco Economic Competitive Project accounting for $27 million, or 90 percent of the overall plan. The Competitive Project, scheduled to run through Sept. 30, 2013, initially included a provision for a $7 million, one-year extension. But because of anticipated budget cuts, a change in mission strategy, complications with the task order and poor implementation of some activities, it is unlikely the project will be extended, according to a December 2011 audit report by a federal inspector general. The initial goals of the project were to improve the country's business climate, work on ways to use water sustainably for agricultural growth and strengthen workforce development. A key part of the project included training Moroccans to create pottery to sell domestically as well as internationally. But the pottery program was riddled with problems, the audit found. For example, a translator hired to translate the instructions from an English-speaking pottery trainer to Arabic-speaking attendees was not fluent in English, which resulted in communication breakdowns. Also, some of the materials used by the pottery trainer were unavailable in Morocco, and participants were unable to replicate the projects. The pottery trainer was forgetful. Ultimately, the audit found that the pottery portion of the competitiveness project was poorly implemented, had limited impact and its intended focus on women and youths was not fulfilled. In a November 2011 response letter, USAID/Morocco's mission director characterized the pottery training as a "minor activity" within the competitiveness project. The pottery training portion of the project represented only one part of the project’s engagement in the country’s pottery sector. In fiscal 2011, that component accounted for 8 percent of annual project spending, the mission director wrote. So is Handel’s claim correct? The former Georgia secretary of state who’s now a U.S. Senate candidate said that the federal government spent $27 million teaching Moroccans how to make pottery. This claim has been a popular touchstone for conservatives looking to shine a light on government waste. But a closer look at the facts shows that the $27 million was for an entire economic development program in Morocco, of which the pottery training was only a fraction of the cost -- about 8 percent of the total program. Some may still consider that amount, $2.2 million, a large expense for pottery training and promotion, but it is not close to the $27 million that Handel claimed. Her overall point that the program was a failure is supported by an inspector general’s audit that found that the pottery training was mismanaged, poorly organized and ineffective. Her statement contains an element of truth but overstates the cost and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rated Handel’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-04924	"The president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for our country."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jul/31/kelly-ayotte/kelly-ayotte-parrots-dubunked-romney-talking-point/	Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, rumored to be one of Mitt Romney’s choice running mates for his 2012 presidential campaign, made her rounds on the National media circuit this weekend criticizing the President while touting the former Massachusetts governor, this time during CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. When host Candy Crowley highlighted Romney’s foreign faux pas while traveling abroad over the weekend, Ayotte was quick to shift the criticism onto President Barack Obama’s foreign policy speeches to show why she feels Romney would better serve as Commander in Chief. "I can tell you that certainly, Mitt Romney is going to be strong on America's exceptionalism and strong foreign policy for America and he won't go around and apologize for America," Ayotte said. "Think about it. The president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for our country, and he's actually made us weaker around the world as opposed to stronger, and Mitt Romney will stand strong with our allies." In the world of PolitiFact, Ayotte and Romney have campaign chemistry, at least when it comes to this claim; we’ve already fact checked Romney three times for saying Obama apologized for U.S. actions overseas. He’s earned a False and a Pants on Fire, not once, but twice. The concept that Obama has traveled the world apologizing is popular among some conservative websites, and since Ayotte put the claim back in the public spotlight, PolitiFact New Hampshire felt it was time to bring it before the Truth-O-Meter, again. What Obama said Romney first made the accusation about Obama’s apologies abroad in his book titled, "No Apology," and later said Obama issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. For starters, as PolitiFact looked over Obama's remarks, we have noticed that Obama never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: "sorry." Merriam-Webster defines an apology as "an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret." PolitiFact read the Obama speeches Romney references and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together. But Since Ayotte cited the Cairo speech specifically, we’ll focus on that one. During a 6,000-word speech on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world in Cairo in 2009, Obama did get very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply "move forward." Here are his exact remarks: "In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward." Obama also praised America, saying "The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world." An Ayotte spokesman, reached Tuesday, stood by the claim that the president was apologetic, saying the President acknowledged what he considered to be several errors in U.S. foreign policy during his speech and then pledged to change course. "President Obama is entitled to his opinion and Senator Ayotte is entitled to her opinion, which is that his address in Cairo amounted to an apology," Ayotte spokesman Jeff Grappone said. "There are numerous ways to apologize for American foreign policy without actually using the word ‘sorry.’ In this case, Senator Ayotte and President Obama have a fundamental difference of opinion, which she expressed." They cited several passages, including Obama’s comments about Iran, which they say amounted to the President apologizing for the United States. Here are the President’s statements from the speech they cited: • Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. • Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course. I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. • I know -- I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq. So let me be clear: No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other. • But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century -- and in too many Muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas. I'm emphasizing such investment within my own country. And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement. • More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. Did Obama apologize? PolitiFact sent Obama's remarks from each of the speeches that Romney cited, including the Cairo speech, to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing. • Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the website Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing, which is not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama was using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret." • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, PolitiFact has also compared Obama to his two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, in the earlier fact check. Our ruling While Obama's speeches have contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, those passages were typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries have erred as well. The same is true when zeroing in on Obama’s Cairo speech, when the President never included the words "sorry," "apologize," "error," or even "regret." It’s incorrect for Romney, and now Ayotte, to portray any of these speeches as apologies. PolitiFact has regularly found Romney’s angle--that Obama’s trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries--to be a ridiculous charge. There’s a clear difference between changing policies and apologizing, and Obama didn’t do the latter. However, Romney charged that the President went on global apology tour, while Ayotte cited only one stop along that tour. Still, for parroting Romney’s repeatedly refuted claim, we give Ayotte a False. Note: Ayotte’s response was added to this item Tuesday evening after it was originally published.

pomt-15369	"Chris Christie has led New Jersey to a record-breaking 9 credit downgrades."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/02/donna-brazile/dem-pundit-brazile-says-nj-credit-rating-fell-reco/	A key talking point for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in his bid for the GOP nomination is that he is a can-do Republican in a Democratic state. That, of course, leaves him open to challenges about what he’s actually achieved. Democratic pundit and occasional party operative Donna Brazile took a jab at Christie’s track record on managing his state’s finances. "Governor #ChrisChristie has led New Jersey to a record-breaking 9 credit downgrades. Yes, you read that right: nine credit downgrades," Brazile tweeted on June 30, 2015. We’ve checked similar statements about Christie before and took this moment to update our findings. In short, yes, the three major credit rating firms have collectively downgraded the state’s bond rating nine times. The latest move came from Moody’s Investor Service in April. The Moody’s rating fell from A1 to A2. The rating firm said it based the change on the state’s "weak financial position and large structural imbalance, primarily related to continued pension contribution shortfalls." In addition to Moody’s, there are two other rating agencies -- Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings. Here’s the history of downgrades since Christie took office. Date Rating service Rating change 1 Feb. 9, 2011 Standard & Poor’s AA to AA- 2 April 27, 2011 Moody’s Aa2 to Aa3 3 Aug. 17, 2011 Fitch Ratings AA to AA- 4 April 9, 2014 Standard & Poor’s AA- to A+ 5 May 1, 2014 Fitch Ratings AA- to A+ 6 May 13, 2014 Moody’s Aa3 to A1 7 Sept. 5, 2014 Fitch Ratings A+ to A 8 Sept. 10, 2014 Standard & Poor’s A+ to A 9 April 16, 2015 Moody’s A1 to A2 Do the nine downgrades set a record? Yes, for New Jersey. According to news reports, that is the highest number ever for a single New Jersey governor. The previous record was six credit downgrades, which happened while Democrat James McGreevey was governor. McGreevey presided over his drops in less than three years in office (2002-04); Christie is in his sixth year in office. Pension system blues Ratings agencies assess the state’s ability to repay its lenders, not just today but for years to come. Their opinion matters because the lower the rating, the higher the interest rate the state faces when it wants to borrow money. A point of ongoing concern for the agencies has been New Jersey’s pension obligations. It’s total commitments are about $43 billion. According to a report by the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, as of 2013, New Jersey ranked last in the country in its efforts to put enough money into the system each year to make good on its promises to it current and future retirees. It was putting in 38 percent of what the association calculated was needed. As Moody’s put it, "the state's plan to restore long-term structural balance relies on economic growth and further pension reforms, which have uncertain timing and impact." Recent events in New Jersey have fueled such skepticism. In 2011, Christie struck a deal with lawmakers, and public workers, to increase state contributions to the pension funds in exchange for higher payments from employees, a bump in the retirement age, and lower cost-of-living increases for retirees. But in 2014, with tax revenues coming in lower than predicted, Christie trimmed the state’s pension payments. Christie says deeper changes are needed. Does Christie deserve all the blame for this mess? No. Democratic and Republican governors alike have failed to put enough money into the pension system going back to the late 1990s. The problem ballooned in the early 2000s when the dot-com bubble burst and tax revenues fell, and the Great Recession later in the decade did even more damage to state finances. Also, the state Legislature has been controlled by Democrats. But while the problem was created before he took office, Christie can’t sidestep at least some responsibility for what has taken place on his watch. Our ruling Brazile said that Chistie led New Jersey to a record-breaking nine credit downgrades. Her tally is correct, Christie was the chief executive throughout and no other New Jersey governor has overseen so many reductions in the state credit rating. The previous record was six. But the underlying problem with pensions began before his time and the economy made it harder to fix past errors. It's also worth noting that Democracts have controlled the Legislature during Christie's time in office. With those caveats, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-15176	"We did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/24/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-us-didnt-have-income-taxes-until-191/	Correction (Dec. 20, 2016): This fact-check initially published on Aug. 24, 2015, and was rated Mostly True. Upon reconsideration, we are changing our ruling to Half True. The text of the fact-check is unchanged. Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb says the U.S. needs a leaner, more efficient tax code. The former Virginia senator broadly calls for lowering tax rates in exchange for eliminating "loopholes and exceptions" that he says "have made a mockery out of true economic fairness." Webb says investment income should be taxed at the same rates as wages. And he would like to see the U.S. shift some of its burden away from income and toward consumption. Big changes? Sure. But Webb says the tax code is not sacrosanct. "We did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913," he wrote on his campaign website. Our radar beeped. Somewhere in the course of our lives, we recalled reading or hearing that the income tax had deeper roots in U.S. history than Webb claimed. So we investigated. In 1913, the year Webb cites, the U.S. began a tax on individual incomes, and a levy on personal earnings has been exacted ever since. That was the birth year of the 1040 tax form that, with many modifications, remains in use today. It came with one page of instructions back then, compared with 104 pages this year. Although the form was new, oldtimers in 1913 might have remembered another era when they paid income tax to Washington. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed a measure enacting an income tax to help pay for the Civil War. It imposed a tax of 3 percent on incomes between $600 and $10,000 and a 5 percent tax on incomes above that level. The levy, which had sunset provisions, expired in 1872. It was not forgotten, however. In 1894, Congress passed a new income tax, but it never went into effect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional the next year because it was a direct tax that was not apportioned on the basis of each state’s population. At that time, for example, if 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, then no more than 5 percent of the total revenue could come from Virginia. That constitutional hurdle was cleared by the 16th Amendment, proposed by President William Howard Taft in 1909 and ratified by the states in 1913. It allowed the tax to be levied without any apportionment among states. Congress adopted a 1 percent tax on net personal income of more than $3,000 with a surtax of 6 percent on incomes of more than $500,000. By 1918, with World War I raging, the top income bracket soared to a 77 percent tax rate. We ran Webb’s statement past Joseph Thorndike, the director of the online Tax History Museum -- a nonprofit organization based in Falls Church. Thorndike, also an adjunct professor of tax policy at Northwestern University, said Webb’s historical oversight merits a minor penalty. "I think it’s fair to treat the Civil War tax as an anomaly," he said. Wonder where the U.S. got its revenues prior to the income tax? Before the Civil War, government funds primarily came from custom duties, selling public land and temporary excise taxes, according to the Congressional Research Service report. During the decades after the Civil War, when the income tax lapsed, the IRS says about 90 percent of the country’s revenues came from taxes on liquor, beer, wine and tobacco. Our ruling Webb said "we did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913." The modern income tax structure, complete with Form 1040, was born in 1913. But his claim disregards two pre-1913 efforts to impose an income tax — one of which was in place for a decade. This claim rates Half True.

pomt-02070	The Obama administration spent "$205,075 in ‘stimulus’ funds to relocate a shrub that sells for $16."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/may/23/ted-cruz/shrub-found-wild-during-california-highway-project/	President Barack Obama regularly disregards laws to impose his preferred policies, Ted Cruz maintains. The Republican senator from Texas hammered that theme in a May 6, 2014, report, the fourth in a series, listing dozens of his concerns covering some previously fact-checked terrain such as work waivers for individuals on Temporary Aid to Needy Families, a topic reviewed by PolitiFact in 2012, plus administration moves softening or putting off parts of the Democrat-propelled 2010 health care law. Cruz set us to digging by declaring the administration "spent $205,075 in ‘stimulus’ funds to relocate a shrub that sells for $16." This shrub, shown here after it was uprooted from its original site, prompted Ted Cruz’s claim (photo by California Department of Transportation, received by email May 22, 2014). Really? Reported by CNSNews.com The basis for this claim, footnoted in the report, was an April 12, 2012, news article posted online by the CNSNews.com, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email. The Virginia-based service says its goal is to "provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission." According to the story, "Shovel Ready in San Fran: $205,075 to ‘Translocate’ One Shrub from Path of Stimulus Project," various agencies in 2010 transplanted a type of bush spotted in San Francisco that until then had been believed extinct in the wild for more than 60 years; the shrub was moved from a highway median where it blocked a stimulus-supported highway renovation to an undisclosed local location where it could continue to bloom in the wild. Meantime, the story said, commercial versions of the Franciscan manzanita, or Arctostaphylos franciscana, could be purchased locally for $15.98 or $18 each. An article about the uncovered plant, on the web page for a Los Angeles botanical garden, says Franciscan manzanitas typically grow about 12 inches tall and spread by rooting branches to form masses from 4 to 6 feet (or more) wide. According to the description, white- to pink-blushed urn-shaped flowers are produced in small terminal clusters. CNSNews.com quoted a spokeswoman for the Presidio Parkway project, Molly Graham, as saying that digging up the uncovered plant, putting it on a truck and driving and planting it elsewhere cost $100,000. The story noted other plant-related costs in a Dec. 21, 2009, 15-year memorandum of agreement involving various agencies teamed up to save and propagate the plant found near the south entrance to the Golden Gate Bridge. In the agreement, the California Department of Transportation, or CalTrans, agreed to transfer $79,470 to "fund the establishment, nurturing, and monitoring of the Mother Plant in its new location for a period not to exceed ten (10) years following relocation and two (2) years for salvaged rooted layers and cuttings…" Receiving the money: the federal Presidio Trust, which describes itself as devoted to transforming the Presidio section of San Francisco to a new purpose. CalTrans also agreed to transfer $25,605 to the trust to cover reporting requirements of the initial 10-year period. Adding these figures to the $100,000 to uproot, move and re-plant the shrub leads to total translocation costs of $205,075, CNSNews.com said, not counting up to $23,500 in other post-move shrub-connected costs it identified from the memo. Stimulus money contributed to road project And how did the Obama administration figure in? CNSNews.com reported that grants funded by the economic stimulus package, approved by the Democratic-majority Congress and signed into law by Obama in 2009, are helping to fund the ongoing replacement of an approach to the Golden Gate bridge, which has a total expected cost of $1.045 billion. Some $130 million in stimulus grants, the story said, breaks down to $83.28 million awarded Dec. 24, 2009 (about a month before the bush move) and $46 million awarded Dec. 30, 2010. Our hunt for other accounts of the shrub shift yielded an earlier news story pegging the costs of the shrub move at $175,000--"$140,000 to dig up and move the shrub, and $35,000 for ‘support’ services from geological, botanical and climate experts in preparation for its new home in the Presidio less than a mile away," according to a San Francisco Chronicle news story posted online June 2, 2010. Like the CNSNews.com article, the Chronicle story was silent on whether stimulus aid paid for the shrub move. Plant in wild distinct from commercially cultivated version? Separately, botanists declared a difference between the plant found in the wild and others like it. In an April 20, 2012, blog post, the Berkeley, Calif.-based Bay Nature Institute, which says it’s dedicated to educating residents about the beauty of the surrounding natural world, quoted Dan Gluesenkamp, the botanist who originally noticed the lone plant as he drove by the median, as saying it’s misleading to equate the wild Franciscan manzanita with the domesticated version found in garden stores, which has been hybridized for features like pretty flowers, Gluesenkamp said. "You can go buy a dog for $15 or $230," he said, "but it’s not the same as a wolf in the wild." The blog post continued: "The Franciscan manzanita found in garden stores is an offshoot of a wild specimen taken in 1947 from a Laurel Hill cemetery, one of the few remaining wild locations at the time. As the story goes, some of the last remaining wild specimens were salvaged by James Roof, the founding director of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley. In a clandestine nighttime rescue, plantswoman Lester Rowntree ‘garnered it ghoulishly in a gunnysack’ and gave it a new home in her garden. A few more plants found their way into nurseries and botanic gardens, but the species’ known wild habitat was no more," the institute said. In September 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the surviving wild manzanita as an endangered species, according to a Sept. 4, 2012, Chronicle news article. Agency: Shrub's move covered by local road tolls Asked how the shrub's move was funded, a CalTrans official, David Yam, replied by email that $148,000 spent to uproot the 21,000-pound plant and move, replant and initially preserve it came from tolls collected on bridges near San Francisco by the Bay Area Toll Authority--not stimulus aid. Yam said major post-move costs, in accord with the memorandum of agreement, are drawing on $105,000 in federal funds, though (again) no stimulus money, he said. Shopping for a Franciscan manzanita Yam agreed a similar cultivated Manzanita plant can be purchased commercially, but he said a 21,000-pound wild Manzanita isn't available. He provided a background document stating the plant discovered on the median is one of three remaining "wild" species of the bush; the others are in botanical gardens, the document states. "Cuttings from the 'wild' plant cannot be purchased by the public," the document states. We briefly shopped online for a manzanita Franciscana without finding one. By telephone, Bart O’Brien, a manager at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley, Calif., said that occasionally the garden sells plants, descended from the manzanita Franciscana salvaged from the San Francisco cemetery in the 1940s. When sales happen, he said, the plants sell for $10 to $25. The sold plants are of the same species as the bush saved during the ongoing highway project, O'Brien said, but they’re not the same because they're not growing in the wild. Cruz unmoved Updated on our findings, Frazier said by email the bush never would have been shifted if not for the stimulus-supported road project. Moving the plant wasted tax dollars, she said, and Cruz stands by his claim. Our ruling Cruz said the Obama administration spent "$205,075 in ‘stimulus’ to relocate a shrub that sells for $16." Some $130 million in stimulus money is supporting a $1 billion California road project that when it started brought to light a thought-to-be-extinct shrub in the wild. But we learned local road toll revenues covered the shrub’s $148,000 move and transplantation--not stimulus aid. Also, there’s a distinction between the rare in-the-wild version the shrub ballyhooed in the city by the bay and the occasionally available commercial versions, which this claim fails to acknowledge. We rate the statement, which has an element of truth but ignores critical facts such as the singularity of the shrub whose move wasn't funded from stimulus aid, as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-12555	A United Airlines passenger forcibly removed from an airplane "was in his seat, he has every right to stay there."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/14/andrew-napolitano/united-airlines-passenger-had-every-right-stay-pla/	A United Airlines passenger’s forcible removal from a flight has led to plenty of armchair judicial rulings on whether it was legal. Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano said on Fox & Friends after the incident that United overstepped its authority by taking David Dao off Flight 3411 unwillingly on April 10, 2017. Dao had boarded the airplane, but then United selected him to lose his seat when the airline wanted to put four flight crew members on the flight from Chicago to Louisville, Ky. Dao refused to leave. Video widely shared on the Internet appeared to show Dao being pulled from his seat by Chicago Department of Aviation police, his face bloodied in the process. His family later announced he had suffered a concussion, a broken nose and lost his two front teeth. The officers involved have been put on leave, and United has struggled to contain the publicity disaster. "By dislodging this passenger against his will, United violated its contractual obligation," Napolitano said the next day. "He paid for the ticket, he bought the ticket, he passed the TSA, he was in his seat, he has every right to stay there." Airline travel already is fraught with hassle and inconvenience, as most of us know, but this incident has tested legal boundaries for how passengers can and should be treated. Is Napolitano right that a ticketed passenger who has passed security and boarded the airplane has "every right" to stay in his seat? Without diving into the other legalities of what happened to Dao, experts we contacted say Napolitano’s argument that a passenger can’t be removed from a plane doesn’t fly. Contract of carriage Let’s start off by saying there’s a lot about the incident that would have to be decided after an investigation, and possibly even legal action. With so many arguments to consider about the legality of Dao’s removal, a lot is still up in the air (so to speak). We emailed Napolitano and two Fox News Channel media contacts for more information on this statement, but we didn’t get a reply. Timothy Ravich, an aviation law professor at the University of Central Florida, told us passenger rights are still limited by laws, regulations and policies. Airlines have the authority to decide whether passengers are breaking the rules, and can remove people at a company's discretion, even against a passenger's will. "The suggestion that Dr. Dao had ironclad rights merely by buying a ticket, passing through TSA security, and being in his seat is incorrect," Ravich said. In this case, Dao was also subject to United’s contract of carriage, essentially a set of guidelines by which a passenger agrees to abide in exchange for the flight. Ravich pointed out that Rule 21 of United’s contract give about 27 reasons why the airline "shall have the right to refuse to transport or shall have the right to remove from the aircraft at any point, any passenger." Some of these reasons include a woman being nine months pregnant, or someone being too sick or too drunk to fly, or even if they are "barefoot or not properly clothed." That last one came up for United in March when two teen girls were barred from a flight for wearing leggings. (The teens were flying standby as part of the airlines’ perk of giving flights to employees and their dependents. The airline said the tight-fitting pants did not meet the company’s policy dress code for those types of passengers.) Ravich noted, as an example, that Rule 21 also said "passengers who fail to comply with or interfere with the duties of the members of the flight crew, federal regulations, or security directives" are subject to removal as a safety measure. One theoretical argument in this instance could be that Dao was told to leave to help United get a flight crew to Louisville. Dao broke the rule when he refused and was therefore removed. Now, before you write us angry letters, let us reiterate that we’re not judging whether a policy is fair or was applied or enforced correctly. We’re merely saying that there are rules in place that allow for passengers already on a plane to be removed, and passengers are subject to them. Embry Riddle Aeronautical University aviation law professor Stephen Dedmon agreed that United can remove passengers from planes for many reasons. He also said the specifics of Dao’s case can currently be debated but not resolved without knowing all the specifics or legal interpretations. "It would take a court ruling to decide UA’s provisions were appropriate and properly applied," Dedmon said. Our ruling Napolitano said a United Airlines passenger forcibly removed from an airplane had "every right" to stay in his seat. Napolitano's blanket assertion is incorrect. Experts told us that airlines, including United, outline dozens of reasons why they might remove a passenger after he has already boarded. Whether the airline adhered to or executed these provisions properly is a different matter, and would have to be decided in court. Either way, you can still lose your seat once you get on the plane. We rate the statement False.	None	Andrew Napolitano	None	None	None	2017-04-14T17:30:57	2017-04-11	['United_Airlines']

pomt-14829	"The vast majority of (Syrian) refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/nov/20/carly-fiorina/fiorina-says-vast-majority-syrian-refugees-are-abl/	Carly Fiorina, in trying to position herself as "most qualified leader in foreign policy" among the Republican candidates for president, reiterated her September stand against admitting Syrian refugees to come to the United States. At a meeting with the New Hampshire Federation of Republican Women in Concord, N.H., on Nov. 17 -- following the terrorist attacks in Paris -- Fiorina questioned the demographics of those fleeing. The photos of mothers and their children provoke sympathy, she said, but they don’t show "the truth." "The vast majority of these refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work," she said at the event, which was covered by the Concord Monitor. In Concord, she didn’t specifically say Syrian refugees, but the surrounding discussion was specific to Syria. A day later, she repeated the claim on talk radio during an interview with host Mike Gallagher and specified that "the vast majority of refugees leaving Syria are able-bodied young men." That sounded like a job for PolitiFact. United Nations data Previously, PolitiFact has examined claims about Syrian refugees. In October, Donald Trump said "there aren't that many women; there aren't that many children" among Syrian refugees. We ranked that statement False. The United Nations keeps track of more than 4 million registered Syrian refugees, with an online database that includes specific demographic data. Let’s start by leaving out the other qualifiers — young and able-bodied — and look at whether the "vast majority" of refugees are men. We need not split hairs on what constitutes a "vast majority" here, since the gender breakdown is pretty evenly split; in hard numbers, the majority of refugees is actually female. Further, to look at only the male refugees – which amount to 49.7 percent of the total – less than half of that population is age 18 or older. Men ages 18 to 59 comprise about 22 percent of all Syrian refugees. Contrary to Fiorina’s statement, most refugees overall are children age 17 or younger. Resettlement Geoffrey Mock, a Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, explained the situation of Syrian refugees to PolitiFact for the similar fact-check of Trump. He said the sort of refugees Fiorina was talking about – young, able-bodied men – would be given a low priority for settling in the United States. President Obama recommended in September that the country take at least 10,000 refugees in the next fiscal year. The United Nations recommended in April that the U.S. and other industrialized countries shelter 130,000 Syrian refugees over the following two years. "The priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and teens on their own, and women and children at risk," Mock told PolitiFact. Selected refugees undergo screening by state agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. The process can take years. Our ruling Fiorina said the "vast majority of (Syrian) refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work." She repeated the essence of a claim that wasn’t accurate a month earlier and isn’t accurate today. A slight majority of Syrian refugees are female, and men age 18 to 59 comprise about 22 percent of all Syrian refugees. We rate Fiorina’s claim False.

pomt-14626	Says Barack Obama's administration has admitted that money from its Iran nuclear deal "would go directly to terrorism."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/29/ron-johnson/obama-administration-admits-cash-iran-deal-will-go/	In a 2016 U.S. Senate race that’s going negative, Russ Feingold has ripped Ron Johnson for opposing virtually any federal minimum wage (Our rating: True) and for saying he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the Veterans Administration (Our rating: Half True). But the target of the latest political missiles are Feingold, the Democrat who lost the Wisconsin Senate seat to Johnson, the Republican incumbent, in 2010. One of the attacks, which also targets President Barack Obama, was made by Johnson on Jan. 22, 2016. A Johnson campaign email, signed by a campaign staffer, starts this way, with a reference to a statement from the day before: Hey all, In light of the Obama administration admitting Thursday that money from its reckless Iran deal would go directly to terrorism, below are five crucial moments in Senator Feingold’s blind support for the deal. Johnson’s assertion -- that the administration has admitted that money from the Iran nuclear deal would go directly to terrorism -- doesn’t come out of thin air. But is it air tight? Iran nuclear deal The Iran deal was made with the United States, China and three other world powers. Iran, which was within three months of getting a nuclear bomb, committed to not pursue nuclear weapons. The deal contains other elements, but a key one is that all of the European Union and most American sanctions against Iran were lifted. Critics say that effectively amounts to a $150 billion check (though some say it’s more like $100 billion) to Iran -- a reference to the amount of Iran’s assets frozen in foreign banks. The Washington Post reported that Iran has more than $100 billion in available frozen assets — most of it in banks in China, Japan and South Korea — but that slightly less than half will more or less automatically go to preexisting debts. "How the rest is spent will reveal the direction of internal power struggles between Iranian hard-liners and pragmatists," the article said. John Kerry To back the claim about the Obama administration and funds going directly to terrorism, the Johnson campaign email links to a January 2016 news article in The Hill about comments made by Secretary of State John Kerry. Kerry had told CNBC’s "Squawk Box" that Iran would get only $55 billion of the $150 billion referenced, saying the rest is committed to China and other countries: I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. To some degree, I’m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented. But I can tell you this: Right now, we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. I’m sure at some point, some of it will. To be clear, Iran is one of only three countries (Sudan and Syria are the others) that the U.S. State Department has designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. The IRGC, as Iran’s premier security institution, fields an army, navy and air force and "presides over a vast power structure with influence over almost every aspect of Iranian life," according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the IRGC’s elite Quds Force a terrorist supporter for aiding the Taliban and other terrorist organizations. So, Kerry was saying some of the money ultimately will end up with organizations involved in terrorism. But that’s not the same as funds going directly to terrorism, as Johnson claimed. Kerry did tell reporters the same day, according to the Associated Press, that he understands the IRGC is "already complaining that they are not getting the money." But Kerry also said the Obama administration believes the amount of money that might flow to terrorist groups will be limited because "the demands of Iran and of the Rouhani administration and of the supreme leader for development in their country are such that there is no way they can succeed in doing what they want to do if they are very busy funding a lot of terrorism and if they are putting money into that kind of enterprise and not into things they need to do to fund their economy." It’s worth noting that Kerry’s comments weren’t the first of their kind. Johnson’s campaign cited to us statements made in August 2015 by senior administration officials to a U.S. Senate committee. The officials said, according to U.S. News & World Report, they were "nearly certain" Iran would continue funding terrorism with the tens of billions of dollars it stands to gain from the nuclear deal. The White House did not respond to our requests for comment. Our rating Johnson said Obama's administration has admitted that money from its Iran nuclear deal "would go directly to terrorism." Administration officials have said they expect some portion of money from the deal with Iran, which is aimed at preventing Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, will end up with groups that are labeled as terrorists. For a claim that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-01-29T05:00:00	2016-01-22	['Iran']
pomt-05068	The Supreme Court said the individual mandate "is a tax. So it's a tax."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-health-care-laws-penalty-tax/	In the days following the Supreme Court’s decision on President Barack Obama’s health care law, supporters and critics of the law sparred over the question of whether or not the individual mandate was a tax. In its 5-4 ruling upholding the mandate -- as well as most of the rest of the law itself -- the court concluded that the mandate to buy insurance was constitutional because of Congress’ taxing power. Republicans who were dejected by the law being found constitutional found a silver lining in that determination, as they proceeded to attack Obama as a tax-raiser. Meanwhile, both sides faced uncomfortable questions on whether the mandate was a tax. Critics of the law highlighted Obama’s shifting views of whether the mandate was a tax or a penalty (an issue we fact-checked here). On the other hand, Democrats noted that if the individual mandate was actually a tax, then Mitt Romney himself had also imposed a tax when he signed a health care law as governor of Massachusetts. Initially, a senior Romney aide, Eric Fehrnstrom, told MSNBC that Romney "has consistently described the mandate in Massachusetts as a penalty" -- a position at odds with many other Republicans in the wake of the ruling. But then, Romney changed course in a July 4, 2012, interview with CBS News. "Well, the Supreme Court has the final word," Romney said. "And their final word is that Obamacare is a tax. So it's a tax." We thought Romney’s comment offered us an opportunity to clear the air on this question. Did the court rule that the individual mandate was a tax, or not? We received comments from 15 constitutional law experts from across the ideological spectrum. We found a certain degree of consensus -- but also a wide range of opinions on whether Romney’s claim was worded accurately, particularly given the complexity of the court’s ruling. What the court ruled The court actually addressed two questions relevant to Romney’s claim. Before it could address whether the mandate itself was constitutional, the court had to look at another critical question -- whether a law called the Anti-Injunction Act prevented the challenge to the law from going forward in the first place. What’s the Anti-Injunction Act? It says that no tax may be challenged in court before it takes effect. Instead, a tax can be challenged only after the government begins to enforce it, with the plaintiff seeking a refund for taxes already paid. Part of deciding whether the suit against the health care law could proceed to the merits depended on the court determining whether the individual mandate is a tax. Ultimately, the court ruled that the individual mandate did not constitute a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act. But the story doesn’t end there. With that hurdle cleared, the court proceeded to the merits, ruling the individual mandate constitutional based on Congress’ taxing power. This seeming contradiction about whether it was or was not a tax is at the root of much confusion. But experts we interviewed said the distinction makes sense legally. The Anti-Injunction Act is a law, while Congress’ taxing power is enshrined in the Constitution. Because of that, the majority opinion addressed the two definitions of "tax" differently. Specifically, when addressing the Anti-Injunction Act, the court gave deference to Congress’ decision not to label the individual mandate a tax when it wrote the legislation. If Congress had wanted the law to be subject to the act, the majority concluded, it could have easily done so by calling it a tax -- but it didn’t. So the Anti-Injunction Act was no barrier to the suit proceeding. However, when the court looked at whether the mandate was constitutional, it used a more expansive definition of the word "tax" -- one that includes provisions that are not explicitly labeled taxes, but act in similar ways. In the decision, Chief Justice John Roberts explained the divergent conclusions by writing, "It is of course true that the Act describes the payment as a ‘penalty,’ not a ‘tax.’ But while that label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act … it does not determine whether the payment may be viewed as an exercise of Congress's taxing power. It is up to Congress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress's choice of label on that question. That choice does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress's constitutional power to tax." Legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. described this distinction as requiring "some fancy footwork," but he concluded that "it’s justified by the principle that the broad constitutional power of Congress to levy taxes should govern when the issue is constitutional, whereas other factors -- including whether Congress labeled something a tax -- should govern when the issue involves a law." What legal experts said Most of the legal experts we interviewed said Romney was on pretty safe legal ground. For instance: • Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute: "This is an easy one. The Supreme Court has said it’s a tax, so it’s a tax. I disagree with the Supreme Court on that point, but the Constitution says that the court’s opinion trumps mine and anyone else’s." • University of California-Davis law professor Vikram Amar: "The court said the mandate provision fell within Congress' powers to lay and collect taxes, duties … and excises -- i.e., that it fell within the federal government's power to raise revenue. It is thus a tax for purposes of how the Constitution defines a tax. And that word from the court means that no legal challenge to it on the ground that Congress lacked power to enact it will succeed." • Yale Law School professor Jack Balkin: "The Supreme Court held that the mandate is constitutional under the taxing power because it functions as a tax, regardless of what Congress calls it." Even so, we heard one main criticism from our experts -- that Romney went too far when he said that the Supreme Court ruled that the mandate is a tax. Several legal scholars told us that the court ruled that the mandate acts like a tax, or is analogous to one, but not that it is one -- a small linguistic distinction, but an important legal one. "The Supreme Court did not say, ‘It's a tax,’ but rather, ‘It does not matter if it was called a tax, because Congress could have done this in the form of a tax, which it is permitted to do,’ " said George Washington University law professor Neil Buchanan, who blogged about the decision. As evidence, Buchanan pointed to several passages in Roberts’ ruling. For instance, Roberts wrote that the payment for not having insurance "may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax, not a penalty." Buchanan noted Roberts’ use of the restrictive phrase "for constitutional purposes." Buchanan noted that Roberts at one point also distinguished between interpreting something to be a tax for constitutional purposes and imposing a tax. It’s also worth pointing out that in two of Roberts’ key concluding paragraphs, he wrote that the act’s "requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax," and that "it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health insurance. Such legislation is within Congress's power to tax." Guy-Uriel Charles, a Duke University law professor, was one of several experts who agreed with Buchanan that the Supreme Court did not technically label the provision a tax. "The Court said that the mandate is consistent with Congress' exercise of the taxing power, which is different from saying that the mandate is a tax," Charles said. "What Romney said is accurate on the political level, but not on the legal level," said Steven Schwinn, a law professor at John Marshall Law School in Chicago. Our ruling Romney said, "The Supreme Court has the final word. And their final word is that Obamacare is a tax. So it's a tax." If you put Romney’s comment under a legal microscope, there’s a strong case that he’s cut some rhetorical corners. The Supreme Court found the law constitutional based on Congress’ taxing authority, but nowhere in the opinion did Roberts say that the individual mandate actually was a tax -- only that it "may reasonably be characterized as a tax" and that "it is reasonable to construe" it as a tax. Still, PolitiFact focuses on political speech, rather than legal speech, and judged by that standard Romney is pretty close to accurate. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00591	A measure to repeal the state’s prevailing wage law would "make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers for Wisconsin construction jobs" through an "illegal worker loophole in the state budget."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/05/protect-american-jobs/group-claims-repeal-prevailing-wage-would-open-ill/	The state’s prevailing wage law, in place for 84 years, sets a minimum wage for construction workers involved with publicly funded projects. Critics say the law artificially inflates wages and raises the cost of projects, meaning taxpayers pay more. Supporters say the law ensures quality work and fair pay for workers. The Assembly Labor Committee voted 5-4 on May 27, 2015 to advance a measure that would repeal the law. Through a spokeswoman, Gov. Scott Walker said he would sign a bill repealing or amending the law. But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos says he has no plans to schedule a vote. Meanwhile, a group calling itself Protect American jobs has launched a television ad that warns of unintended consequences if the prevailing wage law is changed. "Wisconsin worksites could soon be taken over with illegal workers," the announcer intones. "Politicians in Madison are about to weaken the law to make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers for Wisconsin construction jobs." The ad goes on to urges viewers to contact Walker and tell him "no to the illegal worker loophole in the state budget." Wait. Illegal workers? Before the ad started running, no one was talking about that issue. Would the prevailing wage measure "make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers"? Illegal workers Let’s start with the most basic problem: The ad says the measure is in the state budget. But the move to repeal prevailing wage has been introduced as a separate piece of legislation, not as part of the 2015-’17 spending plan. On the substance of the claim, we tried to reach the group, but did not get a response, so we turned to the ad itself and the group’s website. In the ad, a caption on the screen cites "ABC/ACG policy letter: 3/13/2013" during one mention of illegal workers. That appears to be a letter urging immigration law reform that was sent to members of Congress by a group that called itself a "broad base of contractors" that employ "thousands in all facets of construction." The letter says that "any future immigration law must include a new market driven program to provide a legal path for foreign workers to enter the United States when the economy needs them, with fewer entering when the U.S. economy contracts." OK, but that refers to legal immigration. And the letter came years before this prevailing wage measure was introduced. The Protect American Jobs web site goes further, suggesting the "real motivation" for the prevailing wage repeal can be found in a different letter from an executive with the Associated Building Contractors, a non-union group. That letter cited the need to "make it easier for people to move to the United States from other countries and work in the construction industry." Again, that refers to legal immigration. The group also refers to an April 2015 paper by University of Utah economist Peter Philips -- written at the request of the Wisconsin Contractors Coalition -- that notes the end of prevailing wage laws would lead to lower pay and less apprentice training. The paper goes on to say that other states where such laws have been repealed have seen a call for guest workers, because when wages fell contractors had trouble attracting workers. But a guest worker program does not amount to illegal workers. By its very definition, guest workers are in the United States legally. What’s more, the television ad doesn’t say there could be such problems down the road. It says the proposed bill, as written, contains an "illegal worker loophole." For that, we turned to the Wisconsin Legislative Council, which issued a May 26, 2015 memo that said flatly the proposed bill doesn’t address immigration. The council assists members of both parties with the drafting of legislation. "While the bill removes the requirement for employers to maintain certain records concerning wages paid to workers on a project of public works, that requirement relates only to enforcement of the prevailing wage law by the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT)," the memo reads. "The repeal of that record -keeping requirement does not affect enforcement of federal immigration laws by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security." Our rating A television ad from a group against repeal of the state’s prevailing wage law says such a measure would "make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers for Wisconsin construction jobs." This "illegal worker loophole," it says, is in the state budget. But the bill doesn’t have any direct impact on immigration laws and the group’s own references to potential problems -- down the road -- describe workers who would be here legally, not illegally. It also fails on the basic claim of the stand-alone measure being in the state budget. We rate the claim False.	None	Protect American Jobs	None	None	None	2015-06-05T05:00:00	2015-05-05	['Wisconsin']
pomt-10040	"When the salmonella source was finally identified, FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the [peanut] recall."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/19/rosa-delauro/congresswoman-portrait-toothless-fda-accurate-thou/	Is our food-safety system really that weak? We realized the recent outbreak of salmonella poisoning from peanut products exposed serious problems with food manufacturing and plant inspections. But Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, alleged it also exposed the federal Food and Drug Administration as toothless when it comes to recalls. "When the salmonella source was finally identified, FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the recall," the congresswoman said at a Feb. 4, 2009, news conference. DeLauro was speaking amid great public concern about the outbreak, which was discovered in January 2009 after it killed eight people and sickened more than 500 in 43 states. It was traced to tainted peanut butter and paste from a Peanut Corporation of America plant in Georgia and possibly another in Texas. Those ingredients had been distributed nationwide in all sorts of products, prompting recalls of more than 2,100 products from energy bars to ice cream. DeLauro's comment evoked an image of FDA officials meekly asking company executives if it was okay to protect the public from tainted peanuts. We wondered whether she was stretching the truth to drum up support for a bill she proposed to strengthen the FDA's recall process. A spokeswoman said DeLauro was referring to the voluntary nature of food recalls. And indeed, the FDA recall process is almost entirely voluntary — strictly speaking. This is poorly understood by consumers, the media and even some food companies, the FDA says in this primer on its recall policies. "The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not generally authorize FDA to 'order' a manufacturer to recall a food, cosmetic or supplement," the online brochure says. Only when it comes to medical devices, human-tissue products and infant formula can the agency order a recall. DeLauro's office said she got her information partly from this New York Times article , which reported that the government "needed the company’s permission last week before announcing a huge recall of its products." There's an important bit of context to add, though. In reality, companies do not generally refuse FDA requests to issue a recall. In fact, none has ever done so, at least in the memory of Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. "I don't think there's ever been a case to my knowledge where a company has refused to recall products when we told them in very specific terms that we would be taking additional actions," Sundlof told a Senate committee in a Feb. 5, 2009, hearing on the salmonella outbreak. Additional actions the FDA can take against any company that refuses to recall food can include seizing products and enjoining the company from doing further business. Bill Marler, a personal injury lawyer who specializes in foodborne illnesses, concurred with Sundlof. He said companies have little motivation to refuse the agency's recall requests, or even delay the process, because doing so would expose them to more legal liability. "In my experience, there is very seldom a delay, because most of the time you've got a company who wants to solve the problem and not poison any more of its customers than it already has," said Marler, who is based in Seattle. Plenty of food-safety advocates argue the FDA should have the authority to mandate recalls. But their main concern is not that companies refuse to issue recalls voluntarily, it's issues such as FDA's limited control over how aggressively to recover products, and that "voluntary recalls" might not sound serious enough to consumers. DeLauro arguably made our food-safety regime sound weaker than it is, since there is little question as a practical matter that companies will quickly agree to recalls. And it was imprecise for her to say the FDA waited for the company's approval to "go live" with the recall — the FDA did not "go live" with the recall at all; it was the company that issued it. But "go live" is a vague term, and DeLauro seems to have meant "announce." And it's true that the FDA could not post on its Web site this press release announcing the recall, which came from the Peanut Corporation of America, until the company agreed to issue the recall and wrote the release. So while DeLauro's depiction of the recall process was not full and complete, it was technically accurate. We find her claim to be True.

pomt-01153	A bill from U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho attempts to restrict the administration's ability to conduct national security and criminal background checks on undocumented immigrants.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/dec/16/barack-obama/does-yohos-bill-restrict-background-checks-immigra/	House Republicans are so displeased with President Barack Obama’s executive action granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants, they voted to strip White House authority over the matter altogether. U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a veterinarian from Gainesville, introduced HR 5759 on Nov. 20, the same day Obama issued guidelines sparing from deportation more than 4 million immigrants who have been in the country illegally for five years or more but have American-born or legal-resident children. Obama’s action lets those immigrants stay for three years and allows them to apply for work permits if they pay fees and pass a background check. Yoho’s bill, which passed the House along party lines on Dec. 4, sought to stop Obama by taking away the president’s right to act unilaterally on immigration, making such actions illegal. It has widely been viewed as a symbolic gesture, and the Democrat-controlled Senate didn’t vote on it before the end of the session, so the bill died. But wait: Yoho’s office told PolitiFact the congressman would reintroduce the bill next session -- when Republicans control both houses of Congress. The White House said even if the bill had managed to pass the Senate, Obama would have vetoed it, since the measure "would make the broken immigration system worse, not better," according to a statement of administration policy released the day the House approved the bill. "By attempting to restrict the Administration’s ability to conduct national security and criminal background checks on undocumented immigrants, H.R. 5759 would make the Nation’s communities less safe." Since Yoho said the bill would be coming back, we wondered if the legislation would restrict the White House’s ability to conduct security and background checks. Checking the background H.R. 5759 keeps the executive branch from doing anything to exempt or defer any individual or groups from being subject to current immigration laws. "Any action by the executive branch with the purpose of circumventing the objectives of this statute shall be null and void and without legal effect," the bill says. That’s a tall order: Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., recently said presidents going back to Dwight Eisenhower have issued executive actions on immigration, a claim we found Mostly True. Prior executive actions on immigration have provided asylum to specific groups, deferred removals from the United States and expanded the definitions of immigration laws to include more immigrants than originally covered. (H.R. 5759 would allow action that would save groups facing mortal danger, like refugees, or to keep criminal aliens or witnesses in the country at the request of law enforcement.) The White House told PolitiFact Florida that Obama’s action requires about 4 million eligible undocumented immigrants to register and undergo checks by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The checks would determine if someone is a threat to national security or public safety, has a criminal history or has perpetrated fraud, among other flags. Homeland Security didn’t answer our questions about how the order would affect their current workload, but Boynton Beach immigration attorney Richard Hujber said it will lead to a crush of cases in an already backlogged system. The agency has to perform background checks for everything the government processes, he said, whether it’s for a work permit, a travel permit, a citizenship application or anything else. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted about 1,000 job openings the day after Obama’s announcement. About 95 percent of Citizenship and Immigration Services budget comes from fees the immigrants pay. Yoho’s office countered that Homeland Security would still have the power to perform background checks as usual. "The congressman’s bill simply clarifies that the president does not have authority to exempt/defer deportation for categories of illegal aliens; because that would in effect be changing or rewriting law, which is a constitutional power of Congress, not the executive," Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told us in an email. So it’s not that background checks wouldn’t be performed anymore; they couldn’t be performed as part of the executive action’s guidelines because the president’s deferment would no longer be allowed. Mark Schlakman, a law professor and senior program director for Florida State University’s Center for the Advancement of Human Rights, was dubious about whether public safety would be any more endangered by not performing these checks. It’s hard to make that case when these immigrants weren’t previously going to submit to background checks anyway, he said. "These people, for better or worse, no matter what side of the issue you come down on, they’re already here." Our ruling President Obama’s office said Yoho's HR 5759 attempts "to restrict the Administration's ability to conduct national security and criminal background checks on undocumented immigrants." The bill would make illegal any move from the White House that reclassified large categories of immigrants counter to current immigration law. Obama’s action establishes reprieve from removal after undocumented immigrants passed a background check, which would likely strain an already backlogged system. It ostensibly follows current laws as guidelines. But because Obama's action defers the status of the immigrants, the process it proposes to set up would violate the terms of Yoho’s bill. The Department of Homeland Security would continue to be able to perform checks as usual, so there’s little evidence public safety would be any more threatened than before.

pomt-02159	"In states where beer is unregulated, the per capita production is significantly higher."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/may/01/kelli-stargel/states-where-beer-unregulated-capita-production-si/	State Sen. Kelli Stargel thinks Florida’s beer regulations are too lax, and that means trouble’s brewing. Florida craft beer makers are hopping mad about SB 1714, a bill that would require craft brewers at a certain sales level to use distributors to sell their wares, changing the current rules where they can sell directly to consumers. Lakeland Republican Stargel attempted to quench the mounting criticism by writing an editorial April 28 in the Tallahassee Democrat, lamenting that "a small but vocal faction of the beer industry that has clouded this issue by promulgating misinformation." Measures like her bill are necessary, she argued, because unfettered beer production is a looming evil. "In states where beer is unregulated, the per capita production is significantly higher," she wrote. "Higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand. As a social conservative, this is why I believe we need to keep regulations on alcoholic beverages in place and not have unregulated beer widely available in the marketplace. Social issues greatly impact economic issues, and we must seek a balance on both." We’ll deal with whether higher beer production increases consumption in another factcheck, but first we wanted to see if a lack of state regulations leads to higher beer production. We’re going to tap the industry experts on this one. The three tiers The version of SB 1714 that passed Tuesday requires microbreweries selling more than 2,000 kegs that exceed 20 percent of their sales in take-home consumption to sell their product to distributors. (An amendment added on April 28 allows larger craft brewers to self-distribute up to 20 percent of their product through bottles and cans.) Brewers would then have to buy it back at the distributors’ marked-up prices. Stargel argues that this practice is simply following the rules of the three-tier system that brewers have used since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. This system, which is regulated to varying degrees by the states, breaks up the alcohol-making business (beer, wine and liquor) into three categories: The supplier: The brewer who makes the beer; The wholesaler: The distributor who sells the beer to a bar, restaurant or other business; The retailer: The business that buys the beer from the wholesaler. Craft brewers in Florida complain the system will force them to cut jobs to account for the added cost. Some have even implied they may have to close up forever. Joey Redner, founder of Tampa’s Cigar City Brewing, has said he may move his 100,000 keg per year business out of state if the measure becomes law. Critics also complain the bill is the result of "crony capitalism," with many legislators who support the bill getting campaign contributions from distributors. The Tampa Bay Times reported Stargel collected at least $6,000 from beer distributors since late 2013 for her 2016 Senate re-election race -- about 12 percent of her total. They gave her $500 in 2012, when she wasn’t sponsoring a bill regulating alcohol distribution. Regulation vs. production Stargel’s office said her comments came from Redner’s take on the bill. Redner wrote that an analysis by the Brewers Association, a trade group comprised of mostly small brewers and associated workers, including wholesalers, "shows a very strong link between less regulation of access to market for breweries and the total number of breweries and barrels of beer produced by those breweries." Bart Watson, the staff economist with the group that wrote the analysis, says there’s no such thing as a state where beer is unregulated. He suggested Stargel may have meant states where regulations are more favorable for large or small brewers. Even then, beer is highly regulated. Watson said it appeared states with favorable regulation of small breweries did lead to more production from those breweries. But the opposite could be true, as well -- higher brewery production could just as easily drive favorable regulation, he said. Either way, craft brewing (especially in Florida) doesn’t have a big enough impact to really affect total production. Another way to consider the issue is whether states with high levels of production from large brewery plants are hampered by strict regulations. He singled out Georgia and Florida as examples of highly regulated states, but still being among the top beer producers thanks to large brewing operations. Florida was third in total beer shipments in 2012; Georgia was 10th. "General business environment and location relative to the U.S. population are probably better indicators of overall production levels in a state than regulations on small breweries," Watson said. State laws allow all manner of exceptions to the three-tier system; ,ost states let small breweries self-distribute in some capacity. The Beer Industry of Florida, a trade association "dedicated to promoting the responsible consumption of alcohol and the preservation of the three-tier system of alcohol distribution and regulation," did not offer any comment on Stargel’s view. The group did send out a press release on April 25 saying they didn’t support the proposed legislation because it hadn’t allowed for 64-ounce growlers (essentially large bottles favored by consumers), a provision Stargel added three days later. The bill is currently awaiting discussion in the House. Our ruling Stargell said in her editorial that "in states where beer is unregulated, the per capita production is significantly higher." Her office credited Redner, an opponent of the bill, as the source of the line. Redner was referring to an analysis by an economist for a brewers trade group who said favorable regulation led to higher production from craft breweries. The statement is inaccurate in that beer is regulated in every state, although to varying degrees. It also doesn’t specify craft brewing. In fact, the analysis found there didn’t seem to be much of a link between state regulation and total production from both large and small breweries. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-08913	Rob Portman’s "plan to tax, slash and privatize" Social Security "would devastate Ohioans."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/28/lee-fisher/fisher-campaign-claims-portmans-plan-tax-slash-and/	Step on the third rail of American politics and you’ll get scorched by angry retirees. That adage about Social Security comes from the 1980s, but politicians like Ohio’s Lee Fisher are testing it against opponents today. Fisher’s campaign seeks to singe Rob Portman, the rival running for U.S. Senate, for efforts to partially privatize Social Security in the past, and for potential Social Security benefit cuts and tax hikes in the future. In a July 12 news release, Fisher spokesman John Collins said: "Seniors depend on a guaranteed monthly Social Security benefit -- especially in these tough times. Congressman Portman's plan to tax, slash and privatize these benefits would devastate Ohioans. Pure and simple." Pure and simple, it sounds scary. But is it true? To support its claim, the Fisher campaign cited a Columbus Dispatch story in which Portman said he would look at "everything on the table" when considering how to deal with looming problems for entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, "including at least a discussion of possible tax increases and benefit cuts." And Fisher’s news release said that while in Congress, Portman was "an outspoken advocate for privatizing Social Security -- a plan which would have left Ohio's seniors devastated during this recent economic downturn." Asked to back up the claim further, Fisher’s campaign cited statements, TV and Web interviews, congressional hearings, and news articles from when Portman, a Cincinnati-area Republican, served in the House of Representatives and worked as President George W. Bush’s budget director. It is indisputable that Portman supported Bush’s proposal to allow Americans to put part of their Social Security contributions into private accounts. Americans would be able to invest in stocks, bonds, government securities or stay out of the accounts entirely. "I mean, this is what Einstein talked about, the magic, the greatest force in the universe, the power of compounding interest," Portman, then a congressman, said in a House Budget Committee hearing in 2005. "That's what we're talking about here." It’s easy today to see how badly a Wall Street downturn would affect that magic in the short term. But that oversimplifies the case. Bush and congressional Republicans made their strongest push for privatization – they preferred to refer to it as private accounts – in 2005 but did not intend for such a program to start right away. Portman noted at a news conference in early 2007, when he was Bush’s budget director, that the president had already pushed back the proposed start date to 2010, and then in 2007 he pushed it back again to 2012. At the time, Portman said the accounts would be strictly voluntary and comprise only a portion of anyone’s Social Security savings. Furthermore, Portman said in 1999, when the subject was in its incubation phase, that "there must be a safety net for everybody so that no one’s Social Security benefits would be reduced." This might have required a taxpayer bailout if stock market losses packed a wallop, but that’s not the issue here. Still, Portman was unquestionably a privatization champion, saying in 2005 that it was reasonable to expect a 5 percent annual return on investment, "which I think is conservative." But that’s not the same as having a current "plan to tax, slash and privatize these benefits," as the Fisher campaign suggests Portman has now. Asked about any such plan, the Portman campaign said it hasn’t developed one. Portman has only said that everything must be on the table when discussing entitlement reform. That could put Portman at odds with AARP, which says that solutions must not come at the expense of "today's seniors and future generations." But it puts Portman on the same page as President Barack Obama , who said in April when naming a commission to address this nation’s debt: "Everything has to be on the table." Collins, the Fisher spokesman, suggests this is a cop-out for Portman because right out of the gate, Portman includes the potential of tax increases, benefit cuts, or both. "His plan includes an open discussion of taxing and slashing benefits," Collins said. "And our plan would not start with that. We would not consider that." Portman has in fact said that Social Security’s solvency might require pain, although he viewed private accounts as better alternative. Otherwise, he said in 2005, "We're going to have to raise taxes, we're going to have to borrow, we're going to have to cut benefits -- we're going to have to do something." In an interview with Human Events Online, Portman later said that private accounts would over the long term "deal with the solvency issue." That was then, this is now -- and Portman has not mentioned private accounts in a long time or talked about whether his views have changed. He only says that with deficit, debt and entitlement problems growing, the nation needs a serious discussion. To get everyone to the table, says his spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, Portman believes that no possible solutions should be eliminated out of hand. As for the possible fears of seniors or anyone hoping to retire, she notes that as a congressman, Portman voted in 2000 to reduce the percentage of Social Security benefits subject to taxes. He voted in 1995 to repeal a tax increase on Social Security benefits. And he voted in 1996 to allow beneficiaries to earn more outside income without losing their Social Security benefits. The claim against Portman has a substantial short-coming. Agreeing to hear others out is not the same as agreeing to "slash" or "tax." And favoring privatization before, in a dramatically different economic climate, is not the same as pushing for it now. It would be credible to cite Portman’s past actions and question what he might do now. But in saying that Portman has a plan to do so, the claim becomes Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12277	"I have seen crime increase in every major metropolitan area (in California) … Crime is on the rise in every major market."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/jul/03/travis-allen/travis-allens-mostly-false-claim-about-crime-calif/	"California Must Get Tough On Crime." That’s the message Travis Allen has proclaimed early in his campaign for governor, both on his website and in a video announcing his run. The Republican state assemblyman from Orange County announced his campaign for the high office on June 22, 2017. His website says "California must re-establish our tough on crime policies that allow law enforcement to do their jobs and protect the victims of crimes, not the criminals." With Allen’s focus on crime, we decided to probe a related statement he made in the video launching his campaign. "California needs a new vision. California needs new leadership … I have seen crime increase in every major metropolitan area," Allen said, adding a moment later: "Crime is on the rise in every major market." Allen makes his claim at about the 0:15 minute mark of the video above. Was Allen right? Has crime really increased in all California metros? And is it "on the rise" in every major market as he claimed? We set out on a fact check. Our research We asked Allen’s campaign spokeswoman for evidence to support his claim. She pointed us to several news articles that describe increases in crime from 2014 to 2015, both statewide and in large cities. They cite FBI data. Allen’s claim in the video doesn’t cite a specific timeframe for when he’s "seen crime increase." He does, however, attribute the uptick to criminal justice reforms passed since 2011, giving the impression that this has been a recent increase. Crime data is widely available for cities, counties and states but less so for metropolitan areas. As a result, we focused on crime in large cities and counties. The nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California has examined recent crime trends. It and other research groups have noted that 2014 was a historic low for crime in California. A PPIC analysis comparing the first half of 2014 to the same period in 2015 found widespread increases in crime rates in California cities with a population greater than 100,000. Of the 66 California cities that size, 49 saw an increase in violent crime and 48 experienced increases in property crime. Many saw double digit percent increases. "A majority of cities saw increases in crime, but not every city," said Brandon Martin, who researches crime trends for PPIC, who co-authored the report. In a later report comparing the full year 2014 to 2015, the PPIC found 13 of the state’s 15 largest counties saw increases in both property and violent crime rates. Cherry-picked data? Taken alone, the crime increases in 2015 mostly support Allen’s claims. But researchers, including Martin, emphasized that California has seen dramatic long-term crime reductions since the 1990s. Allen’s statement omits this key context. SOURCE: Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, "Urban Crime Trends Remain Stable Through California’s Policy Reform Era (2010-2016)," February 2017. Mike Males is a senior researcher at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a policy research group that makes recommendations on alternatives to incarceration. He said citing the increases in 2015 amounts to "cherry picking." In a February 2017 report, Males examined more recent figures that show total crime -- or the raw number of property and violent crimes -- decreased in 41 of California’s largest 69 cities from the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015. That contradicts the portion of Allen’s statement that says "Crime is on the rise in every major market." Males described Allen’s overall statement as "completely wrong," adding, "certainly crime is not up in every major market." Overall, Males’ report found total urban crime fell 3 percent in the first half of 2016, driven largely by the decrease in property crimes. His report shows more mixed results, however, when separating the rate of violent and property crimes. A majority of the major cities saw increased violent crime rates during the more recent period, while a majority saw declines in property crime rates. Related fact check In March 2017, PolitiFact California rated Half True a related statement by State Sen. Jeff Stone. The Riverside County Republican claimed violent crime in California had been on the rise since 2011, when the state started passing major criminal justice reforms. He added that violent crime had spiked 12 percent statewide in 2015. We found the violent crime rate had ticked up about 3 percent between 2011 and 2015. But that increase wasn’t consistent year-to-year. It went up slightly in 2012, dropped the next two years and then went up again in 2015. Our ruling Republican candidate for California governor Travis Allen recently claimed he’s "seen crime increase in every major metropolitan area" and that "Crime is on the rise in every major market." Allen’s claim is partially correct looking at 2015 alone. A majority of the state’s largest cities and counties saw crime ratchet up that year -- though not all of them. But Allen’s overall assertion ignores the fact that California’s crime rate was at a historic low the year prior, the result of a decades-long decline. Additionally, the second portion of his statement, that "crime is on the rise in every major market" is contradicted by a 2017 analysis that shows total urban crime fell 3 percent in the first half of 2016 compared with the first half of 2015. In the end, we found Allen’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-04464	President Barack Obama’s "spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/09/american-crossroads/ad-says-barack-obamas-spending-drove-us-5-trillion/	In a new ad, the pro-Republican group American Crossroads takes aim at President Barack Obama’s economic policies. At one point, the narrator says, that "Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt." We previously examined a similar -- but opposite claim -- when Obama said that "over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of" President George W. Bush’s policies and the recession. We ruled Obama’s claim False, and a recalculation of the same numbers can shed some light on the American Crossroads claim as well. We contacted American Crossroads for this fact-check, but a spokesman did not respond to our inquiry. First, the bottom-line number on the debt: Yes, it has grown by $5 trillion during Obama’s tenure. Total debt has increased by $5.5 trillion since January 20, 2009, while the share of that debt held by the public has increased by $5 trillion. But it’s not entirely correct to hang that increase on "Obama’s spending" alone. In our previous item, we looked at calculations by the Treasury Department based on data from the Congressional Budget Office, the independent number-crunching arm of Congress. To figure out what caused the accumulation of deficits over the past decade, CBO tracked the surplus it had projected back in 2001 and compared it with the actual cumulative deficits that resulted instead. CBO specifically broke out how much several laws contributed to the deficit, some of which started under Bush and some under Obama. Because American Crossroads was only referring to the debt added during Obama’s tenure, we only looked at fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. And because the American Crossroads ad does not reference how much the deficits fell below the surpluses that had been forecast by CBO, we’re going to exclude from our calculations a category CBO called its own "failures to predict economic conditions accurately." We added up the lost revenue and additional spending each year and then calculated their percentage of the deficits over those three years. Spending Spending initiated by Bush policies: 4 percent of total deficits in 2009, 2010 and 2011 Spending initiated by Obama policies: 11 percent Other increases in discretionary spending: 32 percent Other increases in mandatory spending: 6 percent Revenue reductions Revenue reductions initiated by Bush policies: 11 percent Revenue reductions initiated by Obama policies: 13 percent Other unclassified revenue reductions: 5 percent Interest Net interest: 19 percent The spending increases traceable to programs clearly attributable to Obama, combined with the increase in discretionary spending on his watch, account for about 43 percent of the three years worth of deficits. So if you’re talking about what "drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt," then a clear majority stemmed from sources other than "Obama’s spending." If you expand the definition from "Obama’s spending" to "Obama’s spending and tax cuts," you get to a total of 56 percent. Throw in 13 percentage points for the added interest costs of Obama’s policies and you’re at 69 percent. Our ruling The American Crossroads ad claims that "Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt." But not all of the $5 trillion can be attributed to Obama's spending. Much of it can be attributed to his tax cuts and the policies of President Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-01133	The United States "decided waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents in the Philippine revolution."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/23/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-us-soldiers-have-been-/	The so-called "CIA torture report" has heightened debate over whether certain interrogation techniques used by the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks constituted torture. Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse weighed in on Dec. 14 when he appeared on "Fox News Sunday" with host Chris Wallace and political consultant Karl Rove. In the portion of the program that dealt with whether waterboarding, which simulates the feeling of drowning, constitutes torture, Whitehouse said there was precedent in the United States to conclude that it was. "We decided that waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents during the Philippine revolution," Whitehouse said. "We decided waterboarding was torture when we prosecuted Japanese soldiers as war criminals for waterboarding Americans during World War II, and we decided waterboarding was torture when the American court system described waterboarding as torture when Ronald Reagan and his Department of Justice prosecuted a Texas sheriff and several of his associates for waterboarding detainees." Because the Philippine revolution, which dates back to the 1890s, is the earliest reference Whitehouse made, we decided to check out that part of his statement. While we were waiting for Whitehouse's office to respond to our request for documentation, we started poking around ourselves. There's little doubt that what is now called waterboarding -- then known as water torture or by the odd name of the "water cure" -- was used by Americans in the Philippines after the U.S. gained colonial authority over the islands from the Spanish in 1898 under the terms of the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War. Filipinos had been recruited to help fight the Spanish but when the Spanish were vanquished, the Filipinos tried to gain their independence. The resulting guerilla war had some things in common with the U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, complete with boobytraps, suspicions that all Filipinos were guerrilla fighters, and the depiction of the guerillas as treacherous fanatics. Most accounts we found report that an infantry captain named Edwin F. Glenn was found guilty of engaging in water torture during the war. Glenn was a judge advocate at the time he was involved in waterboarding. By the time he was court-martialed, he had been promoted to major. He was specifically charged with administering the "water cure" to a prominent Philippine resident named Tobeniano Ealdama, whom he suspected of collaborating with insurgents. Whitehouse's office cited a detailed 1903 Senate report on courts-martial in the Philippines. The section on Glenn accuses him of carrying out "a method of punishment commonly known in the Philippine Islands as the 'water cure;' that is, did cause water to be introduced into the mouth and stomach of the said Ealdama against his will" around Nov. 27, 1900. Glenn admitted to the practice but defended it, arguing -- as waterboarding supporters do today -- that it saved lives. A military court didn't think that was sufficient justification. He was found guilty. But his sentence was light -- a one-month suspension and a $50 fine, which was the equivalent to more than $1,200 today. Glenn wasn't the only soldier to be court-martialed for administering the "water cure," and testimony in the Senate report makes it clear that this was frequently used to extract information. First Lt. Julien E. Gaujot, of the 10th U.S. Cavalry, was found guilty of doing it to three priests in January, 1902. He was suspended from command for three months, forfeiting $50 in pay per month for that period. The military court made it clear that, in the cases of both men, the court was being lenient. Like Glenn, Gaujot admitted using water torture, saying he did it because he knew the priests were insurgents and "I knew that they possessed information that would be valuable to the American cause." "It was impossible to obtain reliable information regarding the insurgents from the inhabitants, who are, as a whole, crafty, lying, and treacherous, many of them being fanatical savages who respect no laws and whose every instinct is depraved," Glenn told the court. Not all of the courts-martial were successful. For example, 1st Lt. Edwin A. Hickman of the First U.S. Cavalry was brought up on charges for ordering that two Filipinos be held upside down and the upper half of their bodies dunked in an open spring to extract information and to get the men to act as guides. He admitted doing it but argued that it wasn't unlawful. The court acquitted Hickman because of "the abnormal and disgraceful methods of armed resistance to the authority of the United States; the treachery of the natives generally; the paramount necessity of obtaining information, and the belief on the part of the accused that the punishment administered was within the rules of war and under the instructions of superior military authority." In these cases, Judge Advocate General George B. Davis said General Order #100, which dated back to 1863, "contains the requirement that military necessity does not admit of cruelty -- that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge -- nor of maiming or wounding except in fight, nor of torture to extort confessions." In these cases, there was no emergency that required torture, Davis argued. One might debate whether the "water cure" is the same as waterboarding. In both cases, the victim is lying down and restrained. With waterboarding, the face is sometimes covered by a towel with the body tilted to try to keep water in the upper airways and out of the lungs. With the water cure, water went directly into the mouth and was forced into the stomach, causing a great deal of pain. In both instances, the goal is not to drown the victim, but to make things as unpleasant as possible. Both produce the sensation of being unable to breathe. Even if the water doesn't get into the lungs directly, the victim may vomit and inhale the vomit, which can be fatal. The water cure was clearly effective in inducing fear. According to accounts in the Senate report, just the threat of repeating "the water cure" could be enough to break the will of recalcitrant Filipinos. "At a minimum, the techniques are substantially similar," said Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said the United States "decided waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents in the Philippine revolution." The "water cure" as performed in the Philippines is not significantly different from the waterboarding done in reaction to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Both forms of water torture -- and the risks -- are similar and the Senate report from 1903 makes it clear that military prosecutors regarded the "water cure" as a form of torture. We rate the claim as True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-08374	Says he "voted no on the Wall Street bailouts."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/25/glenn-nye/glenn-nye-claims-he-voted-against-wall-street-bail/	U.S. Rep Glenn Nye portrays himself as a boldly independent Democrat who bucks his party on key issues such as health-care reform and the Wall Street bailout. In at least four TV ads, the freshman congressman from Virginia Beach and Norfolk has stressed he voted against the bank bailout, which is formally known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. "I stood up to my party leaders and voted no on the Wall Street bailouts," Nye said in one ad. (To emphasize his theme, he titled the ad "Independence.") But there’s a big problem with his claim: Nye was not a member of Congress when TARP was approved. The final House vote approving TARP came Oct. 3, 2008 -- 32 days before Nye was elected and 95 days before he took office. The bill set up a $700 billion bailout fund for banks that had made bad investments. President George W. Bush quickly signed the bill to avert what many feared could be a doomsday economic collapse. Although the TARP was intended to rescue the financial industry, the Bush administration in December 2008 broadened its reach to allow an infusion of money for U.S. auto companies. Nye has received considerable flak for the claim. So how can he say he voted against the TARP? He cites two votes cast during his first weeks in office. One of the votes was on Jan. 14, 2009. But when we looked into it, we learned the vote did not concern the life or death of TARP. Nye simply opposed a procedural resolution to allow debate on a bill that would impose tough new restrictions on how companies could spend TARP money. Procedural resolutions are pretty routine and it’s clear this was not considered a significant vote. For example, we couldn’t find stories about it the following day’s editions of the New York Times or the Washington Post. The House passed the resolution largely along party lines. Nye did buck his party leaders on that vote because they wanted the debate to proceed. He was one of only 15 Democrats who voted against their party. But we find it’s not accurate for him to characterize that as a vote "against the bailout." The other vote he cites was January 22, 2009, on a bill to give the treasury secretary access to the second half of the $700 billion in TARP money. The law had said the second $350 billion would become available only if the administration asked for it and at least one chamber of Congress approved. But that vote was essentially meaningless. The Senate had approved the request on Jan. 15, freeing the money to go to the Treasury. The Republican-sponsored resolution had no impact on events; it was the equivalent of a coach challenging a referee’s call a week after the game ended. Still, Nye was among 99 who supported the GOP resolution. So Nye says he voted against the bailout. People hearing his claim would undoubtedly think he was referring to the main vote on the TARP, but he wasn’t even elected when that vote was taken. He cites one vote on a procedural motion that was not substantive and that the news media did not characterize as significant, and another vote that was more substantive, although the issue was moot at that point.

pomt-01716	"All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/aug/07/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-all-aboard-100-private-venture-and/	Gov. Rick Scott has been on the defense for months about All Aboard Florida, a controversial passenger rail project that he supports. All Aboard Florida will run from Miami to West Palm Beach in 2016 and could extend to Orlando the following year. The project has faced opposition from some residents on the Treasure Coast, who fear noise and other impacts. And as he campaigns for re-election, Scott has faced heat for the role of his chief of staff, who previously worked for All Aboard’s parent company. A key point of contention has been about the role of public dollars in the project. In an interview with the West Palm Beach TV station WPEC June 30, Scott said: "All Aboard is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved." Scott made similar claims in June in a letter to the editor in the Tampa Bay Times and at a campaign event in Largo in July. His description of the "100 percent private venture" prompted an outcry from the Florida Democratic Party and opponents of the project. Media reports have also outlined the public funding -- and potential public funding -- associated with the project. Earl Barrett of Clearwater wrote a letter to the editor of the Tampa Bay Times in June seeking some clarity: "A PolitiFact check seems in order." Meanwhile, Scott’s likely nemesis on the November ballot, former Gov. Charlie Crist, made a claim that contradicted Scott’s assertion. "All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars," Crist wrote in a July fundraising email. As the All Aboard controversy moved full steam ahead in August, we decided it was time for us to subject Scott’s and Crist’s statements to our Truth-O-Meter. What we found is that All Aboard Florida is a private enterprise, but it also takes advantage of infrastructure paid for by the government. So neither Crist nor Scott is telling the full story. Here, we’ll look in depth at Scott’s statement that All Aboard is "100 percent private" with "no state money involved." Scott has been asked why he rejected federal funds for high-speed rail in 2011 but now has shown support for All Aboard Florida. Republican Party of Florida Communications Director Susan Hepworth said in statements earlier this summer that the financing was vastly different: "The proposed high-speed rail would have wasted millions of Florida taxpayer dollars by leaving the state on the hook for an unprofitable project. A private sector project — of any kind — not run on state funding obviously doesn’t have the same risks. Anyone saying these two issues are the same is being intentionally dishonest." In 2011, PolitiFact Florida fact-checked Scott’s claim that high-speed rail would have cost Florida $1 billion. The state’s portion of the project was going to be $280 million -- Scott based his figure on a suspect study. We rated that claim False. All Aboard Florida All Aboard Florida is a $2.5 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2016, with hopes to extend to Orlando in 2017. Proposed by Florida East Coast Industries, LLC, All Aboard will use private financing for a large portion of its costs and has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. In the TV interview, Scott didn’t mention that federal loan, but his administration has acknowledged in press statements that federal dollars could be part of the project. So there’s definitely federal money involved, but is there state money? We found three points of contention here. Quiet zones: In response to residents’ concerns about noise from All Aboard trains, the Legislature this year approved $10 million in "quiet zone" money for horns at railroad crossings. Local government agencies can apply for the money for any rail crossing, not exclusively for those used by All Aboard. Local governments have until mid October to apply for the money so no money has been granted yet, Florida Department of Transportation spokesman Dick Kane told PolitiFact Florida. Tri-Rail: Tri-Rail is an existing government-run passenger rail service in South Florida overseen by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority. All Aboard mentioned in bond documents the possibility of using $44 million in state money to connect their trains to Tri-Rail, according to the Naples Daily News. While All Aboard and regional transportation officials talked about the idea of state funding, that never materialized and the Florida Department of Transportation officially shot down that idea amid all the publicity. So for now, there is no state money "involved" with connecting these two rail services. The Orlando International Airport: This is the most concrete connection between All Aboard and state funding. The airport is building a complex to include the airport’s people mover, parking and ground transportation. Connected to that project, the airport is also building an intermodal transportation facility -- and that’s the piece that will get about $214 million from a loan and grant from the state. The intermodal facility will accommodate rail -- including All Aboard Florida -- and potentially two other future rail projects, Phil Brown, airport director, told PolitiFact Florida. All Aboard Florida will pay the airport $2.8 million a year for a lease, which the airport will use to repay a portion of the state loan. In addition, All Aboard will pay the airport between $1 and $1.50 per passenger. (All Aboard Florida estimates that combined the total will add up to about $4.5 million a year.) "Whatever they are using of that facility they are going to pay for," Brown said. The airport is required under federal regulations to charge fair market rate. "The funding is for the Orlando International Airport, not All Aboard Florida," states a July 25 press release from FDOT. "The airport will reimburse the state for the portion of funding related to the rail connection, whether it is All Aboard Florida or another private rail provider." Our ruling Scott said in a TV interview that "All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved." While All Aboard Florida is a private venture, it has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. Also, the state is kicking in money for infrastructure, particularly for a new intermodal center at the Orlando International Airport. The funding for that infrastructure doesn’t go directly to All Aboard, but All Aboard does derive some benefit from the spending. Overall, we rate Scott’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-04286	"The Ryan budget gets rid of Medicare in 10 years and turns it into a voucher program."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/nov/02/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-budget-proposed-vic/	PolitiFact's 2011 Lie of the Year was the claim by Democrats that "Republicans voted to end Medicare." Since then, Democrats have been using variants of that theme, such as saying Republicans want to "end Medicare as we know it," to alert voters -- particularly elderly voters -- about GOP proposals to change the program that provides health care to people 65 and older. During his Oct. 23, 2012 WPRI-Providence Journal debate with Republican challenger Barry Hinckley, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, picked up on that theme, talking about the changes in Medicare proposed by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, now the GOP’s vice presidential candidate. "The Ryan budget gets rid of Medicare in 10 years and turns it into a voucher program," Whitehouse said. PolitiFact National has covered this ground before including looking at statements such as ones by Vice President Joe Biden that "there's not one Democrat who endorses" the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan -- rated True -- and that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan would "eliminate the guarantee of Medicare" -- rated Half True. We'll summarize the issues here. The bad news on Medicare is the money is running out. For example, according to the program’s actuary, the trust fund that pays for hospital care will run dry in 2024 -- even sooner if President Obama’s health care law is repealed, eliminating the cost-saving cuts that go along with it. In early 2011, Ryan, the Republican House budget chairman, released a budget blueprint (not an actual budget) calling for the conversion of Medicare into a voucher system, meaning enrollees would get a set amount of money to buy a health insurance plan of their choice. Republicans call it "premium support." But it also called for keeping Medicare intact for people 55 or older. In addition, to save money, the plan would have raised the eligibility age from 65 to 67. It passed the House on April 15, 2011. The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected it a month later. That sparked the "end Medicare" meme, even though supporters of the Ryan plan noted that the change would only affect people 54 and younger. The next incarnation came when Ryan and U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., developed a white paper that offered a compromise. It would offer Medicare to anyone who wanted it in the future, combined with a voucher-like system to allow people to buy a competitive private policy if they preferred. To quote the white paper: "Traditional Medicare will always be offered as a viable and robust choice." After Ryan released his budget proposal for 2013, which included the compromise, Wyden said he was no longer in favor of the plan because it had been combined with other elements, such as the repeal of Obamacare and no protections for Medicaid recipients. But one theme has been consistent among recent Republican proposals to change Medicare: although younger Americans would essentially have a choice between traditional Medicare and some other form of retirement-age health insurance option -- the current program would be retained for people 55 and older. When we asked the Whitehouse campaign about the senator's statement, spokesman Tony Simon said the senator was correct because, if the Ryan budget had passed, that would be "ending Medicare as we know it and turning it into a voucher." But Whitehouse didn't say "end Medicare as we know it." He said Medicare would be gone in 10 years. Under the latest version of the Ryan plan, it wouldn’t. We rate Whitehouse's statement False.

pomt-13281	"We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/11/hillary-clinton/clinton-claim-us-energy-independent-goes-too-far/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says President Barack Obama’s administration has hindered energy production in the United States. "Energy is under siege by the Obama administration," Trump said at the second presidential debate Oct. 9. "Under absolute siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies." Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton replied that on the contrary, "We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent." Clinton’s claim that the United States is energy independent raised some eyebrows, so we decided to see if it was accurate. Some energy experts we spoke with said the United States is close enough to energy independence that it could prosper without importing energy from unstable or unfriendly countries. Others said the United States isn’t quite there yet, even though it’s trending that way. If the United States only used foreign energy sources, it would clearly be energy dependent. And if it only used domestic energy sources, it would clearly be energy independent. On this spectrum, the United States is definitely closer to independence than dependence, and getting closer every year. But it’s not at full energy independence yet. The United States still consumes about 11 percent more energy than it produces, so it has to import from other nations to meet that need. In 2015, the United States produced 87.9 quadrillion BTUs of energy and used 97.3 quadrillion BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration, an office of the federal government. The United States imported about 11 quadrillion more BTUs of energy than it exported in 2015. This means "the U.S. is not energy independent," said Kenneth Medlock, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. That said, imports have been trending down significantly since the mid 2000s. The EIA has projected that the United States will switch from a net importer of energy to a net exporter sometime between 2020 and 2030. "The U.S. is not currently energy independent and, while it is moving toward energy independence, it is not expected to be so for about a decade," said Paul Holtberg, leader of the EIA’s Analysis Integration Team. This shift is happening because of changes in both supply and demand. Domestic natural gas and oil production has skyrocketed since hydraulic fracturing, the extraction method known as fracking, came into regular use in the late 2000s. At the same time, Americans are using less energy as a result of growing efficiency. Clinton said the United States is energy independent for the "first time ever." However, going by net imports vs. net exports, the United States is currently a larger net importer than it was from the 1950s (as far back as the EIA data goes) through the 1970s, and again in the mid 1980s. So current net import levels are not unprecedented. When people think of energy independence, they often think of oil because it’s the one source of energy that the United States has historically imported from potentially unstable areas. While the United States is essentially self-sufficient as it pertains to coal, natural gas and renewable energy sources, it still imports about 24 percent of its oil needs, even with the increase in fracking. Even so, Marilyn Brown, a professor of sustainable systems at Georgia Institute of Technology, told PolitiFact that she thinks the United States is energy independent because it could meet its oil needs from a friendly country, like Mexico or Canada, if the oil market in one of its other top supplier countries became unstable. North America as a whole is arguably energy independent, in that it produces all the energy it consumes on a net basis, several experts pointed out. While Clinton’s claim that the United States is at present energy independent might not be fully correct numerically, the spirit of the claim is on target because the country is becoming less and less dependent on foreign sources, said global energy expert Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director for Energy and Sustainability at University of California, Davis. While the United States is interwoven with the world energy market, if for some reason "all our fuel had to be produced in the United States, we could do it," she said. Our ruling Clinton said, "We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent." The United States imports more energy than it exports, and it consumes more energy than it produces domestically. So the United States still relies on foreign energy sources for about 11 percent of its energy consumption needs. However, this import-export gap is trending down. The EIA predicts the United States’ energy exports and imports will balance in the not-so-distant future. That said, imports and exports have been balanced in previous decades. The United States is on track to energy independence, but it’s not there yet. Clinton's statement is not accurate and we rate it False.

pomt-13496	"Food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/rudy-giuliani/rudy-giuliani-says-food-stamps-rose-two-and-half-t/	Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump, criticized President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy as he touted Trump’s efforts to court African-American voters. "So, now you compare New York to Detroit and Baltimore, and you look at the number of crimes in both of those cities and you look at New York, you look at the unemployment rates, you look at the economic opportunities, and you see that I think Donald Trump is the first Republican since Jack Kemp, and me, to go into minority poor communities and say, the Democrats have failed you for 50 years, and you are reflexively giving them your vote, and they are going from bad to worse," Giuliani said in an interview on the Sept. 4, 2016, edition of CNN’s State of the Union. "Food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama. He should be ashamed of himself. Jobs should have gone up two-and-a-half times." Is the use of food stamps -- formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP -- really two-and-a-half times higher than it was when Obama took office? The short answer is that it’s higher -- but not by nearly that much. And in recent years, it’s been falling. As we’ve noted, SNAP is the federal government’s largest food program, eclipsing other big farm-bill food spending for school lunches and breakfasts and for Women, Infants and Children. It helps low-income people buy groceries, usually with benefit cards that work like debit cards. Two factors undergird the rise in food stamp use during Obama’s presidency. The first is that the number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush due to policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama. The second is the 2007-09 recession, which drove the number of SNAP recipients to record highs. In an average month in 2011, one in seven U.S. residents got help. So what does the trend line for food stamp usage under Obama look like? Here’s a graph, drawn from Agriculture Department data: Note that the number of beneficiaries did rise -- but not nearly by two-and-a-half times, or 150 percent. At the outset of Obama’s presidency, nearly 32 million people were receiving SNAP benefits. By May 2016, that number had risen to 43.5 million -- an increase of 36 percent. That’s a significant increase, and it’s one of the weakest economic metrics on Obama’s watch. But it’s not two-and-a-half times as high as when he came into office, as Giuliani said. It’s also worth noting that, while the number of recipients is higher now than it was when Obama took office, it has fallen, slowly but consistently, over the past three years. What about the cost of the program? We created a graph from that data as well. This shows that during the Obama presidency, the cost of SNAP increased at a somewhat faster rate than the number of beneficiaries did -- by just under 50 percent. But even that increase was nowhere near the two and a half times or 150 percent that Giuliani cited. We inquired with Giuliani’s office and Trump’s campaign but did not hear back. Our ruling Giuliani said that "food stamps have gone up two-and-a-half times under Barack Obama." Due to expanded eligibility and outreach, as well as the after-effects of the Great Recession -- each of which began under Bush -- the number of SNAP beneficiaries and the cost of the program has risen under Obama. However, the increase in these metrics has been 36 percent and 50 percent, respectively -- far less than the two-and-a-half-times multiplier Giuliani used. It’s also worth noting that both of these figures have been falling consistently over the past several years, a trend that Giuliani’s comment obscures.

pomt-10943	In New York City, "for every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/ocasio-cortez-new-york-city-there-are-3-vacant-apa/	New York Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has put poverty and inequality at the center of her campaign. On Twitter, she focused on troubles in the New York City housing market. New York City is experiencing the highest rate of homelessness since the Great Depression," she wrote July 23. "For every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments. Inequality is a crisis, and a bold, 21st-century effort on poverty must advance." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Ocasio-Cortez’s stat about the number of homeless and the number of vacant apartments caught our eye. Key takeaways There are about 63,000 homeless people in New York City, and the number of vacant housing units is in the range of 150,000 to 180,000. Given the number of families, the actual number of homeless households seeking permanent shelter is about 32,000, and the number of apartments available for rent is closer to 79,000. The numbers lack great precision but in large measure, the 1-to-3 ratio is about right. The math on the homeless count Campaign spokesman Jeff Latzer told us that "numbers vary, but there’s roughly 63,495 homeless and 247,977 vacancies." With those numbers, there are 3.8 empty places for each homeless person. Let’s look at the sources behind both figures. Official reports back up the homeless count. New York City’s Homeless Services Department’s May survey had 62,147 individuals staying in temporary housing. That stat overstates the number of apartments needed, because it includes children in families. The advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless in New York City says the actual number of homeless households, both families and single adults, is closer to 32,000. Turning to vacancies, the city’s 2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey did find 247,977 "vacant units, not available for sale or rent." But before we dive into that big number, the survey found another 79,000 vacant apartments that were actually on the rental market. That’s the number Giselle Routhier, the homeless coalition’s policy director, focuses on. Routhier compared it to the number of apartments needed, not the number of homeless people. "There are about 2.5 vacant rental apartments for every homeless household in New York City," Routhier said. "But the problem is even worse than the point-in-time data. New York City loses thousands of affordable apartment every year through rent increases and deregulation. Between 1996 and 2017, New York City lost more than 1.1 million housing units with contract rents below $800 per month." Routhier’s way of looking at the city’s costly housing market is very different from Ocasio-Cortez’s, but the final numbers are reasonably close. Routhier said about 2.5 and Ocasio-Cortez said about three. Matthew Gordon Lasner, associate professor of urban studies at Hunter College, warned that the focus on math only takes you so far. "The comparison she’s making — no matter the ratio or numbers — is really a rhetorical device, to point out that the city has the capacity to house all its residents," Lasner said. When a vacancy isn’t a vacancy So now let’s get back to that big number of nearly 248,000 "vacant units, not available for sale or rent." It’s not what it might seem. The total includes 58,000 units "undergoing renovation" and another 22,000 rented or sold "but not yet occupied." All told, about 129,000 units are vacant due to one process or another that takes them out of the active housing market. 2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey Total rental units 2,183,064 Occupied 2,103,874 Vacant, available 79,190 Vacant units, not available for sale or rent 247,977 Held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use 74,945 Rented, not yet occupied 10,960 Sold, not yet occupied 11,156 Undergoing renovation 58,347 Awaiting renovation 20,283 In legal dispute 9,626 Held pending sale of building 5,886 Owner’s personal problems (age, illness, etc.) 12,719 Held for other reasons 27,009 But that still leaves nearly 75,000 units in the category of "held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use." These are the pied-à-terre of the well-to-do, and sometimes, the super-duper-well-to-do. "A bit of that is new – global billionaires parking money in Midtown condos," said Lasner. "But New York’s always had tens of thousands of suburbanites, U.S. out-of-towners, and foreigners keeping apartments. That’s been the case for centuries in all important business and government centers." Lasner prefers to focus on what he called a practical figure — the number of units that could be on the market "with a few nudges or tweaks of the law." For him, between the available and the unavailable vacancies, the baseline is in the range of 150,000 to 180,000. How Ocasio-Cortez’s ratio stacks up Taking Ocasio-Cortez’s count of homeless people, and estimating 150,000 and 180,000 vacancies, the ratio falls to 1 person for between 2.4 and nearly 3 apartments. If instead we use the number of homeless households, the ratio could get to the neighborhood of 1-to-6 (32,000 households for 180,000 vacancies). Pushing further, comparing homeless households to just the number of vacant apartments truly on the market (79,000 divided by 32,000), the result is 1-to-2.4. Our ruling Ocasio-Cortez said that "for every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments." The number of homeless people is about 63,000. The number of vacant apartments is harder to judge, but no matter how we jiggered the numbers, the lowest ratio we found was 1-to-2.4. And the high could get close to 1-to-6. There’s a lot push and pull in the underlying statistics, but in the main, Ocasio-Cortez’s math holds up. We rate this claim Mostly True.

"Kushner And Wife Ivanka Trump Were Tossed Out Of The White House — And Donald Is Cutting Them Out Of His Will!" the headline reads. The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. But the story that accompanied the flashy headline neither repeated nor provided evidence to back up the claims. Trump’s eldest daughter and her husband, who enjoy an elevated status in the White House as both family members and advisers, indeed faced increased public scrutiny in the past week, but have not been kicked out of the West Wing. The story correctly summarized news reports describing Kushner’s downgraded security designation, from top secret to secret clearance, following White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s decision to overhaul the security clearance process. It also rehashed anonymously sourced news reports of internal White House turmoil regarding Kelly’s frustration with Ivanka’s White House tenure. The most recent source of tension was her attendance at the Olympic closing ceremony in South Korea. While some editorial pages have suggested the couple should resign from their White House posts, no reputable news sources have announced their departure, let alone firing. And the contents of Trump’s will -- and whether the couple has somehow been eliminated from it -- have not been reported by any credible sources, either.

pomt-12062	Says a poll showed 70 percent to 75 percent of people want to see Confederate statues "remain up and not taken down."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/sep/06/sid-miller/sid-miller-poll-shows-70-percent-75-percent-americ/	Sid Miller objected to the recent in-the-night removals of four statues of people with Confederate ties from pedestals at the University of Texas. The big-hatted Republican serving as Texas agriculture commissioner further said most Americans agree that such statues should be left in place. In an August 2017 interview with Karina Kling of Spectrum Cable’s Capital Tonight, Miller disputed the notion that statues venerating Confederate figures touch off controversy. "I don’t believe they do cause controversy," Miller said. "I saw a poll, I think (on) NPR, 70 or 75 percent of the people would like to see those statues remain up and not taken down." We decided to check Miller’s poll claim. A caution: Any comparison of poll results is limited by the amount of information available about how and when each poll was taken, what’s asked (there are invariably variations) and the demographic and partisan mix of each poll’s respondents. So, we recognized that fact-checking Miller’s reference to precise results might prove knotty. Huffington Post round-up A Huffington Post news story published the day Miller was interviewed rolled out the results of a HuffPost/YouGov poll of 1,000 adult U.S. citizens who were surveyed over the web Aug. 15-16, 2017--specifically, 353 Democrats, 397 independents and 246 Republicans, the organization reported. Its poll question:"Do you favor or oppose removing statues and memorials of Confederate leaders?" Thirty-three percent favored removals, 48 percent were opposed, 18 percent were unsure. The poll also had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percent so you could speculate that 52 percent of the respondents wanted such statues to stay put. That’s considerably shy of 70-plus percent. But the story noted six other polls taken Aug. 15, 2017, to Aug. 22, 2017, each one asking about Confederate statues three days or more after confrontations between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Va., crumbled after a driver drove into pedestrians, killing one. Here’s the Huffington Post’s summary of recent statue polls: SOURCE: Graphic, "Polls Find Little Support For Confederate Statue Removal — But How You Ask Matters," the Huffington Post, Aug. 23, 2017 (accessed Aug. 25, 2017) The Marist Poll We noticed the post-Charlottesville poll showing the largest share of respondents opposed to removing statues was the Marist Poll taken Aug. 14-15, 2017, by mobile and landline phones of 1,125 U.S adults. After the poll interviews, the pollster said, the regionally balanced samples were combined and balanced to reflect the 2013 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey one-year estimates for age, gender, income, race, and region. Marist said that of the 859 registered voters included in the poll, 37 percent were independents, 36 percent were Democrats and 26 percent were Republicans. The poll, taken in collaboration with NPR and the PBS NewsHour, asked: "Do you think statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy should remain as a historical symbol/be removed because they are offensive to some people?" Sixty-two percent of the surveyed adults said the statues should remain, 27 percent said they should be removed, 11 percent were unsure. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 2.9 percentage points meaning you could say close to 65 percent, or as few as 59 percent, of the polled preferred leaving such statues in place. Miller notes a deeper break-out By phone to our inquiry, a Miller campaign spokesman, Todd Smith, said Miller reached his 70 percent or 75 percent figure as an estimate of where Texans stand based on the Marist poll’s detailed results showing 67 percent of moderates and 81 percent of conservative or very conservative respondents said such statues should remain. "He was trying to extrapolate Texas numbers out of that," Smith said. "I don’t think Commissioner Miller was trying to give an exact number." The results also were broken down regionally. Sixty-six percent of respondents in the South favored statues to remain, 23 percent backed removals. Other polls identified by Ariel Edwards-Levy, the Huffington Post’s polling director, suggested 49 percent to 54 percent of respondents oppose statue removals (though it’s again worth stressing it matters how each question was posed and who was polled and how results were weighted). An outlier Only a poll by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling, which showcases Democratic clients, delivered contrary results, perhaps because of how its question was framed and worded. The company’s general summary of its poll taken Aug. 18-21, 2017, says: "Voters have nuanced views when it comes to Confederate monuments. Overall 39% say they support monuments honoring the Confederacy to 34% who say they oppose them. That's basically unchanged from the 42/35 spread we found on this question when we polled it in June." Even though voters narrowly support the monuments, the summary says, 58 percent of respondents said "they support relocating them from government property and moving them to museums or other historic sites where they can be viewed in proper historical context. There's bipartisan support for that approach with Democrats (72/14), independents (52/27), and Republicans (46/42) all in favor of it." Public Policy Polling says it surveyed 887 registered voters. Eighty percent of participants, selected through a list based sample, responded by phone with the remaining 20 percent participating on the web. Forty-one percent of respondents self-identified as Democrats, 31 percent as Republicans, 29 percent as independents. After a question about supporting or opposing monuments honoring the Confederacy, the poll asked: "Do you support or oppose relocating monuments honoring the Confederacy from government property and moving them to museums or other historic sites where they can be viewed in proper historical context?" Fifty-eight percent supported relocation, 26 percent were opposed, 16 percent were unsure. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.3 percent so you could speculate that as much as 61 percent of respondents supported relocation. Our ruling Miller said a poll showed 70 percent to 75 percent of people oppose the removal of Confederate statues. All but one of the latest national polls, we confirmed, show more Americans in opposition to tumbling such statues than in favor. But most polls show a little more than 50 percent to 54 percent of respondents opposed with only the Marist poll, which Miller mentioned, indicating more than 60 percent in opposition. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-12399	California Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget "cuts funds for local tree mortality efforts from $52.7 million to just $2 million."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/may/25/jim-patterson/did-jerry-brown-axe-funds-removing-californias-dea/	Republican Assemblyman Jim Patterson of Fresno recently claimed Gov. Jerry Brown has slashed nearly all the money in the state’s budget to help local governments remove dead and dying trees in California’s forests. More than 100 million trees have died in the forests due to drought and bark beetle infestations since 2010. The tree mortality crisis led Brown, a Democrat, to declare a state of emergency in October 2015. "The Governor’s updated budget released on (May 11, 2017) cuts funds for local tree mortality efforts from $52.7 million to just $2 million," Patterson said in a press release on May 22, 2017. Patterson’s district includes towns in the Sierra National Forest and Kings Canyon National Park east of Fresno where the tree die-off is severe. If they fall, dead and dying trees can damage public roadways, water and power infrastructure and private homes and businesses. But removing them isn’t cheap: It can cost $1,000 or more for each tree. In response to the die-off, the state has reimbursed cities and counties for a portion of the cost to clear hazardous trees from public rights-of-way. Patterson’s statement makes it seem as if that program is being drastically scaled back. We decided to fact-check the assemblyman’s claim that the governor’s May budget "cuts funds for local tree mortality efforts from $52.7 million to just $2 million." Trees dying from drought and beetle infestation in Mariposa County. Amy Quinton / Capital Public Radio Our research Patterson is referring to California Disaster Assistance Act funding. Some of his figures are correct, but perhaps not in context. Brown’s initial budget released in January indeed shows the governor set aside $52.7 million for this disaster assistance fund. It did not cite a specific amount for tree removal reimbursements. The governor’s revised May budget shows the overall disaster assistance fund was reduced to $8.5 million. It sets aside just $2 million for local agencies to remove dead or dying trees based on expected demand for that money, according to state officials. Brown, following record rainfall in California, declared an end to the state’s drought emergency in April. As a result, he scaled back his plans for emergency spending by more than $100 million in his updated budget. Patterson’s spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the claim. Looking again at the assemblyman’s statement, it’s simply not accurate to say the $52.7 million set aside in January for disaster funds was all intended to help with the tree die-off. "A lot of that money was for the effects of drought, drinking water, community water sources. It was not just for tree mortality. Tree mortality is just one kind of disaster that could have requested reimbursements from that fund," said Janet Upton, deputy director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as CalFire. Upton said the $2 million figure is based on the state’s projections for how much local governments will seek in reimbursements in the coming fiscal year for the removal of dead and dying trees. Since the tree crisis started, local governments have requested less than $600,000 from the disaster fund for the removal costs, Upton added. She said the state would ensure all eligible requests by local governments are reimbursed even if the requests exceed the $2 million in the budget. "If there was an unmet demand of $40 million, that would be a different story," Upton said. File photo / Associated Press Requests to ramp up? Even so, the governor’s decision to reduce disaster funding is still worrisome, said Staci Heaton, who works for the Rural County Representatives of California. "I think (the $2 million) is going to be a little low," said Heaton, whose organization advocates for many of the mountainous counties affected by the die-off. Heaton said she expects requests for tree removal reimbursements "will ramp up," adding that rural counties see the reduction "as a fairly big hit to local government aid." Rural cities and counties aren’t the only ones removing the dying trees. And the disaster fund isn’t the only source of money that helps local governments. Here’s another example as outlined in the governor’s January budget: "In December 2016, CalFire awarded $15.8 million in grants for a total of 107 projects across 34 counties to support local efforts to remove dead and dying trees that pose a threat to public health and safety and projects that reduce the threat of wildfires to homes." In April, the San Francisco Chronicle reported: "The governor’s emergency declaration for the forests has ushered in tens of millions of dollars to address safety issues. So far, roughly 500,000 trees have been removed and miles of fuel breaks have been cut in a joint effort by the Forest Service, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the California Department of Transportation and private utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. alone removed 236,000 dead or dying trees last year." Upton noted that nearly half of the $90 million CalFire had been receiving on a temporary basis each year to respond to the drought has now been converted into permanent annual funding. This allows the agency, she said, to continue its year-round staffing, which will focus in part on removing hazardous trees and easing the tree mortality crisis. Our ruling Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson recently claimed Gov. Jerry Brown’s May budget "cuts funds for local tree mortality efforts from $52.7 million to just $2 million." Patterson’s claim gets the $2 million figure correct. But it’s misleading and not accurate to say the entire $52.7 million was set aside to remove dead and dying trees. It’s a disaster assistance fund that also helps pay for water storage and sanitation projects across nine counties in California. Brown declared an end to the state’s drought emergency in April, a move that led the state to scale back some temporary emergency funding. Over the past couple years, local governments have requested less than $600,000 for tree removal reimbursements from the disaster assistance fund, though an advocate for rural counties expects requests will ramp up this year. Patterson taps into a real concern over tree mortality and its cost to local governments. But his statement cites a misleading budget number and ignores critical facts that would give a very different impression. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Capital Public Radio's Insight program discussed this fact check and a separate national fact check on May 31, 2017. Listen to the discussion below: UPDATE: We reached out to Patterson's office for this fact check but have yet to hear back directly. Two days after our report published, Patterson responded to it on Twitter. He said: "The cuts are real, large & dangerous. People who live in the midst of this disaster are scared, and the counties they live in are too." Also, in a separate press release last week, Patterson said a state Assembly budget committee had approved a $20 million increase to CalFire’s budget to fund dead tree removal and prescribed burns. He added that the same committee rejected his request to add $10 million for local tree mortality efforts. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-14225	Says New Hampshire’s second congressional district includes two counties where "almost 5 percent if not more" of residents are enrolled in the state’s expanded Medicaid program.	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/apr/15/jack-falanagan/republican-candidate-congress-cites-higher-average/	At a news conference last month, U.S. House candidate and state Rep. Jack Flanagan explained his vote to continue the state’s expanded Medicaid program. Flanagan, a Republican, supported the legislation because those in the second congressional district were relying on the expanded plan, he told reporters. "When I looked at the actual layout -- Coos County, Sullivan County, there was a significant number of people -- I think it’s almost 5 percent if not more -- in those counties. So, looking ahead and knowing those people could use the support, that’s why I voted" for the program, he said. Flanagan’s assertion caught our eye. While the overall number of those on the expanded program has been stated repeatedly – about 48,000 individuals – less has been said about who those people are and where they live. So we decided to check out Flanagan's statement. Let’s start with the district boundaries. New Hampshire’s second congressional district stretches from the very top of the state to the very bottom, and generally covers the western half. It’s currently represented by U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, a Democrat. As Flanagan noted, the district encompasses all of Coos and Sullivan counties. It also includes all of Cheshire County. Much of Grafton, Merrimack and Hillsborough counties are in the district, too, along with a slice of Rockingham. That’s a lot of space, and as you might expect, use of the expanded Medicaid, which offers subsidized health care to people making less than $16,000 a year, isn’t uniform across the district. Towns and cities in sparse Coos and populated Merrimack counties face very different economic challenges, after all. The next piece of the puzzle is the actual usage of the program. The state’s Health and Human Services department has produced a number of maps through its division of Public Health Services that show, as of January, how many residents across the state use expanded Medicaid.According to this information, Coos County saw the greatest use of the expanded Medicaid program, with 5.38 percent participating. Sullivan County, the second one named by Flanagan, had 4.28 percent of its residents enrolled in the program. These figures include just the expanded program, not all Medicaid enrollees. As expected, numbers vary in the other counties included in the district. Only 3.77 percent of the population of Cheshire County is enrolled. Merrimack County has 3.75 percent of residents participating, while Hillsborough has 3.58 percent. Grafton County is broken up in an unusual way on the map -- Hanover and Lebanon are broken out. Between them, the communities have only 1.72 percent of their residents in the program. The rest of the county has a 4.19 percent enrollment. While the numbers can be sliced and diced further -- the state also issued a town-by-town breakdown of enrollments -- Flanagan was speaking about county numbers, so this rough breakdown should be sufficient. The two counties Flanagan specified, Coos and Sullivan, indeed have the highest participation rate in the expanded Medicaid program. Only the former is over 5 percent, though. Bolstering his argument, both have higher enrollments than the state as a whole, which stands at about 3.5 percent. When reached for comment, the representative pointed to the same set of data from the state. "I was considering Coos when I made that statement, however Grafton and Sullivan counties are still high, percentage wise," Flanagan wrote in an email. Our ruling U.S. House candidate and State Rep. Jack Flanagan said that "almost 5 percent if not more" of the population of Coos and Sullivan counties were enrolled in the state’s expanded Medicaid program. In the second congressional district, one county has more than 5 percent enrollment in the state’s expanded Medicaid program and another is pretty close. Coos county indeed breaks the 5 percent mark. Sullivan, at 4.28 percent, which have the first and second-highest participation rates in the state, respectively. We rate Flanagan’s statement True.

pomt-04288	"Tommy Thompson made millions from corporations who outsource American jobs and now he's trying to lavish huge tax breaks on them."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/01/majority-pac/senate-hopeful-tommy-thompson-made-millions-outsou/	Attacking Tommy Thompson as being "not for you anymore," Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin casts Thompson as someone who has profited from big corporations and who would favor them if he is elected to the U.S. Senate. Majority PAC, a political action committee that aims to protect the Democratic majority in the Senate, portrays the Republican former governor in much the same way. In a TV ad released Oct. 31, 2012, Majority PAC states: "Tommy Thompson made millions from corporations who outsource American jobs and now he's trying to lavish huge tax breaks on them." The claim has two distinct parts. ‘Made millions’ from outsourcers There’s no disputing that Thompson has made millions of dollars since departing his post as U.S. health and human services secretary under President George W. Bush, a job he held after leaving the Wisconsin governor’s office. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in January 2012 that Thompson’s assets exceeded $13 million, most it from his work as a corporate consultant, executive, investor and speaker after leaving Bush’s cabinet in 2005. But the Majority PAC’s claim is that he was paid millions specifically by corporations that moved jobs out of the United States. When we asked the group for backup, it provided a document that cited three corporations. C.R. Bard: Filings from the federal Securities and Exchange Commission show C.R. Bard, a New Jersey medical device firm, has paid Thompson some $1.5 million in cash and stock options since 2005, when he became a board member. Majority PAC also cited a report by the federal Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, which investigated a February 2011 complaint filed by a New York state agency on behalf of Bard workers. The report said a significant number of Bard workers lost their jobs because the company shifted some production to Mexico. In December 2011, Bard announced it was cutting 50 New York jobs, some of which could be relocated outside of the U.S., according to a news article that noted that Bard a year earlier had announced 200 job cuts. In its own attack on Thompson, another group, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, noted that Bard’s 2011 annual report said that "over the past three years, we’ve added close to 300 people in emerging markets in South America, Europe and Asia." Deloitte: Thompson earned more than $1 million in consulting fees from the accounting firm, according a 2007 disclosure report he filed with the government. Majority PAC cited statements by Deloitte, including one on the company's website, which say Deloitte offers its clients outsourcing advisory services. But obviously that’s not the same as directly outsourcing jobs. Unisys: Thompson’s 2007 disclosure report said he received $5,000 from Harvard Consulting for serving on the Unisys Global Public Sector Advisory Board. An advisory role is certainly less powerful, and far less lucrative, than Thompson’s role as a Bard board member, although Unisys was involved in outsourcing. Majority PAC cited an April 2007 news story that reported that Unisys, an information technology company, planned to lay off 950 employees, mainly in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom, while it beefed up operations in cheaper markets such as India, China and Eastern Europe. The company hired about 1,200 workers in those regions, primarily India, in 2006, a company spokesman said in the article. So, while the first part of the claim suggested Thompson earned multi-millions working for a number of corporations that outsourced jobs, the group’s evidence shows something less than that. Thompson earned $1.5 million -- virtually all of it from one company -- that sent jobs outside the U.S. 'Lavishing huge tax breaks' The second part of Majority PAC's claim is that Thompson wants to give huge tax breaks to corporations that outsource. We've already rated as Half True a nearly identical statement by the AFSCME public employees union, which said in September 2012 that Thompson "supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs." We found Thompson would completely exempt from taxation U.S. companies’ profits from overseas operations, under certain conditions. But researchers differed on whether U.S. employment would decline under this "territorial" tax approach, with some arguing that businesses would invest more at home as a result of the tax break. And part of Thompson’s plan provides incentives that could convince companies to bring profits back home. Thompson’s campaign didn’t reply to a request to respond to the Majority PAC ad. But for a Journal Sentinel story about troubles encountered by companies Thompson oversaw, his campaign spokeswoman said: "It is important to note that as a board member, Governor Thompson is not involved in the daily operations of these companies. Rather, his role, among other things, is to provide a strategic vision to these companies similar to the roles of other directors and officers." Our rating Majority PAC said Thompson "made millions from corporations who outsource American jobs and now he's trying to lavish huge tax breaks on them." Thompson was paid $1.5 million, but that doesn’t match the "millions" claimed in the ad. He supports a tax break for U.S. companies' profits from overseas, but it's possible the tax break could lead to more American jobs. Majority PAC's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-10276	Obama wants to increase the size of government by 23 percent.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/23/john-mccain/mccains-math-is-not-even-close/	John McCain's campaign is trying to paint Barack Obama as a big spender. In a new radio ad, an announcer says Obama wants to implement "$863-billion in new government programs — a 23 percent increase in the size of government." The percentage-increase claim is so far off base that we're going to grant McCain several questionable assumptions — and then show that he's still way off. First, let's allow McCain to argue that Obama wants $863-billion in new government programs. That's based on a "Spend-O-Meter" list that the McCain campaign compiled from examining Obama's Web site and his public statements, though the campaign's handout put the total at $865.3-billion. PolitiFact examined a similar list compiled by the Republican National Committee in February, and found some reasons to quibble. But for this exercise, we'll ignore any spending cuts proposed by Obama, such as troop withdrawals from Iraq, and give McCain his $863-billion. Then, McCain contends that the $863-billion can be split into four equal chunks of $216-billion, for each year of an Obama presidency. That's questionable, because spending proposals take time to become law and get implemented. And, because of inflation and population growth, spending programs tend to grow over time, not stay at constant levels, so earlier budgets are likely to be smaller than later ones. But we won't deduct any points for that, and we'll give McCain his $216-billion annual figure for argument's sake. McCain's campaign also says the right year for comparison is fiscal 2008, which ends Sept. 30. We'll give this one to McCain, too. To recap: We've allowed McCain, unchallenged, to argue that Obama wants to raise spending by $216-billion a year and that we'll compare that total to fiscal year 2008 to determine how much Obama wants to increase the size of government. This should be easy, right? Just figure out how much the government is spending in fiscal year 2008, divide $216-billion by that number, and we'll have our answer. Sixth-grade math. According to a White House Office of Management and Budget report from July 2008, the government's total outlays for the year will be $2.942-trillion. So we divide $216-billion by $2.942-trillion and get ... 7.3 percent. That's not 23 percent. Not even close. So where does McCain get that figure? We asked the campaign for clarification, and spokesman Joseph Pounder said the campaign took $216-billion and divided it by $933-billion, which does equal 23.2 percent. That's the amount of discretionary spending in a catch-all spending bill approved by Congress in late 2007 and signed by President Bush. Except that $933-billion isn't even all of the discretionary spending for fiscal year 2008 — because that bill didn't include any money for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The real discretionary spending number for 2008, according to the White House, is $1.13-trillion. (Take $216-billion and divide it by that number and you get 19.1 percent.) Furthermore, some of the spending increases that make up the $216-billion are in mandatory programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, so the McCain campaign isn't even measuring discretionary spending consistently on the top and bottom of its fraction. The McCain campaign's preferred denominator doesn't include current spending on those programs. The result is like saying Alex Rodriguez has a lot more home runs this year than he did last year, without mentioning that this year, doubles count as home runs, too. And lastly, how can McCain argue that an increase in discretionary spending is the same as an increase "in the size of government"? Here's what Pounder had to say about that: "By size of government, we are referring to government spending outside of mandatory spending. It's the argument that outside of mandatory spending, this is the most immediate way that Barack Obama will have an impact on government spending and when you include his spending proposals it accounts for a 23 percent increase." That's the equivalent of saying, "By size of government, we are referring to a government with no Social Security, no Medicare, no Medicaid, no food stamps, no federal employee retirement benefits and no interest on the national debt." The McCain campaign's math is flat-out wrong. So wrong, in fact, their precise 23 percent figure isn't merely a false claim, it's Pants on Fire!

pomt-02975	According to a federal report, Obamacare will increase the long-term federal deficit by $6.2 trillion.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/22/paul-broun/broun-uses-only-negative-scenario-gao-report/	Among the Republican Party, President Barack Obama’s health care plan doesn’t have a lot of fans. The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, has been criticized for cost, requirements and supposed federal overreach. Days before enrollment opened on Oct. 1, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republican, took another shot at Obamacare in an Augusta Chronicle editorial. "Three years ago President Obama touted his 2,700-page health care plan as the solution to our nation’s health care needs … But since that time, statistic after statistic proved these statements false, causing the president’s promises to fall flat," Broun said in the Sept. 29 piece. "According to a report released by the Government Accountability Office, Obamacare will increase the long-term federal deficit by $6.2 trillion." Such a large figure immediately triggered our curiosity. That $6.2 trillion is more than a third of the country’s $16.7 trillion national debt right now, a staggering amount that we had to investigate. Broun is one of several Republican candidates seeking the seat held by retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss. He used the editorial to promote his own health care plan, the Patient OPTION Act. Broun’s plan fully repeals the Affordable Care Act, makes all health care expenses 100 percent tax-deductible and lets families buy health insurance across state lines, he said. (At press time, Broun’s Patient OPTION Act -- introduced in August with no co-sponsors -- sat in a House subcommittee.) We asked his office about the source for his $6.2 trillion statement. A spokeswoman said the figures were taken from articles in conservative publications, including the Heritage Foundation’s Foundry blog and National Review. This $6.2 trillion figure has been bandied about by conservative politicos for some time. Our PolitiFact Virginia colleagues have examined a similar claim made by a congressman from that state, who received a Mostly False rating for creating a misleading claim about the GAO report. The articles Broun referenced based the $6.2 trillion claim on a January 2013 GAO report -- requested by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. -- examining the health care law’s impact on the federal budget over the next 75 years. The report found that the impact depends largely on whether cost-controlling elements of the health care law are sustained long term, and considered two scenarios. In the optimistic scenario where the law and those cost provisions -- including reductions in Medicare payments and hospital readmission -- are fully implemented, the health care law is expected to reduce the federal deficit by 1.5 percent over 75 years. The second scenario assumes the cost-containment provisions are phased out starting in 2019. Doing that would mean the law would increase the deficit by 0.7 percent over the same time period. Under either scenario, the GAO report noted, models show that the federal budget is on an unsustainable fiscal path, driven by rising health care costs and an aging population. The report is full of numbers, but does not include the $6.2 trillion deficit figure. That number was computed by Republican staff members on the Senate Budget Committee. Staffers used data from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to calculate the country’s gross domestic product for the 75 years ending 2085. That GDP is expected to total $883 trillion. Using the GAO report’s deficit increase figure with the GDP data results in the $6.2 trillion figure that is repeated by Broun and used in the various articles. Broun did not mention the $13.25 trillion that would be the savings over 75 years using the same GDP and GAO optimistic scenario figures. We also checked the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency, for data on the health care law’s budget impact. In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the law would decrease the federal budget $210 billion over 10 years ending 2021. So is Broun correct? The Georgia congressman said that a GAO report said the Affordable Care Act would increase the federal deficit by $6.2 trillion. But the GAO report doesn’t include the $6.2 trillion figure. That amount was extrapolated using data from the GAO report by a group of GOP Senate Budget Committee staffers. What the report does say is that the health care law could cause the federal deficit to increase if cost-savings measures are phased out over time. But if the law is fully implemented, it could actually lower the deficit over time. Broun, like other politicos before him, repeats a selective version of the report to support his claim, while omitting alternative positive findings of the same report. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2013-10-22T00:00:00	2013-09-29	['None']
pomt-02601	Volunteer firefighters and communities they serve in Georgia and elsewhere are being devastated by Obamacare.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/27/national-republican-senatorial-committee/obamacare-fears-spill-over-public-safety-arena/	The National Republican Senatorial Committee tapped into a big fear in a Jan. 9 press release. The committee said cities and towns could be facing financial upheaval because of the often-derided employer mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. That provision requires that employers with more than 50 workers to provide health coverage to those putting in at least 30 hours a week. "Seventy-seven percent of Georgia's fire departments are volunteer, and it is unfair and unfortunate that those firefighters and the communities they protect are the latest Obamacare victims," Brook Hougesen, the committee’s press secretary, said in the statement. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the NRSC had accurately sounded the alarm on yet another problem with the Obamacare rollout. Or was the claim all wet? When we started checking into the statement, it became apparent that people from the local firehouse to the halls of Congress were concerned. Joe O’Conor, Peachtree City’s fire chief, said his city’s full-time employees have an excellent benefits package that could not be replicated for its volunteer firefighters. "Our annual budget could not possibly allow us to extend comparable health care benefits to part-time and volunteer firefighters," he said. Peachtree City Fire and Rescue runs with a blend of full-time, part-time and volunteer firefighters and EMT/paramedics. The volunteers receive a nominal stipend so they don’t have to pull from the family budget to cover costs such as gas, child care or food while they are at the fire station, O’Conor said. It’s much the same across Georgia, where 77 percent to 78 percent of firefighters are volunteers, said Glenn Allen, a spokesman for state Insurance and Fire Safety Commissioner Ralph T. Hudgens. In addition to small stipends, some local governments have workers’ compensation coverage for volunteer firefighters in case of injury at a fire scene or when the firefighters are in transit. But none is paid a salary. "That’s why they’re called volunteers," Allen said. The NRSC statement warned that Obamacare requirements, if forced upon volunteer fire departments, could, among other things, "result in higher taxes on Georgia families or penalties for the departments, many of which are already struggling financially." The committee cites an Associated Press report that says volunteer firefighters could be affected by the law. "Obamacare has been a disaster, and now volunteer firefighers and the communities that rely on them are the latest victims of this terrible law," Hougesen said. The committee, which brags that it is "the only national organization solely devoted to electing Republicans to the U.S. Senate," also took a swipe in its statement at Michelle Nunn, the best-known Democrat in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race. The NRSC accused her of being "adamantly loyal" to the new health care law and "prioritizing politics ahead of Georgia’s first responders." But a day after the NRSC released its statement, Mark Mazur, the U.S. Treasury Department’s assistant secretary for tax policy, appeared to put the matter to rest. He wrote in a blog that the final regulations under Obamacare are going to include an exemption for volunteer emergency workers. Mazur’s blog seemed to ease minds in the fire services community. William Metcalf, president and chairman of the board of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, put out a statement, calling it "an important victory for America's fire and emergency services." The NRSC’s Hougesen defended the committee’s press release, saying it came out "a full day before Treasury announced its rule on the exemption for volunteer workers such as firemen." "So when we said what we said, volunteer firefighters were still in danger," she said. But were they really in danger? Members of Congress had already gone to the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service last year, advocating for an exemption for volunteer firefighters. U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., also introduced legislation that would write an exemption for firefighters into law. His bill had 90 co-sponsors and bipartisan support. Our ruling The National Republican Senatorial Committee said that volunteer firefighters and communities they serve in Georgia and elsewhere could be devastated by Obamacare. But fixes to the problem were already under way. Those regulatory fixes, which are set to be put in place by 2015, seem to satisfy the volunteer firefighters in question. At minimum, it was premature for the National Republican Senatorial Committee to declare that firefighters and the communities they protect are "the latest Obamacare victims."

pomt-15132	Under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty "enrichment has been limited to basically the weapons states."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/03/dick-cheney/cheney-slips-key-nuclear-treaty/	President Barack Obama may have secured the Senate votes he needs to stymie congressional opponents to the Iran nuclear deal, but the criticism remains as vigorous as ever. Former Vice President Dick Cheney predicted that the deal would ignite a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. One of the agreement’s fundamental flaws, he said, is it allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium. "When they allow Iran to continue with enrichment, they are breaking one of the key requirements with respect to the nonproliferation treaty where enrichment has been limited to basically the weapons states," Cheney said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Sept. 2, 2015. "And here we are sanctioning giving enrichment capability to the Iranians." Given that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT, was designed in part to allow countries to pursue the peaceful use of atomic energy, Cheney’s claim struck us as dubious. Ratified by the United States in 1969, the treaty’s first two articles target the spread of nuclear weapons. Nations that already have nukes promise not to help other countries acquire them, and those without nukes promise not to try and get them. The fourth article lays down the ground rules for a peaceful nuclear program: Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with articles I and II of this Treaty. National representatives to a United Nations conference in 2000 to assess the treaty added a bit more detail about the peaceful use of nuclear energy in their final report: The Conference confirms that each country’s choices and decisions in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be respected without jeopardizing its policies or international cooperation agreements and arrangements for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and its fuel-cycle policies. Enriching uranium, as this diagram shows, is part of the nuclear fuel cycle. Source: International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament Daryl Kimball is executive director of the Arms Control Association, an organization that favors the current deal. Kimball refutes Cheney’s statement. "Former Vice President Cheney is incorrect in asserting that the NPT prohibits enrichment by non-nuclear weapon states," Kimball said. "Article IV of the treaty does not ‘allow it,’ nor does it prohibit it.’ " Brian Finlay, managing director of the Stimson Center, a defense policy group in Washington, also finds Cheney’s words problematic. "He is correct to say that France, the United States, Russia, China and the United Kingdom all have enrichment capacities," Finlay said. "But so do Germany, Japan, the Netherlands -- definitely not nuclear weapons states." Finlay noted that there is debate over whether Article IV grants Iran the right to enrich uranium. Some diplomats argue it only specifically grants a right to pursue peaceful uses. Whether that includes enrichment is left vague. However, under no reading does the treaty limit enrichment to nuclear-armed states. Finlay said unambiguously, "Cheney misspoke." We note that Cheney is correct that the deal with Iran allows it to continue to enrich uranium. In Annex 1 of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, one section specifically addresses enrichment. The first clause states that "Iran will keep its enrichment capacity at no more than 5060 IR-1 centrifuge machines in no more than 30 cascades in their current configurations in currently operating units at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant for 10 years." The next clause commits Iran to a maximum level of enrichment of 3.67 percent for 15 years. There are many more details, but the point is that Iran gets to run a system to enrich uranium. For the curious, bomb-grade uranium needs to be enriched to about the 90 percent point. However, as we’ve reported before, once uranium-235 is enriched to about the 4-5 percent level, that’s about two-thirds of the work needed to get it to 90 percent. You need about 25 kilograms of that highly enriched material to make one bomb. Supporters of the deal say there are enough inspections and safeguards in place to make sure that Iran doesn’t cheat. Critics obviously think otherwise. Our ruling Cheney said that a key piece of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is that only nuclear-armed states can have enrichment programs. The text of the treaty and subsequent international conferences say otherwise. While it’s debatable whether the treaty grants nations the right to enrich, if a non-nuclear nation wants to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, the treaty doesn’t stand in the way.

pomt-03861	Says 100,000 are on waiting list to attend Texas charter schools.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/mar/11/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-100000-are-waiting-list-attend-te/	Texas needs more charter schools, according to state Sen. Dan Patrick, because there are "100,000 families who are on the wait list." Actually, the Houston Republican gave the statistic a couple ways as he introduced legislation on that point Feb. 18, 2013, in a hearing of the Senate Education Committee, which he chairs. He first cited "100,000 families," then a few minutes later said, "155,000 students … are enrolled in charters; approximately, as I said, 101,000 are on the wait list." His Feb. 18, 2013, press release about the bill said nearly 100,000 parents were on charter school waiting lists. But 100,000 sounds like a lot of anybodies -- as Patrick indicated, that’s about two-thirds of charters’ actual enrollment. According to the state Sunset Commission, those 155,000 charter enrollees equal about 3 percent of Texas public school students. Are the lists that long? We didn’t field a response from Patrick spokesman Logan Spence, and Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us the state did not keep such numbers on charter schools, which receive public dollars but are privately managed and exempt from some education laws so they can try different approaches. Culbertson referred us to the Texas Charter Schools Association, whose spokeswoman Tracy Young emailed us waiting-list counts and some background on Texas charter schools in general. Young said that in August 2012, the association asked its members to report their waiting-list numbers, which totaled more than 101,000 students. Of about 175 charter licensees operating in Texas at the time, she said, 137 were members of the association; 67 of those responded to the survey. Those 67 charter operators accounted for 87 percent of Texas charter school students in 2012 -- 134,532 out of the total 154,278 -- according to the association. On a chart the group sent us, the 67 operators’ wait lists added up to 101,851 students. Two operators accounted for more than half the wait-listed students: Harmony Public Schools reported 44,942 children on wait lists, and IDEA Public Schools/Idea Academy Inc. reported 12,920. 15 largest waiting lists among TCSA members who responded to 2012 survey: Source: Texas Charter Schools Association Operators were asked to remove duplications among their own campuses, Young said. For example, if a child were on wait lists for six campuses run by a single operator, that operator would count the child only once in its total. Young said her group confirmed that at least the operators with the largest lists had filtered out such duplicative entries. But they did not, she said, have a way to "de-duplicate" children who might appear on more than one operator’s list. Under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the association could not collect students’ names and addresses, Young said, and school operators did not have a system to compare such individual data with each other. Still, she said, "We feel certain that it represents a good number of the students on waiting lists across the state." The association, which formed in 2008, last year sued the state to get public dollars for charter facilities and to allow more than 215 charter licenses in Texas. Charter school operators in 2012, according to an association fact sheet, ran 506 campuses educating 154,278 students. Texas charter schools overall have grown steadily since their inception in 1995, as shown by two charts from an August 2012 study commissioned by the Texas Business and Education Coalition, which used education agency data: Texas charter school enrollment, 1997-2011 Number of Texas charter schools, 1997-2011 Looking for other wait-list estimates, we found no current numbers. But we did spot two older reports from the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation that suggested waiting lists had grown along with enrollment in prior years. The reports, from August 2008 and Dec. 9, 2009, used education agency data and the foundation’s own research on open-enrollment charter schools (the largest category) and university charter schools to estimate that in 2007-08 there were 16,810 children wait-listed (compared with 89,156 enrolled), and for 2008-09 there were 40,813 children wait-listed (compared with 102,903 enrolled). Footnotes said that students could appear on more than one list, but also noted, "Some charter schools do not keep a waiting list even though demand exceeds supply." A chart in the 2009 report broke down the wait-lists by region: Our ruling Patrick said, variously, that 100,000 students, families or parents are waiting to get into Texas charter schools. The schools’ association says that’s a little lower than their estimate for students, and it’s plausible that families or parents could be trying to enroll more than one child apiece. The association’s survey only got responses from 67 charter operators, but those operators represented 87 percent of all Texas charter students in 2012. Their reported waiting lists were 75 percent the size of their total enrollment (that is, for every four kids enrolled, another three were reportedly trying to get in). If that ratio held true for the charter operators teaching the other 13 percent of Texas’ charter students (19,746 children), there would have been 14,809 students on those wait lists, yielding a total for all charter operators of 116,659. Then again, the association’s 101,851 wait-list head count could contain duplications, if students were trying to get into schools run by more than one charter operator.

pomt-08101	The Atlanta Braves are "the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in America."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/14/atlanta-braves/braves-go-back-back-back/	Most baseball fans, particularly in Atlanta, know about the Atlanta Braves' streak of 14 consecutive division championships between 1991 and 2005. We here at AJC PolitiFact Georgia won't talk about the fact that the Braves won just one World Series during that time. But few baseball fans are aware of another streak the Braves proudly claim: that they've stayed in business longer than any team in the country. The Braves make the claim on their website, saying they are "the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in America." Really? The Braves came to Atlanta from Milwaukee, but their roots go back even further, to Boston. The Braves are one of the original National League franchises, which began in the late 19th century. A claim that they are the longest-running sports franchise in America is obviously a source of civic pride for the Braves and Atlanta, if true. So, is it true? We were told two other teams, the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds, could dispute the Braves' claim. A Cubs official in their media relations office told us he used to work for the Reds and that they're the oldest franchise. He suggested we call the Reds Hall of Fame. Many believe the Reds are baseball's first franchise, and it appears that they are. In 1869, a former cricket player named Harry Wright organized a band of nine players that barnstormed the country playing a new game we now call baseball. The players dressed in white knickerbockers and wore flashy red hosiery. They were really good, or their opponents were really bad. The team, which became known as the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was 57-0. Wright played center field and managed the team and likely didn't take himself out of many games. He was eventually enshrined into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Red Stockings didn't play in 1871, but four of those players relocated to Boston that year and played in the National Association, winning the pennant from 1872 through 1875, according to Baseball Hall of Fame Library research director Tim Wiles. The team was known as the Boston Red Stockings. In 1876, a new league formed called the National League. The Red Stockings, or the Red Caps, as some called them, were part of the eight-team league. Wright was on the team. The team, the Braves say, eventually became known as the Beaneaters to connect with their Boston fan base -- and to avoid any confusion with the Cincinnati Reds. The Cincinnati team was expelled from the league in 1880 for, among other things, serving beer during their games. Meanwhile, the Beaneaters became a force in the National League, signing Mike "King" Kelly, the Babe Ruth of his day, for what was then a stunning $10,000. That salary, accounting for inflation, is about $250,000 today. In 1912, the Beaneaters changed their name to the Boston Braves. The franchise stayed in Beantown for another 40 years before moving to Milwaukee in 1953. The Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966. But let's go back to the Cubs for a second. The franchise's origins began in 1871 as the Chicago White Stockings. Wiles noted that the team didn't play in 1872 and 1873 because of the great fire of 1871, which killed about 300 people. One third of the city's 300,000 residents lost their homes in the blaze, according to the Encyclopedia of Chicago. The two years the Cubs lost to the fire gives the Braves the advantage to the claim of the oldest continuous franchise, says Wiles. "(The fire) makes Boston a strong historical organization," Wiles, a Cubs fan, conceded. The Boston Red Stockings were one of three teams to play all five seasons in the National Association, according to Baseball-Reference.com, a website that's used by many baseball writers. The others were the New York Mutuals and the Philadelphia Athletics. The Mutuals did not continue after 1876, according to the website. The Athletics stopped playing after 1876 and, after a couple of restarts, have been in business since 1901 and are playing in Oakland. The matter gets confusing when you look at Baseball-Reference.com's list of when each of today's 30 teams in Major League Baseball. It lists the first year for the Braves and Cubs as 1876. Sean Forman, president of Sports Reference LLC, the parent company of Baseball-Reference.com, said he does agree that the Braves franchise began in 1871. "It's pretty clear that they were a franchise," Forman said. MLB, Forman said, doesn't officially recognize the National Association. Why? "I'm not sure," Forman said. Wiles said he considers the National Association a professional sports league because the players were paid and the teams were organized. Bob Epling, a sports historian based in Cherokee County, also sides with the Braves, for many of the same reasons that Wiles stated. Epling doesn't believe there's a team in the three other major sports leagues in America that can make a claim. Football, he said, was semi-professional until the 1920s. The team now known as the Arizona Cardinals is believed to be the first pro football team. It began in Chicago in 1898 as the Morgan Athletic Club. Pro basketball first began in Trenton, N.J. in 1896, but the oldest continuously running teams in that sport didn't get their start until the 1940s. The Harlem Globetrotters, if you're curious, started in 1923. The National Hockey League began in 1917. "I might rate (the Braves' claim) pretty high on the Truth-o-Meter," said Epling, an associate professor of physical education and sport studies at Reinhardt University. The Cincinnati Red Stockings, which many people view as a predecessor of the Reds, are apparently baseball's first professional sports franchise. But that is not what the Braves claim. Regarding their claim to the title of "oldest continuous sports franchise in America," it does appear that the team's origins began with the Boston Red Stockings, who then joined what became the National League of Major League Baseball. The key word here is "continuous." We believe the Braves slid home safely on this one and rate their claim as True.

pomt-07468	"Full marriage equality [would provide same-sex couples] with about 1,700 rights."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/apr/17/bill-fischer/same-sex-marriage-advocate-says-full-marriage-equa/	In the debate over same-sex marriage, proponents have argued that proposals to create civil unions and other arrangements to mimic marriage are unacceptable. They contend that such measures fail to provide for the same rights and benefits received by couples in traditional marriage. One such proposal, which would allow any two unmarried persons in Rhode Island to establish "reciprocal beneficiary agreements" received a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee April 5. Bill Fischer, spokesman for the advocacy group Marriage Equality Rhode Island, said in an interview with The Journal that the proposal wouldn't come close to providing the full benefits of marriage to gay couples. And, he said, there are lots of benefits. "We've been asked a lot lately regarding full marriage versus civil union versus reciprocal benefits, what it actually means. And I think it’s important to note [that] reciprocal benefits would provide same-sex couples with approximately 15 rights, civil unions with about 600 rights, and full marriage equality with about 1,700 rights. There is a real distinction in approach," he said. Supporters of same-sex marriage often cite a large number of federal rights -- usually 1,100 or so -- that they say are denied to same-sex couples because gay marriage is not recognized under federal law. Many examples are substantive and well-documented. Gay couples lose out on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits that would normally go to a spouse. They can't transfer property between themselves without possibly incurring a tax penalty, a concern married couples don't face. They aren't protected by the COBRA law or the Family Medical Leave Act the way the spouse of an unemployed person is. Death benefits don't automatically go to the partner in a gay marriage the way they go to a widow or widower. But when we heard Fischer cite the 1,700 figure, we wanted to know if there really are 1,700 rights to be gained by being married. So we asked for the list. He said it was the combination of about 600 state and roughly 1,100 federal rights denied to gay couples in Rhode Island. To prove it, he sent us three documents. The first was a 1997 report from the U.S. General Accounting Office that, in the wake of the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, identified "1,049 federal laws classified to the United States Code in which marital status is a factor." Given the number of times the 1,100 number has been tossed around, we expected to see a specific analysis of each law cited, or at least some indication of what "right" was at stake. Instead, we were surprised to discover that the GAO had simply done a search of the U.S. Code to identify laws that use words or word fragments like "marr" (for marriage), "spouse," "widow" or "survivor." In fact, the report itself cautions that "some of these laws may not directly create benefits, rights, or privileges." It also warns that "no conclusions can be drawn … concerning the effect of the law on married people versus single people. A particular law may create either advantages or disadvantages for those who are married, or may apply to both married and single people." The second document was a 2004 update to that GAO report, which used the same methodology. The new tally: 1,138. So already, given the GAO’s methodology and multiple caveats, we were skeptical. But we decided to examine a sample of the laws the GAO identified. For this item, we are loosely defining "rights" to include benefits and privileges that people enjoy as a result of a law. We looked at 35 laws -- particularly the ones where their titles made us wonder whether the statute offered a real right, benefit or privilege for being hitched. We discovered that the GAO's cautionary language was well warranted. In most of the cases, 26 of the 35, the language, by our reading, does in fact give rights to people who are married, although some of the rights were pretty obscure: * A section of Title 2, Chapter 16 gives surviving spouses of current, past or future members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and other officials, the right to ask for an advisory opinion from the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards. * Title 15, Chapter 22, which deals with federal trademark law, does not allow anyone to trademark of the portrait of a deceased U.S. president as long as his widow survives, unless the former first lady gives permission. On the other hand, our spot check identified three laws that limited the rights of married people. For example, when considering eligibility for free or reduced-price school lunches, the government must, under Title 42, Chapter 13, consider the income of the spouse, if there is one. And six statutes, even if they mentioned marriage or spouses, didn’t seem to deny rights or benefits. Some examples: * A section under Title 42, Chapter 7, which outlines that an abstinence education program should teach, among other things, that "abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage [is] . . . the expected standard for all school age children." * The section under the immigration section of Title 8, which allows immigration officers to record whether a U.S. resident is married or single when they leave the United States via the border with Canada or Mexico. The provision also allows for the recording of whether the person can read or write, their occupation and other facts. Next, we turned to the third document supplied by Fischer: a listing prepared by Karen Loewy, a senior staff attorney at GLAD, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, citing 669 provisions in Rhode Island law and court rules. Here again, the list was compiled by searching for key words; in this case, the phrase "next of kin" and 16 marriage-related words. This time we randomly selected 10 items to check and applied the same standard. Five appeared to offer no special benefits to married couples. One law says there is no right of patient confidentiality in suspected cases of child abuse or neglect. A second requires the state registrar of vital records to send copies of marriage certificates to municipal clerks before the 10th day of the month. A third outlines how people can recover money from claims made in probate proceedings, and a fourth prohibits the sale, foreclosure or transfer of property in divorce proceedings without court approval if a child is receiving public assistance. The fifth law wasn't even a law at all. It had been repealed. It was included in the list because it had the word "divorce" in the original title. So out of the 45 federal and state laws we examined, 31 clearly offer a benefit for someone who is married. But under 3 other laws, a married person may actually face a disadvantage. And in the remaining 11 cases, it doesn't appear that the distinction affects people's rights at all, a fact the GAO itself acknowledged when listing federal statutes. When we informed Fischer about what we were finding, he referred us to Loewy, who said: "In every one of these statutes there's an equal protection violation." For example, the federal abstinence eduction program that talks only about traditional married couples could be jarring to the children of same-sex couples, she said. The fact that immigration officials aren't recognizing same-sex couples on a form (as they would traditional married couples) constitutes a difference in treatment. In fact, Loewy said, the laws that impose restrictions on the spouses in a traditional marriage also reflect a denial of rights to same-sex couples. We disagree. To assert that any law referring to "marriage" or "spouse" or "divorce" or a comparable term marks a point of discrimination and, as a result, warrants inclusion on the list strikes us as a stretch. If gay marriage proponents simply stated that marriage-related terms appear in 1,700 (or even 1,807) sections of state and federal law, there wouldn't be any debate. Instead, they cite each reference to marriage, spouse or a similar term as an example of a right denied to a gay couple. Fischer, in his defense, points out that he spoke of "about 1,700 rights," leaving him some wiggle room, since we checked only a fraction of the statutes. But because we could validate only 31 of the 45 items we did check, that suggests the number of lost rights could be significantly less than 1,700. Clearly, couples in a traditional marriage have benefits -- both significant and obscure -- that same-sex couples in a civil union or other arrangement do not. And even our spot-check of 45 statutes confirmed that in the majority of laws we checked. But when numbers like these are thrown around, we expect advocates to have more to back them up than a rudimentary word search that fails to say what right or benefit might be at stake. The assertion that federal law denies gay couples 1,100 federal and 600 state rights has not been proven because the technique used to reach the claim produced an unreliable total. For that reason, we rate Fischer's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14356	Nevada Republicans "didn’t do one single thing to cut spending" in 2015.	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/mar/22/danny-tarkanian/despite-new-taxes-legislature-didnt-forgo-spending/	Nevada lawmakers passed the largest tax increase in state history last summer, and its specter continues to loom over many 2016 contests. Republican state Senate majority leader and congressional candidate Michael Roberson, who played a key role in shepherding over $1 billion in new and extended taxes through the Legislature, is fending off attacks from his rivals in the 3rd Congressional District Republican primary. Some of the most pointed criticism comes from real estate owner and candidate Danny Tarkanian, who accused Roberson of failing to enact long-held conservative goals despite unprecedented Republican control of the state Legislature. Here’s what Tarkanian, son of famed UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, told Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston in February. "You don't raise taxes until you do everything you can to cut spending, and they didn't do anything to cut spending," he said. "For the first time in 89 years, the Republicans controlled the Assembly, state Senate and governor's office, they didn't do one single thing to cut spending, cut wasteful tax dollars that are being used, and instead they raised taxes." (The comment is 18 minutes into the interview.) Tarkanian has sought to cast himself as the anti-Roberson in the primary tussle, so we thought it was worth delving into last year’s budget battles to separate truth from fiction. Reached for comment by PolitiFact, Tarkanian backtracked from his comments on Ralston and said he was making a "general statement" in light of the historic tax increase. He said Republicans missed an opportunity to substantially restructure spending in areas like collective bargaining and the state’s public employee retirement system (PERS). "Because the GOP controlled both branches of the Legislature and the governor’s office for the first time in 89 years, for the first time in 89 years our state government could have made meaningful (substantive) cuts to government spending, and they should have before they raised taxes," he said in an email. Tarkanian’s comments do point to an interesting question -- what exactly did Nevada lawmakers do to reduce spending outside of the tax increase? There’s no easy way to compare spending cuts from one two-year budget to another. (Nevada’s part-time Legislature necessitates two-year budgets.) Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson, who chaired one of the legislative finance committees, requested that legislative staffers document spending cuts in response to questions from PolitiFact. Anderson said lawmakers cut an additional $150 million from "ineffective programs" in the two-year budget to free up funds for increased needs in areas like state spending for Medicaid. He said lawmakers tried to leverage most of the new spending towards K-12 education, and finessed other areas of the budget to avoid raising taxes even more. "Had we just left everything as is, and added our education spending, we would have to raise taxes that much more to cover everything," Anderson said. Republican Assemblywoman Jill Dickman, a finance committee member who voted against the tax increase, recalled roughly the same amount of cuts as claimed by Anderson and said lawmakers spent a huge amount of time reviewing spending and ways to save money. "That’s all we did, was go through the budget," she said Defining a "spending cut" can be subjective — lawmakers "cut" around $108 million from the governor’s recommended budget and "cut" from specific line items and programs, but it’s less clear if those translated into net savings. Either way, the savings make up a small percentage of the $7.3 billion two-year budget, especially including the $1.4 billion in new and extended taxes. Tarkanian said he didn’t mean to imply that no spending cuts at all were made, but instead bemoaned the wasted opportunity to create "substantive" changes in three areas: collective bargaining, public employee retirement benefits and prevailing wages (mandatory minimum pay for contractors on publicly-funded projects). Looking back at the legislative session, lawmakers generally backed more even-keeled legislation rather than sweeping changes favored by some Republican legislators. A wide-ranging effort dubbed "Union Armageddon" failed to make much headway, while a Roberson-sponsored bill changing several portions of collective bargaining law for school administrators and teachers passed with nearly unanimous support. Roberson also sponsored a widely supported bill amending the state’s public employee retirement system and helped usher through another effort lowering the prevailing wage on school construction projects (a concession from an earlier bill that eliminated it entirely). The right-leaning Nevada Policy Research Institute agreed with Tarkanian, and complained that some of Roberson’s bills only created "cosmetic changes," whereas other proposed Republican legislation had the potential to severely disrupt the status quo. "It’s easy to argue that none of these initiatives did much to pull back the wasteful spending of tax dollars, but they were certainly billed as attempts to do so," NPRI spokesman Michael Schaus said in an email. "The best I can say is that there were virtually no cuts to the largest drivers of state spending." Roberson’s campaign claims the PERS legislation, which slightly lowers benefits to new recipients and made several other changes, would save the system $1 billion every decade once fully implemented. But the vast majority of changes in the bill only apply to new employees, meaning it will take decades for any significant savings to be realized. The entitlement board testified that the legislation would have a "positive impact on the long term financing," but it couldn’t predict an exact savings amount due to the long time period in which the savings would take place. The campaign also noted that Roberson and other lawmakers cut more than $500 million from the state budget in 2011 to make up for sagging state revenues after the foreclosure crisis, making it difficult to find new areas to cut in 2015. Our ruling Tarkanian says that the Republican-controlled Legislature "didn’t do one single thing to cut spending" in the face of historic tax increases. Taken straightforwardly, Tarkanian’s claim isn’t true — lawmakers shaved off around $150 million in spending between the last two budgets, and approved several bills designed to rein in entitlement spending over the long run. There’s a sliver of truth in Tarkanian’s follow-up, as Republican legislative leadership generally stuck with less severe changes to major state spending drivers like collective bargaining and public employee retirement than what was prefered by more conservative groups and legislators. But to say lawmakers didn’t do anything to address spending isn’t accurate. We rate his statement as Mostly False.	None	Danny Tarkanian	None	None	None	2016-03-22T17:12:00	2016-02-09	['None']

pomt-13453	"One extra year of schooling for girls reduces infant mortality rates among their children by up to 10 percent."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/sep/15/ertharin-cousin/old-stat-girls-schooling-and-infant-mortality-fall/	In development circles, no one quibbles that it’s good to educate girls. There’s plenty of evidence that it helps them and if they become mothers, that it helps their children. The head of the United Nations' World Food Programme Ertharin Cousin was in Armenia on Sept. 5, 2016, to talk about the importance of child nutrition and in the course of her speech, she mentioned a talking point on this topic that has been in play for decades. "One extra year of schooling for girls reduces infant mortality rates among their children by up to 10 percent," Cousin said. It turns out, there are problems with Cousin’s claim. As often happens, this is a statement that has morphed over time, shifting from a more cautious assertion to a more definitive one. We’ll give you the highlights. The origins, changes to the 10 percent claim Staff at the World Food Programme told us they got their figure from UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. It was part of a 2011 collection of illustrations and talking points called Education Counts and this graphic was among them. It reads: "Each extra year of a mother’s schooling reduces the probability of infant mortality by 5% to 10%." Before we jump into stat forensics mode, it’s important to say that UNESCO has retired this talking point. The way they put it now in their 2016 global education monitoring report is, "Achieving universal secondary schooling would make a meaningful contribution to reducing infant and child mortality." In short, the new statement drops the precision of the old. Yet there are numbers that come along with that new, broader statement. "If all women in sub-Saharan Africa had upper secondary education by 2030, it would prevent 3.5 million deaths from 2050-60," UNESCO spokeswoman Katharine Redman told us. UNESCO’s wording clearly changed between 2011 and 2016 and it’s useful to note the details. They moved from talking about infant mortality to infant and child mortality. That’s important because the research on the tie between a mother’s education and the health of her children looked at the number of children who died before they turned 5 years old (child mortality), not the number who died before their first birthday (infant mortality). That research includes a seminal article from 1993, and a key 2010 survey of data from 175 countries that UNESCO in particular has relied on. Both found that more education for women is associated with lower child mortality rates. They did not measure infant mortality. So strictly speaking, UNESCO’s 2011 statement was a bit off when it came out. Does the distinction between infant and child mortality matter? It depends on who you ask. Health statistician Michael Stoto at Georgetown University said the two are highly correlated, so as one changed, so would the other. But Jishnu Das, a World Bank economist who studies both education and health, said in countries such as India, infant and child mortality rates take different paths. "The child mortality rate has consistently declined while the infant mortality rate is roughly the same over a fairly long time period," Das said. The difference has implications for the role of maternal education. Deaths in infancy, Das told us, tend to come from complications that hit within the first few days after birth. On the other hand, deaths up to the fifth birthday relate more to "what’s going on with the household." While the education level of the mother can improve the odds in both cases, Das said her decisions have a bigger impact on the health of older children. Knowing the importance of getting kids vaccinated and recognizing the danger of diarrhea are just two ways that can play out. UNESCO’s latest claim also backed away from the simple equation that each additional year of schooling would cut the child mortality rate. Instead, the agency now looks at the effect of blocks of education -- primary, lower secondary (middle school) and upper secondary (high school). So Cousin’s statement is relying on data that is no longer supported by its authors. But you can still find the organization’s old material on the Internet. Similarly, we noticed how the claim has morphed over time. In 1993, a Yale economist wrote "An added year of maternal education tends to be associated with a fairly constant percentage decline in child mortality rates .. between 5 and 10 percent. By 2004 researchers cited that work as "An extra year of girls’ education can reduce infant mortality by 5–10 percent." And by 2015, the same 1993 chapter was cited as saying "an extra year of girls’ education cuts infant mortality by 5 to 10 percent." The differences are subtle, but they all change the meaning of the statistic and the validity of supporting research. It’s not all education Researchers Das and Stoto both emphasized that so many aspects of life can be in flux as schooling increases that it’s tough to untangle the underlying dynamics. At the same time a country opens more classrooms for young women, it might also be building new health clinics and improving the local water supply. All those changes would give newborns and toddlers better odds of survival. Emily Hannum, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist, told us there can be many reasons for the association. "These could range from delayed marriage and increased age at childbearing, to lower fertility, to better access to or greater utilization of health care, to improved access to information about healthy parenting practices," Hannum said. Emmanuela Gakidou at the University of Washington is a key researcher in this field. Gakidou oversaw the 2010 research that supplied UNESCO with much of its data. Gakidou speaks cautiously about the impact of schooling on mortality rates. "It’s hard to ascribe causality, but the data and analyses on this topic are robust enough that I think we can say that education among women of reproductive age leads to improved child survival," she told us. "Other factors are also important, of course." Gakidou’s research did find that across the globe, one additional year of schooling is associated with a 10 percent decline in the child mortality rate, but Gakidou cautioned against thinking that would apply in any particular country. "That’s the average effect at the global level and across all levels of education," she said. Our ruling The head of the World Food Programme said that one extra year of schooling for girls reduces the infant mortality rates among their children by up to 10 percent. Broadly speaking, the association between more education of young women and better odds for their offspring is real. But this claim suffers from several flaws. It speaks of infant mortality when the underlying research addressed child mortality. It asserts a causal link when the data, while very suggestive, don’t fully prove the point. And it treated every year of schooling the same. Perhaps most important, UNESCO, the source that the World Food Programme relied on, has distanced itself from this statistic. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-01704	"More (student-athletes) graduate than the students who aren't student-athletes."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/10/mark-emmert/ncaa-president-student-athletes-graduate-more-ofte/	The line between amateur and professional for college athletes is up for grabs in the courts, but the NCAA continues to argue that its players are amateurs because they truly are students. Last week, a U.S. district court judge in California ruled against the college athletics association in a case filed by a former basketball player from the University of California at Los Angeles. The decision in Ed O’Bannon vs. NCAA said student-athletes cannot be banned from profiting off of their own names and likenesses. The NCAA plans to appeal the decision, at least in part, said president Mark Emmert on ABC News’ This Week Aug. 10. Emmert defended the athletes’ amateur status by emphasizing their academic successes. "Many, many, many thousands of student-athletes take full advantage of the opportunity to be both a student and an athlete while they’re in college," Emmert said. "The vast majority of them graduate. More graduate than the students who aren’t student-athletes. So I believe strongly, and more importantly, the evidence demonstrates that indeed they are students." With how much time student-athletes spend in practice, in games and on the road, we wondered if it’s true that they have higher graduation rates than their nonathlete peers. The rates The NCAA calculates its graduation success rate by tracking how many student-athletes graduate within six years of enrolling, including students who transfer between schools in good academic standing. Using this measurement, the NCAA Division I student-athlete graduation rate was 82 percent for students who enrolled in 2006 and graduated by 2012. In Division II, the graduation rate was 69 percent for the 2006 cohort. Division III schools aren’t required to disclose their graduation rates to the NCAA. But among those that did, the graduation rate for students who enrolled in 2005 was 88 percent. However, there is no general student body graduation data using the NCAA’s parameters. To show that the student-athlete graduation rate is higher than that of the student body, NCAA officials point to the federal graduation rate, which counts both student athletes and the general student body. It’s different than the NCAA measurement because it only counts students who graduate from the institution where they first enrolled and not transfer students. (The purpose is to measure retention.) To get an idea of the size difference between the two pools, the federal rate included 82,226 Division I student-athletes in 2012, and the NCAA rate included 91,701. The federal measurement tends to calculate a much lower student-athlete graduation rate than the NCAA’s measurement. Using this measurement, 65 percent of Division I student-athletes who enrolled in 2006 and graduated by 2012. This is only 1 percentage point higher than the general student body, which had a 64 percent graduation rate. The difference is a little bigger in the other divisions. Division II athletes had a graduation rate of 68 percent, while the general student body had a rate of 64 percent. For Division III (the 2005 cohort) the student-athlete rate was 54 percent compared with 48 percent generally. Researchers at the College Sports Research Institute at the University of South Carolina have also expressed concern that these calculations include part-time students in the general student body. Part-time students are less likely to graduate in the six-year time frame, bringing down an institution’s overall graduation rate. (The NCAA requires student-athletes to go to school full time.) The institute’s adjusted graduation rate calculations regularly show major negative gaps between Division I football and men’s basketball graduation rates and that of their nonathlete peers. Breaking it down further The graduation rates vary wildly by sport, school and demographic group. For example, compare men’s basketball and football (what often comes to mind when we think college sports) to the general student body and other student-athletes: Group NCAA grad rate Federal grad rate General student body n/a 64 percent All Div. I student-athletes 82 percent 65 percent Men’s basketball 70 percent 47 percent Football — bowl subdivision 70 percent 59 percent Football and basketball have the lowest graduation rates using the NCAA measurement. Additionally, more than half of the 18 women’s sports have graduation rates higher than 90 percent, while only one men’s sport — fencing — has a graduation rate above 90 percent. Under the federal measurement, the sports with the highest graduation rates are: men’s gymnastics with 88 percent, women’s gymnastics with 83 percent and women’s lacrosse with 80 percent. Some experts have taken issue with the NCAA’s claim because the graduation rates vary depending on the team, meaning one group’s success could mask another’s troubles. "Emmert is not referring to football and men's basketball, which is considerably lower," said Gerald Gurney, a former senior associate athletic director for academics at Oklahoma University. "The problem in college sports is not with the women's soccer team." Additionally, it’s difficult to compare the graduation rates and other academic successes of student-athletes to nonathletes because some programs keep their athletes up to NCAA academic standards "by any means necessary," said Dave Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University. He referenced the recent controversy at the University of North Carolina, where some football players were registered for fake classes to get easy As. "Keeping them eligible by any means necessary … might lead to graduation, but are they educated?" Ridpath said. Our ruling Emmert said, "more (student-athletes) graduate than the students who aren’t student-athletes." Experts, the government and the NCAA don’t agree on how this data should be calculated. But the best and most recent measurement we have for drawing a comparison shows that the graduation rate among Division I student-athletes is about the same as the general student body, though it is higher for Division II and Division II. But the graduation rates are not the same across all sports, divisions, schools or demographics, so a group with a particularly good or bad graduation rate could skew the overall results. Because the data is inconclusive, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Mark Emmert	None	None	None	2014-08-10T18:03:25	2014-08-10	['None']
pomt-08461	Says Steve Kagen "promised us jobs, voting for the $787 billion stimulus. Cost: another 77,000 jobs lost."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/republicans-say-stimulus-bill-supported-us-rep-ste/	Some folks are disappointed with the number of jobs created by the federal stimulus. But if the National Republican Congressional Committee is right, in Wisconsin, the stimulus is actually a jobs killer. Hmmm. The NRCC works to get Republicans elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. One Democrat it wants to take down in the 2010 campaign is two-term Rep. Steve Kagen of Appleton. He faces Republican challenger Reid Ribble on Nov. 2. In a TV ad, the NRCC aims to turn Kagen’s vote for the stimulus, and two other measures, against him. "Kagen promised us jobs, voting for the $787 billion stimulus," the announcer says, referring to Wisconsin. "Cost: another 77,000 jobs lost." When this is mentioned, a goofy image of Kagen giving two thumbs up pops up behind the Capitol building. Similar images -- including one pairing Kagen with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- are used to underscore the message that Kagen’s votes "cost Wisconsin dearly." The other votes cited are on the cap-and-trade bill and a vote to raise the debt limit. We homed in on the stimulus claim because it seems so counter-intuitive. To be sure, critics say the cost of the stimulus has bought too few jobs, and point out that unemployment has only grown worse. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, a leading conservative on budget matters, has said borrowing done as part of the stimulus will lead to "job-killing tax hikes" one day. But the NRCC is claiming Wisconsin has already lost 77,000 jobs because of the stimulus. "When I saw that ad," said Kevin Quinn, an economics professor at St. Norbert College in De Pere, "my response was that it was patently ridiculous." Hold on, professor. Let’s look and see. The ad starts by stringing together some correct information. Kagen supported the $787 billion stimulus (although that estimate has since been boosted to $814 billion by the Congressional Budget Office). And Wisconsin has had a net loss of more than 77,000 jobs since the measure became law in February 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. When asked for facts to back up the stimulus claim in the ad, Tom Erickson, Midwest press secretary for the NRCC, provided the citation on the job-loss figures. But when we called and e-mailed asking for evidence that the lost jobs were a result of the stimulus, he did not reply. Perhaps with good reason. In logic class, this one falls under the category that correlation does not prove causation. Think of it this way: Incidents of drowning may go up at the beach at the same time ice cream sales rise. That doesn’t mean ice cream causes you to drown. It may just mean more people are at the beach. Indeed, the consensus -- from several government and private-sector reports issued in 2010 -- is the stimulus has boosted employment. Directly and indirectly, the analysts conclude, the stimulus has created or saved more than 1 million, as many as 2.7 million, or even as many as 4.8 million jobs nationwide. In Wisconsin, the federal government counted 16,348 jobs directly funded by the stimulus in the most recent quarter (April through June 2010) reviewed. In total, according to the state, the stimulus has created or retained 63,000 jobs in Wisconsin. Let’s return to Quinn, the outraged economics professor. He said he is not supporting either candidate in the Kagen-Ribble race. It’s fair to question how efficient the stimulus has been, Quinn said, but there is no debate it has created jobs, both directly and indirectly. And even though joblessness in Wisconsin has risen, it would have been worse without the stimulus injection, he said. Quinn said the only way he could conceive of arguing that the stimulus killed jobs is if it increased taxes. But it didn’t. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have reported, of the original $787 billion, $499 billion was to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, and about $288 billion -- or 36 percent -- was in tax breaks. So is Quinn alone in his views? No. "A broad spectrum of economists would say that the stimulus cannot have cost jobs," said Laura Dresser, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy (yes, COWS) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "The recovery spending increased demand in the economy, and that creates jobs directly, or indirectly, or saves jobs." Some jobs are created or saved because they are funded directly by stimulus money, Dresser explained. And others are created and saved indirectly, she said -- partly as a result of spending done by people holding stimulus-funded jobs who would otherwise be unemployed. We won’t add on any more economists. In issuing its attack against Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen, the National Republican Congressional Committee said the federal stimulus bill cost Wisconsin 77,000 jobs. The two things may have happened in the same time frame, but that does not mean one caused the other. Indeed, there is plenty of evidence the stimulus has created jobs. Here’s a more direct formula: Twisted logic + lack of evidence = Pants on Fire.	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2010-10-14T09:00:00	2010-10-03	['None']
pomt-13073	"The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-new-york-times-apologized-bad-co/	President-elect Donald Trump doesn’t think the New York Times has been fair to him. Amid a series of tweets criticizing the New York Times, Trump said the news organization wrote a letter to readers after the election, apologizing for their "bad coverage" of him. "The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?" Trump tweeted Nov. 13. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s tweet is a distorted and over-the-top description of a Nov. 13 letter to readers from the New York Times’ publisher and executive editor. The 200-word letter primarily serves to thank readers for their loyalty and to say that New York Times will "rededicate" itself to the high journalistic standards it has employed thus far. Nowhere in the letter did the authors write anything like an apology. Nor did they say that the organization’s overall coverage of Trump was "bad." Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said Trump was referring to the fact that the letter includes an admission that the New York Times underestimated Trump’s chances. The letter said the outcome was "unexpected" and posed the rhetorical question: "Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?" At times during the election, the New York Times presidential poll forecast predicted Hillary Clinton had more than a 90 percent chance of winning the election, and that turned out to be incorrect. "Doesn’t that speak volumes about the coverage?" Cheung said of the inaccurate predictions at the New York Times and elsewhere. "It wasn’t just a disservice to President-elect Trump, but it’s also a disservice to the voters looking for reliable coverage — which they obviously didn’t get during the election." But predictions and polling are just two aspects of the New York Times’ Trump coverage throughout the campaign season. They also broke the story that he likely didn’t pay federal income taxes for years, on top of stories about women who claimed Trump groped them. On the other side, the New York Times also broke the news that Clinton used a private email server. The letter from publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet praised the organization’s work overall. It said reporters consistently covered the election "with agility and creativity" and that they will cover the new president with "the same fairness, the same level of scrutiny, the same independence" that they already do. So it’s a stretch to say the letter’s line about an inaccurate prediction is an admission of "bad coverage" of Trump overall, nor is it an apology. A spokeswoman for the New York Times told PolitiFact: "We're incredibly proud of our coverage of the 2016 campaign. There was no suggestion either in our note to staff, or the note to subscribers, that we were apologizing." Certainly, the New York Times and other media outlets are reflecting on their coverage from the year and why they so underestimated Trump’s support. The New York Times public editor Liz Spayd, for example, wrote Nov. 9 that reporters could have done more to immerse themselves in Trump supporters’ lives. Our ruling Trump said, "The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me." The New York Times sent a letter to subscribers thanking them for their loyalty and promising to provide strong coverage of Trump going forward. While the letter does note that the New York Times underestimated support for Trump, it does not say their coverage of him throughout the campaign was bad. In fact, the letter praises New York Times reporters’ work. The note does not include any semblance of an apology. We rate Trump’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f2054f27-8478-407c-9196-35f65372025d	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-15T11:18:19	2016-11-13	['None']
pomt-02714	"Most of the (Affordable Care Act) has already in some sense been waived or otherwise suspended."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/22/george-will/george-will-says-most-health-care-law-has-been-wai/	President Barack Obama announced last week that people who had their health insurance canceled can now purchase a bare bones plan that only covers major medical expenses without facing the threat of a fine. It’s a significant change for some, and one of several ways the administration has altered some provisions of the law. How much tinkering has gone on? Fox political commentator George Will offered this analysis on Fox News Sunday. "At this point, it’s very hard to quantify, (but) perhaps most of the law has already in some sense been waived or otherwise suspended," Will said. "The president said this week that the suspensions of the employer mandate, the individual mandate, etc., etc., etc., do not go to the core of the law. If not that, what is the core of the law?" For this fact-check, we will take a stab at quantifying the steps the law set out to do so we can determine if, as Will said, most of the law has been waived or suspended. Delays and modifications There have been a number of modest administrative changes, including giving people an extra week to sign-up for coverage to begin in January and giving insurance companies an extra month at the end of next year to set premiums. There have also been some significant alterations. This summer, Obama delayed by a year a requirement that all companies with 50 or more employees provide their workers health care coverage. And in the fall, when a wave of cancellation notices appeared in the mailboxes of Americans who bought coverage directly from insurance companies, Obama gave states the option to let people stay on those plans through next year -- even though the plans did not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act. In some ways, the move this week was a way to supplement that relief for people who wanted more options. Comparing head counts Of all the changes, the most recent one seems likely to touch the most lives. Obama said his staff estimated that about 500,000 people might want a high-deductible, catastrophic plan. We have seen credible estimates that about 4 million people saw their plans canceled but some have now found replacement coverage. In reality, we won’t know the full scope of this policy shift for several months. The next-biggest impact stems from the delay in the employer mandate. Analysts with the RAND Corporation, a respected, independent research group, recently estimated that about 300,000 fewer people would have coverage as a result. While these figures are only estimates, they show that the changes -- while perhaps significant -- affect only a small portion of people in the health insurance market. About 365,000 people purchased insurance through the federal marketplace through November and another 800,000 were found eligible for Medicaid, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Obama said another 500,000 people had signed up for health insurance in December. Other parts of the law are affecting many more Americans. The law added about 3.1 million young adults to their parent’s health care plans. A requirement that insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of every premium dollar on actual health care affected the health care policies of about 77 million people in 2012, according to government figures. That resulted in about $3.4 billion in rebates, coverage adjustments or policy enhancements. Starting in 2011, the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit became more generous. More than 35 million people participate in that program. Looking at the individual mandate, the Urban Institute, a Washington academic policy group, estimated that it would hit about 18 million people. That dwarfs the 500,000 the administration believes will take advantage of the catastrophic coverage option. Our ruling With all the talk about problems with the health care law, it’s easy to forget just how many corners of health insurance policy the law affects. Will seemed guilty of that on Fox News Sunday when he said most of the law has been waived or suspended. Obama has made at least two major course corrections in the law. He delayed the employer mandate by one year and allowed individuals dealing with canceled plans to buy insurance that fails to meet minimum standards under the law. One way to put these changes into context is to look at the number of people they affect. While precise data are missing, the combined impact could be in the range of 1 million Americans. On the other side of the ledger, 3.1 million young adults have gained access to coverage through the law, another 18 million people are subject to the individual mandate and millions more have benefited from requirements that health insurance companies spend premiums on care.

pomt-13207	"Because as a Senator Toomey stood up for Wall Street. He wanted to privatize Social Security and invest it in the stock market. Wall Street would make billions in fees even if the stock market crashed. "	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/oct/21/afscme/story-behind-attack-ads-blast-pat-toomeys-plan-soc/	Opponents of Senator Pat Toomey are making sure his past ideas about Social Security stay front and center. Social Security, of course, was a much hotter topic a few years ago. Many Republicans, including former President George W. Bush, pushed for allowing younger workers to contribute portions of payroll taxes into government-approved private mutual fund accounts. It was a movement for a partial privatization of Social Security. But that plan never gained much traction and lately politicians on both sides of the aisle have been reluctant to talk about privatizing Social Security and have instead focused on other means of reform or at least used less divisive terminology than "privatization." A recent ad from AFSCME throws Toomey into this mix. It accuses him of previously favoring the privatization of Social Security and, yes, uses the dreaded p-word: "Because as a senator Toomey stood up for Wall Street. He wanted to privatize Social Security and invest it in the stock market. Wall Street would make billions in fees even if the stock market crashed." We’ll break down this fact check into two parts: Toomey’s previous beliefs on Social Security privatization and then whether Wall Street would in fact make billions off such a plan. Ted Kwong, a spokesperson for Toomey, said over email Toomey once supported younger people placing portions of their payroll taxes into "government-regulated private accounts." (He did not answer a question about the Senator’s current position on Social Security privatization). This is backed up in several past interviews conducted with Toomey. Shortly after he was elected to the Senate, a New York Times article noted he intended "to continue to push for allowing young people to invest part of their Social Security payroll tax." Toomey told the Scranton Times-Tribune in 2010 workers on the verge of retirement would be guaranteed their current benefits. In his book, The Road to Prosperity, he laid out his beliefs in greater detail (Yes, Toomey has a book. It’s currently ranked 1,491,962 on Amazon’s top-seller list). Toomey wrote that older workers would continue to use the current Social Security system, "But younger workers should be given a choice. Those who would prefer to stay in the current system should be allowed to do so….Others, however, should be free to deposit a portion of the payroll taxes they already pay into personal savings account instead of sending their hard-earned money to Washington." In the book, Toomey gave an example of a beneficiary of this program as a young worker who could invest this portion of the payroll tax "in a bundle of stocks and bonds" and earn a much higher return than Social Security. In other words, he would want the worker to invest the money. That’s where Wall Street comes in. Right now, payroll tax for Social Security goes to a trust fund that is then invested into special securities overseen by the U.S. Treasury that are only available for the trust fund. Max Skidmore, author of The American System of Social Security: Separating Fact From Fallacy, said the administrative costs of this system are effectively nothing. They are less than one cent per dollar. That wouldn’t be the case with investments in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. If somebody were allowed to take a portion of their payroll tax that would normally go to Social Security and invest it, they would face much higher administrative fees. Skidmore said it would be difficult to estimate, but the total could easily reach the billions if many people were to opt for a personal account as proposed by Toomey and others. Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, said these fees would be comparable to what Americans see with their 401(k)’s, which have administrative fees. A University of Chicago study estimated if Social Security was partially privatized in one of the plans proposed by Bush fees paid to banks could be as high as $940 billion over 75 years. As for whether Toomey’s plan of letting only younger workers put a portion of their payroll tax into a personal account should still be considered privatization, Munnell said yes. "When people were discussing this issue," she said, "that is what was being discussed." Our ruling A recent AFSCME ad claimed Pat Toomey supported Social Security privatization during his time as Senator: "Because as a senator Toomey stood up for Wall Street. He wanted to privatize Social Security and invest it in the stock market. Wall Street would make billions in fees even if the stock market crashed." In the past, PolitiFact has tried to emphasize the difference between privatization and partial privatization because Democratic and Republican politicians have tried to distort it. Toomey has not supported full privatization, which would mean completely overhauling the system so everyone’s proceeds of the payroll tax would go to personal accounts that could be privately invested. This ad doesn’t give the full picture. It doesn’t say he was for full privatization but also doesn’t make clear the difference between full and partial privatization. Toomey has supported partial privatization of Social Security. In the plan he wrote about -- and plans favored by past politicians -- young workers were expected to invest in stocks and mutual funds that are synonymous with Wall Street. The companies with whom people did their investing would earn sizable fees.

pomt-11710	"Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/19/truthcommandcom/no-fda-didnt-hide-information-linking-vaccine-auti/	The federal government tried to hide that a common vaccine given to children causes autism, according to a misleading viral story on Facebook. "Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism," stated a headline on truthcommand.com. The story stated: "For years, fears over vaccines and the onset of autism have been dispelled by medical professionals, but this has all changed. Parents over the years have been criticized for abstaining from getting their child vaccinated over autism fears, but now it turns out they were right all along." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the website misled readers about information related to the potential adverse side effects of the DTaP vaccine Tripedia manufactured in the past by Sanofi Pasteur. DTaP, a vaccine given to children in multiple doses, stands for Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, getting those diseases is much riskier than getting the vaccine. Mild problems such as a fever or swelling are common, while severe problems such as a serious allergic reaction are so "rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine." The internet has been fueled with misinformation for years about a vaccine-autism link. A 1998 article in a British medical journal, the Lancet, claimed to show a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism but in 2010, the Lancet retracted the study. Scientists have repeatedly debunked the myth that vaccines cause autism through peer-reviewed studies. And yet, the spread of misinformation continues -- including by Donald Trump before and during his race for president. Vaccine pamphlet on adverse side effects Truthcommand.com stated that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration admitted that autism is a potential side effect in an online pamphlet about Tripedia: "Adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting." But that section also includes a disclaimer about adverse events: "Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine." Through the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), anyone can file a report: doctors, patients, family members -- and they don’t need proof that the event was caused by the vaccine. Government researchers examine the reports and turn over anything suspicious to outside groups, such as the Institute of Medicine for more research. Marie McCormick, an expert on child health at the Harvard School of Public Health, told PolitiFact that the reporting system can be gamed. When the measles-thimerosal-autism controversy first emerged, activists encouraged parents to report adverse events regardless of the duration of time since the vaccination and prior events such as previous indications of developmental problems. What happened to the pamphlet on FDA’s website Truthcommand.com suggested that the FDA had tried to hide the autism link by deleting this pamphlet from the FDA’s website. But the FDA told PolitiFact that the pamphlet written by Sanofi Pasteur in 2005 wasn’t actually deleted -- the FDA archived it and sent PolitiFact a link to the pamphlet. It’s no surprise that the pamphlet was archived on the FDA’s website because the vaccine hasn’t been available for many years. Cristine K. Schroeder, a spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur, told PolitiFact that the company’s last shipment of Tripedia occurred in 2012. "Tripedia is not in use today," she said. The company’s pamphlets for current vaccines for DTaP, Daptacel, Pentacel and Quadracel, do not list autism as a potential adverse event. They do show data from clinical trials about side effects such as the percentage of children who got a fever, or became drowsy. Tripedia was originally licensed by the FDA in the early 1990s, FDA spokeswoman Megan McSeveney told PolitiFact. The drug maker had to follow what was at the time broad label requirements for adverse events. More recent federal regulations about drug labeling approved in 2006 are now more narrow and state that the only adverse events that have to be reported are those "for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event." The scientific evidence does not support a link between any vaccine, including Tripedia (DTaP), and autism or other developmental disorders, McSeveney said. The truthcommand.com website states that it aims "to raise awareness to issues ignored by the media." We contacted the email address listed on the website and did not get a reply. Part way through our reporting the story was no longer accessible on the website. The misleading story has circulated at least since March 2016 when Snopes debunked it. Truthcommand.com stated "Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism." But the FDA did no such thing.

pomt-09343	"Giving money to politicians has paid off for Paul Workman. Workman gave thousands to politicians and got millions in government construction projects."	false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/07/holly-turner/turner-says-workman-gave-thousands-political-candi/	Paul Workman and Holly Turner are jockeying for votes before their April 13 runoff to be the Republican nominee for the Texas House District 47 seat in southwestern Travis County, which includes part of Austin. Turner took the fight to TV March 31, debuting a hard-hitting ad that accuses Workman of donating to politicians and getting construction contracts. "Giving money to politicians has paid off for Paul Workman," a narrator says. "Workman gave thousands to politicians and got millions in government construction projects." To support this charge, Turner’s campaign sent over a list of projects handled by Workman Commercial Construction Services, which Workman founded. Turner’s spokesman, Craig Murphy, cited Workman’s contributions to several Williamson County officials: commissioners Ron Morrison ($250 in 2006), Lisa Birkman ($1,250 since 2004), and Valerie Covey ($500 total in 2006 and 2007) and County Judge Dan Gattis ($100 in 2010). Murphy also pointed to a real estate firm, T. Stacy & Associates, where Workman is director of development. Murphy noted the firm’s Web site lists the state of Texas among 40 featured clients. We also looked at Workman’s estimated $15,010 in political donations since 2000 to candidates for state office and political groups, according to records kept by the Texas Ethics Commission. Through this year, Workman has donated $9,740 to 20 individual candidates — about $1,500 to Democrats and $8,240 to Republicans. Overall, the Austin chapter of the Associated General Contractors PAC was Workman’s top recipient, fielding $2,790 in the period, followed by the Texas Building Branch Associated General Contractors PAC ($1,780), then-state Rep. Joe Nixon ($1,500) and Gov. Rick Perry ($1,390). Next, we reviewed 16 construction projects that Murphy cited on Workman Commercial’s Web site. Among them: Dripping Springs Elementary School, Lake Travis High School, Williamson County Regional Park, the Williamson County Justice Center, the Crowley Justice Center, the Boswell High School Dance and Cheer Center, the Irving Valley Ranch Library, Texas A&M University Langford Architecture building, and the Cypress Fairbanks-Leider, Bonham and Neff elementary schools. The Austin Business Journal reported in 1997 that Workman Commercial had earned $12.7 million doing work for the Austin Independent School District, and the American-Statesman reported in 2006 that Workman’s company had received about $14.5 million from Williamson County for various projects since 1998. Eric Bearse, Workman’s spokesman, said: "Workman Commercial built two projects in Williamson County — a park and a courthouse. They were two separate projects, both bid publicly. And (in each case) they were the low bidder." Connie Watson, a public information officer for Williamson County, confirmed that the contracts were let through competitive bidding, which Watson said the county requires for all construction and road projects. County commissioners ultimately award the contracts, based on a company’s bid, experience and other factors, she said. (We don’t know whether Workman donated to local school board members in school districts where he won contracts. Workman said he didn’t recall making any contributions, and we didn’t check board members’ finance reports, which are stored in each school district’s headquarters.) Additionally, Workman told us there was no connection between his political donations and his government contracts. In 1997, he told the Austin Business Journal that a contribution such as $250 to Commissioner Morrison "does not influence a politician; it may just get us to the point where we could get a phone call answered if we need to see them about something." Murphy, of Turner’s camp, told us: "People don’t make contributions to local county commissioners for nothing. It’s in the law to have competitive bidding but that doesn’t stop people from doing their best to influence these decision-makers." Murphy reminded us that Turner’s TV ad also says Workman admitted he donated to Democrats in order to benefit his business. According to Murphy, Workman said so during a Feb. 26 debate when another House candidate, David Sewell, asked about his contributions to Democratic candidates. (Investigating a separate claim in February, we found that Workman donated to Democratic candidates seven times — $1,500 total since 2000.) "Workman said he did not share values with those Democrats, he was making contributions to benefit his business," Murphy said. Sewell, who has since endorsed Workman, said he didn’t remember his question or Workman’s response. We could not confirm that the exchange took place. "We are not claiming he made bribes," said Murphy. "Was there a quid pro quo? No way to know that." We agree: There’s no way to know. It’s undisputed that Workman has contributed thousands to political candidates — both local and statewide — and that his company has handled government construction projects worth millions. But that doesn’t mean Workman’s donations "paid off" in contracts for his companies, and Turner offers no evidence of that. We rate her loaded statement as False.

pomt-00471	Says she is "the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2018/aug/14/kyrsten-sinema/fact-checking-kyrsten-sinemas-claim-about-medicare/	In the Arizona race to replace outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, Democratic contender Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is pointing to her stance on Medicare and Social Security to separate herself from other candidates and win seniors’ votes. "She understands that Medicare and Social Security aren’t line items in a budget for politicians to cut – they’re benefits Arizonans have earned through a lifetime of hard work," Sinema said on her campaign website. "Kyrsten is committed to protecting benefits for current seniors and future generations, and she’s the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age." Arizona’s primary election is Aug. 28. Sinema is the Democratic frontrunner. The top Republican challengers are Rep. Martha McSally, former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward, and Joe Arpaio, the controversial Maricopa County sheriff pardoned by President Donald Trump. Is Sinema "the only" Arizona Senate candidate refusing to make cuts to Medicare, Social Security or to raise the retirement age? Sinema’s team in response to PolitiFact’s query narrowed down the claim to Sinema and McSally, saying they were the only two "who have had to vote on entitlements" and that the wording on Sinema’s website didn’t make a determination about "what others may claim they will (or won’t) do." While Sinema has a record of supporting Medicare and Social Security benefits, we found that her claim overplays the impact of some nonbinding measures voted on by her and McSally. Both lawmakers at times also voted the same way. McSally has generally been perceived as a moderate Republican (though she’s embraced a more conservative voice in the primary race), and Sinema bills herself as "one of the most independent voices in Congress." Comparing Sinema’s and McSally’s voting record Sinema’s campaign pointed to McSally’s and Sinema’s voting record on motions and concurrent resolutions — although those votes did not directly stop or allow changes to Social Security, Medicare, or the retirement age. For instance, Sinema’s team pointed to a January 2017 concurrent resolution setting a budget blueprint for fiscal year 2017; Sinema voted against it, McSally for it. Its main purpose was to facilitate repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But the resolution did create the possibility of making changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he specializes in Medicare, Social Security, and health coverage issues. Still, budget resolutions even if they pass do not become law; they lay out a plan. Budget resolutions also don’t affect Social Security — at least not directly — because there are rules against it, Van de Water said. Sinema’s team pointed to McSally and Sinema’s stance on transitioning Medicare to the Republican-favored "premium support" program, or "vouchers" as Democrats critically call it. Under the premium support/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the premium support/voucher approach is to reduce the growth in Medicare spending. Arguments against the switch include concerns that it would shift more costs to beneficiaries over time. Van de Water told PolitiFact that a premium support/voucher system would in most cases make traditional Medicare more expensive relative to the Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare plans offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare). It’s fair to say that voting for a premium support/voucher system would be, at least in principle, a vote for cuts in Medicare, Van de Water said. McSally has cast votes for motions and resolutions that would support a premium support/voucher program or restructure Social Security, and raise the retirement age, Sinema’s team said, pointing to roll-calls and media reports. Sinema’s campaign also said that in 2013, Sinema and other lawmakers wrote to former President Barack Obama urging him to reject any budget proposal that would raise the retirement age or cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits, specifically mentioning "Chained CPI" (an inflation adjustment measure). As PolitiFact Florida reported, a proposal to use chained CPI for inflation would not have lowered seniors’ Social Security checks, but their checks would have grown at a slower rate. The impact of the proposal would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that became law, PolitiFact Florida found in a similar gubernatorial race fact-check. Sinema’s campaign also said McSally voted in favor of the tax cuts Trump signed into law late 2017 (Sinema voted against), saying they will lower Medicare and Social Security’s projected revenue. We’ve rated Half True claims linking the tax cuts to Medicare and Social Security’s future payments. The tax cuts are projected to increase the deficit, and some Republicans have called for entitlement reform to address it. Experts say that potential changes or "cuts" to Medicare and Social Security would not be just because of the tax cuts. The programs already are on an unsustainable trajectory. While it's common for a candidate to attack another for trying to do anything to bring the systems into balance, the bottom line is that either Congress will have to slow the growth of the program, raise taxes, or both. Asked about Sinema’s position to ensure the program's financial viability in the future, her campaign didn’t give specifics, saying only that Sinema "believes we need to protect Medicare and Social Security benefits, weed out waste, fraud and abuse, and work together to ensure that the program is able to fulfill its long-term commitments to current and future retirees." There are instances where McSally’s and Sinema’s votes aligned. Sinema in April 2015 voted for a motion instructing House conferees to agree with the Senate in preventing Medicare from becoming a "voucher program," Sinema’s campaign said. The roll call shows McSally voted the same way. Both lawmakers in October 2017 also voted against a budget proposal that called for "slashing trillions from domestic and foreign-affairs programs and entitlements including Medicare and Medicaid, repealing the Affordable Care Act and changing Social Security," Tucson.com reported. McSally’s campaign did not push back on Sinema’s claims about McSally’s record. Instead, it spotlighted Sinema’s own record. One example McSally’s campaign provided: Sinema in April 2018 voted in favor of a "balanced-budget amendment," which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described as "an act of breathtaking hypocrisy and an open assault on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security," and one "purpose-built to force devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security." McSally also voted in favor of the proposal. It did not pass. While Sinema’s team said her website’s claim was only directed toward McSally, other candidates in the race, including Republicans Ward and Arpaio, told PolitiFact they opposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and raising the retirement age. Sinema’s Democratic opponent in the primary, civil rights attorney Deedra Abboud, also said she was against cuts to seniors’ benefits or raising the retirement age. Our ruling Sinema on her campaign website said she is "the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age." The website’s claim is broad; Sinema’s team said McSally was its target. While some votes cast by McSally could have indirectly led to cuts in Medicare and a restructuring of Social Security, those votes were for not for measures that would have become law. They were for non-binding resolutions and motions. McSally’s and Sinema’s votes have aligned at times to protect entitlement programs — McSally has been considered a moderate Republican, and Sinema touts having an independent voice. In one instance, they both voted in favor of an amendment that Pelosi said would cut Medicare and Social Security. We rate Sinema’s claim Half True.

pomt-10818	"Obama Skips Out On Condemning Left-Wing Attacks On Gen. Petraeus Despite Casting Other 'Important Votes' Earlier And Later In The Day."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/21/republican-national-committee-republican/maybe-he-had-a-lunch-date/	Political candidates and parties take plenty of cheap shots, but this isn't one of them. The Republican National Committee is correct that Sen. Barack Obama of Illinios, a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, skipped a vote Thursday, Sept. 20, 2007, on a resolution meant to condemn the anti-war group MoveOn.org for an advertisement bashing Army Gen. David Petraues, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq. The RNC release also correctly notes that Obama canceled a town hall meeting in Rock Hill, S.C., to stay in Washington for "important votes on the future of America's presence in Iraq." It's not uncommon for members of Congress to miss votes because meetings can overlap with floor votes. But in this case, floor action on Iraq dominated the schedule, and Obama participated in the two Senate votes before and after the vote on the MoveOn resolution: At 11:58 a.m., the Senate voted on an alternative resolution calling for support for the U.S. military. Obama voted yea. It passed. At 12:35 p.m., the Senate voted on the MoveOn resolution. Obama did not vote. It passed. At 2:54 p.m., the Senate voted on an amendment to a defense bill that sought to end most funding for the war in Iraq by June. Obama voted yea. It failed. In a statement, Obama said he didn't vote on the resolution because it was a "stunt." President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress have been fighting Democratic attempts to end the war in Iraq. They have seized on the MoveOn ad, published last week in the New York Times, in hopes of turning public sentiment against anti-war groups, and by extension their Democratic allies. The full-page ad said "Gen. Petraeus or Gen. Betray Us?" and questioned whether the general's report to Congress on progress in Iraq would be influenced by the White House. MoveOn has leveraged its 3-million members to help drive opposition to the war, and in the process the group has become a powerful Democratic ally and fund-raiser. Among other presidential hopefuls, Sens. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn., voted against the MoveOn resolution, while Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sam Brownback, R-Kan., voted for it. Another contender, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., also missed the vote, but he was absent from all votes Thursday. The resolution was offered by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and it passed 72 to 25. Here's the text: "To express the sense of the Senate that General David H. Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq, deserves the full support of the Senate and strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all members of the United States Armed Forces." An alternative, offered by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., also passed, 50 to 47. All the Republicans opposed it, while all Democrats, including Obama, voted for it. Here's the text: "To reaffirm strong support for all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and to strongly condemn attacks on the honor, integrity, and patriotism of any individual who is serving or has served honorably in the United States Armed Forces, by any person or organization."

pomt-08924	"My 7-step plan" creates 700,000 jobs in 7 years.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/26/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-7-7-7-plan-create-700000-jobs-sev/	Rick Scott, a Republican running for governor, is scurrying across Florida touting a new economic plan to create 700,000 jobs in seven years. The plan relies heavily on cutting government spending, eliminating state regulation, reducing property taxes for homeowners and phasing out the state's business income tax. (See it here.) "I am the only candidate in this race with a comprehensive plan that will get our fiscal house in order, balance the budget and create long-term, good-paying jobs," Scott says introducing the plan, which is sometimes called the "7-7-7" plan. "My 7-step plan isn't complex. In fact, it's very simple. And it's common sense. "I've created jobs in the private sector. As governor, my 7-step plan will create 700,000 in 7 years." PolitiFact Florida steers clear of trying to fact-check opinions -- so we won't in this item analyze Scott's claim that he is the only candidate running for governor with a comprehensive fiscal plan. Scott's primary opponent, Bill McCollum, does have an economic plan, for the record, and so does Democrat Alex Sink. We also avoid checking things in the future we can't know -- so no weighing in on Scott's 700,000 jobs promise. But we can get our fact-checking hands around a more basic question: Does Scott's plan -- however it was crafted and however logical or illogical it may be -- actually call for the creation of 700,000 jobs in seven years? It's a point worth knowing, particularly when McCollum says his plan will add 500,000 jobs, or 200,000 less than Scott. (To be fair, we plan to look at McCollum's numbers in a subsequent report). The glossy printed version of the plan that's displayed on Scott's campaign website and has been handed out across the state breaks down job growth by: if the state adopts Scott's regulatory reforms; if the state phases out the income tax on businesses; and if the state better focuses on job growth and retention. Let's take one at a time. Regulatory reform Scott's plan includes a freeze on new regulation, a promise to expedite permits for job-creating businesses, working to move Florida's health insurance costs in line with the national average, and somehow shaving electricity costs by $3.25 billion. Reducing those barriers will create 240,000 new jobs, Scott says. Phasing out corporate income tax Scott says eliminating the corporate income tax "will have a minimal effect on state revenues." But the state collected almost $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2009-2010 through the corporate tax, which was about 2.7 percent of the $66.5 billion state budget in 2009-2010. Combined with other tax and spending reforms, Scott says the elimination of the corporate income tax will create 365,000 new jobs. Focusing on job growth and retention Scott's plan is to invest in a state Innovation Fund to help attract high-tech businesses. He also says he'll take a more hands-on role in bringing new business to Florida. The result? Another 60,000 jobs. That's 240,000 regulatory reform new jobs + 365,000 tax and budget cut new jobs + 60,000 new jobs through state incentives and a persistent new governor = 665,000 jobs. A group of reporters, including the Palm Beach Post's Mike Bender, asked Scott about the discrepancy on July 25, 2010, as Scott was in the middle of a six-day statewide bus tour. "It's just rounding," Scott said. Bender reported that a more detailed version of the plan puts the jobs number lower, at 661,914. Donna Arduin, who helped draft the economic plan and is Jeb Bush's former budget director, noted to reporters that the job growth estimates are conservative. Still, the number is the number. And it doesn't add up to 700,000. At the same time, it's worth noting that Scott's budget cutting plan also calls for a 5 percent reduction in the state workforce. Using the Florida Department of Management Services most recent workforce report, that would mean anywhere from 5,473 to 8,432 state workers would lose their jobs (depending on how across-the-board the 5 percent cut is). Scott campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Scott's plan only measures private sector growth. Still, we believe it's appropriate to at least mention the impact on public jobs under Scott's plan. If you include the public sector losses, that could put the net job creation figure somewhere around 656,441 (using the low end estimate of 5,473 state workers being let go). That means Scott's claim is inflated by about 6.6 percent, or 43,559 jobs. That's more than all of the people employed in Hernando County, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Or it's equivalent to closing just about every dentist office in the state. Scott claims that his economic plan for Florida will create 700,000 jobs in seven years, but he admits that he's rounding up. The real number in the plan is closer to 660,000 jobs. We guess the "7-7-7" plan sounds better than "7-6.6-7" plan, but for the sake of accuracy, we have to rate Scott's claim Mostly True.

pomt-09602	On the importance of an independent voting record	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/18/barack-obama/obama-says-browns-voting-record-not-independent/	In a last-minute effort to protect a Democratic Senate seat in Massachusetts, President Barack Obama sang the praises of an independent voting record. In a Boston campaign appearance on Jan. 17, 2010, for Democrat Martha Coakley, Obama took aim at her opponent, Republican Scott Brown, for voting too much along party lines in the Massachusetts Senate. "I do want somebody who's independent," Obama said. "I want a senator who's always going to put the interests of working folks all across Massachusetts first -- ahead of party, ahead of special interests. "So I hear (Coakley's) opponent is calling himself an independent," Obama said. "Well, you've got to look under the hood because what you learn makes you wonder. Now, as a (state) legislator, he voted with the Republicans 96 percent of the time -- 96 percent of the time. It's hard to suggest that he's going to be significantly independent from the Republican agenda. When you listen closely to what he’s been saying, it’s very clear that he’s going to do exactly the same thing in Washington." The president's comments gave us a serious case of deja vu that sent our Flip-O-Meter spinning. But first we'll look into the accuracy of the president's claim, not only because it was disputed by Brown (and later seemingly embraced), but also because it's kind of our thing here at PolitiFact. And we found that Obama is guilty of a little cherry-picking. In September, the Coakley campaign commissioned an analysis of Brown's voting record from Insta Trac, a nonpartisan Massachusetts legislative bill tracking service. As the Coakley campaign has hammered often, the firm found that since 2007, Brown has voted with the Republican Senate Minority Leader Richard Tisei 96 percent of the time. But Brown has been in the Massachusetts Senate since 2004, and he voted with Tisei's predecessor, Brian Lees, 82 percent of the time. We verified those numbers with Insta Trac president Michael Segal. Also, Brown served for six years in the Massachusetts House, and according to Insta Trac statistics, he voted with Republican leadership there about 92 percent of the time. We tallied all of Brown's votes in the state House and Senate (3,104 votes in all) and confirmed the Coakley campaign's claim that he has voted with Republican leadership 90 percent of the time as a state legislator. We think that probably would be a fairer number for Obama to cite, unless he qualified that he was just talking about Brown's voting record over the past two years. But our aim here is not to quibble with Obama's number. Rather it's that Obama was citing these voting records to dispel Brown's claims of independence. Indeed, that 96 percent figure Obama cited rang a bell with us at PolitiFact. That's the percentage Obama himself voted with the Democrats when he was in the U.S. Senate. We happen to know that number because we fact-checked Sarah Palin's claim about it from the vice presidential debate in 2008. She earned a True. It's based on a calculation of party unity from Congressional Quarterly that measures how often members vote with their party on bills where the parties split. Presumably, that percentage would be much higher if you included all votes (even ones where Democrats and Republicans alike supported a bill) -- such as Brown's number does. Asked about that voting record on ABC's This Week on Sept. 7, 2008, Obama defended his record and said that host George Stephanopoulos was "conflating two arguments. One argument is bipartisanship. One argument has to do with change." "Who is the more likely to break with their party?" Stephanopoulos asked. "Well, no. That wasn't the question, right? That's not the point," Obama said. "The point is if you believe that George Bush has run this economy into the ground and mismanaged our foreign policy, who's more likely to change those policies? And I don't think there's any dispute that that would be me. Now, if it has to do with who has broken with their party, the first couple of years that I was in the Senate, the Republicans controlled the agenda, which meant that most of those votes are votes against efforts by the Republicans on issues that I feel very strongly about. So I have no problem defending a record of saying, no, we shouldn't cut benefits to vulnerable populations. No, I don't think that we should suspend habeas corpus, critical issues." Earlier in the campaign, Obama dismissed as "silly" a rating by the National Journal that concluded he was more liberal than Ted Kennedy. Obama said some of the votes the National Journal considered liberal had bipartisan appeal. Yet in Brown's case, all votes, including bipartisan procedural ones, would count as votes in lockstep with party leaders. So pot, meet kettle. During the presidential campaign, Obama defended his 96 percent record as a strong stand for his principles. But when Brown has the same rating in Masschusetts, he's not independent enough. That earns Obama a Full Flop.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-18T18:56:10	2010-01-17	['None']
pomt-00146	Says Ron DeSantis has not revealed $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money.	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/24/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-gillums-claim-about-desantis-145000-/	Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and former Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis asked each other for receipts during a Florida gubernatorial debate: DeSantis asked who paid for Gillum's ticket to a Hamilton show, and Gillum called out DeSantis for travel paid by taxpayers. "I would ask him, what happened to the $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money that he has yet to reveal?" Gillum asked Oct. 24 during a WPBF 25 News debate. Here are the facts: DeSantis hasn’t released detailed receipts on $145,000 spent on travels, but he broadly reported the travel charges. Gillum cites Naples Daily News article as evidence Gillum’s campaign linked his claim to an Oct. 18 Naples Daily News article headlined, "Candidate DeSantis won't disclose details of taxpayer-funded travel while in Congress." The story says that DeSantis spent more than $145,000 in taxpayer money for travel as a congressman, including at least two trips to New York City to appear on Fox News shows. DeSantis was sworn into Congress in January 2013 and resigned in September to focus on his gubernatorial campaign. The story did not say DeSantis traveled to New York City to talk about his campaign — the known trips happened before he officially announced his candidacy in January 2018, although he had been expected to enter the race for months and President Donald Trump in December 2017 tweeted that DeSantis "would make a great governor of Florida." The story also doesn’t say that his spending broke House rules or laws. The crux of the story is that DeSantis hasn’t disclosed detailed travel receipts and that lack of information leads to uncertainty over how exactly he spent taxpayer money. "Without receipts, it remains unclear how many trips DeSantis took at taxpayer expense to make media appearances. It's also difficult without those records to know how often he traveled at taxpayer expense to locations other than his Florida district or Washington office," the Naples Daily News story said. Funds come from the Members' Representational Allowance The money at issue comes from the Members' Representational Allowance, an annual allowance members of congress get to support their official and representational duties. The amount appropriated can vary per year. During his time in office, DeSantis’ allowance was more than $1 million but not more than $1.4 million. Authorized spending includes personnel salaries and benefits, travel, and office expenses. The funds cannot be used to pay for expenses "related to activities or events that are primarily social in nature, personal expenses, campaign or political expenses, or House committee expenses," and members may be held personally liable for misspent funds or excess spending, said a September 2017 Congressional Research Service report. House members’ spending is published in a quarterly public report called Statements of Disbursements. The Naples Daily News analyzed reports submitted by DeSantis and found more than $1,000 spent on seven hotel stays since 2013, and 71 commercial transportation expenses totaling about $143,000. DeSantis did not provide to the news outlet details on where and how long he stayed in the hotels; nor receipts on the commercial transportation that would detail where, when, why or with whom he traveled, how many trips were by plane or train, and whether he traveled first-class or coach. DeSantis’ campaign did not respond to multiple PolitiFact queries. New York City trips to appear on Fox News The Naples Daily News identified travel expenses listed in DeSantis’ spending reports that matched the dates of at least two appearances on Fox News TV and radio shows, in July and October of 2017. DeSantis discussed issues of the day, including Trump’s policies. DeSantis by that point had not officially entered the race but was expected to join. DeSantis’ appearances on Fox News and Fox Business propelled him into the national spotlight and helped him win Trump’s endorsement. "The once little-known congressman spent so much time broadcasting Fox News TV hits from Washington this year that he learned to apply his own powder so he could look as polished as he sounded," Politico reported. Stephen Lawson, DeSantis’ campaign spokesman, told the Naples Daily News that the trips to New York were "official office travel that included official media appearances." If a member of congress is invited in his or her official capacity to do an interview with any media organization, then use of the Members' Representational Allowance would be considered permissible if that was the member’s primary purpose for travel, said Courtney Parella, spokeswoman for the Committee on House Administration. DeSantis could voluntarily release records detailing his travels, but without itemized receipts there isn’t a way of knowing exactly how he spent taxpayers’ money, said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at the government watchdog group Public Citizen. The level of transparency as it relates to the release of detailed receipts varies among lawmakers, and they are not legally required to provide itemized receipts to the public, Gilbert said. Our ruling Gillum claimed DeSantis has not revealed $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money. DeSantis like other members of Congress received an allowance to cover expenses related to official duties. DeSantis has not disclosed — in detail — how he spent more than $145,000 in travel. But DeSantis has disclosed broad description for the expenses. Some reported expenses are listed as "commercial transportation," but do not specify when or where the trip was taken. At least two travel expenses reported by DeSantis match the dates of 2017 appearances on Fox News shows. DeSantis’ campaign said those were official media appearances, because he was answering questions as a House member and had not yet entered the governor’s race. DeSantis is not legally required to disclose detailed reports of his travel. But a watchdog group said that without itemized it’s not entirely clear how DeSantis spent taxpayers’ money. Gillum’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-10701	"I spend a lot of time in Iowa, and believe it or not, in Ottumwa, Iowa, this is the heartland, the newspaper, the regular newspaper for Ottumwa, Iowa, is (a) bilingual newspaper."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/29/tom-tancredo/what-about-the-daily-english-paper/	Illegal immigration is one of the key targets of Congressman Tom Tancredo's campaign for president. He wants to secure borders, reduce job prospects for border-crossers and end the "bilingualization" of America. The latter goal is behind this statement on Fox News' The Big Story, where he makes the case that bilingual countries don't work. He cites the newspaper in Ottumwa, Iowa, as an example of things gone wrong. Problem is, his example is wrong. The regular newspaper for Ottumwa, Iowa, is the Ottumwa Courier, published six days a week in English, says Ottumwa Courier publisher Tom Hawley. Reported circulation is around 14,000. Once a week, the Courier publishes a couple thousand Spanish editions along with the regular paper, Hawley says. The top story is printed in English and Spanish and the rest of the paper, which is a compilation of stories from the week, as well as Mexican soccer scores, is printed in Spanish. The Spanish papers are free and distributed across the city. "It's really aimed at just helping (Hispanics) assimilate in the community," Hawley says. In Wapello County, where Ottumwa is the county seat, 7.4 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, according to a 2006 report from the State Data Center of Iowa. So as far as the regular newspaper for Ottumwa, Iowa, being bilingual, Hawley said: "That's not true." "He was a little confused," Hawley said of Tancredo. "We had him in for the editorial board and explained it. He didn't really say much. ... He continued to say the same thing even after we explained it." We took this information to the Tancredo campaign, and press secretary Alan Moore disagreed with our findings. "We stand by our statement," Moore said. He added, "How do you define regular?" We'll skip the linguistics discussion and rule Tancredo's statement False.	None	Tom Tancredo	None	None	None	2007-11-29T00:00:00	2007-11-20	['Iowa']

pomt-10435	"We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/12/hillary-clinton/yes---and-we-borrow-from-the-saudis-too/	Speaking to two of voters' biggest economic concerns, Sen. Hillary Clinton tried to link America's reliance on foreign oil with its need to borrow huge sums from foreign investors, saying, "We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. That is not a winning strategy for America." It's a great applause line with more than a kernel of truth, but the link between China and Saudi Arabia is not as direct as Clinton suggestions. Let's try to break it down one step at a time. The United States borrows money to keep our economy flush with cash by selling U.S. Treasury notes, bonds and other securities to foreign nations, corporations and private investors. These securities are regarded as among the safest investments in the world, and they bring a decent guaranteed rate of return, to boot. Japan is the biggest foreign purchaser of Treasuries, but China is a solid No. 2 -- it held $405.5 billion worth at the end of 2007. That accounts for about 17 percent of total foreign holdings of all Treasury securities. So it's true that China is a significant lender to the U.S. The U.S. needs the Chinese and other foreign investors because our economy operates on borrowed money to meet all of its consumption needs. This is reflected in the oft-cited trade deficit, and in a less well-known but more accurate measurement called the current account deficit. The current account deficit is the trade deficit plus other things such as military aid. It provides the best picture of how much more the United States economy consumes in goods, services and investments than it's really capable of paying for. The current account deficit hit a record $811.5 billion in 2006 -- the last year for which complete statistics are available -- and has more than doubled during President Bush's years in office. The United States has been running a deficit on this figure since 1991. So, this practice of selling bonds, effectively borrowing money from the foreign countries that buy the bonds, is what keeps capital pumping into the U.S. economy. When China buys those treasuries that makes it possible for other investors, like banks, to loan money to companies that want to buy oil. Energy firms benefit because there is more cash available --at lower borrowing costs-- to purchase crude from producing nations. Clinton's singling out of Saudi Arabia as the primary beneficiary of this transfer of wealth is a bit of a distortion because the Gulf nation is only the fourth-largest supplier to the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration. The United States draws far more from its own domestic sources, and Canada and Mexico. So, it would be a bit more accurate to say the U.S. borrows from China to buy oil from Canada, but what's the fun in saying that? Clinton was trying to make the additional point that the U.S. relies on oil from politically volatile regions. It's clearly a stretch to say the same capital China injects into the economy when it buys Treasury securities somehow winds up in the Saudis' pockets. Clinton might have noted that Saudi Arabia also is a big investor in Treasury securities. That means some of the money we pay for crude oil circulates back to our economy when they buy Treasuries. It's all proof that what goes around, comes around. Although Clinton is correct that China is a big investor in Treasuries, but her statement is misleading because it suggests that we're specifically using Chinese investments to pay for Saudi oil.
