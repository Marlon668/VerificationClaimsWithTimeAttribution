History shows that since the defeat of the Liberal-National opposition led by John Hewson in 1993, the trend has been for oppositions to provide ever decreasing levels of detail in their pre-election policies. In 2016, Labor continues that trend. Labor's document, the "10 Year Plan for Australia's Economy", has only around 15 pages of policy content. Even taking into account Labor's separately released policies on the areas touched on by the document, such as those on education, negative gearing and tax, Labor's plan is not in the same league as Mr Hewson's notoriously detailed Fightback! plan from the 1993 election, which spanned around 650 pages (not including the other opposition election policies). Labor has produced an attractively designed booklet about its economic intentions for government but however you look at it, its "10 Year Plan on the Economy" is not the most comprehensive economic plan by historical standards.

However, these figures include six categories of homelessness of which sleeping rough is only one. In the sleeping rough category, women numbered 2,180 and men 4,633. Experts contacted by Fact Check said these were the best figures available and far fewer men and women were sleeping rough on the streets of Australia than Mr Morrison said. There were 29,193 soldiers in the Regular Australian Army on June 30, 2015. Whilst there are more homeless women in total than there are soldiers in the Regular Army, there are fewer women sleeping rough than the number of soldiers.

abbc-00231	Underpinning the Coalition's re-election pitch is its assertion that it is the party best equipped to manage the budget by keeping a lid on spending.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-01/fact-check-spending-growth-under-the-coalition/9800624	Mr Turnbull is close to the mark. Annual spending growth is indeed running at its lowest average rate since at least the early 1970s. However, the verdict is subject to three qualifications. First, in calculating average spending under this government, Mr Turnbull has included the budget's projections out to 2021-22. As experts contacted by Fact Check noted, there is a big difference between predicted and actual spending. Past history demonstrates that budget predictions for spending cannot be used as a reliable estimate for actual spending. Second, in calculating its average annual spending growth (1.9 per cent), the Government has shared responsibility 50:50 with the former Labor government for a spending surge in 2013-14 (the financial year when it came to power). Experts have questioned this methodology, particularly as the Coalition was in power for approximately three-quarters of the 2013-14 financial year, during which it made some significant spending decisions, including providing the Reserve Bank with $8.8 billion and Victoria with $1.5 billion for the now-defunct East West Link road project. Finally, as the experts noted, low spending should not be regarded as a political virtue in its own right, or a benchmark of political success. Rather, spending levels should reflect the economic circumstances of the time. For example, a dramatic spending surge in 2008-09 was an arguably justifiable response to the global financial crisis. An alternative method for calculating the average, based on advice from experts, found the growth in real annual spending is running somewhat faster under the current Coalition Government than the level identified by Mr Turnbull. Nevertheless, under this alternative calculation, spending remains at its lowest average level for about 50 years, and indeed below the level that prevailed when Mr Costello was treasurer.

abbc-00237	Since the summer break, tensions have been simmering within the Coalition over electric vehicles. Although Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg has thrown his support behind electric cars, some on the government benches are yet to be convinced.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-07/fact-check-does-corolla-emit-less-than-tesla/9461096	The data on the Green Vehicle Guide website shows only the more powerful Tesla models emitted "close to 200 grams" of carbon dioxide per kilometre. Most emitted less, some considerably less. Mr Kelly referred to "a Tesla" and "a Corolla". However, the website lists 27 different models of Tesla, with emissions varying depending on the model. At the time Mr Kelly made his claim (the website has since been updated), emissions for the various Tesla models ranged from 174 to 212 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre. For petrol Corolla models, emissions ranged from 171 to 191 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre. However, according to experts, the data for the emissions intensity of the energy grid was out of date at the time the claim was made. The website has been updated since Mr Kelly made his claim with data reflecting the 2015-16 electricity mix between coal, gas and renewables. This resulted in a significant improvement in the reported environmental performance of the Tesla compared with petrol Corollas, such that five models of Tesla had higher emissions than the most polluting Corolla (191 grams of CO2 per kilometre), compared with 22 that were less polluting. After the update, 17 models of Tesla had higher emissions than the least polluting petrol Corolla (171 grams of CO2 per kilometre), while 10 had lower emissions than even the most environmentally friendly petrol Corolla. Mr Kelly does have a point — not all Tesla models are cleaner than Corollas. However, it is a stretch to suggest — even using out-of-date 2013-14 data for the emissions intensity of the electricity grid — that Corollas have "significantly" lower emissions than Teslas. And experts said it was misleading to compare high-performance cars with mid-performance ones. They pointed out that a fairer comparison for a Corolla was a small electric car such as a Renault Zoe, which according to the latest data on the website emits between 121 and 136 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre — less than any of the five petrol Corollas.

abbc-00124	The issue of political donations remains a source of ongoing policy debate in Australian politics, amid concerns that powerful interests — including property developers, tobacco, liquor and gambling businesses — are buying influence.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-12/fact-check-does-tasmania-have-weakest-political-donation-laws/9407872	Ms O'Connor's claim is a fair call. Currently, Tasmania's political donation laws are almost identical to those of Victoria. This amounts to a subtle distinction between the two states. However, once Victoria's promised new rules are legislated, Tasmania unambiguously will have the weakest political donation laws among the states and territories; equally as weak as the federal laws to which it defers.

abbc-00114	A brawl reportedly involving up to 200 people in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood has reignited the debate about crime in Victoria and, in particular, offending by African Australians.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-05/fact-check-sudanese-gangs-victoria/10187550	Ms Nyuon's claim checks out. Between April 2017 and March 2018, they made up a combined 73.5 per cent of the unique offender population (those people alleged to have committed crimes) in Victoria; whereas, those born in Sudan made up 1.1 per cent. Experts told Fact Check that statistics from the CSA were an accurate representation of Victoria's offender characteristics. Monash University Associate Professor in Criminology Rebecca Wickes said: "1 per cent of offences are being committed by those who have reported being born in South Sudan. That is accurate." Melbourne University Professor of Criminology Mark Woods said: "Nyadol Nyuon's claim is correct; the overwhelming majority of crime in Victoria is committed by Australian-born offenders." This fact reflects population statistics more generally: Australian-born and New Zealand-born people account for 64.8 per cent and 1.6 per cent of Victoria's population, respectively. In percentage terms, there is a greater disparity between population and crime rates for people born in Sudan and South Sudan, who make up just 0.14 per cent of Victoria's population. However, experts stressed that discussions surrounding this issue fail to take into account the age profile of the Sudanese population in Victoria, which helps explain their overrepresentation in the crime statistics.

abbc-00234	With the Turnbull Government's proposed corporate tax cut stalled in the Upper House, the business lobby has been ramping up efforts to convince a handful of crossbench senators to pass the legislation.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-23/fact-check-corporate-tax-cuts-and-higher-wages/9652850	Senator Watt is on shaky ground. Although he accurately points out that half of the signatories to the BCA letter represent companies that did not pay any corporate tax in 2015-16, it is a stretch to suggest this means these companies would not be in a position to pass on potential future benefits — however small — in the form of higher wages. As experts noted, using a single year (in this case, 2015-16) to make a broad assertion about the future is problematic. Should the legislation be passed, the tax cut would not apply until the next decade for some larger companies. In their letter, the executives left open the timing of future wage increases resulting from the tax cut, promising stronger wages growth "as the tax cut takes effect". As experts pointed out, whether a company pays corporate tax in a given year depends on a range of factors, including market conditions, past capital investments and tax offsets. Not paying company tax in a particular year does not mean a business will not pay company tax in the future. Indeed, some of the signatory companies that did not pay corporate tax in 2015-16 have indicated they are on track to pay corporate tax in the near future. Economic modelling by Treasury and other analysts has concluded the corporate tax cuts would also broadly boost the economy, although the impact is likely to be modest. Whether other policies would be more effective in boosting wages is a different issue, and not the subject of this fact check; nor is whether the corporate tax plan — which is expected to cost about $65 billion over a decade — is in the nation's best interests, or should be prioritised over other budget measures.
