In that same time, though, the cost of superannuation (after tax) is estimated to rise to $61bn - meaning it will account for 6.1 percent of GDP. If GDP only doubled, then superannuation would account for 11.5 percent of that.	Elections	Winston Peters	None	None	Fact or Fiction: A superannuation special	13 September 2017	None	['None']

ranz-00031	The prison population has been rising under Labour and National… We’ll be at twice the OECD average by 2027, according to our projections.	fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201859218/fact-or-fiction-how-correct-are-corrections-claims	The Opportunities Party co-deputy leader Geoff Simmons (in a video on the party's Facebook page) The prison population in New Zealand actually dipped slightly between 2011 and 2013. Increases since 2013 can largely be attributed to changes in the Bail Act & Sentencing Act. The Bail Act placed tougher conditions on those seeking bail, while also limiting which offences would qualify for bail. Changes to the Sentencing Act were introduced to ensure all victims were offered restorative justice prior to their sentencing. These changes have meant an overall higher proportion of prisoners are remanded in custody (kept in prison while their case is going through the courts) at any given time, as an overall percentage of the total prisoner population. At the top end of projections, the Ministry of Justice has forecast that prison numbers will likely increase by about 19 percent by the 2025/26 year. Inside Paremoremo PrisonPhoto: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly New Zealand’s total number of incarcerated persons are the seventh highest per capita in the OECD at a rate of 210 prisoners per 100,000 people, while the OECD average hovers around 140 per 100,000 people. Using the ministry's projections, the imprisonment rate would rise to 232 per 100,000 (accounting for a general population increase) by 2025/26 - about 66 percent higher than the current OECD average but not double. The ministry has not published its projections for the 2027 year.	Elections	Geoff Simmons	None	None	Fact or Fiction: How correct are corrections claims?	20 September 2017	None	['None']
ranz-00015	National’s promise to increase the number of elective surgeries to 200,000 is bizarre, given Jonathan Coleman has claimed 200,000 electives are already being performed.	fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857606/fact-or-fiction-which-health-claims-are-quackery	Is National setting itself a target it's already achieved? RNZ asked Labour for its source material, which were Ministry of Health elective surgery documents provided under the Official Information Act. Fact or Fiction has ignored Labour's commentary around the OIA material and only used the raw data to assess this and the following claim. No captionJonathan Coleman Photo: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King Since the 2015/16 year, the Ministry of Health has monitored two sets of elective surgery figures: elective surgical discharges (i.e. completed elective surgeries); and elective surgical discharges and 'arranged' surgical discharges (same-same-but-different to elective surgery). The second set of figures is the one currently used to report on the government's much-touted 'more elective surgery' health target. In the 2015/16 year, the target was 200,460 elective surgeries - Jonathan Coleman said in Parliament that this target had been met. In his press release announcing National would 'lift' the number of elective surgeries from 174,000 to 200,000 by 2021/22, Dr Coleman appears to be using the first, older definition - which the Ministry of Health still measures, but does not use as the target it sets for district health boards to meet.

Steven Joyce claims this is where most of the gap comes from. Several economists have roundly rejected National's claims. Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson (left) and leader Andrew Little, at the party's launch of its budget plan. Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson with the party's budget plan Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson Economic commentator Brian Fallow has told Checkpoint with John Campbell that the disagreement over the figures is a matter of interpretation. National's budget includes an $11.7bn operating allowance (essentially, a slush fund of unallocated spending). Labour's is just $4.5bn - but that doesn't mean $7bn has disappeared, Fallow says. Instead, Labour has allocated that money to the budget lines it intends to spend it on - mostly health, education, and increased paid parental leave and other provisions in its Families Package. Total Crown operating expenses are $440bn in National's budget and $448bn in Labour's budget - and the $8bn difference is mostly covered by the $7.4bn Labour gets by cancelling National's planned tax cuts. BERL chief economist Ganesh Nana - whose organisation reviewed Labour's alternative budget - agrees with Fallow's assessment. It is different to the way the National-led government treated the operating allowance, but it is not wrong or a mistake, Nana says: "From an accountant's perspective it makes sense."

It is indeed a “gross” number as well, meaning it does not take into account what the recipients pay back in tax. However, Mr Peters neglects to mention the very next sentence in Treasury's statement: "We might be able to afford that, but we would have to either cut other government spending or increase taxes."

ranz-00005	There's 200,000 houses going to be built in New Zealand over the next six years.	fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857236/fact-or-fiction-do-the-leaders-know	According to Statistics New Zealand, in the year to 30 June 2017, 30,453 homes were consented across New Zealand. If this rate is maintained exactly over the next six years, 182,718 homes will be consented – 17,282 less than Mr English states. However, MBIE’s National Construction Pipeline Report for 2017 estimated that residential consents will steadily grow from 30,453 homes to a peak of 34,500 homes per year in 2019. If that is the case, then it is likely around 200,000 homes will be consented over the next six years, from 2017-2023. It is probable Mr English is anticipating the rate to increase in accordance with heightened demand for housing, as New Zealand’s population is expected to grow to 5.01 – 5.51 million in 2025. If New Zealand achieves its highest ever recorded rate of consents of 40,000 homes per year in early 1974, it will go far beyond this 200,000 houses goal. One important caveat: just because a house is consented, does not meant the house gets constructed. Experimental statistics published by Statistics NZ earlier this year concluded that 97 percent of house consented do eventually get built, within 10 months on average. However, over the past year Auckland Council has been developing a database of dwelling completions - the only local authority to do so. The latest monthly data puts the annual completion rate at 6,827 - despite an annual consent rate of about 10,000 houses.

ranz-00028	The justice sector forecast for 2015-2025 said that the prison population was likely to increase to 10,090 by 2025… Well that actually happened in less than one year after the report was released.	fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201859218/fact-or-fiction-how-correct-are-corrections-claims	Kelvin Davis was referring to the Ministry of Justice’s Justice Sector Forecast, released in December 2015, which did forecast a rise in the prison population from 9150 in 2015 to 10,090 by 2025. It is also true that the prison population grew far faster than anticipated by the ministry. As of June 2017, the prison population is at 10,260 - higher than it was predicted to be in 2025. However, in December 2016, which was one year after the report was released - Mr Davis’s reference point - the prison population was 9914. This is slightly less than the 10,090 by December 2016 that Mr Davis claimed, yet it is still a considerable increase compared to the predicted rate of increase.

ranz-00019	We've gotta remember that we lost Te Reo through compulsion in schools	fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201858175/fact-or-fiction-all-just-spin	Firstly, it’s important to point out that Te Reo is actually not compulsory in schools in New Zealand, despite recent recommendations made by the Waitangi Tribunal. What Mr Seymour is apparently referring to is a series of Māori language recovery programmes that began in the 1980s, targeted at young people and the education system – such as kōhanga reo (immersing pre-schoolers in the Māori language) and kura kaupapa (schooling in a Māori language environment). This had come after years of lobbying by Māori activists, who highlighted 1985 statistics showing that only about 12 percent of the Māori population (50,000 people out of the total population at the time) were fluent in Te Reo. This should be compared to 1919 statistics, in which 99 percent of Māori school children were native speakers. Te Reo Māori was only declared to be an official language of New Zealand in 1987. Maori Language WeekChildren celebrate Te Wiki o Te Reo in 2016 Photo: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King According to the Health of the Māori Language Survey, after extensive work to re-establish the language (such as government funding for a Māori television channel, and community Māori language initiatives), the number of Māori who had “some Māori speaking skills” had risen to 136,700 speakers in 2001. However, only 13 percent of this population aged over 15 could read Te Reo “well” or “very well”, according to the same survey. A later survey in 2006 found the number who could read Te Reo “well” or "very well” had increased significantly to 23 percent. While proficiency in Te Reo was highest for the oldest Māori, the second highest age group was for 15 to 24-year-olds – indicating that Māori language teaching in schools, was, in fact, helping to revitalise the language. While the total proportion of the Māori population able to converse “well” in Te Reo dropped to 21 percent in the 2013 Census, the higher proportions of younger speakers in 2006 indicate the introduction of Te Reo in schools was a help, rather than a hindrance, to the survival of the Māori language. However, if Mr Seymour meant that Te Reo was "lost" through making English language compulsory in schools (and banning Te Reo), he was correct - as the statistics from 1919-1985 highlight a drop from 99 percent fluency to merely 12 percent.

During The Spinoff’s debate Paula Bennett claimed that only seven people were currently in prison for possessing the drug. The New Zealand Drug Foundation (via Twitter) confirmed that the numbers were indeed correct. The foundation based this on information obtained from the Department of Corrections through a recent official information request, which shows an average of seven people per year are imprisoned for possession of marijuana (as their only offence). It is unlikely that all seven are in prison at one time. About 150 people were imprisoned in 2016 with a cannabis charge (possession for supply, etc) as their most serious offence. Neither Mrs Bennett nor Ms Ardern mentioned overall (non-custodial) convictions for cannabis, which number in the thousands each year.

The same report puts the cost of a remand prisoner at $239.17 per day. The main reason for this difference is because sentenced prisoners generally have longer unlock hours, more case management and a series of mandated programmes such to attend. The same report gives an average population of 6816 sentence prisoners and 2377 remand prisoners. The weighted average cost therefore works out at $105,809 per prisoner, per year.

Of those, it is correct that about 60,000 people had their referral declined (and another 10,000 were declined because their GP didn't provide enough information - they may well have re-applied and been accepted in a subsequent month). Of those who were declined, about 27,000 (46 percent) were turned down because they didn't meet the threshold - basically, the level of seriousness your condition has to reach before you can get a specialist appointment. The Ministry of Health defines this category as patients where "the referral is appropriate and the patient would benefit from an assessment but the referral is below the DHB's capacity threshold". So, those 27,000 people needed an appointment but missed out, because our health system couldn't afford it or couldn't cope with that demand. Another 29,000 (50 percent) were turned down because specialist services assessed their referrals and decided that a specialist appointment was "not required" - either because they didn't need an appointment, or their condition could be treated by a GP, or the appointment was unlikely to benefit them.

The examples are based on averages - it is important to note that irrigation requirements will vary from region to region, and even between farms. We have used Dairy NZ's figures on both farm size and irrigation water requirements, here and here. Two dairy farmers - one from the Waikato, one from the Wairarapa - confirmed to Fact or Fiction that they would use a little less water for irrigation than Dairy NZ suggests, but we have stuck with the Dairy NZ figures. Labour has suggested a charge of one to two cents per 1000 litres of water used - we have used two cents. If Labour went with a one-cent tax, the following costs would halve. First up, a dairy farmer, farming on 144 hectares (the average size), requiring 4mm of irrigation a day over a 120-day irrigating season (assuming it's particularly dry). For every hectare of land, you need to use 10,000L of water to get 1mm of coverage - a cost of 20c/mm, per hectare. For 4mm of coverage, the cost would be 80c per hectare, per day. Over 120 days, assuming full irrigation for every one of those days, the cost for the entire farm would be just over $13,800. Based on an average herd size of 413 cows, each drinking 130L of water a day, you'd pay another $391 each year. To get to a figure of $50,000, you would need to have a very large farm - well over 500 hectares - or be irrigating at three to four times the suggested rate. For a produce grower, with an average 20-hectare farm, requiring 17mm of irrigation each week over an irrigation period of 13 weeks, the cost per year would be $884, or thereabouts.
