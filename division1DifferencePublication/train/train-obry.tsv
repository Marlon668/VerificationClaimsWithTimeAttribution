obry-00038	Incumbent Republican Senator Rob Portman is continuing to apply pressure to former Democratic Governor Ted Strickland in the Ohio Senate race. In a recent Facebook post on his campaign’s page, Portman made numerous claims pertaining to the effectiveness of Strickland’s political history. “After 12 years in Congress, Ted Strickland was ranked as one of the most absent and ineffective members of Congress and never authored a single bill that became law. Under Governor Ted Strickland, Ohio lost over 350,000 jobs and ranked 48th in job creation,” said Portman. Strickland served as the representative for Ohio’s 6th Congressional District from 1993-94 and 1997-2006. According to GovTrack — a nonpartisan, open data website that tracks the work of the U.S. Congress — from January 1993 to December 2006, Strickland missed 364 out of 6,954 roll-call votes. Strickland missed 5.2 percent of the votes held during his congressional career, noticeably worse than the 2.9 percent lifetime average among all the representatives serving during December 2006. 	verified	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/29/portman-claims-strickland-ineffective-in-congress-as-governor/	None	None	None	Max Beyer and Riley Vetterkind	None	Portman claims Strickland ineffective in Congress, as governor	November 29, 2016	None	['Ted_Strickland', 'United_States_Congress', 'Ohio', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Congressional_district']

obry-00012	Republican state senator and U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir posted on Facebook on March 6 that the residency rule in Milwaukee “prevented highly qualified teachers, police officers and firefighters from opting to work in the city” and that “removing these barriers helps Milwaukee retain and attract many valuable workers who were once discouraged by the residency rule.” Her post was accompanied by a link to a Fox6Now story by Myra Sanchick on the impact of the removal of the rule. The Observatory fact-checked Vukmir’s statement. The residency rule required people who work for the city of Milwaukee to live within the city limits. The residency rule in Milwaukee was in place for 75 years until it was removed by a 2013 state law, which was upheld by a decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2016. 	unobservable	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/04/21/did-milwaukees-old-residency-rule-lead-to-lower-quality-city-workers/	None	None	None	Teodor Teofilov	None	Did Milwaukee’s old residency rule lead to lower quality city workers?

In a March 23 press release, Wisconsin Democratic gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn said, “Taxpayer dollars will go to out-of-state businesses when they should go to Wisconsin ones.” His comments came after Flynn learned that the lead contractors directing construction of the $10 billion LCD manufacturing plant are, in fact, out-of-state companies.

This last budget we’ve increased it $200 million dollars more than the Governor put forth.” The Wisconsin Legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance – sometimes referred to as the Joint Finance Committee or the Committee on Joint Finance – is a bipartisan, 16-member committee responsible for reviewing all bills introduced “for the appropriation of money, providing for revenue or relating to taxation.” In 2015, Olsen served as one of the Committee’s vice chairs.

Soglin claimed, “The latest statistics demonstrated that if there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder.” In light of recent debates about how to address gun violence, The Observatory decided to check the validity of this claim. 	mostly true	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/05/01/mayors-claim-about-gun-violence-may-be-off-but-stats-still-alarming/	None	None	None	palmby	None	Mayor’s claim about gun violence may be off, but stats still alarming	October 17, 2018	None	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Wisconsin']

Representative Steve Doyle “We’ve done studies at the La Crosse County level and we’ve identified $61 million dollars of need that we have, roads that need serious repair and maintenance right now, $61 million, but we’re only able to spend $2.4 million dollars,” said Doyle on WPR. 	mostly false	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/30/how-much-does-la-crosse-county-have-to-spend-on-roads/	None	None	None	Max Bayer	None	How much does La Crosse County have to spend on roads?

Sensenbrenner’s office provided The Observatory with information that this claim was in reference to the Gun-Free School Zones Act (GFSZA) of 1990 (Senate Bill 2070).
