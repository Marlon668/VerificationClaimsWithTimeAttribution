abbc-00227	Calls to privatise the ABC have become louder in recent months, with Liberal Party members voting to privatise the national broadcaster at the party's annual federal council, though the Coalition Government's policy remains to keep the ABC in public hands.	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-13/fact-check3a-abc-greens-voters/9931782	Professor Davidson's claim is flimsy. In making the claim, Professor Davidson referred to a study published in 2013 which surveyed 605 journalists from a variety of organisations on their voting intentions. Fifty-nine of these journalists were from the ABC, and only 34 of them answered the question on voting intention, with 25 either undecided or electing not to answer. Of the 34 who did answer, 41.2 per cent, or 14, said they would vote for the Greens. But experts told Fact Check that the ABC sub-sample was too small and the rate of undecided and non-response too high to be able to draw accurate conclusions from the survey on ABC journalist voting intention, let alone voting intention of all ABC employees. Upon releasing the findings in 2013, the author of the study himself, Folker Hanusch, inserted numerous caveats about using sub-samples of the survey, including that the margins of error would be larger than those for the total sample. Professor Davidson neglected to include any of these important caveats in making his claim. Experts contacted by Fact Check, including Professor Hanusch, also took issue with comparing the results of the survey with larger, more stable studies of the voting intention of the general population, such as Newspoll. Whilst the survey found that Australian journalists in general tend to skew left, it showed no evidence that ABC journalists were five times more likely to vote for the Greens than the general public, and experts contacted by Fact Check said they did not know of any other recent studies which canvass the voting intentions of ABC journalists. University of New South Wales statistician Jake Olivier compared the survey results with those of Newspoll over the same survey period, and found ABC journalists were 2.4 times more likely to vote for the Greens. But he cautioned that the sample size of ABC journalists was too small to make strong conclusions about this result. Fact Check could find no research on the voting intentions of all ABC employees including those outside of the news division.

abbc-00224	Alison Watkins, the group managing director of Coca-Cola Amatil, has argued against a sugar tax, emphasising that despite a fall in the consumption of added sugars since 1995, obesity rates have continued to rise.	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-03/fact-check-sugar-consumption-and-obesity/9999182	Ms Watkins's claim is spin. Yes, the consumption of added sugar, particularly of carbonated drinks, has fallen since the mid-1990s. Meanwhile, obesity rates have indeed continued to rise. But this is not the full story. In attempting to put the case against a sugar tax, Ms Watkins paints an incomplete picture of the link between sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity, ignoring the weight of scientific evidence. Authoritative research shows a consistent association between a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity. Indeed, research shows that adolescent boys, who are the biggest consumers of sugar-sweetened drinks, also have the fastest rates of weight gain. Ms Watkins refers to the fact that just 2 per cent of the average Australian's kilojoule intake comes from soft drinks. But "soft drinks" refers only to carbonated drinks, not the full gamut of available sugar-sweetened beverages, including sports drinks, iced teas and fruit juices. This was because overall averages could mask increased consumption of sugary drinks among a particular group, which could be underpinning a rise in obesity. In her article, Ms Watkins also refers to an Australian Bureau of Statistics analysis showing a relative decrease in the consumption of added sugars in people's diets between 1995 and 2011-12, but she does not mention significant caveats the ABS attached to its analysis. Also, she does not mention that Australia's consumption of sugary drinks per capita exceeds the World Health Organisation's recommended energy intake from sugars.

abbc-00230	The Liberal Party has again come under fire for the low number of women in its federal parliamentary team after Jane Prentice, the Assistant Minister for Disability Services, lost preselection for her safe Brisbane seat.	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-06/fact-check-liberal-women-in-parliament/9796976	Ms Troeth's claim is in the ballpark. There were, indeed, three more Liberal women in parliament during 1996 compared to May 2018. But the party also held an extra 22 seats. That's why, in determining whether "the level of women" has declined, it is more meaningful to consider the numbers as a proportion of seats held. Viewed this way, female representation in the Liberal Party has actually increased over the 22 years — from 21 per cent of Liberal parliamentarians to 24 per cent. But it still remains below the level for women in Parliament overall, and roughly half that of Labor party members. So while the "level of [Liberal] women" is indeed low, it has not "dropped to a low level" since 1996. Ms Troeth specifically identified 1996 in her claim. However, female representation during John Howard's prime ministership peaked not in his first term but in his second (1998-2001), when it reached 25 per cent. Across Mr Howard's four terms, female representation averaged 23 per cent of Liberal seats held, which is just below the party's current level.

The Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey — as it is formally known — is not a plebiscite. It will ask people whether or not the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. It is voluntary and non-binding, and, indeed, "completely novel". Normally, Parliament would legislate on matters within its power without directly consulting the people. As in federal elections, only Australians named on the Commonwealth electoral roll will be allowed to participate. Mr Kirby's suggestion that it is a "vote of a few citizens" cannot be tested as it remains unclear how many people will actually send in their response.

abbc-00221	Australia's political establishment was quick to denounce the explosive first speech of Katter's Australian Party senator Fraser Anning and his call for a return to immigration policies that would discriminate against non-Europeans and Muslims.	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-06/fact-check-did-harold-holt-abolish-the-white-australia-policy/10194408	Mr Wilson's claim is simplistic. The White Australia policy was dismantled, piece by piece, over decades spanning governments both Liberal and Labor. Experts told Fact Check the 1966-67 Holt government's reforms were critical steps in the process, constituting a significant break from past practice. Mr Holt's changes levelled the playing field between Europeans and non-Europeans applying for citizenship, setting a 5-year wait time for both groups, and eased the criteria for non-European migrants seeking permanent residence. But the process of relaxing Australia's discriminatory immigration policies quietly began before Mr Holt became prime minister — and policies of racial discrimination persisted beyond his term. So it is a stretch to say the Holt government "abolished" the White Australia policy. Responsibility for officially ending it fell to Gough Whitlam's Labor government, which in 1973 declared the policy dead. The Whitlam government then took steps to strip race as a factor from visa assessments and to equalise the criteria by which all people — whether British, European or otherwise — could become Australian citizens.

Whilst other research from NATSEM and HILDA found slightly more Australians under the poverty line, with fewer of them children, these reports measure poverty and define children differently, and the numbers are still comparable with data in the report which Mr Shorten uses as the basis for his claim. Experts say that whilst the different reports make slightly different assumptions, all are sound in their methodology. They also said that there are many ways to measure poverty, and there's an element of arbitrariness involved.

The proportion of Australian women with a bachelor's degree or above rose from just under 13 per cent in 1996 to 28 per cent in 2016. In fact, since 1998, more women than men have earned a bachelor's degree or higher qualification. This appears to have had little impact on the gender pay gap.

abbc-00278	Liberal Democratic Senator David Leyonhjelm says that the Government's proposed changes to Senate voting will make it almost impossible for small parties to win a seat, based on similar reforms made to NSW upper house elections.	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-10/fact-check-senate-voting-reforms-david-leyonhjelm/7203556	Senator Leyonhjelm's claim is overstated. The Senator's assertion that abolishing group voting tickets in the NSW upper house elections resulted in most people choosing to vote for only one party above the line is backed up by the data. However, experts told Fact Check that the proposed Senate voting changes could not be directly compared with NSW because voters would be instructed to number six squares, which differs from the instructions to number one square in NSW.
