pomt-06404	Says adding toll lanes on I-95 in Broward County improved rush-hour traffic for non-toll lanes from 25 mph to 45 mph.	/florida/statements/2011/oct/28/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-toll-roads-sped-traffic-i-95/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a big fan of interviews from friendly talk radio stations, used an Oct. 10, 2011, chat with a Daytona Beach host to discuss prudent investments for the state amid another big budget shortfall. (Well, after saying Florida doesn't need more anthropologists, which created an uproar within the academic community. And after disputing that he's changed how he will measure his promise to create 700,000 private-sector jobs, which PolitiFact Florida gave a full-flop. Moving on ...) Scott pointed to improving state ports in anticipation of the Panama Canal expansion, cargo rail and adding more toll roads across the state to support new construction projects. In his comments to host Marc Bernier, Scott said the state can designate toll lanes on federal highways as long as the state adds a new lane, and he cited changes to Interstate 95 as an example of how it can work well. "We did that down in Broward County," he said. "It took the rush-hour traffic for the non-tolled lanes from 25 mph to 45 (mph). So for people not paying the toll it was a big benefit. We're going to start doing that across the state." Scott's claim that express lanes improved rush-hour traffic for all drivers is interesting, especially given his signal that he wants to expand tolling statewide. He repeated the point a week later in an interview on Tampa Bay's WFLA-AM 970. We thought it wise to check his evidence. 95 Express, a primer First we'll address what he's talking about, as it may not be obvious to residents outside of southeast Florida with its notoriously treacherous commutes. Scott was referring to "95 Express," a Florida Department of Transportation project unveiled in December 2008 to improve traffic speeds during the morning and afternoon rush hour. He misspoke when he said the program was in Broward County. The only operational piece of the project is in Miami-Dade County. DOT workers added new lanes to a 7.3-mile stretch of I-95 by repainting northbound and, about a year later, southbound lane lines. The express lanes replaced High Occupancy Vehicle, or HOV, lanes that were reserved for cars carrying two or more people, free of charge. The HOV lanes -- one in each direction -- were not very popular. The special toll lanes, two in each direction, start at State Road 836, called the Dolphin Expressway, in Miami, and run north to the Golden Glades Interchange. The second phase, which was scheduled to begin construction in fall 2011, will extend from Golden Glades to Fort Lauderdale in Broward County. A word about the tolls: They are paid automatically via electronic transponders (SunPass) but are not charged to motorcycles, registered carpools of three or more passengers, registered hybrid vehicles, and school and transit buses. Anyone else itching to use the lane less traveled pays a fee based on "congestion pricing," meaning the toll value changes with traffic load. The rate increases with demand, so drivers pay more to use the express lane when they need it most. The higher the toll, the busier the lanes. DOT keeps a weekly estimate of these rates. From Oct. 3 to Oct. 7, 2011, the toll in both lanes was 25 cents from midnight to 7 a.m. But in the southbound lane, which takes on a heavier load of morning commuters, the fee got as high as $3. Conversely, the fee peaked at $2.75 in the northbound lanes from 5 to 6 p.m. "They opt to pay the toll because they know they're going to have a more reliable trip," said Brian Rick, DOT District Six spokesman. The program has generated about $28 million since its debut, he said, or about $1 million a month. That money pays for maintenance of the program and express buses that use the lanes. The first phase of construction cost about $132 million, according to the first yearly overview of the program. The second phase reaching Fort Lauderdale will cost an expected $92.7 million and be finished by 2014. The express lanes reached their peak toll of $7.10 when fans piled on the highway after an Oct. 4, 2010, Miami Dolphins-New England Patriots game. That's a pretty steep fare at $1 per mile, earning the express lanes the nickname "Lexus lanes." Benefits Scott is right: converting high-occupancy vehicle lanes to express lanes speeds up traffic, the program overview shows. Traffic in both HOV and general lanes crawled below 20 mph during the morning and afternoon rush, according to a 2008 study of the HOV lanes. With the express lanes, southbound traffic in non-toll lanes jumped to an average 51 mph during morning rush hour, a 35.7 mph leap. In the northbound non-toll lanes during the afternoon rush, traffic sped up to 41.3 mph, improving by 22.5 mph. DOT puts it more simply on its website: "With the opening of the express lanes, drivers are experiencing improved speeds above 40 MPH in the local lanes and 50 MPH in the express lanes along the northbound and southbound directions during rush hour periods." A few caveats about DOT's numbers. The 2008 HOV study relied on peak periods of 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. In its evaluation of average speeds with 95 Express, DOT expanded the rush-hour periods by an additional hour from 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. Also, the southbound toll lanes did not open until Jan. 15, 2010, halfway through the 2009-10 fiscal year during which DOT collected its speed data for both lanes. There's also the number of vehicles using the highway to consider. The program improved peak-period speeds, but did it do the same for volume? The southbound section in 2008 took on an average of 6,872 vehicles in the HOV and general purpose lanes per hour during the morning peak period. In the northbound section, the 2008 hourly peak period figure was 7,843. In 2010 (keeping in mind the caveats we mentioned before) the southbound express and general purpose lanes moved a total of about 8,916 vehicles per morning rush hour, and 7,856 vehicles per hour in the northbound section in the afternoon. DOT has not completed its fiscal year 2011 report, but project manager Rory Santana said volume is improving as peak-period speeds stay the same. In an interview, he acknowledged the argument that traffic would have improved simply because DOT created a new lane. Still, he says, if DOT had just added an extra lane without the toll lanes and congestion pricing, "there's a very good chance that volume would have gone up right there and filled it up," Santana said. Scott and DOT Secretary Ananth Prasad want to expand the managed lanes program across the state. Prasad is seeking a public-private partnership to put new Express-style lanes on I-75 in Broward County, as well as adding a managed lane to Miami's Palmetto Expressway, according to an interview with the News Service of Florida. Our ruling A program overview for 95 Express shows Gov. Scott was about right when he said speeds for rush-hour traffic in non-toll lanes had improved from 25 mph to 45 mph. DOT's first study of the program shows traffic speeds during the peak periods were actually lower than 20 mph before the program. In 2010, traffic speeds during peak periods increased by 35 mph for southbound general lanes and by 22.5 mph in northbound general lanes. Still, Scott misidentified the program's location.

pomt-11886	"We have done more in eight months than the previous administration has done in many years" against ISIS.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/trump-takes-full-credit-gains-against-isis/	President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to hit the Islamic State hard, and the armed fundamentalist group has suffered major losses on his watch. In July, coalition forces broke ISIS' hold on Mosul, the largest Iraqi city under their control. In October, they were forced out of Raqqa, the Syrian city the Islamic State claimed as the capital of their would-be caliphate. During a news conference, Trump drew a sharp contrast with his predecessor in the White House. "We have done more in eight months than the previous administration has done in many years," Trump said Oct. 25. Based on numbers from the battlefield and the assessment of terrorism analysts, Trump can rightly claim that he built on the work done under President Barack Obama, but he can’t take full ownership of the gains that followed. Sorties and munitions Numbers tell only part of the story, but Pentagon figures on the missions flown and the explosives rained down on ISIS put the first months of the Trump administration into context. The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to U.S. Air Force Central Command data, coalition forces engaged the enemy nearly 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and September 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.) Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three-fourths of the action took place during the Obama years. The Air Force reports over 102,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. Over two-thirds of that came before Trump took office. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Loss of territory By late August 2014, the Islamic State controlled about 35,000 square miles. The defense data firm IHS Markit mapped the terrorist group’s declining influence between 2015 and 2017. The ISIS zones are in gray. The maps show that most of the territorial collapse of ISIS took place during the Trump administration. But defense experts say that what the maps don’t show are the offensive operations that began under Obama. The battle for Mosul, for example, began in October 2016, about four months before Trump took office. The collapse was a continuation of what had begun earlier. Between the start of 2015 and February 2016, IHS reported that ISIS had lost 22 percent of the territory it once controlled. A drawn-out effort Some defense analysts criticize Obama for not moving quickly enough to confront the Islamic State. Anthony Cordesman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the Obama administration was "grindingly slow" to get air power and equipment into the region. But that changed rapidly through 2015. "Virtually all were in place before the Trump administration came to office, along with virtually all of the key arms transfers and other assistance that went to Iraqi forces and the Syrian forces supported by the U.S," Cordesman said. Under Trump, the tempo of airstrikes increased, and military commanders were given greater leeway to order attacks. But Cordesman said that represented no great shift in overall strategy. "Trump deserves credit for fully implementing the plan and some limited improvements, but it is nonsense for him to take credit for a program his predecessor had largely put in place," he said. The Islamic State faced battles everywhere. It was under attack by the Iraqi and Syrian militaries. Kurdish and Syrian forces backed by the United States wore down ISIS fighters at strategically key locations. American and Russian airstrikes targeted both ISIS military centers and the oil fields that helped fund the fundamentalist fighters. William Braniff, executive director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said the Islamic State was an "impossibly poor nation-state fighting a multifront war while savaging its own economic base." It was, in Braniff’s view, unsustainable. "This beleaguered proto-state was then starved of external sources of money and fighters by an international effort, that included many initiatives led by the United States under the Obama administration, and that were continued into the Trump administration," Braniff said. We reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said his administration had done more against ISIS in the last eight months than the Obama administration had done in many years. Trump is correct in the sense that the Islamic State has suffered its largest territorial losses since he took office, but that confuses the timing with the cause. Between two-thirds and three-fourths of the firepower unleashed against ISIS hit before Trump became president. The terrorist group’s hold on territory had started to crumble a year before he took command. While Trump ordered some changes in the military operation, the experts we reached said those didn’t transform the strategy so much as continue the one he inherited from Obama. Trump can take credit for keeping the fight going, but he has to share the glory for the results. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13123	"One in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/03/mike-pence/mike-pence-right-1-5-us-households-dont-have-anyon/	On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has consistently criticized President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, echoed that theme during a campaign event in Cocoa Beach, Fla. "Literally, nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't working," Pence said at the Oct. 31 event. "You've got one in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job." We wondered whether Pence was right. We were able to find a statistic with roughly that figure, but it lacks important context. Pence’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we quickly found that several conservative websites all published similar articles last spring with headlines like, "One In Five American Families Don’t Have A Single Person Working A Job." We’ll set aside a technical distinction that will mostly irritate economists -- the difference between "families," which is the unit used in the data cited by the websites, and the broader term "households," which is the word Pence used. There are 81.4 million "families" in the United States, but there are 118.2 million "households," mainly because only "households" include single-person living arrangements. Ultimately, the differences between the two measures was modest -- 19.7 percent of families without any workers, compared to 26.7 percent of households. If these percentages were all that mattered, then Pence would be correct. But what he said ignores that many of those households without a working member consist of senior citizens who are retired. And unless Pence intends to shoo Grandma and Grandpa out of their Barcaloungers and into the workplace, he’s using a statistic that inflates the weakness of the labor market for Americans in their prime working years. How big a concern is this? Looking in federal statistical databases, we couldn’t find what percentage of households consisted of senior citizens. However, we were able to reverse-engineer it. We’ve streamlined the math by making some assumptions, but experts tell us the underlying method is solid. We’ll use "households" as our metric here, because that’s the term Pence used. (Using "families" would produce similar results.) According to the U.S. Census Bureau chart below, there were roughly 30 million households headed by someone 65 or older in 2015. Presumably most of these included a spouse who was also 65 or older. Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 19.5 percent of Americans 65 and over are in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for work). The flip side of this is that about 80 percent of Americans 65 and older are not in the labor force. As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, you can multiply the 30 million 65-and-over households by 80 percent -- the likelihood that someone of that age is not in the labor force -- and come up with an estimate of 24 million senior-citizen households in which no one working. These 24 million retiree households account for the vast majority of the 31.7 million total households in which no one is working. Essentially, it leaves 7.7 million households where no one is working for a reason other than retirement. These 7.7 million households account for just 6.5 percent of the nation’s 118.2 million households. And 6.5 percent is quite a bit smaller than the 20 percent figure Pence cited. By our math, about two-thirds of Pence’s non-working households can be explained by retirement -- a demographic issue that no president can reverse -- rather than by a shortage of jobs. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, cautioned that many households include someone who is 65 and older yet still working, and many households have someone younger than 65 who is either unable to work, due to disability, or who has chosen to go to school or stay home to raise children. "It is valid for political candidates to point to the disappointing employment-to-population ratio of adults, especially for American men between 25 and 54," he said. "But it is quite misleading to suggest there is something wrong with a country that makes it possible for adult students, disabled adults, and very aged adults to live comfortably and productively in families or households that do not contain a person working for pay." Our ruling Pence said, "One in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job." Pence has a point that, according to federal data, about one of every five families, and about one of every four households, does not include a worker. However, this glosses over the fact that a big majority of these households have no worker because they consist of senior citizens who have retired -- an entirely different policy concern than a weak labor market, and one whose demographic roots make it beyond the reach of the Obama administration.

pomt-13825	Says Hillary Clinton "took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire" during the terrorist attack in Benghazi.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/mike-pence/pence-falsely-says-clinton-didnt-send-help-during-/	Vice presidential nominees are often expected to act as attack dogs on a campaign ticket. Maybe Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was warming up for the role at a rally for Donald Trump in Indiana on July 12. Pence rattled off a series of reasons Hillary Clinton was not fit for the presidency. One of them caught our attention, a claim about Benghazi, the Libyan city where a 2012 terrorist attack left four Americans dead. "We don't need a president that took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire and after four brave Americans fell said ‘what difference, at this point, does it make.’ Anyone who did that, anyone who said that, should be disqualified from ever being commander in chief of the armed forces," Pence said. President Barack Obama’s administration has been subject to a great deal of scrutiny during, before and after that attack, and much of that has been directed at Clinton. Several investigations have found, however, that no action by Clinton -- or anybody in the administration -- could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths. And if it were possible, Clinton was not responsible for sending help. That fell to military officials. The Benghazi timeline The attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi began at 9:40 p.m., Benghazi time. It took until after 10 a.m. the next morning for the last plane evacuating Americans to leave Benghazi — the time from the initial attack to the final evacuation is Pence’s "13 hours." (For a more detailed timeline, see this document issued by the House’s select committee on Benghazi or our fact-check of a claim about delays in the military’s response.) At an 11 p.m. meeting (5 p.m. Washington time), President Barack Obama directed military officials to "do everything possible" to save lives in Benghazi. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified that he then ordered forces around the Mediterranean to move toward Libya. Clinton’s department was ultimately responsible for the security setup at the Benghazi mission, but at this point it was the military, under the Defense Department and, ultimately, the president, that was moving forces toward Libya. None of the forces ordered to prepare to deploy to Benghazi ever reached the city in the aftermath of the attack. Eventually, it was decided that the Americans in Benghazi would evacuate to Tripoli, Libya's capital, and forces that would have gone to Benghazi were directed there, Libya’s capital, where they were being evacuated to. The CIA station chief in Tripoli — as opposed to anyone in Washington — dispatched a team to work with local militia groups to extract the Americans in Benghazi. Clinton was active throughout the 13-hour period. She testified that she called Libya’s president to see if friendly forces could be dispatched to help the Americans in Benghazi. She also spoke with the embassy in Tripoli and then-CIA director David Petraeus. There have been eight congressional investigations of Benghazi so far, most of which were run by Republicans. Several of their reports criticized Clinton and her State Department for the security setup in Benghazi, for their part in the administration messaging after the attack, and for not holding themselves accountable afterward. But they generally criticized the Defense Department or other parts of the administration, not Clinton or the State Department, for delays in deploying military assets the night of the attack. When Congressman Mike Pompeo asked Clinton, "Why was heaven and earth not moved at the initial sound of guns," in terms of sending help, Clinton told him to ask the Defense Department. The House select committee on Benghazi concluded: "The decisions made earlier in the year by senior State Department officials to maintain a presence in Benghazi without adequate security forces and an inadequately fortified Mission compound contributed to what amounted to a worst case scenario of circumstances that would test the military’s preparedness and ability to respond. "Nevertheless, the Defense Department did not pass the test." The committee went on to question why it took so long for orders from Obama and Panetta to translate into action on the ground. The committee’s final report leaves open the possibility that the State Department might have further impeded the speed of reaction to Benghazi. "Whether this failure is shouldered by (the Defense Department) alone, or rests in part on decisions made by the State Department in Washington D.C. or with the White House... is one of the lingering questions about Benghazi," the report reads. This brings up the possibility that the State Department delayed help, but that wasn’t Pence’s claim. And, based on the generally accepted timeline of the attack, its appears likely the delay ended up being immaterial. Different Republican-led congressional investigations have concluded that additional forces could not have reached Benghazi in time to matter. Even if Clinton was responsible for the response to the attack, it's not clear what she could have done to overcome what military officials called "the tyranny of time and distance." Our ruling Pence claimed that Clinton "took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire." In fact, it wasn’t Clinton’s responsibility to send troops to the scene — the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred. Pence implied that Clinton dawdled before sending help to Americans in danger. That is not accurate.

pomt-14308	"Youth unemployment in minority communities is about 40 to 45 percent."	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/31/peter-kinder/peter-kinder-right-about-high-unemployment-minorit/	Candidates for Missouri’s GOP gubernatorial nomination have sparred over race relations, MU campus protests and the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. At a March 17 debate in Columbia, Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder said unemployment was a key cause of the events in Ferguson, saying, "Young men were walking around with nothing to do." "Minority youth unemployment is about 40 to 45 percent," Kinder said. The reasons for the unrest in Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown aren’t simple, but we wanted to determine whether Kinder’s numbers for youth unemployment in minority communities were on the money. Youth unemployment in Ferguson and the city of St. Louis Kinder’s office said the numbers came from a St. Louis Post-Dispatch column in 2014, which said 47 percent of the metro area’s African-American men between ages 16 and 24 were unemployed, according to 2012 census numbers. Peter Muesser, professor of labor economics at MU, said the youth jobless rate Kinder cited seemed to be in the correct range. "I’m seeing Kinder’s statement as likely reliable because it was based on Census Bureau info," he said. "The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau are the best sources when it comes to reliable unemployment statistics." The Census Bureau and the BLS work together, using annual and monthly surveys to define the unemployment rate and other measures of the American population. The Current Population Survey is more in-depth, but the American Community Survey has a bigger sample size, which allows for unemployment estimates from smaller geographical areas like cities and townships. According to the American Community Survey, the youth unemployment rates in 2014 for St. Louis City, Ferguson Township, and Ferguson City were significantly different. St. Louis City – 32 percent (16-19 years); 21 percent (20-24 years) Ferguson Township – 54 percent (16-19 years); 34 percent (20-24 years) Because Kinder specified youth unemployment in minority communities, we looked at the demographic makeup of both St. Louis City and Ferguson. St. Louis City – 126,452 white residents; 118,653 African American residents Ferguson – 9,178 white residents; 17,824 African American residents St. Louis has a comparable number of black and white residents. Ferguson has a significantly larger African-American population, with black residents outnumbering white residents by a 2-to-1 margin. The rate of African American unemployment in all age groups is historically twice that of white unemployment across the nation. Youth unemployment is no different – nationally, the unemployment rate for African Americans 16-24 is about 20 percent, while the unemployment rate for the same age group of whites is about 10 percent. Our Ruling The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data fits Ferguson into Kinder’s claim of youth unemployment of about 40 percent to 45 percent in minority communities. Defining which cities, suburbs and townships are "minority communities" is a matter of debate. But it’s worth noting that Ferguson’s youth are not only more unemployed than their peers in St. Louis , they are also significantly more unemployed on average than both white and black 16-24 year-olds across the country. Ferguson was the community in question when Kinder cited the rate of 40 percent to 45 percent of youth unemployment in minority communities — and Ferguson does fit into Kinder’s estimate.

pomt-06785	Says Rick Perry "wanted to secede from the union."	/texas/statements/2011/aug/17/jay-carney/white-house-press-secretary-says-perry-wanted-sece/	Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, brought up secession when a New York Times columnist asked about the latest Republican presidential aspirant, Texas Gov. Rick Perry. In her op-ed column posted online Aug. 16, 2011, Maureen Dowd describes the stumping Perry as galloping "through Iowa like an unbroken stallion in danger of cracking a leg." Her column notes that the governor called President Barack Obama "the greatest threat to our country" and questioned Obama’s patriotism and sense of duty. Also mentioned: Perry saying Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would be treated "ugly" in Texas for tackling the economic slump by printing more money. In Cedar Rapids on Aug. 15, Perry said "printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost ... treasonous in my opinion." Obama, Dowd writes, batted away the Texan. Her column then quotes Carney telling her: "We may disagree with our political opponents, but we certainly think they’re all patriots — even those who wanted to secede from the union." We take that as Obama's spokesman saying Perry wanted Texas to secede. But did Perry say that? Asked for backup information, White House spokesman Adam Abrams pointed us to an April 17, 2009, Austin American-Statesman news article recapping Perry’s response to an Associated Press reporter who had asked him about people associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas. Perry, who had just spoken at an April 15, 2009, Austin tea party rally, suggested Texans might at some point get so fed up with Democratic-led actions in Washington that they would want to secede. PolitiFact Texas later transcribed the exchange: Reporter Kelley Shannon: "Some have associated you with the idea of secession or sovereignty for your state..." Perry: "Oh, I think there’s a lot of different scenarios. Texas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that. "You know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention. We’ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we’re a pretty independent lot to boot." A day after the rally, the Statesman reported, Perry called potential secession a "side issue of Texas history. ... We are very proud of our Texas history; people discuss and debate the issues of can we break ourselves into five states, can we secede, a lot of interesting things that I'm sure Oklahoma and Pennsylvania would love to be able to say about their states, but the fact is, they can't because they're not Texas." As noted recently by the Texas Tribune, Perry also touched on secession before the rally. He’s heard in audio accompanied by still photographs posted on YouTube in March 2009 telling tech bloggers visiting him in his Capitol office that from its beginnings as a state, "one of the deals was" that Texas could leave the union "any time we want." Perry continues on the recording: "So we’re kind of thinking about that again." His guests laughed. An anonymous Texas blogger takes credit here for putting the audio and pictures together. This week, we reached one of the tech bloggers, Robert Scoble of Half Moon Bay, Calif., who said the meeting occurred because the bloggers were in Austin for a conference. He said the visitors thought Perry "was being funny. I always thought" Perry’s secession reference "was just Texas bragging" mixed with Perry’s disappointment in the country’s direction. By email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said she has no details about the meeting. She said, though: "The governor was not advocating secession. He never has and he never will." After Perry made his April 2009 comment, a Perry spokeswoman told the Statesman that Perry believes Texas could secede if it wanted. Not so, advised Sanford Levinson, a professor at the School of Law at the University of Texas at Austin, saying that between the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and the 1845 Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States, there is no explicit right for the state to return to its days as a republic. "We actually fought a war over this issue, and there is no possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a 'right' to secede," Levinson said in an e-mail. Levinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows for Texas to break itself into five states but doesn't specify whether that would require congressional approval — and forming new states still wouldn't constitute secession. That was hardly the end of the issue. In April 2010, Perry said in an interview with Newsweek and the Texas Tribune he wanted to clear up his reply on secession the year before. "It was asked as a, you know, what do you think about the people who shout out the word 'secede.' And I say that we live in an incredibly wonderful country and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen. …" We rated Perry’s recap of his 2009 remarks Mostly True because he didn’t acknowledge in the later interview either his position that Texas has the right to secede or his initial speculation about "who knows what may come" from people angry about actions in Washington. Also, in June 2010, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said Perry had threatened to secede, a claim we rated False. Via the Nexis search tool, we found 169 major newspaper articles as of that time linking Perry and secession. But none quoted Perry threatening to push for secession, though critics and comedians framed his words in that way. Our conclusion was that in a politically theatrical moment, Perry stated an old (and factually incorrect) claim that Texas retains the right to leave the union. That is not the same as his saying giddyap, I want to leave. Perry didn’t call for secession then and hasn’t since. We rate Carney’s statement False.

pomt-07536	Says "some [states] with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population."	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/05/newt-gingrich/gingrich-states-should-consider-alternatives-priso/	In the wake of the Great Recession, some conservative political leaders are considering a new portion of the state budget to save money -- the prison system. Gov. Nathan Deal has talked about his desire to find less costly alternatives to prison for drug addicts who commit nonviolent crimes. "It is draining our state treasury and depleting our workforce," Deal said in his inaugural address. It seems some of this new thinking comes from conservative mastermind Newt Gingrich, the former Georgia congressman and one-time U.S. House speaker who says he is considering a run for president. Gingrich co-wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post a few days before Deal’s speech that contained similar themes. "The criminal justice system is broken, and conservatives must lead the way in fixing it," wrote Gingrich and Pat Nolan, a former California lawmaker who is now vice president of a Christian ministry that aids prisoners, ex-prisoners and their families. "Some people attribute the nation’s recent drop in crime to more people being locked up. But the facts show otherwise," they added. "While crime fell in nearly every state over the past seven years, some of those with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population." AJC PolitiFact Georgia stumbled upon the second sentence late last week and wondered whether it was true. Wouldn’t the reason why some states have less crime is because more criminals are in prison? A Gingrich spokesman pointed to data from states such as Texas to make the former speaker’s case. In 2007, Texas lawmakers approved broad changes to the state’s correctional system -- then the nation’s largest -- that included more drug courts and treatment programs, The New York Times reported. Crime, Gingrich and Nolan wrote, dropped 10 percent between 2004 and 2009, and the Lone Star State is expected to save about $2 billion in prison costs over five years. Gingrich and Nolan also compared New York and Florida to further prove their point. "Over the past seven years, Florida's incarceration rate has increased 16 percent, while New York's decreased 16 percent," they wrote. "Yet the crime rate in New York has fallen twice as much as Florida's. Put another way, although New York spent less on its prisons, it delivered better public safety." We looked around to see whether anyone has done research on this topic. The Washington-based Pew Center on the States puts together an annual report on the prison population of each state. Its most recent annual report, released in April 2010, found the number of state inmates in America declined for the first time in 38 years. Between 1972 and 2008, the number of state prisoners grew by an astounding 708 percent, Pew found. The Pew Center has also done research, using data from the federal government, on the nation’s crime rate. It shared two charts: one with the change in crime rate between 1999 and 2009; the other contained the incarceration rate change during that same time period. The Pew research showed four of the 10 states with the greatest drops in crime were also among the top 10 states in lowering their incarceration rates. Those four states were Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Utah. The six other states had increases in their incarceration rates. Texas, which Gingrich and Nolan held up as an example of their theory, had a 10 percent drop in crime and a 15 percent decline in its incarceration rate. Georgia, by the way, had a 21 percent decrease in crime and a 1 percent decrease in its incarceration rate, according to Pew’s data. The Peach State did not rank in the top 10 in either category. We also looked at data from the federal National Institute of Corrections, which compiled 2008 crime statistics from several state and federal agencies and the incarceration rates in 2009. Seven of the 10 states with the lowest crime rates also had among the 15 lowest incarceration rates. Those seven states were Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota and Vermont. Georgia had the eighth-highest crime rate and incarceration rate. Florida and Texas ranked among the top 10 highest crime rates and incarceration rates. So are some of these states making a concerted attempt to leave more space in their prisons? Texas is trying to change its approach in order to save money on incarceration, Gingrich and The New York Times noted. In Oregon, where officials say the crime rate is at its lowest rate in four decades, the state’s Criminal Justice Commission analyzed five-year intervals of the state’s incarceration rate, the Portland Oregonian reported. Oregon had a 36 percent decrease in crime between 1999 and 2009, the largest decrease in the nation, according to the Pew data. The commission found major drops in both violent and property crime from 1995 through 2000, when Oregon's prison population grew more than 50 percent, the Oregonian reported. It also showed that when incarceration remained fairly flat from 2005 to 2008, violent crime and property crime continued to fall. Then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat, has used the lack of growth in the prison system to argue that Oregon should not "overinvest in our prison system." Others in the Oregonian article suggest the lower crime rate is a result of an aging population and efforts to reduce the production of a key ingredient of methamphetamine. There is some debate about what factors are causing a decline in crime. Gingrich and Nolan argued that "some" states with major reductions in crime have also had large drops in their incarceration rate. The Pew figures provide support to Gingrich’s point. So does the National Institute of Corrections data. Therefore, we rate Gingrich’s statement as True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-04-05T06:00:00	2011-01-07	['None']

pomt-09111	“The Republican Party lost 1.1 million registered voters since 2008. The Democratic Party lost 1.2 million registered voters… (while) voter registration in the Libertarian Party rose 8 percent.”	/texas/statements/2010/jun/19/libertarian-party-texas/libertarian-party-says-major-parties-have-shed-reg/	Just before the Libertarian Party of Texas held its state convention, it suggested its fortunes are rising while the two major political parties are on the decline. “The Republican Party lost 1.1 million registered voters since 2008,” the Libertarians said in a June 7 press release. “The Democratic Party lost 1.2 million registered voters in that time period. There is one exception: the Libertarian Party. Over the same time frame, voter registration in the Libertarian Party rose 8 percent.” Did the major parties bleed voters while the LPT surged? Significantly, party affiliations based on voter registration records can only be gauged in the 29 states that allow citizens to declare an affiliation when they register. Texas is among 21 states that don’t permit voters to air a preference at registration time. To back up its claim, the Texas party’s release cites a blog post on smallgovtimes.com. We found that post largely based on research by Michael McDonald, an associate professor of Public and International Affairs at George Mason University. McDonald cites his research in two May posts at Pollster.com. In his first post, McDonald writes that since the 2008 election, voters registering as Democrats are down by 2.7 percent and voters registering as Republicans have dropped 3.5 percent in those states where voters are allowed to register an affiliation. Voters registering their affiliation with a minor party increased by 2.4 percent, he writes. Still, McDonald does not see an incipient minor-party revolution afoot. “America is a long way from having a viable multi-party system at the federal level, like we are currently witnessing in the United Kingdom,” he says in his second post. “However, these trends are consistent with the notion that some American voters are willing to express their frustration with the major parties by registering with a minor political party or affiliating with no party. Indeed, the increase in unaffiliated registrations is a long-term phenomenon observed since the 1970s.” We contacted McDonald in hopes of boring in on Libertarian voter registrations. He told us he did not separately calculate registration for minor parties, but referred us to Richard Winger, a Libertarian himself and the editor of Ballot Access News, a monthly newsletter. A May 26 blog post by Winger says Libertarian registrations in places that allow registration by party are up 8 percent since October 2008 — the figure cited in the release from the Texas Libertarians. Generally, Winger writes, more “voters are registered Libertarians now than ever before. Between October 2008 and this spring, Libertarian registration rose in 19 of the 23 states that tally Libertarians. It declined in four states, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and South Dakota,” a state where the party has not been on the ballot since 2006. Professor McDonald told us he still doesn’t see Libertarians succeeding at the polls unless, he said, they move en masse to, say, lightly populated Wyoming. “They’re not concentrated enough in one state or district in order to win elections,” he said. Here’s why: Regardless of cited changes in party affiliation percentage-wise, the raw numbers of voters registering affiliations underscore the dominance of the major parties. As researched by McDonald, some 43.3 million voters now line up as Democrats, while 29.9 million align as Republicans. Meanwhile, 2.2 million voters are registered as members of minor parties. As of May, according to Winger’s research, more than 259,000 voters had registered affiliations with the Libertarian Party. Even if we assume that some of nearly 23.6 million unaffiliated voters in states where voters can register their affiliations end up supporting Libertarians at the polls, their numerical share of the electorate is swamped by either of the major parties. In elections, numbers are everything. That brings us to a statistical problem with the Libertarian’s statement: it compares a reduction in numbers (how many voters fell off the Democratic and Republican rolls) with an increase in a percentage (the share of voters affiliated with the Libertarian party). Patrick Dixon of Lago Vista, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Texas, told us that’s how the information was presented on the cited online sources. “Maybe I was a little lazy there,” Dixon said. Regardless, he said, the trend is that “our party is growing and theirs are shrinking or growing flat.” In fact, McDonald’s breakdown, shown on a chart in his first May blog post, tracks registrations both by raw numbers and percentages for the two major parties and all minor parties lumped together. Upshot: Based on voter registrations in 29 states that allow voters to declare their party affiliation, the statistics cited by the Libertarian Party are correct. But comparing raw numbers and percentages to make a point, as the Libertarians do, can leave a distorted impression: that the major parties are fading away as the Libertarians gallop ahead. Voter for voter, that’s at least an incomplete characterization. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-13397	Says Donald Trump once suggested that he "would try to negotiate down the national debt."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-has-said-he-woul/	During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump fought about his statements on the national debt. Clinton said, "You even one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States." As she spoke, Trump interjected, "Wrong. Wrong." We did not get a reply from the Trump campaign on the night of the debate. The Trump campaign also did not respond when we looked at his debt comments in May. Clinton is correct that Trump did talk about negotiating down the debt, but he backtracked on his views after economists panned his idea. Trump’s debt statements Clinton’s attack stems from comments Trump made about the national debt in two separate interviews in May. Trump’s initial remarks came in an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick on May 5, 2016. Sorkin: "Mr. Trump, you talk about debt. And you are to some degree the king of debt. I appreciate that point. You have also renegotiated debt agreements over the years. Do you believe that we, in terms of the United States, need to pay 100 cents on the dollar, or do you think that there's actually ways that we can renegotiate that debt?" Trump: "Yeah, I think -- look. I have borrowed, knowing that you can pay back with discounts. And I have done very well with debt. Now, of course, I was swashbuckling, and it did well for me and it was good for me and all that. And you know, debt was sort of always interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with the country. But I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can't lose. It's like, you know, you make a deal before you go into a poker game, and your odds are so much better." ... Quick: "I understand that you've done this in business deals, but are you suggesting we would negotiate with the U.S. credit in such a way?" Trump: "No, I think this. I think there are times for us to refinance. We refinance debt with longer term. Because you know, we owe so much money. … I could see long-term renegotiations, where we borrow long-term at very low rates." ... Quick: "But let's be clear. I mean, you're not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the U.S. has already issued?" Trump: "No. I don't want to renegotiate the bonds. But I think you can do discounting, I think, you know, depending on where interest rates are, I think you can buy back. You can -- I'm not talking about with a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts, you can do things with discounts. … I would refinance debt. I think we should refinance longer-term debt." The second comments came in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, on May 9, 2016. Trump: "I’m only saying you can buy back. Look, this isn’t a real estate deal where you can go in and buy out a mortgage at a big discount because the market crashes, okay? This is the United States government. The bonds are absolutely sacred. … I’m saying if interest rates go up, you can buy debt at a discount on the market — just on the market. You just buy back debt on — at a discount." Wall Street Journal: "And so the U.S. government should spend its money to go buy back its bonds and --" Trump: "Well, if they can make good deals. If they can buy the debt back at good deals, you could buy it back in the market. And if rates go up, you’ll always — you’re always given that opportunity. But no, I’m not talking about negotiating with — with people that own the debt or creditors or anything like that." He tried to clarify his remarks in an interview on CNN May 9, and said that his comments had been misrepresented by the media. "If interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back at a discount, if we are liquid enough as a country, we should do that. In other words, we can buy back debt at a discount," he said. "People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and these people are crazy." Experts told PolitiFact in May that Trump’s statements were unclear and that he confused the concepts of "discount," "refinance," and "renegotiate." (We provided a more detailed discussion of the consequences of what he seemed to argue for in this article.) "The statements are neither clear nor coherent," said Paolo Mauro, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School when PolitiFact asked him about it in May. On the night of the first presidential debate, Dean Baker, an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said that Trump’s comments "didn’t make any sense." "The U.S. has the strongest possible credit rating because it has always paid its debt," he said. "It would pay an enormous price if he tried to negotiate a write-down. We would pay higher interest rates for many decades in the future.More importantly, with the ratio of interest payments to (gross domestic product) at 50-year lows, it is hard to see why anyone would try to do this." "No one on the other side would pick up the phone if the secretary of the U.S. Treasury tried to make that call," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a firm that analyzes Federal Reserve operations, economic data and Treasury financing trends, told the New York Times. "Why should they? They have a contract" requiring payment in full. Our ruling Clinton said Trump one time suggested that he "would try to negotiate down the national debt." In two separate interviews in May, Trump suggested that he could do something to negotiate federal debt through "discounting" and that he would "refinance debt" and "buy back debt on — at a discount." He backtracked after criticism, saying his words had been misinterpreted.

pomt-09320	Says Republican state leaders are using "Soviet-style" budget management.	/texas/statements/2010/apr/15/bill-white/bill-white-objects-what-he-calls-soviet-style-budg/	In a public interview hosted by the Austin-based Texas Tribune, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White compared Republican leadership on state budget woes to how things swung in ye olde U.S.S.R. You remember, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -- home of the late dictator Joseph Stalin and run single-handedly by the Communist Party prior to the government's collapse in 1991. White said March 9 he’d take a more deliberate approach to spending than the state's top leaders, all Republican, who asked government agencies in January to suggest ways to cut their budgets by 5 percent. White said if he's in charge, "it won’t be done by things that are just across the board, Soviet style, you know, budget management that only career politicians seem to embrace." Pressed by interviewer Evan Smith, White said: "Is it just a coincidence that 5 percent is the appropriate amount for each state agency?... No. It’s because that’s the way that career politicians know how to run government." We started our review of White's statement wondering what "Soviet-style" budget management means. Several expert professors said that historically, the term didn't refer to across-the-board budget cuts. Professor Paul Gregory of the University of Houston Department of History said "Soviet style" makes him think of a monopoly party (in this case, the Communist Party) dictating everything to subordinates without any possibility of change. Gregory said Soviet-style budgeting also means hiding expenditures you don’t want people to see—such as massive investments in military infrastructure. Peter Caldwell, a Rice University professor of history, said budget-writing in the Soviet Union most often consisted of “huge and crude” decisions to invest in one part of the economy at the expense of another. And H. Stephen Gardner, chairman of the Baylor University Department of Economics, said he’d define Soviet-style management as overly centralized as opposed to giving autonomy to individual units of government. So are there "Soviet style" ways that state leaders have approached the budget? Some background: In January, Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus--mindful of a projected state revenue shortfall that could reach $15 billion by next January--jointly asked agencies to submit plans identifying savings in 5 percent “priority increments” in their 2010-11 appropriations from state revenue. Such plans could lead to cuts, though no decisions have been made and some programs have already been excused. No doubt, the leaders' request is a centralized one. But is it Soviet-style in any other way? We turned to White for elaboration. White’s campaign pointed us to a statement issued by White, the former Houston mayor, in January: “Well-run organizations cut spending based on priorities and where they can best attain productivity improvements. So, for example, in the city of Houston we made smaller cuts in public safety because that was the highest priority. And we were able to cut more in garbage collection and disposal through productivity improvements.” White then told us that by "Soviet style," he doesn't mean that Texas state government owns the means of production, as in the Soviet Union. “Obviously we have a market system,” White said. He described his alternative approach to the looming revenue gap, saying that as governor, he'd focus on funding priorities such as education while encouraging agencies to improve productivity via "process re-engineering" without hurting the delivery of services to taxpayers. He said the state also would seek savings by renegotiating vendor contracts. Also, he said, there’d be regular meetings with agency chiefs to talk about how they’re cutting spending and avoiding non-essential hirings. “I would have had reports back to me weekly and monthly concerning the efficiencies identified,” White said. We didn't get to why White considers the existing approach "Soviet style" before he had to go. We asked the professors if "Soviet style" accurately characterizes the GOP leaders' request for proposed budget cuts. Gregory said describing the request from Perry, et al. that way “doesn’t seem to have any relevance to what was actually practiced in the Soviet Union. ... It's inappropriate to use that term." Gardner agreed, saying: "It’s a bit hyperbolic to refer to this (budget cutting) as Soviet style. I should admit I have done exactly the same thing myself on matters of budgeting.” The point of saying as much, Gardner said, is to elicit an emotional reaction. He added that Republicans who cast President Barack Obama as socialist — Perry has told reporters he thinks Obama has socialist beliefs — are likewise guilty of hyperbole for dramatic effect. The professor, who said he considers Obama a centrist, speculated that Noam Chomsky, a left-leaning linguist who writes on public affairs, would call the president a "crazed capitalist." "If White’s point is that budget management is being handled in an overly centralized way," Gardner said, "I can see the element of truth there. The problem I would have is even if you say I am going to be more careful and more surgically look at the right places to cut, you’re still using a more centralized approach.” Caldwell agreed with the psychological impact, if not the accuracy, of "Soviet style." Generally, he said, “anyone who ever mentions the Soviet economy or Naziism when they’re talking about American domestic debate is usually off track. They’re referring to crude examples to raise the stakes of a debate. They’re not necessarily wanting a careful, rational debate. Who in America wants the Soviet economy or supports Naziism?” Our conclusion? The GOP leaders' request that agencies submit proposed budget cuts isn’t Soviet style — not even close. At best, White's statement is an example of how politicians try to light up a room. It's so off base, we're lighting up the meter: Pants on Fire!

pomt-05250	Says in the last six months of the Bush administration, the U.S. lost 3.5 million jobs, including 760,000 jobs during January 2009 alone.	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/01/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-35-million-jobs-lost-during-bush-ad/	Vice President Joe Biden spent a lot of time in New Hampshire during the 2008 election, both as a candidate himself and as President Barack Obama’s running mate. So, when he returned to the Granite State earlier this month, he looked back to 2008 and the economic turmoil that year. Speaking May 22 to a crowd at Keene State College, Biden referred to the start of the national recession in the fall of 2008 and to the failing economy he and Obama inherited when they came into office. "In the last six months of the Bush administration, we lost 3.5 million jobs," Biden told the crowd. "As a matter of fact, on that magnificent day … when we were sworn in, before I lowered my hand that day after taking the oath … we’d already lost over 760,000 jobs that month." Claims and blames like this have become a rallying cry of sorts for Obama’s re-election campaign. But, are they true? PolitiFact decided to take a look. The source of the numbers wasn’t hard to find. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks employment numbers from month to month dating back to 1939. The data from the last six months of the Bush administration supports Biden’s claim. A search of the job figures from July 2008 through January 2009 shows the country lost 3.47 million jobs during that time, falling from 137 million from July 2008 to 133.6 million in January 2009, according to the bureau’s monthly count. Those figures, which are seasonally adjusted, are based on payroll surveys collected the 12th of each month from 141,000 businesses and government agencies across 486,000 locations, according to Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the labor statistics bureau. The labor statistics show that job losses started to mount before the end of the Bush administration. Driven by the bursting housing bubble, the country lost 84,000 jobs between January and February 2008. But the job losses grew, reaching 200,000 in April. And by September, when Lehman Brothers collapsed in the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, job losses spiked again, reaching 489,000 in October and 803,000 in November. When Obama and Biden took office in January 2009, the country had already lost 818,000 jobs from the prior month, falling from 134.4 million in December 2008 to 133.6 million in January. But, if you pro-rate those figures to the Jan. 20 inauguration date referenced by Biden, the economy would have lost about 527,000 jobs, roughly two-thirds of the month’s total. That number falls below Biden’s claim of 760,000 jobs lost by the time he took office. The steep job losses continued through the first few months of the Obama presidency, which lost 3.4 million from February through July 2009, according to the labor data. In October 2010, the economy started adding jobs, and job growth has been evident for 19 consecutive months, according to the labor figures. In total, the economy has lost 1.4 million jobs since Obama and Biden took office. "It had gotten bad by (the time they came into office)," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. "Regardless of political leanings, it is not ambiguous that Obama inherited a labor market in free fall." Our ruling: The economic recovery and job creation during the Obama administration will be a leading point of contention throughout the 2012 election. As for the labor situation Obama and Biden inherited when they came to office, there’s little room for debate. Federal labor statistics support Biden’s claim that the country lost 3.5 million jobs in the last six months of the Bush administration, but they show he overstated the losses reported by inauguration day, Jan. 20, 2009.

pomt-04688	"We have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/06/choose-new-jersey/new-jersey-leads-world-number-scientists-engineers/	New Jersey has long held the title of most densely populated state in the country. But the Garden State has an even more prestigious ranking, according to a recent advertisement placed by Choose: New Jersey in the Wall Street Journal. The July 30 ad reads in part: "New Jersey has a rich tradition of bringing the world some very big thinking. In fact, we have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world, making ours one of the most highly skilled and educated workforces available." That’s quite a claim for any state to make so for this fact check, we are focusing only on the statistic about scientists and engineers. And it seems Choose: New Jersey’s calculations add up. Let’s look at how Choose: New Jersey, a nonprofit group that markets the state to attract businesses and jobs, came up with their statistic. Choose: New Jersey is part of the Partnership For Action, the Business Action Center and state Economic Development Authority. Melissa Hensley, chief marketing officer for the group, said the group compared geographic and employment data from four organizations: the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, the CIA’s World Fact Book 2012, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the National Science Board. "All of it came down to an apples-to-apples comparison to the extent possible between a state and country," Hensley said. The Census Bureau’s Population Reference Bureau listed New Jersey as having 260,655 scientists and engineers in 2010. That number divided by New Jersey’s total land area of 8,722.58 square miles equals 29.88 scientists and engineers – the highest number among all states and a list of 37 countries. "I read somewhere that New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the U.S., so I guess you could extrapolate from that that there are more scientists per square mile than anywhere else," Brian Bell, a spokesman for the California Institute of Technology said in an e-mail. "Although Massachusetts might give N.J. a run for its money. California has lots of smart people, but we have huge deserts and lots of empty space too." Bell’s guess is accurate. Massachusetts has the second highest number of scientists and engineers, at 23.47 per square mile, followed by Maryland, at 20.97. California is 10th on the list. A similar calculation was used for other countries by measuring the number of researchers – a more broad term that includes scientists and engineers – per 1,000 of employed people. Breaking that figure down and comparing it against country size, we determined that Israel tops the international list, with 5.10 scientists and engineers per square mile (Choose: New Jersey’s calculations were adjusted to consider countries in square miles instead of kilometers). Rounding out the top three are Japan, at 4.46, and Belgium, at 3.16. If both lists are put together, New Jersey and 11 other U.S. states lead the world in number of engineers and scientists per square mile before Israel joins the rankings. "The numbers reflect what we regularly hear from businesses considering locating or expanding in New Jersey – that if a company is looking to benefit from a high concentration of very skilled talent, New Jersey is a prime location," Hensley said in response to our findings. Our ruling Choose: New Jersey said in an advertisement that "we have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world," making the state’s workforce one of the most skilled and highly educated. Choose: New Jersey used a variety of data to reach its conclusion, from the U.S. Census Bureau to the CIA World Fact Book and more. PolitiFact New Jersey vetted the calculations and found that the Garden State does top the world in number of scientists and engineers per square mile: 29.8. We rate this statement True.

pomt-05316	Obama promised to cut the deficit by half by the end of his first term but he "hasn't even come close."	/florida/statements/2012/may/17/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-ad-says-obama-failed-keep-pledge-ha/	President Barack Obama is failing to deliver on his promises, insists a new attack ad from conservative group Crossroads GPS. The TV commercial, airing in Florida and nine other states through May 31, 2012, lists a few examples relating to foreclosures, taxes and Obama’s health care plan. We plan to fact-check each claim, but for now we’ll address one about the deficit. (See our other stories on past claims from Crossroads GPS.) The ad shows a clip of Obama at a press conference where he says, "Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office." A narrator deems that a broken promise over the sound of shattered glass, adding that Obama "hasn’t even come close." Spoiler alert: We’ve already checked out this issue a few times. In short, the claim about the deficit -- the difference between government spends and takes in -- is accurate. Obama indeed made the pledge on Feb. 23, 2009, following a "Fiscal Responsibility Summit" shortly after his inauguration. (Watch more of his remarks that day.) He said then that the nation’s $1.3 trillion deficit was the largest in the nation’s history. It was mostly unchanged through fiscal year 2011. In 2012? It’s expected to be $1.17 trillion. So not cut in half. That’s according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in a March 2012 report. "Although the deficit is starting to shrink, it remains very large by historical standards," the CBO noted. PolitiFact Florida asked the Obama campaign about the pledge as part of a fact-check along the same lines from Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry. The campaign pointed us to Obama’s response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012. "Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized," he said. "Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. …" Obama promised to halve the nation’s deficit, but he hasn’t managed to chip away much as the end of his first term nears. We rate this claim from the Crossroads GPS ad True.	None	Crossroads GPS	None	None	None	2012-05-17T17:40:47	2012-05-16	['None']
pomt-04951	"In 2010, Mr. [Anthony] Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. Now, he claims to be pro-choice."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/27/naral-pro-choice/abortion-rights-group-says-democratic-congressiona/	On July 19, the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America announced that it was endorsing incumbent David Cicilline for reelection to Congress over his Democratic primary opponent, Anthony Gemma, who also ran for the seat in 2010. The group cited Cicilline's consistent support for abortion rights, accusing Gemma of "attempting a make-over" on the issue of whether abortion should continue to be legal. In a news release, NARAL President Nancy Keenan said the endorsement "is a matter of consistency versus conflicting statements" and that Gemma was calling himself a "pro-life Democrat" as recently as April 16, during a radio interview. "In 2010, Mr. Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate," Keenan said. "Now he claims to be pro-choice. My fear is that Mr. Gemma wants to hop on the pro-choice bandwagon as the anti-choice agenda unfolding in the House is becoming more and more unpopular." We thought readers might want to know whether Gemma really has done a major turnaround in two years. So we took a trip back in time (actually we checked our news archive), to when Gemma announced his original candidacy June 15, 2010. "How would you describe a Democrat who supports gay marriage, a Democrat who is pro-life, except in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother, a Democrat who opposes the death penalty, a Democrat who is pro-business when business is pro-Rhode Island, who is pro-labor when labor is pro-Rhode Island?" he said during a speech at Providence Place mall. He would repeat those views throughout the 2010 campaign. Fast forward to April 16, 2012. On WHJJ, Gemma told talk-radio host Helen Glover, "I'm a pro-life Democrat." But he also made it clear that he objected to Republican efforts to put limits on what women could choose for birth control and said that his personal pro-life beliefs would not affect how he voted on the issue. "I'm not in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade. I'm not even going near there," he said. "My beliefs will not affect where everyone's going here. Women have their own right to choose." And in a July 5 news release with the headline "Anthony Gemma Outlines Women’s Health Care Position/States He Will Defend a Woman’s Right to Choose," Gemma said the issue of family planning choices "is something I personally wrestle with everyday. "But I know I must put my personal religious beliefs aside, and defend a women's (sic) right to choose. The actions of Republicans in Congress and state legislatures are horrifying. I could never vote for an anti-choice bill. Women must be able to make this personal decision for themselves." The statement never used the word abortion but it seemed clear he was talking about abortion rights. Spokesman Alex Morash acknowledged that Gemma's position had evolved because the candidate has become "more understanding of other people's beliefs." When we inquired further for this story, Gemma e-mailed us a statement that said, in part: "My commitments to defend a woman’s right to choose and to preserve and strengthen Roe v. Wade are born of deep contemplation. To an appreciable degree my change was spurred by Republicans’ ongoing efforts -- supported by the likes of Brendan Doherty [the Republican running for the seat] -- to return America to a dark age when women were second-class citizens whose most intimate health choices were made by men." Finally, we asked NARAL Pro-Choice America about the organization's assessment of whether Gemma belonged in the "pro-choice" category, given his pledge and his personal feelings. Part of their response: "We remain skeptical of Anthony Gemma's sudden jump to support a woman's right to choose while labeling himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. His position contradicts how he frames his values." Our ruling NARAL Pro-Choice America said: "In 2010, [Anthony] Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. Now he claims to be pro-choice." It's clear that Gemma's position on abortion rights has changed. He went from saying that he supported a woman’s right to abortion only in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother, to saying he would defend a woman's right to choose when it comes to health care and family planning options, although his statement doesn't specifically mention abortion. He may be calling himself a "pro-life Democrat" in the same breath, but when the candidate says, "I vow to protect a woman's right to choose," he's trying to put himself in the "pro-choice" camp. NARAL says Gemma changed his position after his appearance on WHJJ. Clearly it predates that. But that's a side issue. When NARAL says Gemma has gone from being a "pro-life" candidate to calling himself a "pro-choice" one, we judge that statement to be True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-06515	"Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations."	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/11/eva-galambos/mayor-admits-error-beltline-connection-claim/	Ah, deadlines. For many, they bring panic. In one current case among metro Atlanta elected officials, a coming deadline has resulted in some attempted horse-trading and an interesting 11th-hour debate. County commissioners and mayors across the 10-county region are attempting to finalize a list by Oct. 15 of transportation projects that area residents will vote on next year, along with a 1 percent sales tax to fund those projects. One area they’re debating is a proposal to spend about $602 million on transit projects along the Atlanta Beltline. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed wrote an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution arguing for money for the effort, which is located in the city limits and he argues will benefit the region. Sandy Springs Mayor Eva Galambos countered in a separate op-ed in the AJC that the $602 million should be spent on other projects that will better serve the region. "These are worthy purposes for the city of Atlanta, but they are not related to relieving the Atlanta region’s traffic congestion," Galambos wrote, referring to the Beltline. "A close examination of the Beltline website map reveals an astounding fact: Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations." An astounding fact! Such a claim seemed ideal for PolitiFact Georgia. The Atlanta Beltline is a 22-mile loop of largely unused railroad tracks that circle around the core of Georgia’s capital city. Atlanta political and business leaders embraced a Georgia Tech graduate student’s suggestion to make better use of those lines and began an effort several years ago to build more homes, office space, parks and trails and construct a light-rail line along the Beltline. The effort is expected to take at least another decade before it is completed. Beltline spokesman Ethan Davidson sent us an e-mail contending that Galambos was wrong. "This is absolutely false ... the Atlanta Beltline corridor will have at least three additional connections to MARTA at the following areas: Lindbergh/Armour, Inman Park/Reynoldstown and West End/Oakland City," Davidson wrote. He also sent us a YouTube video by the Beltline that says the Beltline environmental impact study area intersects with six MARTA stations. The study area extends a quarter-mile east and west of the Beltline’s existing and former rail lines. We looked at the same Beltline map that Galambos referred to when we talked to her. We spotted two MARTA stations that seemed to connect to the Beltline: Inman Park/Reynoldstown and Lindbergh Center. Davidson explained that there are plans to connect the Beltline to the West End/Oakland City station. "[The Beltline] doesn’t work if it doesn’t connect to MARTA. … That’s the whole point of it," Davidson said. In response to what we found, and the Beltline’s argument, Galambos told us that the Lindbergh Center station did connect with the Beltline. Galambos admitted she erred in not saying the Beltline connects with the Lindbergh station. "That one is on the map," she said of Lindbergh. The mayor said her point about the Lindbergh MARTA station is that connecting it to the Beltline there won’t help more people across the region to get around. "In terms of service, I didn’t word it correctly," Galambos told us. "In terms of additional connectivity, we’re not getting any." Galambos admitted she made a mistake by writing that the Beltline doesn’t intersect MARTA at any of its stations. We thank her for her honesty. Still, her article went off the tracks on that point. We must give her a rating of False.	None	Eva Galambos	None	None	None	2011-10-11T06:00:00	2011-09-27	['Metropolitan_Atlanta_Rapid_Transit_Authority']

pomt-03939	"The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/20/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-says-obama-ignores-border-fence-law/	In a searing call to action that appeared in the conservative Daily Caller, the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre encouraged Americans to arm themselves, join the NRA and recruit others in preparation against the growing threats of terrorism, economic instability and the policies of the Obama administration. "It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people," LaPierre wrote. "During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing." He cited drug gangs and other criminals who enter the United States through the southern border. They get in, LaPierre said, because "the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border." Flagrant defiance? We decided to examine whether it’s true that President Barack Obama is bucking a law requiring construction of a such a fence. Secure Fence Act of 2006 We did not hear back from the NRA for this story. But the 2006 law directing fence construction is the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico. The act specified "at least two layers of reinforced fencing." One thing it did not do: require a fence to be built "along the entire Mexican border," as LaPierre claimed. Instead, it directed that specific segments of the border -- "extending from 10 miles west of the Tecate, California, port of entry to 10 miles east of the Tecate, California, port of entry," for example -- be double-fenced. The fenced segments totaled roughly 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is about 2,000 miles long. Obama, an Illinois senator at the time, voted for the law. The following year, the legislation underwent a significant change. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security argued that different border terrains required different types of fencing -- that a one-size-fits-all approach across the entire border didn't make sense. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, proposed an amendment to give DHS the discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read, "nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location." In other words, Border Patrol would use its discretion to decide which type of fencing was appropriate in various regions. The amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007. Hutchison said at the time, "Border patrol agents reported that coyotes and drug-runners were altering their routes as fencing was deployed, so the amendment gives our agents discretion to locate the fence where necessary to achieve operational control of our border." Opponents, however, said the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill. Today, DHS says Border Patrol has completed 651 miles of fencing, including 299 miles of vehicle fence and 352 miles of primary pedestrian fence. One mile of pedestrian fence is left to complete, and it is tied up in litigation. So what’s being flagrantly defied? That comes down to the difference between vehicle fence and pedestrian fence, as well as the "double layer" specification in the 2006 law. On the one hand, the fence is virtually complete and in compliance with the 2007 amendment. "It cost almost $3 million per mile to construct that fence. Including maintenance, it is supposed to cost over $6 billion over the next 20 years. President Obama is going above and beyond any president ever at enforcing our immigration laws," said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. On the other, it’s not the fence envisioned in 2006. For one thing, vehicle fencing would be more accurately described as posts placed close enough together that cars can’t be driven between them. What’s more, just 36.3 miles of fencing are double-layered. Said Rosemary Jenks with Numbers USA, a Washington group that favors low levels of immigration: "The Secure Fence Act called for 650 miles of double-layer pedestrian fencing. While the administration claims to have completed 650 miles of fencing, virtually none of it is double layer, and several hundred miles is vehicle barriers, instead of fence at all." Other resources, practical considerations While LaPierre was specific about fence construction, we thought we’d mention other aspects of border control. Rey Koslowski, in a 2011 paper for the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Southwest Border Security Act Obama signed in 2010 appropriated $600 million for enhanced border protection on top of the president’s July 2010 authorization to deploy 1,200 National Guard troops to the border. The largest share of the additional funding, $244 million, was to hire and maintain existing levels of Border Patrol agents and customs officers. Almost $200 million went to the Department of Justice to hire more federal law enforcement officers for the southwest border region, and still millions more went to communications and aerial surveillance equipment. In an interview, Koslowski pointed out that the 2006 law required that no more than 18 months after its enactment the government should have "operational control" of the border. How was that defined? "The prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States." "Well, guess what, they failed," Koslowski said. "Under this definition, no country, not even East Germany, managed operational control like this." So the fence -- pedestrian and vehicle -- is an adaptation to changing immigration patterns, from population centers where people used to walk in, out to deserts and mountains where they drive across. Added Gordon Hanson, an economist at University of California, San Diego: "It simply doesn’t make economic sense to build a fence along the entire border; in desert/mountain regions there are far more efficient ways to block entry than a fence in the middle of nowhere." Our ruling LaPierre wrote that "the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border." First, he misrepresented what the law required, which was segments of fencing in specific places, not a continuous fence along the 2,000 mile border. Second, he ignored the 2007 amendment which gave the government some discretion over how to build the fence. The fence that has been built -- just one mile short of what’s required -- is a combination of pedestrian fencing and vehicle barriers. To some critics that does not satisfy what Congress intended in 2006, and very little of it is double-layered. On that point, we think LaPierre’s statement contains a grain of truth. Otherwise, though, it’s clear that Obama is not flagrantly defying the law, especially as resources toward other aspects of border enforcement are increasing. We rate LaPierre’s statement Mostly False.	None	Wayne LaPierre	None	None	None	2013-02-20T16:31:12	2013-02-13	['Mexico']

pomt-01474	"94 percent of those that are employed by the Department of Education at the federal level were deemed by the department as nonessential employees."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/30/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-says-94-percent-education-department-em/	The U.S. Education Department is often a political football in debates about the role of the federal government. Look no further than the Iowa Senate debate on Sept. 28, 2014, between Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley. During the audience-participation part of the debate, a local college student named Jake asked Ernst this question: "You've said you'd like to eliminate the Department of Education. What implications does this have for students who receive Pell Grants and federal student loans?" Here’s Ernst’s response. "Thank you, Jake, that's a great question. It doesn't do anything to those that receive Pell Grants and student loans. Those are programs that are very necessary for our college students, but they can be easily housed in the Department of Treasury. Now when it comes to the Department of Education, 94 percent of those that are employed by the Department of Education at the federal level were deemed by the department as nonessential employees. So I would rather see the dollars that go to those nonessential employees be directed back to the states so they can be utilized by our administrators and our teachers in making sure that our Iowa students are receiving a great education." Is Ernst correct that 94 percent of employees at the Education Department have been "deemed by the department as nonessential"? Her campaign didn’t return an inquiry, but we took a closer look. First, some background. A government shutdown happens when one particular kind of federal funding stops flowing -- money that’s appropriated by Congress. Appropriations bills are supposed to be passed annually, though in recent years, acrimony between Congress and the president has made it happen more irregularly. This occurred most recently from Oct. 1, 2013, to Oct 16, 2013, when congressional Republicans refused to fund President Barack Obama’s health care law and Obama refused to sign spending bills unless they included funding for the law. There is a grain of truth to back up Ernst’s claim. During the 2013 shutdown, the Education Department furloughed 3,983 employees out of a workforce of 4,195. That’s 94.9 percent of all department employees. But the employees weren’t deemed "nonessential." While the term "nonessential employees" has been used in the media in the past to describe federal employees who are furloughed during a shutdown, the phrase was never officially used to describe employees. The word "nonessential," which has been used since a 1980 memo issued by the Office of Management and Budget, was applied to activities, not employees. The terms for employees themselves are "exempt/nonexempt" or "excepted/nonexcepted." More importantly, the way Ernst uses the term "nonessential" -- suggesting that the employees’ own department classifies them as make-work employees and that their salaries would be better shifted to state education budgets -- is misleading. What prevents an employee from being furloughed during a government shutdown is their performance of "emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property." (Some federal employees are able to continue working because their salaries were paid entirely by user fees or trust funds and, as a result, were not held up by a stalled spending bill.) Few of the Education Department’s employees save lives or guard property. The department’s budget is heavily weighted toward paying out and overseeing student loans and aid to schools in the states. It has the fewest employees of any cabinet-level department in the federal government. (The next smallest, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has twice as many employees.) Since so much of what the department does is to write checks, it’s not surprising that 94 percent of its staff would be furloughed; neither life nor property is at risk. If being "essential" was defined solely by saving lives or protecting property, most Americans' job duties would be categorized in the "nonessential" camp. Ernst is "being disingenuous at best and probably a lot worse than that," said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. John M. Palguta, vice president for policy with the Partnership for Public Service, agreed. "The law makes no reference to whether or not an employee’s work is important, meaningful, and/or valuable to the agency’s mission," he said. A final note: Remember when Ernst said, "I would rather see the dollars that go to those nonessential employees be directed back to the states so they can be utilized by our administrators and our teachers in making sure that our Iowa students are receiving a great education"? Well, the money saved from "nonessential" employees wouldn’t do much to help front-line schools. If the roughly 4,000 Education Department employees were magically transferred to state or local education jobs, they would increase the number of state and local education employees by a minuscule 4/100ths of 1 percent, according to our calculations of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Our ruling Ernst said, "94 percent of those that are employed by the Department of Education at the federal level were deemed by the department as nonessential employees." While it’s true that the Education Department did furlough 94 percent of its employees during the 2013 government shutdown, those employees were neither called "nonessential" in official documents nor were they "nonessential" in any casual definition of the word. The Education Department’s furlough rate was 94 percent because its employees were not saving lives or protecting property -- the standard for being exempt from furloughs. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02686	Under a proposed bill, a $100,000 home’s flood insurance premium would be "maybe $200 or $300 annually."	/florida/statements/2014/jan/07/gus-bilirakis/gus-bilirakis-says-his-flood-insurance-bill-would-/	While millions of indebted Florida homeowners are already trying to keep their heads above water, recently enacted flood insurance regulations are threatening to swamp the housing market with even more problems. With the end of subsidized flood coverage, Florida legislators have been looking for ways to keep their constituents from drowning in sky-high premiums. One such solution is a bill co-sponsored by Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, who recently discussed the measure with Bay News 9 anchor Al Ruechel. After listening to Bilirakis explain his bill, Ruechel asked the congressman what it might cost to cover a home worth $100,000. Bilirakis’ answer was eye-popping, according to a reader who brought it to our attention: "Well, we’re saying maybe, I’m approximating, but maybe $200 to $300 annually. Approximate. Because I’ve done these figures in the past." The reader told us he couldn’t believe his ears, and frankly, neither could we. Would a $100,000 home really only cost as little as $200 a year to cover under the Bilirakis bill? We dove into this claim with both feet. A deluge of problems First and foremost, the 12th District representative’s figure sounded so low that it led us to wonder if Bilirakis had simply misspoken. We asked his office if that was the case. They assured us he had, meaning to say "monthly" instead of "annually." So if you were watching and thought your flood insurance bill could end up being only a few hundred dollars a year, sorry to disappoint you, but his office did correct the statement. But let’s go through the math, anyway. Bilirakis was referring to his proposed H.R. 3312, the Homeowners Flood Insurance Relief Act of 2013, which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Oct. 23. The bipartisan bill is co-sponsored in part by Florida’s Thomas Rooney and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Republicans, and Democrat Kathy Castor. It’s a response to the Biggert Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, which Bilirakis supported. The law took effect on Oct. 1, 2013, and Bilirakis and other lawmakers have since been focusing on how to handle the law’s consequences. (Lawmakers said they didn’t realize such dramatic rate increases would happen.) Biggert-Waters ended subsidized premiums for the troubled National Flood Insurance Program, which is some $24 billion in debt, leading to astronomical increases for some homeowners. Homes with severe or repetitive losses, along with second homes and businesses, face rates that are allowed to rise 25 percent per year until they mirror their true risk of flooding. That applies to some 50,000 policyholders in Florida. Other homeowners in flood-prone areas will be grandfathered in at current rates unless they sell their homes or let their policies lapse. About 115,000 subsidized condos or multifamily homes won’t be affected, nor will about 1.8 million Florida policies currently not being subsidized. Some horror stories about changes in premiums involve homes being hit with insurance bills quintupling or worse, climbing well into five figures for a year of coverage. Many neighborhoods in flood-prone areas are already reporting dismal sales figures, with sellers frightened off by sky-high insurance quotes. The problem is especially troublesome for Florida, which Gov. Rick Scott claimed has paid out four times what it has received in flood claims over the last 35 years. We found that Mostly True. H.R. 3312 isn’t the only attempt to deal with this problem. The Senate has been struggling with its own measures, and Florida legislators are proposing a competing market set up by private insurers. The Bilirakis bill does a couple things: First, it caps the maximum flood insurance premium levied on a structure at 1/30th of the property’s appraised value at the time of sale. This is based on the concept of a 30-year mortgage and is meant to establish a baseline of coverage. Second, it would spread any increase over current premiums across a 10-year phase-in period, during which time the premium would get incrementally higher until it reached the maximum. FEMA, which evaluates the amount of risk faced by each property, would have the flexibility to determine that rate of increase. The bill would allow homeowners to pay for flood coverage in monthly installments, instead of an annual lump sum payment. So, using the example of a $100,000 home, the annual premium would be limited to 1/30th of $100,000, or $3,333.33 per year (we’ll round down, but actuaries probably won’t be as generous). Spread out over 12 months, that would be a monthly payment of $277.77. A $250,000 home would have a maximum premium of $8,333.33, with a $694.44 monthly payment, and so on. Only in Florida would an insurance bill that high be considered reasonable, but it still provides a cap to the exorbitant rates possible under Biggert-Waters. It’s also quite a bit higher than a couple of hundred dollars a year. Our ruling Bilirakis told Bay News 9 his bill would limit a $100,000 home’s flood insurance bill to "$200 to $300 annually." That didn’t add up to us, and when we asked his office about it, they told us he meant to say "monthly", not "annually." We do appreciate it when elected leaders admit they’re wrong. Unfortunately for homeowners paying for flood insurance, Bilirakis used the wrong word in the interview, and we have to rate the wording of this particular statement False.

pomt-00457	Says the Trump administration "has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender.’ "	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/17/tammy-baldwin/sen-tammy-baldwins-claim-about-trump-administratio/	Transgender rights have become an issue in many aspects of American society, from Hollywood actors seeking recognition and roles, to the state of Vermont, where Democrat Christine Hallquist is vying to become the nation's first transgender governor. In Wisconsin, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person to the serve in the Senate, has been a champion of LGBTQ rights. At a June 2018 Human Rights Campaign event, Baldwin gave a speech in which she praised volunteers on the front lines of the "fight for equality" and also aimed a couple barbs at the Donald Trump administration. The administration "has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender,’ " Baldwin told the crowd, which booed in response. What’s more, she continued: "President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country." For this fact check we will look at the first claim on the CDC word ban. (We checked the second claim, on transgender people and the military, separately. You can find it here). The background On December 15, 2017, The Washington Post published a story headlined "Words banned at multiple HHS agencies include ‘diversity and ‘vulnerable.’ " HHS is the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is a federal agency under the HHS and is headquartered in Atlanta. The agency in question is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (You may remember that in the wake of the story, the Human Rights Campaign and artist Robin Bell projected some of the words onto to the side of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.) When asked to provide backup for Baldwin’s statement, campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to that Washington Post report. "The Trump administration is prohibiting officials at the nation's top public health agency from using a list of seven words or phrases — including ‘fetus’ and ‘transgender’ — in official documents being prepared for next year's budget," the news report said. A day later, The New York Times reported on the "uproar" over the purported word ban: The Department of Health and Human Services tried to play down on Saturday a report that officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been barred from using seven words or phrases, including "science-based," "fetus," "transgender" and "vulnerable," in agency budget documents. "The assertion that H.H.S. has ‘banned words’ is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process," an agency spokesman, Matt Lloyd, told The New York Times. The Times story noted officials said the proposal was not a ban on words. Rather it was a recommendation to avoid some language to ease the path toward budget approval by Republicans in Congress. In a Jan. 9, 2018, report in The Hill, CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald said the agency "has not banned, prohibited, or forbidden" the use of certain words in official documentation. The statement came in response to concerns from Senate Democrats. Later that month, CNN published a follow-up report, which said news reports about the "banned" words may have been overstated and cited a document, along with interviews with officials from the Department of Health and Human Services. They describe not a ban or prohibition on words but rather suggestions on how to improve the chances of getting funding."Words to avoid: vulnerable, diversity, entitlement." The other four words on the list — "transgender," "fetus," "evidence-based" and "science-based" — were brought up by employees at the meeting who wanted to know if they could be used, according to the two HHS officials, who were familiar with what transpired at the meeting. "Nobody ever told them they couldn't use these seven words. It was just said, 'if you think these words would cause someone to jump to a conclusion, then use a substitute. But if there isn't a good substitute, then go ahead and use the word,' " said one of the officials. Likewise, CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, refuted the idea of a ban. "CDC has not banned, prohibited, or forbidden employees from using any words," Harben said. "CDC uses the best scientific evidence available and strongly encourages evidence-based programs." Our rating Baldwin told a human rights group that the Trump administration "has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender.’ " The statement was based on a Washington Post report. But that story was later countered by several other published reports that indicated the words were not banned. Rather, it was suggested that other words be used in some cases — in part to temper controversy during the budget process. And despite The Washington Post headline, the first paragraph of the story does not mention the word "banned" instead saying "they should avoid using certain words or phrases in official documents being drafted for next year's budget."

pomt-01251	"It is senior citizens, not Hispanics, who are the fastest-growing demographic in this country."	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/13/brit-hume/hume-senior-vote-growing-faster-hispanic/	Conventional wisdom is that the changing landscape of the American electorate -- i.e. the influx of Hispanic voters -- is good news for Democrats. But Fox News analyst Brit Hume turned the idea on its head during his post-election analysis. The fastest-growing segment of the country is old people, Hume said. And that’s good news for the Grand Old Party. "It is senior citizens, not Hispanics, who are the fastest-growing demographic in this country," Hume said. "Hispanics are clearly the fastest-growing ethnic group in the country, but their size as a group is dwarfed by the 65 and older demographic which has been trending Republican," Hume continued. "If the GOP continues to make gains, it may more than offset any advantage Democrats have with the ethnic groups." The simple question here is: Are senior citizens, and not Hispanics, the fastest-growing demographic in the United States? (Hume did not respond to our requests for more information.) Looking at the past Every two years, the U.S. Census Bureau produces a report that breaks down eligible voters by race, ethnicity and age. Of particular significance for tracking the Hispanic vote, it culls out noncitizens. This table, based on the Census Bureau data, shows that in no decade did the senior group grow at a faster rate than Hispanics. (All numbers are shown in thousands) Group 1980 1990 Growth 1980-90 2000 Growth 1990-00 2010 Growth 2000-10 Hispanic 18+ 5,565 8,566 +53.9% 13,158 +53.6% 21,285 +61.8% 65+ 23,514 29,192 +24.1% 31,815 +9.0% 37,745 +18.6% It’s the same case for the raw number of eligible voters, except for the 1980-90 period. So in present terms, Hume’s case appears weak. Looking ahead As a general rule, we at PunditFact don’t assess predictions, but we can compare Hume’s sense of the future to what the Census Bureau tells us to expect. Here, Hume finds a bit more support. There is one decade, between 2020 and 2030, when the senior population is estimated to grow by 30 percent while the Hispanic group would increase by 26 percent. (Note: These estimates look only at population, not voter turnout. The Census does not project voter turnout. Again, the numbers shown here are in thousands.) Group 2010 2020 Growth 2010-20 2030 Growth 2020-30 2040 Growth 2030-40 Hispanic 18+ 21,285 43,407 103.9% 54,827 26.3% 67,309 22.8% 65+ 37,745 55,969 48.3% 72,774 30.0% 79,719 9.5% The same pattern holds true when we look at the absolute change in population. Group 2010 2020 Growth 2010-20 2030 Growth 2020-30 2040 Growth 2030-40 Hispanic 18+ 21,285 43,407 22,122 54,827 11,420 67,309 12,482 65+ 37,745 55,969 18,224 72,774 16,805 79,719 6,945 A few important caveats In Hume’s framework, voters are either seniors or Hispanic, but of course, some will be both. By focusing on seniors, Hume seems to assume that age, rather than ethnicity, does more to shape a person’s vote. That might or might not be true, and it’s actually the diciest part of any comparison. Also, there is no question that seniors actually get to the polls much more reliably than Hispanics. In the 2010 elections, about 61 percent of seniors voted. The Hispanic rate was half that, just 31 percent. Now couple that with the higher number of seniors, 37.7 million in 2010 compared to 21.2 million Hispanic voters, and you can see where Hume has a point completely apart from how fast each group is growing. If Republicans get 57 percent of the seniors who vote, and Democrats get 70 percent of the Hispanics who vote, the Republicans come out ahead 13.1 million seniors to 4.6 million Hispanics. We could get into more complex calculations involving presidential races, the electoral college, and the concentration of Hispanics in certain states, but we’ll leave that for fivethirtyeight.com. Our ruling Hume said seniors, not Hispanics, are the fastest-growing demographic. The Census Bureau numbers tell us that’s not accurate right now. Historically, the Hispanic population has grown faster than the senior population. The Hispanic group will continue to grow faster until about 2020, according to Census Bureau projections. In the decade after that, the senior group is projected to grow at a faster rate, but then after 2030, the growth rate for Hispanics is higher once again. Hume’s electoral analysis (based on seniors showing up to vote) was more on target than the trend he cited as evidence, but we only deal with his factual statement, which aligns with Census numbers in one decade out of five. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Brit Hume	None	None	None	2014-11-13T16:47:47	2014-11-10	['None']
pomt-06312	"The governor won this state with 49 percent. We had some of the closest races in the House in history. So you’re not dealing with this 70-30, like they want to make it."	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/14/robert-hagan/state-rep-robert-hagan-says-ohio-isnt-70-30-republ/	Because of slow population growth, Ohio is losing two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. And because of their statewide sweep last fall, Republicans controlled the process of drawing a new congressional map, which features 12 solidly GOP districts and four that favor Democrats. Needless to say, the Democrats aren’t fond of their counterparts’ work. They have resisted any deal that doesn’t improve their chances to win more seats and have threatened to take the map to a referendum. After two months of debate, cooler heads have yet to prevail. Capping a particularly rancorous session on Nov. 3, State Rep. Robert Hagan stood angrily to complain that redistricting was distracting from more urgent problems. "Quite frankly," the Youngstown Democrat said, "I’m left wondering what the hell we are doing down here." Colorful remarks, indeed. But PolitiFact Ohio was more interested in what Hagan said after the session. In an interview with Marc Kovac, a Statehouse bureau chief for several newspapers, Hagan stressed his preference for a map that better fits the state’s political pedigree. "The governor won this state with 49 percent," Hagan said of Republican John Kasich’s 2010 victory over Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. "We had some of the closest races in the House in history. So you’re not dealing with this 70/30, like they want to make it." Hagan’s argument, and those similarly made by his fellow Democrats, is that new lines should reflect their belief that Ohio is split about 50/50 between the two parties. A map that favors the GOP in 12 of 16 districts could give Republicans 75 percent of Ohio’s congressional seats. We decided to take a closer look at the examples Hagan cites as justification for equality. First, Kasich’s margin of victory has been well-documented. But to cover all bases, we confirmed with the Ohio secretary of state’s office that Kasich received 49 percent of the vote to Strickland’s 47 percent. The remaining four percent went to third-party or write-in candidates. By mentioning this race, Hagan implied that Ohio is evenly divided. We found Republicans won by five points or more in all but one of the five other statewide contests last year. The exception: Mike DeWine’s 1.28-point victory over incumbent Democratic Attorney General Richard Cordray. Examining the second part of Hagan’s claim involved more scouring of past election results. In 2010, according to the secretary of state’s website, six Ohio House races featured margins of two points or fewer. All six of these races were decided by fewer than 1,000 votes. The closest was in the 99th District -- Ashtabula County and a slice of Trumbull County -- where Republican Casey Kozlowski beat Democratic Rep. Deborah Newcomb by 137 votes. Another squeaker came in the Franklin County-encompassing 21st District, where the GOP’s Mike Duffey beat Democrat David Robinson by 377 votes. In Hamilton County, Democratic Rep. Connie Pillich kept her 28th District seat by finishing 602 votes ahead of Republican Mike Wilson. Hagan confirmed to PolitiFact Ohio that those three were the races he was thinking about when speaking to Kovac. But was 2010 really an anomaly in terms of razor-thin margins of victory? Our review of Ohio House races dating to 2002 found no contest quite as close as the Kozlowski-Newcomb match. Another six races in 2008 and seven in 2006 were decided by two percentage points or fewer. Three candidates in 2004 won by fewer than 500 votes. For the sake of context, it’s important to note that the Ohio House has 99 seats, so the half-dozen or so nail-biters are exceptions. Many House elections are blowouts, and some candidates don’t even draw an opponent. It’s also important to point out that in the six tight races in 2010, Democrats and Republicans split the seats, with three going to each party. The makeup of the House today is 59 Republicans, 40 Democrats. That’s more like 60/40 than 50/50. If Democrats had won all six of the close races, the makeup would be 56-43. Unfortunately, there is no perfect accounting for party affiliation in Ohio. Voters here do not specify party when registering -- only when voting in a primary. But that’s an unreliable measure of true political identity. Republicans are known to cross over into Democratic primaries and vice versa, particularly during hotly contested battles for a party’s presidential nomination. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted’s turnout numbers anyway. Of those who voted in the 2010 primaries, 48 percent cast Republican ballots, while 42 percent cast Democratic ballots. So even by this measure, there is no evidence of a 50/50 split. Our best guess is that the 50/50 talk is part anecdotal, part wishful thinking. Ohio is known as a swing state with fickle tastes. In a four-year stretch, voters here elected to the U.S. Senate a known liberal in Sherrod Brown and a known conservative in Rob Portman. The state went for Democrat Bill Clinton twice in the 1990s, twice for Republican George W. Bush in the aughts, then for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008. But since 1991, Republicans have occupied the governor’s chair with the exception of the four years that Strickland served. Then again, as Hagan correctly noted, Ohio isn’t a 70/30 state, either. His arguments -- and those from his Democratic colleagues -- would benefit from more context, though. For one, there’s no bulletproof way of suggesting the state is 50/50 -- a claim Hagan did not make explicitly in his comments to Kovac. Hagan instead implicitly pointed to results of two elections as proof of Ohio’s political parity: Kasich’s narrow gubernatorial victory and a batch of close Ohio House races. Regarding the latter, Hagan remarked on "some of the closest races in the House in history." It is clear that several of those battles match that description. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Robert Hagan	None	None	None	2011-11-14T18:00:00	2011-11-03	['None']
pomt-13295	"We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-claims-us-has-biggest-increase-murders-45-ye/	Donald Trump returned to a topic he’s been citing often in recent months -- rising crime. "We have a very divided nation," he said. "You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities. Chicago. You take a look at Washington, D.C. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years." Trump is largely on target that "we have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years." His staff didn’t respond to an inquiry, but Trump seems to be referring to a set of annual statistics released by the FBI. The most recent report came out in September. Those statistics showed that the number of murders and non-negligent homicides rose nationally between 2014 and 2015 by 10.8 percent. When we checked the numbers, we confirmed that this increase does rank as the biggest year-to-year jump in murders since 1970-71, when the number rose by 11.1 percent. That was exactly 45 years ago. In fact, Trump’s debate comment was stated more accurately than what one of his key surrogates -- former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- said earlier in the day on Meet the Press. Giuliani stated that "last year, crime went up more than in the last 41 years." Not only did Giuliani get the number of years wrong, but he also referred to "crime" generally, not to murders specifically. And that makes a difference. Violent crime did go up between 2014 and 2015, but by a significantly smaller percentage than murders did -- 3.9 percent. That rate of increase was smaller than several year-to-year increases since 1971, most recently an increase between 1989 and 1990 of 10.6 percent. In addition, between 2014 and 2015, property crime actually dropped by 2.6 percent. So Trump has a fair point. Still, we’ll note two caveats. First, his terminology was imperfect. The 10.8 percent increase represents an overall national figure -- not the figure for murders "within our cities," as Trump phrased it. That said, murder rates within cities tend to be higher than for the country at large, as this chart shows. (The red line is the rate for cities over 250,000 population, while the blue line is the rate for the country as a whole.) So this flaw in Trump’s phrasing doesn’t strike us as especially problematic. A bigger problem for Trump is that he leaves out some important context -- that, as we have noted previously, crime rates were heading downward for a quarter-century before the most recent uptick, and that the recent increase is nowhere near big enough to erase those gains. Sticking to murder statistics for the moment, the following chart shows a zig-zagging rise in murders between 1970 and the early 1990s, followed by a fairly steady decline since then. To be precise, the number of murders declined by 42 percent between 1993 and 2014, even as the U.S. population rose by 25 percent over the same period. The same 25-year decline also shows up in the statistics for violent crimes more generally … … and for property crimes, too. After the newest FBI statistics came out, we asked several criminologists how much concern they place in the recent murder spike. They said it was definitely worth noting -- but that it also needs to be understood within a broader context. "Violent crime rates are up compared with historic lows, and they are still very, very low compared with just five or 10 years ago," said Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, agreed. "A small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20 year trend is downward," he said. "If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase." And James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist said that while "crime rose, it is far from certain that it will continue. Such a large jump in homicide, the most volatile of crime figures, can easily be followed by a turn in the other direction. One year does not make a trend." For a past example, look no further than an October 2006 report by the Police Executive Research Forum that cited an upward spike around 2005 that’s visible in our graphs above. The group warned of "a gathering storm of violent crime that threatens to erode the considerable crime reductions of the past." But starting in 2006, crime began falling again, and it stayed that way for most of the next decade. As Jeffrey Butts of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice recently told the Guardian, "You lost 50 pounds. You gained back a couple. You’re not fat. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t look at your behavior, because the trend is not good." Our ruling Trump said, "We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years." The number of murders nationally did rise by the biggest amount in 45 years, and criminologists agree that this is a development worth paying attention to. But they add that it comes after a steep, quarter-century decline, which suggests that it is not yet a cause for panic. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dbd0f6e6-df11-462a-bf5c-ac53c13c462f	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-10T01:14:09	2016-10-09	['None']
pomt-07470	"43,000 people are going to be kicked out of nursing homes or denied nursing home entrance" if the Texas House version of the state budget passes into law.	/texas/statements/2011/apr/16/joaquin-castro/joaquin-castro-says-if-house-approved-budget-becom/	State Rep. Joaquin Castro says spending cuts in the Texas House version of the state’s 2012-13 budget will cause vulnerable Texans to suffer. For instance, the San Antonio Democrat said in House debate April 4, "43,000 people are going to be kicked out of nursing homes or denied nursing home entrance." The House-passed budget, yet to be answered by the Senate, would reduce by about 10 percent reimbursement rates paid to nursing homes for residents covered by Medicaid, the state- and federally-funded health program for the poor and disabled. Nursing home advocates say actual daily rates would effectively drop 34 percent — from $123 to $81 per resident — because the House-adopted budget also doesn’t account for projected increases in health care costs or in Medicaid-supported nursing home residents. Nor does it replace federal stimulus aid that ends this year. Some perspective: Of about 90,000 nursing home residents statewide, 54,800 — 62 percent — are covered by Medicaid. Starting in 1999, Medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes have increased seven times, most recently going up 2.7 percent in 2009. Rates have been cut thrice, most recently 2 percent as of February. The state’s reimbursement rate is 49th nationally, according to an April 9 Austin American-Statesman news article. Also, Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us that "there’s widespread agreement that our rates don’t fully cover costs." When we sought backup for Castro’s statement, his office said he got his numbers from the Texas Health Care Association, which represents the state’s nursing home industry. The group’s president, Tim Graves, told us that it analyzed the most recent data, covering 2008, to try to estimate "the scope of the potential impact" of the proposed cuts. Graves said at least 70 percent of the residents at about half the state’s nursing homes, or 550 facilities, are insured through Medicaid — figures we confirmed with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The association estimates that the average number of residents at these facilities is 83, suggesting that 45,650 residents live in heavily Medicaid-dependent homes that would bear the brunt of the House’s rate cut. And how many nursing home residents would be kicked out or denied care? That number proved elusive. A Feb. 16 association press release says the reduction "will force local facilities to significantly cut staffing levels, cut pay — or worse — go out of business, leaving local seniors and local workers to make do with no care and no jobs." Graves told us: "There’s no way I can predict the future, but I can tell you they’ll be in really bad shape. ... Our point is any facility that depends on Medicaid to that extent is going to be in very significant trouble, and that could affect a lot of folks." Graves said the association hasn’t asked every home if it would close upon the proposed rate cut, but conversations with nursing-home operators have persuaded him that widespread closures with residents getting displaced is a valid concern. At his suggestion, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. President George Linial told us it now costs homes $140 to $150 a day to serve residents. Separately, the state health commission told us the average daily cost for nursing-home care in 2008 was $129 per resident and the state projects that average for 2012-13 to be $133. Linial shared an association document titled "Nursing Home Profile for Texas" stating that if the House-approved rates become law, 896 of the state’s nursing homes will close and 63,616 residents will lose their care. Linial, calling the group’s forecast "an estimate... a guess," also said: "It is tough to determine who will close because most nursing homes do not want to alarm their residents by saying they will close ... However, simply looking at their financial statements will tell you that closure is imminent with further cuts." How did the group reach its numbers? Association vice president David Thomason said he determined from cost data collected by the state health commission that an average of 71 residents lived in the state’s nursing homes in 2008 and that Medicaid-covered residents accounted for 65 percent or more of the occupants of 896 homes. Assuming those homes would close if the House-backed budget becomes law, Thomason said, 63,616 residents would be kicked out of the shuttered homes. According to the health commission, 676 nursing homes in 2009 had 65 percent or more of their residents covered by Medicaid. Informed of this tally, Thomason replied by email that he’d "rounded up" in his analysis and the group "will be happy to agree that at least 676 facilities will close at the current House version of the bill," with 47,996 residents kicked out. We pressed Thomason on his assumption that this particular cut would force the homes to close, though their reimbursement rates had mostly risen over the past decade. Reminding us of the homes greatly depending on Medicaid, Thomason said: "There’s no other way around it, you’re going to close." Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that Castro accurately pinned the number of nursing home residents whose "access to care is at risk." Yet whether all those residents "would lose coverage at once, that may be pushing it," she said. Finally, spokeswomen for HHSC and the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, which administers long-term services, said their agencies have not assessed the impact of rate cuts on Medicaid-covered residents. Goodman said: "We don’t doubt that deep cuts in Medicaid rates would mean that some nursing homes would close." All in all, Castro’s claim that the House-approved budget would effectively deny 43,000 people nursing home care was not confirmed by the group he cites as his source. Though a different group estimates a larger number, that’s acknowledged as an educated guess. At this point, all such predictions are speculative. We rate the statement Barely True.

pomt-07098	After not having any foreign trade offices overseas for the past decade, New Jersey opened offices in Shanghai and London in the past six months, and has seen an 18 percent increase in exports.	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/23/kim-guadagno/lt-gov-kim-guadagno-says-foreign-trade-offices-sha/	If you heard Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno on the Brian Lehrer Show on May 11, you'd think New Jersey didn’t have any foreign trade offices for at least a decade until the administration of Gov. Chris Christie set up outposts in Shanghai and London, which led to a big surge in exports. In the middle of her statewide tour to highlight New Jersey’s commitment to economic growth, Guadagno did a radio interview on the WNYC program. After discussing the state’s effort to attract jobs from the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, the conversation turned to where Guadagno said the "real game" is -- overseas. Here’s how Guadagno summed up New Jersey’s international outreach: "It's no longer just a regional market. It's attracting business from overseas. And New Jersey, for the past decade, hasn't had any offices overseas. Compare that to Pennsylvania (that) has 23. Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent." Fred Snowflack, a spokesman for Guadagno, said the offices in Shanghai and London opened last year through a joint effort between the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Two people are stationed in Shanghai and one person is in London, Snowflack said. According to a September 2010 press release announcing the deal, the duties of the foreign trade representatives include helping to advance export sales of New Jersey companies and arranging visits for potential investors. The London office covers the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. PolitiFact New Jersey also confirmed that Pennsylvania has 23 foreign trade offices covering 67 countries. So she is right on that point. But she's wrong on two other key points: that the state lacked foreign trade offices for the past decade and that the two new ones led to the 18 percent increase in exports. Actually, a total of 10 full- and part-time overseas offices were in operation during the past decade. New Jersey had full-time offices in Tokyo from 1988-2006; London, 1994-2004; Ra’anana, Israel, 1995-2007; Mexico City, 1999-2006; Cairo, 2000-2004; and Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2000-2007. The state had part-time offices in South Korea from 1999-2004; Greece, 2000-2004; China, 2001-2004; and Argentina, 2001-2002. Snowflack told us those offices closed for financial reasons. Asked about the discrepancy between Guadagno’s radio interview and the information on previous offices, Snowflack wrote in an email: "As for the other question, the lieutenant governor has said on many other occasions, including her budget testimony of last year, that the offices were closed during the Corzine Administration. I submit that the important point here is that the state has reopened overseas offices, not the exact year in which some of the old ones closed." Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce back up the 18 percent increase in exports. Those exports included chemicals, computers and electronic products, and transportation equipment. But that's a figure for exports throughout the world and an economics professor expressed doubt that the new offices deserve much credit. "I wish economics were that easy," Rutgers University professor Thomas Prusa said. Snowflack told us Guadagno was not linking the export increases to the new offices. "She was not saying that the two new offices were directly responsible for the increase in exports," Snowflack wrote in an email. "Her point was that New Jersey is trying to rekindle business relationships overseas, as evidenced by an increase in exports and two new offices. But she never said two offices that opened within the last year prompted an 18 percent increase in exports." That may have been what she meant, but listeners who heard her would clearly be under the impression there was a link. She said, "Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent." Her wording suggests a clear linkage. Let’s review: Guadagno said New Jersey has opened foreign trade offices in Shanghai and London, marking the first in at least a decade. She’s right about those two offices, but she’s wrong to say such international efforts haven’t been done before. In fact, New Jersey had 10 offices at various times during the past decade. And there's little, if any, evidence that the offices led to the 18 percent increase. We find her statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12958	"General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/04/donald-trump/mostly-true-trump-tweet-about-gm-chevy-cruze-manuf/	President-elect Donald Trump put General Motors on notice for tariff-free imports of vehicles from Mexico, warning of heavy taxes if vehicles are not instead manufactured in the United States. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border," Trump tweeted Jan. 3. "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Imposing hefty tariffs on foreign goods was a staple of Trump’s pro-manufacturing agenda. He suggested on day one of his campaign that if Ford chose to open a factory in Mexico and then tried to sell those vehicles in the United States, he would tell Ford’s CEO that "we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax." In the same speech, he bemoaned Chevy’s slight presence in foreign countries, particularly in Japan. We wanted to look at Trump’s most recent beef with Chevy. The key to our review is that the president-elect singled out the Mexican-made model of the Chevy Cruze. The Cruze made in Mexico is a hatchback that does not sell widely in the United States. Chevy Cruze sedans are more popular in the United States — and they are produced in Ohio. Trump has a point, however, that the Mexican Cruze has made its way to the United States free of taxes, based on provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement. General Motors: We make Cruzes in Ohio, too General Motors, whose portfolio includes Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC, said in a brief statement that all Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in the company’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. In 2016, it sold 185,500 of this body type in the United States. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com But the company "builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.," the statement said. Production of the hatchback model began in mid 2016, said Patrick Morrissey, a General Motors spokesperson, in an email. Out of 29,000 hatchbacks made in Mexico in 2016 for global markets, 4,500 were sold in the United States, Morrissey said. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com (Chevy Cruze photos courtesy of General Motors) Free trade provisions under international agreement The North American Free Trade Agreement, effective since January 1994, lifted trade tariffs and restrictions among Canada, the United States and Mexico. NAFTA has been praised for expanding and facilitating trade among the three countries, but Trump and labor unions from the United States have criticized the deal for outsourcing jobs and lowering wages. Trump called it the "worst trade deal ever," blaming it for the loss of manufacturing jobs. But nonpartisan research said NAFTA has had a more subtle effect on the U.S. economy. "NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters," a 2015 Congressional Research Service report said. "The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP." NAFTA allows the tariffs-free import of autos, light trucks, engines and transmissions from Mexico as long as 62.5 percent of their value is from North America, the 2015 report said. The "rules of origin" requirement for other vehicles and automotive parts is 60 percent, according to the report. The Chevy Cruze hatchback would be covered under NAFTA’s duty-free provision, experts told PolitiFact. NAFTA allowed each participating country to specialize in different stages of production, said Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. Parts can go back and forth in the production of a vehicle, so a car that’s imported from Mexico can actually include components from companies in the United States, Freund said. As for the logistics of Trump’s plan to impose high tariffs, trade experts introduced a number of concerns about it for our June analysis. They cited potential rising production costs and an increased cost burden on consumers, as well as a possible trade war and broken international agreements. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border." That’s accurate for 4,500 Chevy Cruze hatchbacks made in Mexico and sold in the United States in 2016. That was about 15 percent of all Cruze hatchbacks produced in Mexico last year for global markets. NAFTA provisions allow the tax-free imports of autos from Mexico. It’s worth pointing out extra context that Chevy Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The sedan is more than 40 times as popular among American buyers as the hatchback. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

Donald Trump President-elect in a tweet Tuesday, January 3, 2017 -01/-03/2017 Read More info After the Fact After publishing this check, readers reached out telling us some Chevy Cruze sedans have also been imported from Mexico to sell in the United States. We asked General Motors about it, since their statement in response to Trump's tweet said all Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in General Motors' assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. In a follow-up email, a General Motors spokesperson said, "In the fourth quarter of 2016 we built some sedans in Mexico (and shipped to the U.S) to help support the launch of the Lordstown plant with the new Cruze (that was announced and reported on last summer) – about 8,000 total. So some of those are still in inventory in the U.S., but the only Chevrolet Cruze models being built in Mexico now for the U.S. market are the hatchbacks." The approximate 8,000 sedans were sold to dealers in 2016 "and most were probably sold to consumers," General Motors spokesperson Patrick Morrissey said.

pomt-09302	''I have received more contributions than any other candidate in the race – Republican or Democrat.''	/florida/statements/2010/apr/21/dan-gelber/state-sen-dan-gelber-boasts-hes-raised-more-other-/	State Sen. Dan Gelber says he has received more contributions than any other candidate in the race to become Florida's next attorney general. ''We received over $325,000 in contributions – and we did this during a shortened fundraising quarter of two months,” he wrote. ''I have received more contributions than any other candidate in the race – Republican or Democrat. Since announcing last year, our contributions total just under $1 million.'' We wondered if this was accurate, so we checked in with the Gelber campaign where aide Christian Ulvert told us the actual number was $321,000. We went to the Division of Elections website to see how that stacked up with the other candidates. We confirmed the $321,000, but noted that he included in-kind donations. Those would include restaurants comping Gelber for campaign events and the Democratic party sending staffers to assist from elsewhere but not charging for the hours. So we ran our own numbers using the same yardstick for first-quarter figures and found that state Sen. Dave Aronberg, another Democrat in the race, raised more -- $328,543 to Gelber’s $321,426. None of the Republican candidates broke $100,000. (Holly Benson raised $97,566.48; Pam Bondi raised $44,337 and Jeff Kottkamp, $27,230.) We also decided to check the total for the entire campaign, which goes back to June 2009. There again, Aronberg edged out Gelber, $999,609.87 to Gelber’s $991,922.35. Ulvert, Gelber's aide, then tried to move the goalposts by suggesting his boss' claim was true because ''we have the greatest number of contributors to our campaign. Our total contributors are 3,487.'' This, in fact, is true. The state database counted 91 more individual contributors to Aronberg’s 3,396 with none on the GOP side breaking the 2,000 mark. We don't accept that interpretation. When someone says contributions, we believe it's universally interpreted as the dollar amount. Said Aronberg campaign spokeswoman Allison North Jones: ''He is leading the public to believe -- and his supporters and his donors and everyone else -- that he had raised significantly more than his opponents.'' For his part, Gelber conceded in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida that he did not outraise his opponent in the race. Rather, he said, ''We were innocently and unknowingly comparing apples to oranges,'' because Aronberg had published his fundraising totals first, minus in-kind donations. The Gelber campaign believed Aronberg's figures included in-kind contributions. ''Of course the difference turned out to be very, very minor ($8,000 in a million dollar race),'' wrote Gelber. ''Although I did not know or try to say when I wrote the e-mail that we had a greater number of contributors than Dave (which is pretty important as it shows actual level of support) -- I assumed we did and that did turn out to be totally true and accurate.'' The e-mail didn't focus on number of donors. It was about dollars. So we find the claim to be False.

pomt-14184	"A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia."	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/25/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-jim-kenneys-sod/	Jim Kenney’s proposed soda tax went national last week. Hillary Clinton led off what became a back-and-forth political battle by voicing her support for the tax at a forum in Philadelphia. Bernie Sanders chimed in later to call the tax regressive. Kenney fired back in an editorial on Huffington Post that his proposal, which would levy a three cent per ounce tax on distributors, was a "corporate tax" and said Sanders was siding with beverage corporations. Then Sanders responded with an editorial of his own, in Philly Mag. He basically gave an elongated version of what he said earlier in the week, which was, "A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia." Is Sanders correct? Or was this political grandstanding? Berkeley, Calif., remains the lone American city to enact a sugary drink tax. It taxes the distributors of sodas and similar beverages like sports drinks 1 cent per ounce. Studies have shown some of the cost of tax has been passed on to consumers. A Cornell study found about 25 percent of it was passed on, and a University of California-Berkeley study found the amount to be between about 50 to 70 percent, depending on the type of beverage. The prices of soft drinks were more likely to go up at supermarkets than chain drug stores. Carl Davis, the research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told Billy Penn last month soda taxes like the one proposed by Philadelphia are "imperfect:" "The first thing you realize is that it is regressive. It’s going to hit lower and more moderate income families more heavily than higher-income families." William Shughart, a Utah State University professor and sin tax expert, explained taxes like the one proposed by Kenney disproportionately affect lower income residents because a greater amount of their income is used on food and drinks. Warren Gunnels, senior policy advisor for Sanders, said in an email, "It would make much more sense to finance universal pre-school in Philadelphia by raising taxes on its wealthiest residents, who currently benefit from flat state and city tax rates. Right now wealthy Philadelphians pay state income tax of 3.07 percent, an unemployment tax of 0.07 percent, and a city income tax of 3.92 percent. That’s a total state and local tax burden of 7.06 percent. By contrast, New York City’s wealthiest residents pay a top rate of 12.6 percent." Such a plan would be easier said than done, according to Kenney’s administration. "Because of the uniformity clause, it’s constitutionally impermissible right now in Pennsylvania to raise the income tax rate only for wealthy individuals," said Lauren Hitt, Kenney’s communications director. "The Republican controlled state legislature would have to change the constitution and we’re not holding our breath on that one. Our kids need Pre-K now." Kenney has said the tax is not regressive because he believes the money will stay in the neighborhoods. His finance director, Rob Dubow, said most consumers of sugary drinks are in poor neighborhoods. When Dubow suggested distributors would absorb some of the tax, City Council president Darrell Clarke responded, "Fundamentally, I don’t believe that." Our ruling Sanders said Kenney’s proposed soda tax would disproportionately increase taxes for low income families. In the only other instance of a soda tax in the United States, studies have shown somewhere between 25 and 70 percent of the cost of the tax gets passed to consumers. Tax experts say if this tax reaches the consumer level it would affect low income residents to a greater extent. We rule the claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19db2be2-02d7-4cfd-baa1-423db2d4d80f	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-25T13:02:29	2016-04-22	['Philadelphia']
pomt-14125	"There’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives."	/rhode-island/statements/2016/may/08/michael-oneill/how-many-lives-would-be-saved-gun-free-zone/	A bill that would stop the state’s more than 3,000 concealed-carry permit holders from bringing their weapons into Rhode Island schools quickly became the center of attention at an April 26 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Sponsored by Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, Senate Bill 2761 would make schools "gun free zones," meaning that only "peace officers" — defined in state law as people who are sanctioned by the school and have extensive firearms training — could carry weapons in school zones. This roiled Second Amendment enthusiasts who argued against the bill, saying it would put kids at higher risk for acts of terrorism. Legal gun owners, or "good guys," can help disarm a potential attacker if they are on school grounds before police arrive, Michael O’Neill, a pro-bono lobbyist for the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition said at the hearing. Sen. Frank Lombardi, D-Cranston, and Sen. Stephen Archambault, D-Smithfield, both agreed with O’Neill on that point. "If we're going to issue law-abiding concealed-carry permits to people," Archambault said, "... I'd rather know there's a chance someone can put down a lunatic." O’Neill added: "There’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives." We reached out to O’Neill, and his colleague Frank Saccoccio, also of the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition, to clarify. We briefly spoke with both men. Saccoccio said he’d send us information via email Tuesday night. By Friday, he hadn’t sent us an email, and he hasn’t returned subsequent emails and phone calls. On the other side of the argument, support for the bill comes from school committees across the state, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, the Rhode Island Association of School Principals and the Rhode Island Federal of Teachers and Health Professionals, among others. Is it possible that it's not backed up by data? Is there no data? O’Neill’s statement is tough to refute because it’s so broad, said Linda Finn, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence. There may not be data that gun-free zones have "saved lives." It’s hard to disprove a claim like that. Further, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the leading national public health institute — has not extensively researched firearms since 1996, when the National Rifle Association accused the agency of promoting gun control. After the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, President Obama signed an executive order reversing the research ban. But nearly four years later, Congress still hasn’t approved the funding. There is, though, "plenty of data that shows that when guns are present, it increases the likelihood of an injury or death," Finn told us. Like when Michelle Ferguson-Montgomery, a sixth-grade teacher and a concealed-carry permit holder in Utah, shot herself in the leg in the school bathroom in September 2014. Or when an Idaho State University professor literally shot himself in the foot with his concealed gun on campus. Then there’s a psychological phenomenon called the "weapons effect." Numerous peer-reviewed studies, including one dating back to 1967, show the presence of a weapon, or just a photo of one, leads to aggressive behavior in humans. This is especially true when stress levels are high -- say, in an active school shooter situation. The study "Does the Gun Pull the Trigger?" published in "Psychological Science" in 1996 showed that "simply identifying weapons increases the accessibility of aggressive thoughts." This theory played out for a Barrington sixth grader, according to testimony by his father, Willis Peter Bilderback. Bilderback testified that his son became "very afraid" after his teacher told him he had a firearm in his desk. The boy was so shaken that he switched out of the class and had repeated nightmares of "his teacher attempting to track him down with a gun and kill him," according to Bilderback’s testimony. "The fact that my son believed his teacher had a gun in the classroom turned a nationally recognized blue-ribbon Middle School into a house of horrors for him," Bilderback wrote. But do ‘good guys" help? There is anecdotal evidence to back up O’Neill and Archambault’s idea — some of which is outlined in this Washington Post blog from October 2015. In Chicago in April 2015, an Uber driver with a concealed-carry permit "shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people," according to a Chicago Tribune report. A similar incident played out in a Philadelphia barber shop. And an FBI "Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013" showed that out of the 160 incidents studied, in 21 cases unarmed citizens "made the selfless and deeply personal choice" to confront the shooter, and ended the threat. There were seven times that an armed, off-duty police officer, citizen or security guard used a weapon to end the threat. Our ruling: O’Neill says "there’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives." He is correct. There is no definitive data to say that a gun-free zone has saved lives. In part, that’s because the CDC has been blocked from studying anything related to firearms for the last 20 years. And also because "saved lives" are hard to quantify. However, there are many anecdotes, scholarly articles and federal studies with data showing that just the presence of guns can cause anxiety and increase aggressive behavior. Plus, there are the teachers who accidentally shot themselves on school grounds. And yes, there are the cases in which the "good guys" prevail.

pomt-02622	Says Alex Sink "failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices."	/florida/statements/2014/jan/22/republican-party-florida/gop-accuse-alex-sink-using-predatory-lending-pract/	The Republican Party of Florida wasted no time attacking former Florida CFO Alex Sink in her bid for Congress. The GOP started its campaign long before the Jan. 14 Republican primary, which clinched the nomination for David Jolly. A video posted Oct. 31, 2013, begins with Sink taking a break at a CNN/Tampa Bay Times debate in 2010, during which a makeup artist showed Sink an email message from one of the candidate’s advisers. The incident broke the debate’s rules against coaching, and became a sensational talking point about the Democrat cheating. After flashing a sentence accusing Sink of having "failed the public’s trust by cheating during a debate," the video then declares it wasn’t her only failure, launching into several attacks, including the claim that Sink "failed Florida investors by allowing for deceptive sales practices … and failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices." With the March 11 general election matchup set, we decided it was time to lend Sink’s past some of our attention. Sink’s banking background Before being elected Florida’s chief financial officer in 2006, Sink’s extensive banking career included 26 years working for Bank of America, formerly NationsBank. She was promoted to president of Florida operations in 1993 and oversaw tremendous growth. In 1997, NationsBank acquired Jacksonville-based Barnett Bank, then merged with California’s BankAmerica Corp. the following year. The new company took the Bank of America name. Sink retired as Florida president in 2000. The GOP said the "deceptive sales practices" that "failed Florida investors" was referring to a time between 1998 and 2002 when NationsBank and subsidiary NationsSecurities paid more than $13 million in fines to the federal government and the SEC. That led to a class-action lawsuit by investors; the bank in 2002 agreed to compensate their former customers with an $8.1 million settlement. Even though Rick Scott brought up the NationsSecurities fiasco during the same gubernatorial debate being referenced in the ad, Sink said the lawyer bringing the case declared she "had nothing to do with the situation." We found her statement Mostly True in 2010. The part of the ad we are checking, however, is about predatory lending. The video doesn’t give a time frame, and it would be understandable if your first thoughts went to the housing crash of 2008. But when we asked, the GOP told us their accusation actually goes back before that, to NationsBank’s August 1997 merger with Barnett, which was the largest commercial bank in the state at the time. The merger included Barnett subsidiary EquiCredit, which specialized in home loans for low-income borrowers at high interest rates, or subprime lending. EquiCredit was accused of predatory lending on multiple occasions, eventually leading to several lawsuits. The accusations gained steam after a May 2000 hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Financial Services. William J. Brennan, an Atlanta Legal Aid Society attorney, told the committee that EquiCredit and NationsBank’s own subsidiary, NationsCredit were "the worst I have ever seen" in terms of predatory lending. EquiCredit’s delinquency rate -- the share of mortgages either 90 days past due or in foreclosure -- was much higher than average, and targeted minorities, women and the elderly, he said. The company charged higher than average interest rates, which is common in subprime lending. The difference, Brennan alleged, is that EquiCredit willfully deceived vulnerable consumers into taking on loans they could not easily pay, with terms they could rarely understand. At the end of 1999, Bank of America held more than $22 billion in subprime loans, the most of any bank in the country. But Sink was in charge of Florida operations, not national lending for EquiCredit -- that company was run out of two offices in Dallas and Jacksonville, and it used independent brokers, not Bank of America employees. Sink has repeatedly said she did not work with the mortgage side of the business and "never had any involvement with them." Her team reiterated to PolitiFact Florida during the current campaign that she "was not engaged in these disreputable practices." EquiCredit operated as a national entity, with about 150 units across 43 states (22 of which were in Florida). Sink’s Bank of America Florida operations existed alongside the division, but EquiCredit took orders from the bank’s Charlotte, N.C., headquarters. Amid pressure from regulators, lawsuits and consumers, Bank of America closed NationsCredit and sold off EquiCredit by the end of 2001. Officially, both were shuttered because Bank of America no longer considered them profitable. By 2001, one of every 18 EquiCredit loans nationwide went bad, compared to one in 60 of Bank of America’s overall loans. These practices preceded the post-9/11 housing bubble that thrived on subprime lending -- in fact, one of the reasons cited for the closure was the poor economy that initially resulted from the 2001 terrorist attacks. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida accused Sink of having "failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices," citing the subprime lending practices of Bank of America’s NationsCredit and EquiCredit during her time as the bank’s Florida president. The EquiCredit problems were a nationwide issue, though, not just in the Sunshine State. And EquiCredit used brokers to sell their products, not Bank of America Florida employees. Sink would have had no control over that. The video also seems to imply Sink was somehow responsible for the precipitous loss in property values since 2008, but that timeline doesn’t match up, either. There doesn’t seem to be much of anything at all to tie Sink with EquiCredit, other than they both answered to Bank of America HQ in Charlotte. The Florida subsidiary of PolitiFact rates this claim False.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2014-01-22T10:00:00	2013-10-31	['None']

pomt-01494	Says Rick Scott "pled the Fifth 75 times to avoid jail for Medicare fraud."	/florida/statements/2014/sep/25/charlie-crist/crist-says-scott-pleaded-fifth-75-times-avoid-jail/	Gubernatorial campaign commercials have been digging up each candidate’s past for months, but now Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are pretty much calling each other criminals. The Republican Party of Florida, working on Scott’s behalf, had a Fort Lauderdale investor say in a TV ad that he was "swindled" by Crist. The man had invested with Scott Rothstein, who was later convicted of a Ponzi scheme. We rated that Pants on Fire!, because Crist had nothing to do with the plot to defraud investors. Now Crist is going after Scott’s past as the CEO of hospital chain Columbia/HCA, which in 1997 was busted by the federal government for bilking Medicare. Crist referred to the Rothstein attack in a Sept. 19, 2014, commercial, saying Scott lied to voters "4,000 times," the number of times the Rothstein ad had aired on Florida TV stations. "We shouldn’t be surprised," the narrator said. "Scott pled the Fifth 75 times to avoid jail for Medicare fraud." That’s referring to a deposition Scott gave in 2000 for an unrelated civil case. To further muddy the waters, the commercial shows footage from a deposition for yet another unrelated case in 1995. This attack should sound familiar, because it came up in the 2010 campaign, when Scott’s Republican primary opponent Bill McCollum said Scott "barely escaped imprisonment," which we rated False. PolitiFact Florida wanted to revisit this angle and see if Scott, who was never charged with wrongdoing in the federal fraud case, gave vague testimony to avoid time in the cooler. The Columbia/HCA case We’ve been over this many, many times before, so let’s explain the history as quickly as possible. Scott began what eventually became Columbia/HCA in 1987, buying and merging hospitals until his publicly traded company became the nation’s largest health care chain. At its peak, the company boasted more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries. Scott’s reputation as a hard-nosed businessman came from a cutthroat corporate environment, in which the most productive managers were rewarded and the least were fired. Some employees speculated it was that culture that led to unscrupulous behavior, such as padding bills, charging Medicare for procedures that were more lucrative than what was actually performed, and giving doctors kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. Whether Scott knew about such practices is unknown, although he apparently signed off on reports that raised concerns about things happening within the chain. Jerre Frazier, a company attorney told the Miami Herald in 2010 that Scott said the company wasn’t doing anything differently than other chains in the health care industry. Whistle-blowers exposed the fraud, helping federal investigators gather enough evidence to raid the company’s offices and hospitals in 1997. Scott was pressured to resign in July of that year, taking a $5.1 million cash severance and an additional $300 million in stocks and options with him. (Five other top executives also resigned.) Scott has said it was because he wanted to fight the charges while the board wanted to settle, which they did in 2000 and 2002, for a total of $1.7 billion in fines and penalties. Scott was never charged with a crime. His boilerplate response to the incident is that he wasn’t even questioned by investigators, although ABC’s World News Tonight reported in 1997 he was "considered a prime target of the investigation." That’s not unusual, legal experts told PolitiFact, because replacing a CEO is often a first step a company makes to show the government it means business about cleaning up its wayward methods. Whether that’s exactly what happened in Scott’s case, we can’t say. Scott has addressed the case plenty, however. In a 2010 debate he called the deposition a "fishing expedition" he refused to participate in. He told the Tampa Bay Times that same year that he was partly culpable. "There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes," he said. "I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader." Think about the clink The company agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies, which don’t involve jail time but did factor into the fines. Four Florida-based Columbia/HCA executives were indicted. Two were convicted of defrauding Medicare and sentenced to prison, but those verdicts were later overturned. One was acquitted, and a jury couldn’t reach a verdict on the last. Does that mean Scott faced jail at all? In pleading the Fifth Amendment, it certainly seems like a possibility, former federal prosecutor Ryan O’Quinn told us. That’s because the only legal reason to use your Fifth Amendment right in court is if you think your answer would incriminate you. The deposition in which Scott pleaded the Fifth 75 times was part of a civil case by Nevada Communications Corp., which alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract. Scott gave the deposition at his offices in Stamford, Conn., on July 27, 2000, months before the settlement with the federal government. Scott lawyer Steven Steinbach explained the strategy thusly: "Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself." While pleading the Fifth in a criminal case can’t be used as an admission of guilt, it’s just fine to assume that in a civil case. For example, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2014 upheld a $67 million judgment against TD Bank for a group of investors bilked by imprisoned attorney Scott Rothstein, who has factored heavily into campaign commercials between Scott and Crist. In that ruling, the judge said jurors could infer former TD Bank South Florida regional VP Frank Spinosa knew about or participated in Rothstein’s scheme when he invoked the Fifth 193 times. Spinosa has not been charged with a crime and was no longer a bank employee, but was likely avoiding self-incrimination, or possibly as a favor to TD Bank, the ruling said. Scott wasn’t facing a jury, but we’re trying to establish whether one could infer guilt for invoking the Fifth Amendment. In fact, there’s no other reason to think otherwise, because by the letter of the law, Scott must have thought he would incriminate himself if he answered truthfully. "Given the adverse consequences of an assertion of the Fifth Amendment in a civil deposition, an executive must have a significant concern that their response could contribute to their criminal prosecution," O’Quinn said. "A frivolous assertion of the Fifth Amendment would be an unethical act." So if Scott was avoiding incriminating himself and other executives were actually convicted and sentenced to prison (albeit later overturned), does that mean Scott faced jail? That’s conjecture, but he certainly could have faced federal charges, which could have resulted in time in prison. There is a possibility some in the FBI regretted the decision to not go after Scott. "After Columbia/HCA, I realized people, individual corporate officers, had to be held accountable for the actions of their companies,'' former Tampa FBI agent Joe Ford said in a book about the Columbia/HCA case. "Instead of just giving us (the government) money, people need to go to jail. I learn from my mistakes and this was my first big one.'' Our ruling Crist said Scott "pled the Fifth 75 times to avoid jail for Medicare fraud." If you haven’t heard by now, Scott did invoke his Fifth Amendment rights 75 times in a deposition to avoid discussing a Medicare fraud case. But Crist’s ad is pushing the envelope to say he did it to avoid jail. No one went to prison for the Medicare fraud debacle, nor did Scott actually face the rigors of a grand jury or even federal investigators. The commercial seems to imply Scott was in the thick of the raids, when he was actually sent packing as soon as it became apparent the company faced a major punishment for defrauding the U.S. government. It’s impossible to say if Scott would have gone to jail if he had answered those deposition questions, but experts say he was certainly avoiding possible legal trouble by asserting the Fifth Amendment. We rate the statement Half True. Correction, Oct. 3, 2014, 2:30 p.m.: This version clarifies the context in which Scott asserted his Fifth Amendment right. The change does not affect the ruling.

pomt-07063	"There is no $30 million pot of money" for redistricting issues, including defending redistricting lawsuits. "Your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that."	/florida/statements/2011/jun/28/will-weatherford/weatherford-denies-30-million-pot-exists-redistric/	Redistricting will be a messy battle in 2012. And that means legislators need money to protect their turf. But how much have they set aside to wage the war? The Orlando Sentinel has reported that the House set aside $30 million that can be used for redistricting and to fight potential lawsuits. But state Rep. Will Weatherford, the House redistricting chairman and a Republican from Wesley Chapel, rejected that claim while speaking at a public legislative redistricting meeting in Panama City. "There is no $30 million pot of money. That doesn't exist," Weatherford, the House speaker designate, told the June 22, 2011, audience. "Your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that. There is no large pot of money out there that is fighting anything." Several readers saw the Sentinel's reporting and the response from Weatherford and asked us to look into it. First, a quick primer on redistricting. Every 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. The task seems simple enough: to logically divide Florida's 18.8 million residents into 120 House districts, 40 Senate districts and 27 congressional districts. But the process is never without accusations of "gerrymandering" often brought up against the party in power. This round of redistricting, however, could be even more contentious because of two constitutional amendments approved by voters in 2010 that require districts to be drawn in a way that doesn't favor incumbents or political parties or interfere with minority representation. Some lawmakers say the amendments are vaguely worded and are open to interpretation, meaning that any redrawing of district lines will be open to a legal challenge. Expecting lawsuits, legislators have been storing away discretionary tax dollars to fight potential legal challenges. The Sentinel's Aaron Deslatte has been writing about the Legislature's plans and is the source for the $30 million figure. Specifically, Deslatte identified two House discretionary funds -- one with $8.49 million available and another with about $23 million available. (The Senate has set aside about $9 million, according to multiple reports). Deslatte asked House Speaker Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, about the funds in May, and reported that the reserves had been allowed to accumulate in part because the chamber would need money — millions of dollars — to pay for the redistricting fight. "The problem with redistricting every decade is it's unpredictable. The litigation this year is likely to be more broad and complex than it has been in past decades," Cannon said. Through June, the House had spent $945,843 on law firms associated with redistricting, Deslatte reported. Yet, despite the Sentinel stories, and quote from Cannon -- Weatherford is now challenging the dollar figure. Why? Weatherford told us that the problem is suggesting those moneys are specifically earmarked for redistricting. "Those resources are in two different areas, they are not earmarked for redistricting purposes," he said. "Will those pots be utilized for redistricting costs? I believe they will, but that's not the only thing they will be for." Weatherford's right that neither fund has shiny, bold-faced type linking it to redistricting. The funds are called "Legislative Carry Forward" and "House Discretionary Budget." But we believe he's also underplaying their intent. • Of the $8.49 million in the "Legislative Carry Forward" fund, about $571,000 has been spent -- including $18,932 for the redistricting committee. The fund includes small allotments for House members, but the biggest chunk of the money -- nearly $8 million -- is available in a "General House" fund that is available to be used on redistricting. (The redistricting committee has no specific allotment.) • Of the $23 million in the "House Discretionary Budget", about $700,000 has been spent so far on house reapportionment, and most of the money is not allocated for any specific use. Cannon himself admits that the funds were bolstered in order to fend off redistricting challenges. Which makes Weatherford's other claim that "your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that" -- simply not true. (Weatherford told us he wasn't trying to suggest that there are zero dollars for redistricting.) Part of the problem in examining this claim is that the Sentinel's stories got somewhat lost in translation. The Sentinel never said there was a bank vault filled with money sealed behind a door with "Redistricting Only" written on it. But Weatherford, in responding to allegations, was able to suggest as much. And that's what makes his claim -- at least part of it -- credible. There is, in fact, no $30 million pot of money for redistricting in the House. There are two pots of money available for lots of things, but the House speaker said the money predominantly is available to fight potential redistricting lawsuits. That admission, which is not in dispute, defies Weatherford's other point, that "your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that" -- referring to redistricting lawsuits. The Legislature is planning on doing exactly that. There's too much about this claim that is missing. We rate it False.	None	Will Weatherford	None	None	None	2011-06-28T14:20:27	2011-06-22	['None']

pomt-10459	"Bill Clinton invited him (the Rev. Wright) to the White House when he was having his personal crises."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/25/barack-obama/photo-and-obama-dont-lie/	In an interview with Philadelphia radio talk show host Michael Smerconish on March 24, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama defended his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, noting that he was good enough at one point for the Clintons. "But understand this, something else that I think has not gotten reported on enough, is despite these very offensive views, this guy has built one of the finest churches in Chicago. It's not some crackpot church. I mean, witness the fact that Bill Clinton invited him to the White House when he was having his personal crises." Obama is talking about a White House prayer breakfast on Sept. 11, 1998. But this wasn't just any prayer breakfast. This was the forum Clinton chose to make his most comprehensive public apology for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The Clintons invited more than 100 religious leaders from around the country. And Wright, pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ, was one of them. A few days before Obama's radio comment, the Obama campaign released a photo of Rev. Wright shaking hands with President Bill Clinton at the prayer breakfast. Case closed. He was there. They also provided a two-sentence letter Clinton wrote to Rev. Wright the following month. "Thank you so much for your kind message," Clinton's letter reads. "I am touched by your prayers and by the many expressions of encouragement and support I have received from friends across the country." The Rev. Wright's incendiary comments about America — like the oft-viewed comment about America's "chickens coming home to roost" on Sept. 11 — and his close ties as spiritual adviser to Obama have made him the most controversial figure of this presidential election season. A couple days after the Obama campaign released the Clinton-Wright photo, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore took it one step further and claimed that during a time of marital difficulties due to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Clintons had reached out to none other than Rev. Wright for "spiritual counseling." According to ministers at the prayer breakfast, that's not true. Wright was merely one of more than 100 religious leaders invited to the prayer breakfast. There was no spiritual counseling. A small team of ministers were chosen by Clinton to provide ongoing religious counseling about his indiscretions. But Wright wasn't one of them. We rule Moore's statement False. But Obama's wording and purpose are different than Moore's. Obama merely noted that Clinton invited Wright to the White House during a time of personal crisis and didn't suggest there was some close personal tie. And by pointing out the invitation Obama was making clear that Wright was a well-regarded minister — good enough, at least, to be among a select group of religious leaders invited to the White House for an important address by Clinton. "To my knowledge, the 100 leaders were invited on the merits of their leadership and accomplishments in their particular communities," said Dr. Gerald Mann, who delivered a prayer at the breakfast. Listeners hearing Obama's comments might have thought Wright had a larger role at the White House than simply attending a prayer breakfast, but Obama is correct about the timing of the event. And so we find the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-04-25T00:00:00	2008-03-24	['White_House', 'Bill_Clinton']

pomt-07147	"For a young man or woman who is entering the ninth grade in Newark this year, they have a 29 percent graduation rate."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/15/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-graduation-rate-29-percent/	Gov. Chris Christie recently cited Newark as an example of the problem with New Jersey’s public school system, slapping a bulls-eye on the city’s high school graduation rate. "So let’s talk about Newark for a second, our largest city, little over 275,000 citizens, a school district of about 70 schools, where we spend on average $24,500 per pupil per year. And for a young man or woman who is entering the ninth grade in Newark this year, they have a 29 percent graduation rate. Twenty-nine percent graduation rate," Christie said in a speech at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Christie also used that number at a town hall meeting on April 19 in Jackson while discussing school funding for poor districts. PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check if Newark’s graduation rate is as low as the governor claims. First, let’s put the debate over graduation rates in context. The rates can vary wildly because of differences in calculation. "This is one of the most controversial and confusing areas in education … there is a great need to quiet the debate and have uniform measure," said Jack Jennings, president of the nonpartisan Center on Education Policy in Washington, D.C. "Otherwise, people cherry-pick their numbers." The graduation rate for New Jersey’s Class of 2011 will be based on a new federal standard called the "adjusted cohort graduation rate." The federal measurement closely resembles a common definition of graduation rates that 45 states, including New Jersey, agreed to in 2005. The rate will be calculated by determining the percentage of a ninth grade class that graduates in four years with a standard diploma, accounting for transfers and dropouts. But the number Christie cited at Harvard relied on a different approach. In fact, there are at least two other ways of measuring the graduation rate: One method calculates the percentage of people who enter ninth grade and graduate in four years by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment, or HSPA. A more generous method calculates the students who pass the HSPA, adds in the students who pass an alternate exam as well as special education students whose tests are varied. At Harvard, Christie was referencing a study released in February by Global Education Advisors, a private consulting company incorporated by Christopher Cerf before he became New Jersey’s acting state Education Commissioner. A presentation based on the study’s findings said that 22 percent of children who enter ninth grade in Newark graduate with a "HSPA degree in four years." Newark Public Schools said its graduation rate is 55 percent, which it calculates by including all students who graduate in four years, accounting for transfers and dropouts. Using raw data provided by Newark Public Schools, PolitiFact New Jersey calculated the four-year graduation rate for students who pass the HSPA. We got a rate of 25.8 percent. Newark also had a rate of 19.8 percent for students passing the alternate exam, now called the Alternate High School Assessment and special education students exempt from taking the HSPA accounted for another 9.4 percent, according to the district’s data. The HSPA number is higher than the 22 percent figure from the presentation based on the Global Education Advisors study, which appears to be calculated from two different years of data. And it’s lower than Newark’s 55 percent. Both the state Education Department and Newark Public Schools said they didn’t produce the presentation, so they couldn’t comment on it. Two emails and a phone call to Sangari Global Education, a company with ties to Global Education Advisors, were not returned. Still, Christie’s statistic isn’t totally out of the ballpark -- but only when specifically referring to students who graduate in four years after passing the HSPA. We spoke to three academics and a policy expert to gauge whether one method of calculating the graduation rate is more credible than the other. They said graduation rates should reflect students who graduate within four years prepared for a career or college. "I think we get in this number game way too much," said Alexander Urbiel, assistant dean of teacher education at Ramapo College. "What we really should be looking at is outcomes." One of the academics also said anyone citing a graduation rate statistic needs to be clear on who the number includes. "We need to account for them when we say the school’s graduation rate," said Donna Jorgensen, an associate professor of education at Rowan University, about students who graduate by passing the alternate exam. "If we don’t, it’s like saying they weren’t in school at all." We also talked to Alan Sadovnik, a professor of education, sociology and public affairs at Rutgers University who co-authored a recent report that studied the use of alternate exams in Newark. From 2003 to 2008 the study tracked 9,725 students, 60 percent of whom graduated from high school by passing the alternate exam, which was then called the Special Review Assessment. Forty percent of those students enrolled in college, compared with 68 percent of the students who graduated by passing the HSPA. The study also found that female, low-income and minority students were more likely to graduate by taking the alternate exam. Sadovnik said the governor’s choice of statistic is part of the larger, ongoing debate over eliminating alternate exams and requiring a single-high stakes test for graduation. Let’s review. The governor said the graduation rate in Newark is 29 percent. There are several ways to calculate graduation rates and there is no solid consensus on whether one method is more credible than any other. New Jersey is moving to a federal standard of calculating graduation rates, but hasn’t done so yet. Christie’s number is actually a bit higher than the statistic that measures the four-year graduation rate for students who passed the HSPA. But it’s lower than the calculation that the school system uses. There are different ways to calculate graduation rates and it’s important to be precise in describing them. In this case, the governor glossed over the details and omitted a whole group of students recognized by the state as having graduated, many of whom continued their education beyond high school. For these reasons, we rate Christie’s statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2011-06-15T05:00:00	2011-04-29	['Newark,_New_Jersey']
pomt-05827	Says "there are homes for sale on and around (Oswego Lake) right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy."	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/17/doug-thomas/can-you-really-get-home-near-lake-oswego-less-1500/	A fight over just who should have access to the waters of Oswego Lake is always simmering. Some say the lake belongs to the whole community and needs to be public. Others are coming down on the side of leaving access where it is now, largely with those who live on the lake or have access through easements. In defense of the status quo, Doug Thomas, president of the board of directors for the Lake Oswego Corporation (the organization that manages the lake) had this to say: "Every 10 years or so, someone makes a challenge as to why everyone and anyone can’t come into the lake … But the shareholders built this lake and have maintained it for over a hundred years. Why would we let everyone have access to our backyards?" Then he added an important dimension to the debate, telling The Oregonian that "We’re not exclusive. There are homes for sale on and around the lake right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy." We might be a little out of touch, but "exclusive" is, in fact, one of the first words that comes to mind when we think about Lake Oswego. Generally speaking, the city carries a reputation as an upscale community for those who take home more than most. It seemed to us that $150,000 for a home in the area was a stretch -- let alone a home that sits on or near the lake. We couldn’t help ourselves; we had to check his claim. Our first call was to the Clackamas County assessor’s office. Lynn Longfellow, a sales analyst there, admitted to having heard something about Thomas’ comment earlier. She was similarly confused. She guessed there might be some condos with access to the lake for under $150,000, but she doubted there was anything on the lake for that price. The cheapest she could remember a house on the lake going for was $300,000 -- a short sale with some slide issues. "I can’t imagine anything (else) on the lake selling for $300,000," she said. Let alone $150,000. Still, she was kind enough to run us last year’s sales data, so we could take a closer look for ourselves. As far as waterfront property goes -- that means canals and the lake itself -- the cheapest sale documented was for just over $500,000. If you’re talking Lake Oswego and Lake Grove generally, six homes went for less than $150,000. None of them looked as though they’d be in areas with easement rights -- though we can’t say for certain as the map on the Lake Corp. website isn’t definitive. If you take a look at condos specifically, things look a little more promising. About 44 condos in the whole of Lake Oswego -- half of those listed -- went for less than $150,000. Few of them were in the estimated easement areas, but we did find a couple, including one in Lake Grove that went for just over $100,000. To put that figure in a little bit of context, though, of the 580 stand-alone homes sold in the area last year -- and the figures aren’t completely final -- six sold for less than $150,000, while more than 200 sold for $500,000 or higher. To check the current market, which seemed to be Thomas’ focus, we pulled up current listings in the area on the Windemere Real Estate website. First we searched for strictly waterfront properties under $150,000. Not a single one came up. When we left the waterfront part out, 20 properties popped up, about five of which appeared to be close enough to potentially have lake access via an easement -- though we can’t be sure. Those five properties were all condos. The cheapest listing that explicitly mentioned lake access was for a condo priced at $100,000. Based on that quick search, it seemed like Thomas might be right as far as homes around the lake go -- so long as you consider a condo a home. But there is still nothing directly on the lake, house or condo, that appears to be available for less than $150,000. Still, we’re hardly professionals when it comes to real estate, so we phoned Hasson Realtors, an agency that works in the area, for another take. Bill Marquard, one of the real estate agents with Hasson, was happy to help. He quickly found around 10 condos that were listed for less than $150,000 and would have lake access. Some condos at a property that was formerly an apartment complex even had docks. "You definitely have condos," Marquard said. "You can get into Lake Oswego and have access to the lake for definitely under $150,000." But as for stand-alone houses, "I wouldn't say impossible but very, very difficult. "What's your definition of a home?" he asked. Finally, we wanted to talk to Thomas. After all, he’s the one who made the statement we’re ruling on. After repeated phone calls, we finally got him on the line. He said condos are just as much a home as a house and he pointed out the apartments-turned-condos that were going for under $150,000. "I'm not trying to mislead anybody," Thomas said. "I think everybody always assumes that these properties are expensive." So that brings us to our ruling. Last week, Thomas told the Oregonian that there were "homes for sale on and around (Oswego Lake) right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy." So far as we can tell, there’s nothing on the lake, condos or otherwise, that hits that mark. There are some condos with lake access that go for less than $150,000. But that price is hardly the norm. Those are important details -- and his statement ignores them. We give this a Half True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this staterement and ruling.

pomt-08068	"Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, recommended partitioning Iraq into three separate entities."	/texas/statements/2010/dec/22/george-w-bush/former-president-george-w-bush-says-senator-joe-bi/	In his memoir Decision Points, President George W. Bush says that he declined to announce plans to increase troop levels in Iraq in 2006 until after the midterm elections. "The rhetoric on Iraq was hot," he said. "Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, recommended partitioning Iraq into three separate entities. Republicans were anxious, too. Mitch McConnell (the Senate minority leader from Kentucky) made it clear with his Oval Office request for a troop reduction." Before he was elected Vice President in 2008, Biden called for boundaries to be drawn for the Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite populations. But is that the same as partitioning a country? The word can hold some heavy implications: think India, Korea and Vietnam — previously unified territories that were divided into two countries. Seeking an answer to that question, we turned to the May 2006 op-ed article published in The New York Times that then-Delaware Sen. Biden penned with Leslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. In it, they drew a parallel between conditions in Iraq and Bosnia's recent ethnic turmoil. "A decade ago, Bosnia was torn apart by ethnic cleansing and facing its demise as a single country," the article says. "After much hesitation, the United States stepped in decisively with the Dayton Accords, which kept the country whole by, paradoxically, breaking it into ethnic federations, even allowing Muslims, Croats and Serbs to retain separate armies. With the help of American and other forces, Bosnians have lived a decade in relative peace and are now slowly strengthening their common central government, including disbanding those separate armies last year." A similar plan for Iraq, the Biden-Gelb article says, would "maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it," establishing "three largely autonomous regions with a viable central govetrnment in Baghdad . . .The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multi-sectarian and international police protection." And as to the "p" word? The article says: "Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing. But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq." In 2007, Biden — who by then had become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, shepherded a nonbinding "sense of the Senate" resolution that proposed separating Iraq into three semi-autonomous regions while maintaining a federal government. The resolution passed the Senate 75 to 23. According to a C-SPAN video, Biden told colleagues on the Senate floor in April 2007: "You make federalism work for the Iraqis. You give them control over the fabric of their daily lives. . . Let them control their local police, their education, their religion, their marriage. That's the only possibility. Change the focus to a limited central government and a federal system that their Constitution calls for." But when news articles used "partition" or "soft partition" to describe Biden's proposal, the senator took exception to the label, mindful that in foreign policy, it is a loaded term. A June 2007 paper from the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution making the case for "soft partition in Iraq" says it would divide the "country into three main regions. Each would assume primary responsibility for its own security and governance... it would require new negotiations, the formation of revised legal framework for the country, the creation of new institutions at the regional level, and the organized but voluntary movement of populations." "Such a plan for soft partition (as opposed to hard-partition which involves outright division of Iraq) is consistent" with the Biden-Gelb plan, according to the paper. Michael O'Hanlon, the paper's coauthor and a Brookings' foreign policy fellow, told us in an e-mail that "Biden called it enhanced federalism. He did not say that it would be formal partition into three states." O'Hanlon described "enhanced federalism" as "three regions with lots of autonomy." In an October 2007 op-ed (again co-written with Gelb) for The Washington Post, Biden wrote: "Our plan is not partition, though even some supporters and the media mistakenly call it that. It would hold Iraq together by bringing to life the federal system enshrined in its constitution. A federal Iraq is a united Iraq but one in which power devolves to regional governments, with a limited central government responsible for common concerns such as protecting borders and distributing oil revenue." And during a July 18, 2010 interview on ABC's This Week, Biden said: "I don't want to debate history here, but I never called for a partition. I called for a central government with considerable autonomy in the regions." PolitiFact National rated his statement True. But is a rose by any other name still a rose? We wondered whether what Bush calls a partition and what Biden calls, well, not a partition, shakes out the same way. O'Hanlon said "the word 'partition,' by itself, tends to mean separate states. 'Soft partition' or 'enhanced federalism' or 'autonomous regions' are fairer ways to characterize Biden's thinking. I would say partition is inaccurate as a depiction," he said. Long story short, Biden proposed dividing the country into three separate and semi-autonomous regions while retaining a federal system to handle border security and other common concerns. Bush calls that partitioning. Biden does not, pointing to his support for a central government in Iraq. But both are talking about creating new geopolitical entities in Iraq.

pomt-14646	Martin Luther King Jr. "was a Republican."	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/25/philip-van-cleave/van-cleave-wongly-says-martin-luther-king-jr-was-r/	On the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., gun rights supporters rallied on the state Capitol grounds against efforts to tighten firearm restrictions. Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, which organized the rally, disparaged the Democratic Party as the party of gun control. He then uttered what he said was a little-known fact: "We’re here on a holiday, and this holiday is Martin Luther King’s birthday, right? Somebody who fought for civil rights to bring people to be equal," Van Cleave said. "Let me ask you a question. What party was he with? He was a Republican." That was news to us. We decided to investigate. We asked Van Cleave to support his claim that the slain civil rights leader was a Republican. He told us in a telephone interview that he’d heard that statement many times. He said he’d do some research on the origin of the claim and get back to us. He followed with an email saying his research found some claims that King was with the GOP and others saying his party affiliation was unknown. "I’m also not finding an unimpeachable source either way. So I’d have to say that one can’t claim he was a Republican with absolute certainty, nor can one say he wasn’t a Republican with absolute certainty," Van Cleave wrote. "Rather than get mixed up in this gray area, I’m just going to drop that one off my talking points," he added. Indeed, the Internet is replete with declarations from conservative groups that King was a brethren Republican. The claim rests, in large part, on comments made at least eight years ago by Alveda C. King, the civil rights leader’s niece. "My uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during his lifetime was a Republican," Alveda King said in a video posted on the National Black Republican Association website. Her statement has been dismissed by other members of King’s family. "It is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican," Martin Luther King III, the civil rights leader’s son, told The Associated Press in 2008. "He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican." And on the same day Van Cleave made his statement, Bernice King, the civil rights leader’s daughter, said in a radio interview that her father was "never" a member of the Republican Party. The video of Alveda King’s comments has been circulating for years. But in 2013, she retracted her claim in an op-ed for Newsmax.com, a conservative news website. King wrote that she regrets "having said to a group of peers that my Uncle M. L. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) was a Republican. I said that without having all the facts." Alveda King wrote that her uncle was "an independent, who in his own words tended to vote Democrat." She wrote that she had assumed her uncle was a member of the GOP because his father - Martin Luther King, Sr. - was a Republican. Alveda King wrote that before the election of Democrat John F. Kennedy as president in 1960, most blacks were Republicans. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island in 2012 also examined a claim that the civil rights leader was a Republican. They wrote that it wasn’t surprising that King’s father, who lived in Atlanta, was a Republican because most Southern Democrats at the time backed racial segregation. For more insight, we contacted Clayborne Carson, founding director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. We asked him if King was a Republican and whether there are any voter registration records that would confirm that’s the case. "To the best of my knowledge, the answer to both questions is no," Carson replied in an email. Carson also is director of the King Papers Project, a research initiative with the King Center in Atlanta that is compiling the civil rights leader’s sermons, correspondence, speeches and other writings. He said that project has not found any records that show King registered with either political party. Carson said King wasn’t completely enamored with Republicans or Democrats. "There are many documents indicating that King was critical of both major political parties, because they were insufficiently committed to civil rights and ‘a better distribution of wealth,’" he wrote. Lewis Baldwin, a professor emeritus of religious studies at Vanderbilt University who has written six books about the civil rights leader, told us there’s "no evidence whatsoever" that King was a Republican. Any assertion that King was a member of the GOP is "absolutely false," he said. King said blacks "should remain independent voters, and they should not become unduly tied to any party, Democrat or Republican," Baldwin said. Our ruling Van Cleave said at a rally that Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican. He told us he had heard the claim many times but, after doing some research, now concludes that the evidence is cloudy and said he will stop using the line in speeches. Experts say King eschewed party labels and was critical of both major parties. King’s son and daughter have denied claims that their father sided with the GOP. King’s niece, who once said the civil rights leader was a Republican, retracted that statement three years ago. The burden is on Van Cleave to prove his statement, and he, too, backs away from it. We rate his claim False.	None	Philip Van Cleave	None	None	None	2016-01-25T09:13:49	2016-01-18	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-11474	Says Mike DeWine "flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA."	/ohio/statements/2018/mar/06/mary-taylor/gop-ohio-primary-governor-mary-taylor-said-mike-de/	Among Ohio’s Republican candidates for governor, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor portrays herself as more conservative than Attorney General Mike DeWine when it comes to Second Amendment issues. "I do not trust Mike DeWine on guns," Taylor said during a Jan. 29 speech at the Washington Heights Baptist Church. "He flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA. I have an A with the NRA." Taylor and DeWine are competing in the May 8 Republican primary for governor with hopes to replace term-limited Gov. John Kasich. There is no disputing that DeWine once received an F grade from the NRA, which was based on his stances while in the U.S. Senate more than a decade ago. In 2002, the Columbus Dispatch described DeWine as a "Republican who's not afraid to stand up to the National Rifle Association." But when DeWine ran for Ohio attorney general in 2010, his positions on gun laws changed. Taylor omits that DeWine’s grades from pro-gun groups have risen as he has taken stances more in line with the NRA. The NRA did not respond to our requests to confirm DeWine’s grades, but DeWine’s campaign spokesman sent PolitiFact documents showing his grades by the NRA, as well as from a state group, the Buckeye Firearms Association. DeWine’s ratings from gun groups have varied over the years DeWine has served in elected office since he won a county prosecutor position in 1976. We largely focused our search of his gun stances starting with his tenure in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007. Taylor’s campaign spokesman Michael Duchesne pointed to Vote Smart’s compilation of DeWine’s ratings from groups that take stances on gun laws. The NRA gave DeWine a 46 percent in 2000, an 8 percent in 2006 and an F in 2010. DeWine supported multiple gun control measures while a senator, including restrictions on sales at gun shows and the assault weapons ban. In 1999, DeWine was one of a handful of Republicans to side with Democrats to support an amendment to enact a waiting period on sales at gun shows following the mass shooting at Columbine High School. "The amendment seemed on balance to make sense," he said a year later. "I feel that the requirement to follow the Brady gun-check law should apply to everyone at a gun show and that's what this amendment did." In 2001, Dewine co-sponsored a bill with U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to impose a three-day waiting period on gun show purchases, which was opposed by the NRA. DeWine was outspoken in favor of extending the assault weapons ban. In 2005 when Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation to re-establish the expired ban, DeWine was among a group of bipartisan cosponsors. "Re-establishing the assault weapons ban is simply good public policy. The law modestly prohibits a select few military-style weapons, all the while protecting the rights of legitimate gun owners nationwide," DeWine said. "As a former prosecutor, I understand the challenges Ohio's mayors and law enforcement officials face, and we owe it to them to reestablish this law." In 2006, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed DeWine in his re-election, according to news reports. DeWine lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Sherrod Brown that fall. The Columbus Dispatch later wrote, "DeWine's 2006 defeat was primarily because voters were sick of the war in Iraq, not because they believe everyone in Ohio should own a machine gun." DeWine’s gun record since leaving the U.S. Senate In 2010 while running for attorney general, DeWine’s campaign told sportsmen and Second Amendment groups that he regretted his assault weapons vote, said Ryan Stubenrauch, who has worked on behalf of DeWine’s campaigns between 2010-18. Stubenrauch said that while DeWine was in the Senate, he heard from law enforcement officials who said they supported the assault weapons ban. But he later concluded the assault weapons ban "didn’t do anything." (Firm conclusions about the impact of the ban are not possible, PolitiFact has previously concluded.) In 2010, the NRA still gave DeWine an F. But his support from gun rights groups would change after he was elected attorney general. While attorney general, DeWine repeatedly took stances in favor of gun rights by supporting legislation in Congress and the Ohio Legislature. He also signed on to amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, including in support of the Illinois State Rifle Association, opposed a federal proposal to ban a certain type of ammunition and supported efforts to arm school teachers. In 2012, DeWine supported the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act to allow any person with a valid state-issued concealed firearm permit to carry the concealed firearm in many other states. He also supported state bills that removed some requirements for concealed carry license holders. When DeWine sought re-election in 2014, the Buckeye Firearms Association gave DeWine a B grade and endorsed him while the NRA gave him a C plus. DeWine’s campaign spokesman said as of Feb. 21 he wasn’t aware of any grade by the NRA for his current race. One other sign of DeWine’s pro-gun stance: He named Secretary of State Jon Husted, who has received an A plus from the NRA, as his running mate. Our rating will only be based on information that was available at the time that Taylor made her statement in January, but we will note that in February the Republicans split endorsements from state gun-rights groups. DeWine was endorsed by the Buckeye Firearms Association, and Taylor was endorsed by Ohioans for Concealed Carry. Our ruling Taylor said DeWine "flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA." DeWine did receiving failing grades from the NRA based on his record in the U.S. Senate, including in 2010 when he ran for Ohio Attorney General. As Taylor noted broadly, DeWine did flip-flop. As attorney general he has taken several stances more aligned with the NRA and no longer supports an assault weapons ban. Taylor zeroes in on DeWine’s record from many years ago and omits that by 2014, he had clearly earned the support of the Buckeye Firearms Association when it endorsed his re-election.

pomt-02720	Says Gov. Scott Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college short of a degree "not long after" he was "kicked out of student elections at Marquette University."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/21/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-scott-walker-was-k/	Some critics of Gov. Scott Walker have for years charged, insinuated or suggested that a dark story underlies his early departure from Marquette University in 1990. Such talk ramped up when Walker announced he was writing a book, "Unintimidated," that was released in November 2013. "The ‘Essence’ of Dirty Tricks: Dropping out at Marquette," read a headline on the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s website. "Scott Walker was kicked out of student elections at Marquette University after masterminding a scheme that destroyed newspapers critical of him," the party alleged on its website. "Walker either dropped out or was forced out not long after." Mike Tate, chairman of the state Democratic Party, told us the party based its post on unnamed sources who he said had privately passed on information about possible "nefarious activity" that Tate did not describe. Those parties would be reluctant to talk to a reporter, he said. The allegation is defensible, Tate argued, because the party is trying to raise questions about the "mystery" of Walker’s departure. That’s a flimsy case, at best. At worst, it suggests a possible fictional smear. It’s similar to claims by others that Walker got caught cheating and was kicked out, for which critics have offered no evidence. To research the various claims, and examine how Walker has shifted his own explanation over time, we examined volumes of university files on the election and other matters from the period, and spoke with Walker, his opponent in the student elections, and students, teachers and administrators -- Walker critics and backers alike. We reported the results of our investigation in a story published Dec. 18, 2013. That story provides a basis for this Truth-O-Meter item, which we decided to break out separately because of how often we are asked by readers to look at -- and rate -- this very claim. Here we’ll summarize some of our findings. Walker enrolled at Marquette in the fall of 1986, and left in spring 1990 with about a year’s worth of credits left to earn. He took a full-time job and was running for state Assembly at the time. In February 1988, as a sophomore, he entered a fiercely fought campaign for Marquette student government president against John Quigley, a liberal student from Chicago. The day before the election, the student-produced Marquette Tribune endorsed Quigley. The paper, though, also said Walker was qualified. That day’s newspaper became a limited edition, students told the Quigley campaign. They’d seen Walker workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings, according to Quigley. Administrators soon got involved in the dustup. Walker campaign officials denied involvement. Stung by the endorsement, Walker’s camp plastered campus with an election-eve flier criticizing Quigley’s political tactics. It was gentle stuff, but the Trib took offense, publishing an election-day editorial headlined, "Walker unfit." It decried his "mudslinging" and said another factor in its reversal on Walker being qualified was the alleged theft of papers. The next day’s vote wasn’t close; Quigley won 1,245 to 927. His tenure was short. Within months, Quigley was forced from office when senators threatened impeachment following his arrest at a sit-in protesting a university decision to displace low-income residents of the central YMCA to make room for Marquette dormitory space. Theft of newspapers alleged Quigley’s departure left an opening in spring 1989. But Walker sat it out and disappeared from the student government scene. An interesting turn of events, but a far cry from proof that Walker was barred from running. Overall, we turned up no proof that Walker was banned from elections. We did find evidence that the alleged newspaper confiscation got the attention of top university administrators, one of whom ordered an investigation. "I have requested the Department of Public Safety to investigate the reported destruction/theft of a large number of Marquette Tribune newspapers on February 23, 1988," Dean of Students James E. Moore wrote to College Of Journalism Dean Sharon Murphy on May 9, 1988. "If the inquiry indicates a conduct policy violation on the part of the identified individuals, a disciplinary process will be initiated." We found no paper trail, and could not learn from interviews, what came of that investigation, if anything. Marquette officials told us that even if they once existed, records regarding disciplinary actions unrelated to academics are destroyed two years after a student or his/her class graduates, per the student handbook. Students who have completed a penalty for non-academic discipline are returned to good standing. Records of suspensions or expulsions are not destroyed, the handbook says. The bottom line: Details of the alleged purloining of the papers are not readily available in the public record, such as it is, much less evidence of who may have "masterminded" it. "These allegations are false," Walker spokesman Tom Evenson told us. Quigley firmly agrees. "I don’t believe any disciplinary action was taken against him for anything that happened in that election," said Quigley, who is now a Democratic political consultant. Marquette releases information Now let’s tackle the larger suggestion by the Democratic Party -- that Walker may have been forced out of the university altogether. In the course of our reporting, we heard nothing -- and found no evidence -- suggesting Walker was pushed out of the university. Publicly available documents cannot fully resolve the question, in part because a federal privacy law blocks release of information on former students unless the person consents. In addition, Walker told us he was sticking to an earlier decision not to release his transcript. With that in mind, we asked Walker if he would allow Marquette to comment on his academic and conduct record. He did. "Gov. Scott Walker was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew from Marquette," the university said in a statement. That means that no conduct issues, academic or otherwise, blocked Walker from continuing in school at the time of his departure, MU spokesman Brian Dorrington told us in early December 2013. When we asked Dorrington whether any conduct issues were on Walker’s earlier school record, he said Walker would have to permit release of that information. Walker did so in response to our request. "Governor Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette University and when he left Marquette University," Associate Vice Provost Anne Deahl said in a letter. "Governor Walker was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time." That statement provides the strongest refutation to date of accusations that Walker was forced out. Finally, there’s another problem with the Democratic Party’s claims. According to MU, Walker left school after the spring semester in 1990. That’s more than two years after the 1988 election, instead of the "not long after" the Dems claim. After we published our Dec. 18, 2013 story, Tate told us the Democratic Party was changing its website in light of the new information released by Marquette that contradicts the party’s claims. "While we still stand behind our sources, only Scott Walker can clarify what happened in his time at Marquette University, and we'll afford the governor the respect of taking him at his word on this," Tate told the Journal Sentinel. "Accordingly, we've updated our website." The site now drops the "forced out" reference. But it still accuses Walker of "masterminding" the scheme to destroy newspapers. Walker, for his part, said this to PolitiFact Wisconsin about the accusation he was kicked out: "I can say unequivocally that isn’t true." Our rating The Democratic Party website said that "Scott Walker was kicked out of student elections at Marquette University after masterminding a scheme that destroyed newspapers critical of him." It added that "Walker either dropped out or was forced out not long after." The party offered nothing to backup up its claims, and our investigation found no backup either. And statements by Marquette go a long way to contradicting the party’s statements. We’ll revisit this item if new evidence emerges, but at this point, we rate the party’s claims False.

pomt-06976	Social Security and other federal checks may not go out on Aug. 3 if the debt ceiling is not increased.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-social-security-and-other-federa/	President Barack Obama and Congress are in intense discussions on raising the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow. But the negotiations aren't going so well, leaving observers -- and some participants -- to consider whether there are Plan B's, Plan C's and Plan D's if the negotiators can't reach an agreement in time. After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts as a temporary measure that bought time for further negotiations. But officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011. While most if not all federal accounts are affected in some way by the debt limit debate, the most urgent items for many ordinary Americans are direct transfer payments, most notably Social Security and veterans' benefits. Obama was asked about this in a July 12, 2011, interview with CBS News anchor Scott Pelley. Here's their exchange: Pelley: "Can you tell the folks at home that, no matter what happens, the Social Security checks are going to go out on August the 3rd? There are about $20 billion worth of Social Security checks that have to go out the day after the government is supposedly going to go into default." Obama: "Well, this is not just a matter of Social Security checks. These are veterans' checks, these are folks on disability and their checks. There are about 70 million checks that go out each month." Pelley: "Can you guarantee, as president, that those checks will go out on August the 3rd?" Obama: "I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on August 3rd if we haven't resolved this issue, because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it." We heard from a lot of readers who wanted us to check whether that statement was factually accurate or if Obama was using scare tactics. Back in February, we examined a similar statement by Obama -- that if there's a government shutdown, "people don't get their Social Security checks." We rated that Barely True. Social Security is a mandatory program supported by a trust fund, so Social Security benefits don't have to be formally approved by Congress every year. However, Social Security Administration employees are paid through appropriated funds. The real question about a government shutdown was whether those employees would be kept from going to work and if so, whether the checks would sit idle rather than arriving in mailboxes nationwide. The rules that cover government shutdowns provide some leeway for federal workers to carry out core Social Security functions. This flexibility allowed checks to go out during a 1995 shutdown, even as less-urgent agency functions lagged. However, the two scenarios -- a government shutdown caused by the absence of funding approved by Congress and a debt ceiling impasse that prevents new borrowing -- are different. So the consequences of one do not necessarily match the consequences of the other. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, put it this way: "Failing to raise the debt ceiling would not bring the government to a screeching halt the way that not passing appropriations bills would. Employees would not be sent home, and checks would continue to be issued. If the Treasury was low on cash, however, there could be delays in honoring checks and disruptions in the normal flow of government services." This is because the government receives both cash, including tax revenue, and bills at irregular intervals. So it doesn't always have enough cash on hand to pay all its debts at any given moment. (Families and businesses will recognize this as the always-dreaded "cash flow problem.") The Treasury Department has argued that failure to raise the debt limit actually would have more dramatic consequences than a government shutdown. "If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, the government would have to stop, limit, or delay payments on a broad range of legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and many other commitments," the department said in a statement. How broad would the impact be? The Bipartisan Policy Center -- a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with a board that includes former politicians from both parties -- conducted an analysis of what the government's fiscal situation would be if a deal on the debt ceiling is not reached. When the center analyzed the government's inflows and outflows for the rest of August 2011, it found $172.4 billion in cash coming in, to offset required payments of $306.7 billion. That works out to a deficit of $134.3 billion. With that amount of income to work with, the government -- if it could prioritize payments, and we'll say more on that later -- could pay the monthly costs of Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Pentagon vendors ($31.7 billion), interest on the debt ($29 billion), and unemployment benefits ($12.8 billion). Those categories total $172.7 billion. But doing so would mean delaying other payments -- for instance, Pell grants and other educational programs ($20.2 billion), salaries and benefits for federal employees ($14.2 billion), welfare and food programs ($9.3 billion), health and human services grants ($8.1 billion), housing assistance ($6.7 billion), and many other programs, including military active duty pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs program ($2.9 billion), Department of Justice funding that includes the FBI and federal courts ($1.4 billion) and IRS refunds ($3.9 billion). If the government could prioritize payments to creditors it deemed most important -- bondholders, say, or Social Security beneficiaries -- it could be a viable stopgap, at least for the favored creditors. But does the government have the power to prioritize whom it pays? The answer is somewhat in dispute. Here's how CRS describes it: "Some have argued that prioritization of payments can be used by Treasury to avoid a default on federal obligations by paying interest on outstanding debt before other obligations," CRS wrote in a study published earlier this year. "Treasury officials have maintained that the department lacks formal legal authority to establish priorities to pay obligations, asserting, in effect, that each law obligating funds and authorizing expenditures stands on an equal footing. In other words, Treasury would have to make payments on obligations as they come due." But CRS added that this view contrasts with one expressed by the Government Accountability Office in 1985 (when the office, the auditing arm of Congress, was known as the General Accounting Office). The GAO found "no requirement" that Treasury pay its bills in a first-in, first-out fashion. "Treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States," the GAO concluded. Even if the government has the authority to prioritize payments such as Social Security checks, doing so would still entail some downsides, and some of these might be considered politically or practically untenable. Doing so merely kicks certain payments down the road, where they may accrue additional interest charges, worsening an already difficult fiscal climate. "A backlog of unpaid bills would continue to grow until the government collects more revenues or other sources of cash than its outlays," CRS wrote. "In some cases, delaying federal payments incurs interest penalties under some statutes such as the Prompt Payment Act, which directs the government to pay interest penalties to contractors if it does not pay them by the required payment date, and the Internal Revenue Code, which requires the government to pay interest penalties if tax refunds are delayed beyond a certain date." Even if payments to bondholders were prioritized, the bond market may still be spooked by the delays in other federal payments, risking harm to the nation's creditworthiness. "If the federal government were to prioritize payments on debt obligations above other obligations, it is not clear whether financial markets would find this distinction to be significant when deciding whether and how to invest in federal government Treasury securities," CRS wrote. CRS added, "if creditors lost this confidence, the federal government’s interest costs would likely increase substantially, and there would likely be broader disruptions to financial markets." Delaying certain payments, even while making others, could ripple through the economy and drag down already weak economic growth. "Removing a portion of government spending from the economy would leave behind significant economic effects and would have an effect on" gross domestic product, CRS wrote. There are also some specific technical challenges for shifting funding into and out of the Social Security Trust Fund, which our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker column looked into here. Most of the experts we interviewed agreed that the federal government, if push came to shove, could probably find a way to prioritize Social Security or other payments, though none expressed absolute certainty. However, most of the experts also acknowledged practical challenges of using such tactics. While he thinks the GAO's green light for payment prioritization carries significant weight, Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute added that "with so much being borrowed, it is hard simply to pick on a few programs" to continue in the face of a debt ceiling impasse. Ronald M. Levin, a professor at the Washington University School of Law said, "I interpret the president to be saying, 'Stopping Social Security checks would be hugely costly, but other curtailments would also be hugely costly. ... Something will have to give, and I cannot responsibly guarantee that it won’t be Social Security.' That is not quite what he said, but to my mind it’s close." Where does this leave us? The critics likely have a point when they say Obama is playing up the risk to the most sympathetic potential victims -- Social Security recipients, 23 percent of whom live in households that depend on the retirement system for 90 percent or more of their income. While it's not a certainty that the Obama administration could prioritize cutting checks to seniors, there's a reasonable shot that the administration could do it. On the other hand, doing so would likely cause a lot of collateral damage to other American creditors, federal workers, students, Pentagon vendors and countless others -- and could also hamper the broader economy at a particularly sensitive time. The president is probably justified in saying that the possibility of an un-raised debt ceiling jeopardizes Social Security checks -- after all, it hasn't happened before, so no one knows for sure. But we also think the president probably has tools at his disposal to avoid the worst-case scenario for seniors that he expresses concern about. Acknowledging that there are a lot of uncertainties, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-07-13T18:26:51	2011-07-12	['None']
pomt-13160	Says drug dealers have "overdosed on purpose" to avoid prosecution.	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/28/chris-sununu/chris-sununu-says-nh-law-protects-drug-dealers-pro/	New Hampshire has a big problem with heroin and opioids -- the state is on track to hit over 480 overdose deaths in 2016 and currently ranks third nationwide for per-capita drug overdose deaths. Candidates up and down the ballot have explained their plans to deal with the crisis. Earlier this month, gubernatorial candidates Chris Sununu, a Republican from Newfields, and Colin Van Ostern, a Democrat from Concord, were asked separately about their plans to tackle the heroin and fentanyl epidemic at a candidate forum in Manchester. Asked about law enforcement’s response to the drug crisis, Sununu gave a lengthy answer on New Hampshire’s Good Samaritan Law, which gives people suffering an overdose immunity from arrest if they call 911 for help. Sununu said the bill has had an unintended effect - making police unable to prosecute drug dealers. And the executive councilor went one step further, saying drug dealers have started overdosing on purpose because they know they won’t be prosecuted. "So what I’ve heard from police officers, police chiefs, they’ve said we’ve gone in and revived folks with Narcan, with 10 fingers of heroin on the table knowing that was going to kill somebody, and they could do nothing," Sununu said. "Those are well intended laws with massively unintended consequences." He went on. "Drug dealers have smartened up right away, they've overdosed on purpose. They're buying Narcan themselves and they've overdosed, they've called 911 so all the drugs they have in the house are now immune from prosecution." Narcan is an overdose reversal drug carried by first responders in the state. Also known by its generic name naloxone, the drug has been made available over the counter at pharmacies because the state’s heroin problem has grown so dire. PolitiFact decided to look into the matter. Are police rendered helpless when responding to a report of an overdose? Are drug dealers intentionally overdosing? The Good Samaritan Law was one of many new pieces of legislation dealing with the drug crisis that went into effect in 2015. Advocates who backed the bill in the New Hampshire legislature argued it would save more lives by allowing people to call for help without fear of arrest. However, the bill was opposed by some in law enforcement for fear it could make it more difficult to arrest low-level drug dealers. The law states that anyone asking for help during a drug overdose "shall not be arrested, prosecuted, or convicted for possessing, or having under his or her control, a controlled drug in violation." But the law only shields individuals from drug possession charges, not charges related to drug dealing. We reached out to Sununu’s campaign, which said he based the statement about drug dealers overdosing on purpose from conversations with "sheriffs, police chiefs, and other law enforcement officials" on the campaign trail. So we called a few of the people Sununu said he’s been talking to. He is correct at least that some law enforcement officials are still concerned about the bill’s effects. Enfield Police Chief Richard Crate, the former president of the NH Chiefs of Police Association, says there was little evidence to show fewer people were calling for help during an overdose before the law was passed and removing the threat of arrest puts police at a disadvantage. "I think we’ve lost a valuable tool by being able to use the threat of prosecution and the threat of incarceration to keep people clean," he said. However, Crate said he is not aware of any drug dealers intentionally overdosing to try and avoid prosecution. We asked around to see if other departments had seen anyone intentionally overdosing to avoid prosecution. In Manchester, the state’s largest city, the police department’s drug unit was "not aware" of any intentional overdoses, said Lt. Brian O’Keefe. Police in Concord, the state's capital, and police in Laconia to the north, also said they had not seen anyone overdosing intentionally to gain immunity. Police in Nashua and the State Police Department did not respond. Even if a drug dealer did overdose on purpose to avoid prosecution, it wouldn’t work. If police respond to an overdose and find a significant amount of drugs, "we’re going to do an investigation regardless if the person overdosed on purpose," said Laconia police officer Eric Adams, the department’s prevention, enforcement and treatment coordinator and an advocate for the "good samaritan" law. While the law protects people who overdose with immunity from drug possession charges, it does not - as Sununu claims - give people with intent to distribute drugs protection from prosecution. A recent local case demonstrates this. On Sept. 30, Concord police responded to the Comfort Inn for a report of two people overdosing. Upon arrival, police treated the people with Narcan and observed hypodermic needles, a large amount of cash and multiple packages of pills. Police arrested both for possession with intent to distribute and seized 115 grams of methamphetamine. The law doesn’t prevent police from seizing drugs either, Concord Police Lt. Tim O’Malley said. "If we walk into living room and there’s heroin on the table, we’re going to seize that," O’Malley said. "We will not walk away from any kind of controlled substance." Our ruling Republican candidate for governor Chris Sununu said drug dealers have "overdosed on purpose" to avoid prosecution on drug charges. That’s not how the law works. New Hampshire’s "good samaritan" law shields people from drug possession charges if they call for help during an overdose. The law does not shield individuals from drug dealing charges and police can still investigate a crime and seize drugs when responding to an overdose. Police in various departments reported no instances of anyone intentionally overdosing to avoid drug charges. We rate the claim False.

pomt-15201	"We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-repeats-flawed-claim-about-us-healt/	Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is on a campaign for "Medicare for all" — or at least something like it. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who identifies as a socialist, told NBC’s Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd to look at how much the country spends compared to the rest of the world as a reason for a single-payer system. "We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country," Sanders said. It’s a striking claim, and one we heard from Sanders six years ago. We rated the claim False then, and it's still wrong now. We looked at data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), widely cited by experts as an authoritative source for this information. In 2007, the United States led the world in health care spending at $7,167 per capita, according to the OECD. Norway and Switzerland followed at $4,579 and $4,568, respectively. The United States maintained its spending lead in the years that followed. But Sanders puts the difference too strongly when he says U.S. spending is "almost twice" per capita of "any other country." According to the OECD’s most recent data, U.S. spending grew to $8,713 per capita in 2013. Switzerland and Norway came in second and third at $6,325 and $5,862 per capita, respectively. (The organization’s incomplete 2014 data set, which does not include the United States, shows no country spending over $6,500 per capita.) Had Sanders fine-tuned his talking point by claiming that the United States spends twice as much per capita as the average developed country, his statement would been accurate. Average per capita spending is less than $3,500 across the 32 countries listed in the OECD database. That’s 40 percent of what the United States spends per person. A spokesman for Sanders could not be reached for comment. Our ruling Sanders said that "we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country." The United States spends more on health care per capita than other countries, but not always twice as much. Sanders’ comment suggests the United States outpaces all other countries more than it actually does. European countries with extensive social service networks aren’t so far behind the United States. We rate his statement False.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-08-16T18:22:23	2015-08-16	['None']
pomt-13321	"In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights."	/missouri/statements/2016/oct/06/jason-kander/kander-supported-second-amendment-while-office/	In a September campaign TV spot that has gained national attention, Jason Kander assembles a military assault rifle while blindfolded. Kander, who is Missouri’s secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, puts together an AR-15 in 30 seconds. As he assembles the gun, he talks about how his opponent, Republican Roy Blunt, has attacked his record on guns Kander, a former Army captain, says "In the Army, I learned how to use and respect my rifle." He continues to say, "In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights," while supporting background checks to keep guns like the AR-15 "out of the hands of terrorists." Kander was a Missouri state representative for four years, from 2009 to 2012, before he was elected secretary of state. We wanted to know more about how Kander handled Second Amendment issues as a representative, so we decided to investigate his claim. Voting record We asked Kander’s campaign about his statement, and his staff sent us part of his voting record. In 2011, Kander voted in favor of a bill that would lower the age — from 23 to 21— at which a person could get a permit to conceal and carry a gun. Kander voted against the bill when the House first debated it, but switched for the final vote. The bill became law. In 2012, he voted to lower the conceal-and-carry age from 21 to 18 for military members. That bill also became law. That same year, Kander voted for a resolution that would amend the Missouri Constitution to protect "the right of every citizen to possess, purchase, reload, or manufacture ammunition and any other parts or articles essential to the proper functioning of arms." The resolution died in a Senate committee. But that’s only part of the story when it comes to Kander and gun legislation. The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund gave Kander an ‘F’ rating on his advocacy for the Second Amendment for 2016. It provided us with more information about Kander’s voting record. In 2009, Kander voted against a bill that would extend the Castle Doctrine to renters. The doctrine allows a homeowner to use deadly force against a perceived intruder. The bill also would have lowered the age to get a concealed carry permit and would remove a ban on carrying a gun on a college campus. Kander voted against the "Business Premises Safety Act" four times – once during each of his terms as a state representative. That bill would have prevented business owners from restricting people from lawfully possessing a firearm in a car on business property. Both the NRA and incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, Kander’s opponent, have released ads in response to Kander’s ad, denouncing his claim that he supports the Second Amendment. What the Supreme Court says about the Second Amendment So Kander did not support every effort to expand access to guns while serving in the state legislature. That doesn’t mean he is against Second Amendment rights. In a 2010 landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment prohibition against infringement on the right to "keep and bear arms" extends to state and local governments. But the court has also ruled in the 2008 case of District of Columbia v. Heller that some restrictions on guns are acceptable. In the Heller decision, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, made clear that while D.C. could not ban handguns, the Second Amendment is "not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose." He went on to say that some restrictions, like the prohibition of guns in churches and government buildings, were not affected by the court’s decision. Carrying a concealed weapon is also subject to regulation. Kander’s votes against expanding access to guns fall within the Supreme Court’s definition of allowable regulation of the Second Amendment. He has never proposed, or voted for, a bill that would repeal the Second Amendment or flout the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the amendment, our review found. Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law and well-known constitutional law expert, said in an email that analysis of Kander’s stance on the Second Amendment depends on two questions: "Does one believe that the Second Amendment protects a right to have guns?" and "Are particular regulations of guns desirable?" "Even if one believes in the Second Amendment right to have guns, that does not mean that every law to allow more access to guns should be regarded as a good thing," he said. "Someone could believe in the Second Amendment, but still support some restrictions on guns." Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in constitutional law, agreed. "The Supreme Court has only said that the right protects the right to have a handgun in the home," he said in an email. "So long as he did not vote to deny law-abiding people that right, then he can reasonably claim to be a supporter of the right to bear arms." Our ruling In a TV ad, Kander said, "In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights." As a state representative, Kander voted in favor of two bills, which are now law, that would lower the age for someone to conceal and carry a weapon. On the other hand, he also voted against several bills that would reduce regulations on guns. In short, his gun record is nuanced. Further, experts cautioned us not to draw a straight line between votes and gun legislation and support for the Second Amendment. It is possible to support the Second Amendment and favor some regulation on guns. Even though he sometimes voted against bills to expand access to guns, it is fair for Kander to say he supported the Second Amendment as a legislator. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate Kander’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/05a77216-92bf-4df3-933b-6d093512c2a7	None	Jason Kander	None	None	None	2016-10-06T14:32:54	2016-09-15	['None']
pomt-05315	President Obama "promised" families making less than $250,000 a year would not see taxes go up, but "Obamacare raises 18 different taxes."	/florida/statements/2012/may/17/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-health-care-law-raises-taxes-1/	The conservative advocacy group Crossroads GPS has a new ad that says President Barack Obama has broken his campaign promises. The ad says, "President Obama’s agenda promised so much," then recounts several areas where it says Obama broke his promises. One those points is about taxes. The ad shows video of Obama saying, "If you are a family making less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes go up." The ad’s narrator says, "Broken: Obamacare raises 18 different taxes. … We need solutions, not just promises." The text on the screen says, "$503 billion between 2010 and 2019." We’ll be fact-checking the ad’s other claims in separate reports. Here, we’ll look at what the ad says about taxes. We should note that here at PolitiFact, we consider ourselves experts on the president’s campaign promises. Our Obameter tracks more than 500 campaign promises Obama made during the 2008 campaign, including many promises about taxes. The health care law and taxes The ad makes a sweeping claim about taxes that suggests broad increases. It says that the health care law raised 18 different taxes, citing an analysis from the Heritage Foundation. We know from our previous research on the law that it does in fact raise taxes. But when we looked at the issue in January 2011, we found only 13 measures that could reasonably be considered tax increases. (The other items were mostly new regulations.) Many of those taxes are aimed at health insurance companies, drug manufacturers, medical device makers or high earners, not people who make less than $250,000, as the ad says. (See our detailed list of taxes in the health care law.) When we looked at the list with the Crossroads statement in mind, we found only five taxes that might apply to individuals making less than $250,000. Those taxes include the following: • Higher federal excise taxes on tobacco. • A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. • Limiting the amount taxpayers can deposit in flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. For people who use the accounts, this could increase their taxable income. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • Raising the 7.5 percent adjusted gross income floor for the medical expenses deduction to 10 percent. People who would have qualified for the deduction this year would pay more. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided "Cadillac" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2018. There’s one other thing that may or may not be a tax, and it’s a biggie: the individual mandate. The mandate means that everyone has to have health insurance or pay a penalty; the Supreme Court is currently considering whether it's constitutional -- and whether it's a tax. We won’t take a side on this question here. The tax increases on tobacco and tanning services prompted us to give Obama a Promise Broken on our Obameter for his pledge that "no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase." But the statement from Crossroads is different. It makes the sweeping claim that the health care law raises 18 taxes on people who make less than $250,000 when in fact many of the taxes are on corporations and health care companies. Only a few of them are on individuals in that income range. Obama’s tax cuts for workers On the other side of the equation, though, Obama has cut taxes for many people of modest means. Obama pushed for small tax credits in the economic stimulus of 2009. The "Making Work Pay" tax credit amounted to about $400 per worker per year for two years. Then, in 2010, Obama hammered out a deal with Republicans for lower payroll taxes. That lowered them by 2 percent; with a maximum tax break of about $2,202 per year. Those tax cuts apply to all workers, while the health care tax hikes apply to more limited groups, such as smokers and indoor tanners. Our ruling The Crossroads ad says Obama "promised" families making less than $250,000 a year would not see taxes go up, but "Obamacare raises 18 different taxes." Obama has increased a few taxes -- on tobacco and tanning -- that hit people making less than $250,000. But he also gets credit for tax breaks for workers, most notably a payroll tax holiday that is still in effect. The Crossroads ad wrongly implies that people of modest means are getting hit with 18 tax increases because of the health care law. In fact, most of the taxes in the health care law are on high-income individuals or the health care industry. We rate their statement Mostly False.

pomt-03108	"Ninety-five percent of all the wages in Texas are above minimum wage."	/texas/statements/2013/sep/20/rick-perry/perry-claim-about-nearly-all-texas-workers-earning/	Assailed for Texas leading the nation in minimum-wage workers, Gov. Rick Perry shot back a statistic we hadn’t heard before. Perry, engaging with Stephanie Cutter, the from-the-left co-host of CNN’s Crossfire, said on the Sept. 18, 2013, edition of the show: "Ninety-five percent of all the wages in Texas are above minimum wage." We’re in gravy, baby! But is that so? By email, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed shared the calculations behind Perry’s statement. Nashed noted that according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, 452,000 Texas workers in 2012 earned the minimum wage or less, accounting for 7.5 percent of the state’s 6 million hourly workers over all. The Texas minimum wage equaled the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Nationwide, the bureau said, 4.7 percent of hourly workers earned the minimum wage or less. And those 452,000 minimum-wage Texas workers, Nashed said, accounted for 4.2 percent of the state’s total workforce, counting salaried workers and those paid on an hourly basis, of 10,879,800. The latter figure reflects the number of jobs held in Texas in 2012, according to the government’s payroll surveys. Nashed’s email continued: "This would tell us that roughly 95.8% of all Texas workers earn at or above minimum wage. And since this is our own analysis of the data, we prefer to round down to 95% to be cautious." By email, Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based bureau economist, did not quibble with the raw figures relied on by Perry. Then again, Abbot said by telephone that federal surveys of households and employers do not elicit detailed state wage data for employees paid by the week, the month or on other bases such as by the piece. Precisely, she said, the government’s household survey asks someone how much they’re paid only if the respondent says they are paid on an hourly basis. In 2012, Abbot said, the state’s 6 million hourly workers represented 57 percent of all wage and salary workers. So, what about the remaining workers? "Because we don’t have detail on wage levels for the non-hourly (workers)," Abbot said, "I really can’t tell you if any of those people are paid above or below the minimum wage." Still, she added, she assumes most non-hourly workers are paid more than the minimum wage. "I’m not saying that ‘95 percent’ is out of the realm of reason," Abbot said, just that "I can’t verify that." By phone, University of Texas economist Daniel Hamermesh told us that Perry’s methodology seems reasonable, though he agreed that because the bureau has no wage information from non-hourly workers, he said, "you can’t know for sure." Another factor, Hamermesh speculated, is that workers who are not legally authorized to live here may be underrepresented in the survey results; neither they nor their employers are likely to reveal extremely low pay rates, he said. Separately, political scientist Doug Hall of the Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute said by phone that while the bureau figures largely support Perry’s statement, any assumption that this means nearly every Texan is reasonably paid--or that low-income Texans are doing particularly well--deserves scrutiny. For instance, Hall said, the lowest 10th percentile of Texas workers--meaning those who earned less than 90 percent of the workforce--were paid an average $7.84 an hour in 2012, according to U.S. Census Bureau survey results analyzed by the institute. That average wage for workers at the 10th percentile placed Texas third-lowest in the nation, besting Arkansas ($7.80 an hour) and Louisiana ($7.71), according to the institute. Hall noted that Texas ranked better in 2000 (7th) and 1990 (12th). (See the state-by-state breakdown here.) Our ruling Perry said 95 percent "of all the wages in Texas are above minimum wage." That conclusion ties to 452,000 of the state’s nearly 10.9 million workers in 2012 being paid the minimum wage or less. But those numbers are incomplete, because the federal agency that analyzes such data doesn’t gauge how much any non-hourly workers are paid. It seems reasonable to speculate that most non-hourly workers earn more than the minimum wage, but it’s not an across-the-board certainty. We rate this statement as Mostly True.

pomt-07034	Says that in 2009, Jon Huntsman "said that the Recovery Act wasn't large enough and as governor he asked for $14.4 billion in federal stimulus funds. Now he's saying that he never supported it."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/03/richard-swett/former-us-rep-richard-swett-says-huntsman-flip-flo/	A week and a half ago, New Hampshire Democrats took aim at a former Republican governor they say has a deep history of flip-flopping. And no, it's not the one you think. Minutes after former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman officially launched his campaign for president, New Hampshire Democratic leaders took to the phones, accusing him of flip-flopping on key issues. Taking part in a New Hampshire Democratic Party conference call for political reporters, former U.S. Rep. Richard Swett criticized Huntsman for switching his stance on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the federal stimulus package. "Gov. Huntsman has left diplomacy for a reinvention tour that would make even Mitt Romney blush," Swett, a former ambassador to Denmark, said in the June 21, 2011, conference call. "In 2009, Huntsman said that the Recovery Act wasn't large enough and as governor he asked for $14.4 billion in federal stimulus funds. Now he's saying that he never supported it." So, is Huntsman backtracking? Or is Swett off base? To sort it out, we reviewed Huntsman's comments on the stimulus over the past two years. We used statements provided by the Democratic Party and the Huntsman campaign as well as some that we found in our own research. Together, they reveal that Huntsman was ready and willing to accept the federal money when it was made available, but that he has not retreated the way the Democrats claim. News accounts from the Salt Lake Tribune show that he requested more than $14 billion worth of stimulus funds for state projects, and he predicted the money would help create more than 124,000 jobs over the next five years, according to the Deseret Morning News. By October 1, 2009, six weeks after Huntsman left office, Utah had been awarded $1.5 billion in stimulus funds, and state officials had formally accepted $624 million during that time, according to the federal Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which tracks stimulus spending. But, even as he accepted the money, Huntsman expressed concerns over the $787 billion Recovery Act, including questions about the size of the bill (too small) and the amount of tax cuts (too few). Let’s go to the transcripts. Jan. 19, 2009, Huntsman to Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, supporting the stimulus for state projects: "Well, if stimulus money is going to be invested in the U.S. economy, why don't those dollars follow projects that are ready to go? "Our state has more shovel-ready projects than any state in America right now. And you’ve got to remember, we're now the fastest growing state in America, which surprises a lot of people. … "We need to electrify. We need to move toward renewable opportunities. We need highways. We need everything that the rest of the country is talking about, but we need it sooner because of the way in which we're growing demographically and economically." Feb. 24, 2009, to Cavuto, saying he would have opposed the stimulus because it was too small: "Well, if I were in Congress, I probably would not have voted in favor (of the Recovery Act), because it didn`t have enough stimulus and probably wasn`t big enough to begin with. "But it is where it is. And I`m not going to quibble with a 1 or 2 percent of the entire package. We are trying to make our states run. We are going to take receipt of it. And we are going to try to actually focus some of the unallocated money on our own stimulus ideas in our states that might create some of the industries of tomorrow." Feb. 24, 2009, to Politico.com’s Alexander Burns, questioning the lack of tax cuts: "I guess in hindsight we can all say that there were some fundamental flaws with (the bill). It probably wasn’t large enough and, number two, there probably wasn’t enough stimulus effect. For example, a payroll tax exemption or maybe even a cut in the corporate tax … for small and medium-sized businesses for three years, for example. "I’m not sure it’s the stimulus money that will necessarily allow the economy to recover … It will help to fortify our budgets, frankly, to ensure that there isn’t as much backsliding in the areas of education and healthcare, for example. But economic recovery must be earned. And it will be earned by entrepreneurs and it will be earned by small businesses. "The size of about a trillion dollars was floated by Mark Zandi, who’s a very respected economist. I tend to believe what he is saying about the size of the package, which didn’t necessarily hit the mark in terms of size." April 27, 2009, to 2009 Milken Institute Global Conference, calling the stimulus flawed but helpful: The stimulus has helped by "building our core capacity to attract brain power, and to build our industries of tomorrow around innovation. Even when times are bad, we've invested in engineering and our science and technology undertaking, and are reaching out to name brand universities around the country and try to steal talent, to put it very crassly. So building these core areas of innovation, which we're not throttling back on at all, and some of the stimulus dollars have, in fact, allowed us to kind of move forward. "(There’s) too little focus on meaningful and relevant infrastructure that would have enhanced our entire nation and our ability to compete, whether delivering products or getting people from point A to point B. In other words, the overall enhancement of needed infrastructure in our country, which is desperately needed, so maybe you have 25 percent infrastructure, 75 percent all other categories. It should have been reversed in my mind, so that coming out of the stimulus phase, we actually could have maybe achieved a better, stronger, more 21st century infrastructure in our country. So that is my one gripe. There wasn't vision and direction in terms of where those dollars went. "Stimulus, to be sure, that was needed. We needed to sort of kick start the economy and infuse it with some liquidity. It was the targeted end points that I would sort of question, and whether or not that was done in a way that, longer term, will be meaningful for our citizens." May 19, 2011, to ABC’s George Stephanopolous, reflecting on his past criticisms of stimulus: "My take was, let's stimulate business. Let's look at tax cuts, let's look at payroll tax deductions. If you read on in the (2009) interview, that's exactly what I said. But more than that, George, a specific focus as opposed to just giving dollars to states. And let's face it, every governor took it. "Mark Sanford in South Carolina was the only one who stood up and said, ‘I'm not going to take it,’ and in the end, he ended up taking it too. We as governors, our states, we all make contributions to Washington. And when stimulus dollars are coming back, you ultimately found that every governor took those dollars. "(There’s) a regret that it was not properly focused around that, which would really stimulate the economy, tax cuts, and it was not focused around enhancing our infrastructure, and preparing ourselves for the future." Our ruling Huntsman's comments on the stimulus have been all over the map. He said from the start he would have voted against it -- because it wasn't big enough -- and then he's offered different explanations that have emphasized the need for more infrastructure spending or more tax cuts. Swett was right in saying that Huntsman requested $14 billion in stimulus funds, and that he offered his support for a figure even larger -- $1 trillion. But Swett's account is too one-sided. The record shows Huntsman has continued to raise questions about the stimulus all along, even as he accepted the money. We rate Swett’s statement Half True.

pomt-08620	Says Bill White "didn't pay taxes while earning $133,600 annual salary as deputy secretary of energy."	/texas/statements/2010/sep/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-bill-white-didnt-pay-taxes-1995/	Republican Gov. Rick Perry hasn't seen Democratic challenger Bill White's 1995 tax return. Even so, he says White didn't pay taxes that year. "Bill White hiding his taxes because he didn't pay them," says the headline on a Sept. 7 news release from Perry's campaign. That's followed by this header: "Liberal trial lawyer didn't pay taxes while earning $133,600 annual salary as deputy (U.S.) secretary of energy." Perry's press release did not say what kind of taxes he meant, though we suspect most observers would conclude that he is referring to White not paying federal income taxes that year. Perry said as much as we wrapped up our research on this topic, telling San Antonio's KTSA-550 AM last week that White "didn't pay any income tax in 1995." We believe that dramatic charge is impossible to independently prove or disprove without access to the relevant White tax return. Later that day, White told the station: "I served part of the year in the federal government. I paid income tax; there was withholding. And the other half of the year, when I was out of government, I lost money in my business with a self-employed business and so then I got a refund." Some background: White's tax returns have proved a Perry talking point. While White has released returns from his mayoral tenure (2004-09), Perry said he would not agree to a debate until he made public his tax returns from when he was deputy energy secretary in President Bill Clinton's administration (1993-95) and chairman of the Texas Democratic Party (1995-98). That didn't happen. In his Sept. 7 press release, Perry says White's 1995 tax obligation was "uncovered" in an Aug. 14 Dallas Morning News article citing information from White's campaign that he reported "no taxable income for 1995." Katy Bacon, White's campaign spokeswoman, declined to share the candidate's 1995 tax return or grant us an interview with White's accountant. But to counter Perry's charge that White paid no taxes while earning his federal pay in 1995, she sent us figures that she said White's camp gave the Dallas newspaper in August; they showed White's annual taxable income from 1993 through 1995 and his annual tax liability. For 1995, White's taxable income was listed as zero and his tax as $3,482. Katinka Podmaniczky, an Energy Department spokeswoman, confirmed that White's annual salary at the agency was $133,600. He resigned from the post in August 1995, according to White's 1995 federal financial disclosure report. Bacon told us in an e-mail that White grossed nearly $90,000 for his work at the department that year and that $21,568 in federal income taxes were withheld from his paycheck. He did not have another job in 1995 for which federal taxes were withheld, she said. "After he left Department of Energy, while starting a new business, his losses were such that he had no 'taxable income' and a refund of $24,186," Bacon said. (His refund was larger than the amount of taxes withheld, she said, because "he had also paid in estimated taxes and had rolled over an overpayment from 1994 that totalled $6,100.") She said the new business was White Acquisitions, which "pursued investments in oil and gas services and oil and gas." She told us that the firm was formed in September 1995 and dissolved on the last day of 1997. According to Bacon, White owned the company, there were no other investors and he was the "sole shareholder." Based solely on information from the White campaign, here's the tax math so far: Counting what he paid through withholding and estimated tax payments, plus his overpayment from 1994, White was credited with paying a total of $27,668 in income tax in 1995. His business losses the same year erased most of his tax liability, so he received a $24,186 refund. That left $3,482, which the federal government kept because he owed "household employment taxes ... on the income he paid to his employee," a housekeeper, Bacon said. Separately, we asked a tax policy expert whether it's possible to have no taxable income while still paying federal taxes on earnings. Sure, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. He told us that if White's taxable income was zero after all of his investment losses and other adjustments (exemptions, deductions, credits) were taken into account, his federal income tax liability would indeed have been zero. That would have produced a refund of income tax. However, Williams said, the vast majority of American workers also pay Medicare and Social Security taxes, commonly known as payroll taxes, which the government doesn't refund. If White paid those, "they are gone," Williams said. To address this aspect without handing over White's tax return, his campaign agreed to our suggestion that White ask the Energy Department to release all the taxes that were withheld from his pay in 1995. In an e-mail to the White campaign that was forwarded to us, the agency's payroll department listed $21,568.45 in federal income taxes, $3,794.40 in Social Security and $1,302.55 in Medicare taxes that were withheld from White's pay. (According to his 1995 tax return, Perry had $3,794 in Social Security and $1,121 in Medicare taxes withheld from the state salary he received as state agriculture commissioner.) Now to the Truth-O-Meter: Perry's press release claimed that White "didn't pay taxes while earning $133,600 annual salary as deputy secretary of energy." Later, he said he was referring to income taxes. Regardless of what sort of taxes Perry meant, we confirmed that White was paying taxes — income, Medicare and Social Security — while he was making that salary during the first eight months of 1995. White said he got income taxes back after filing his tax return. Why? His business losses later that year largely offset the income taxes he had already paid through withholding, he said, leaving him with no taxable income in 1995. Is that the same as White paying no taxes that year while he did his federal job, as Perry says? We think not. We rate the statement False.

pomt-00323	"In 2017, the number of new business registrations in West Virginia grew nearly 11 percent (8,318 new businesses registered for the year). This comes off the heels of a 12 percent increase in new business registrations during 2016."	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/20/west-virginia-republican-party/business-registrations-are-wva-closures-high-too/	Has there been an increase in new businesses in West Virginia? The West Virginia Republican Party says so. On Sept. 4, the West Virginia GOP tweeted "In 2017, the number of new business registrations in West Virginia grew nearly 11 percent (8,318 new businesses registered for the year). This comes off the heels of a 12 percent increase in new business registrations during 2016." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet cited a news article in the Herald-Dispatch of Huntington, W.Va., that includes this information almost verbatim. The data comes from the Business Statistics Database maintained by the West Virginia Secretary of State’s office, and the office confirmed to PolitiFact the accuracy of the numbers in the tweet. Erin Timony, the office’s assistant communications director, said the numbers focus on limited liability companies and corporate business license registrations by county. Since other types of businesses are not included, the data does not encompass all new businesses in the state. Another point to note: The tweet cites business registrations, but not business closings. "The number of businesses that are ‘born’ and ‘die’ in a given year (would) provide a more accurate portrayal of business conditions overall," said Brian Lego, a research assistant professor of economic forecasting at West Virginia University. This data is compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, though data for both births and deaths is available only through the first quarter of 2017. Here’s a chart showing trends on business births and deaths in West Virginia. Quarters that saw more births than deaths are marked in blue, while quarters that saw deaths exceed births are marked in red: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com So, looked at from this perspective, 15 out of 17 of the last quarters have seen more business deaths than births in West Virginia. This doesn’t mean that the business registration data is wrong; rather, it just says that the tweet paints an incomplete picture. Our ruling The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, "In 2017, the number of new business registrations in West Virginia grew nearly 11 percent (8,318 new businesses registered for the year). This comes off the heels of a 12 percent increase in new business registrations during 2016." The data cited in the tweet is solid. However, it looks only at certain types of business births. Looking at data for both business births and deaths shows a less rosy picture for business creation in the state. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-00601	Says that during his eight years as Florida governor, "we created 1.3 million net new jobs -- more jobs created than Texas."	/florida/statements/2015/jun/03/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-13-million-jobs-were-created-florida/	At an event in Orlando attended by several GOP presidential contenders, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a likely Republican candidate, touted his state’s record on job creation during his tenure. "In Florida, during my eight years, we grew at 4.4 percent per year, and we created, together, many of the people in this room, by creating a better environment, we created 1.3 million net new jobs -- more jobs created than Texas, more jobs created than any state in country other than California, a state 2 1/2 times our size," Bush said. That’s a direct knock at one of his likely rivals in the presidential race -- former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who also spoke at the summit and is expected to announce his candidacy for president later this week. We decided to look at the number of jobs created in Florida and Texas, respectively, and how much credit Bush deserves for that. Bush was governor from January 1999 through January 2007; Perry was governor from late 2000 to early 2015. Net jobs in Florida vs. Texas Bush’s term in office was bookended by two periods of robust job growth -- 1998-2000 and 2004-06. The 2007 recession hit after he left office. Bush’s spokesman pointed to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for total, nonfarm, seasonally adjusted jobs. In Florida, there were about 6.7 million such jobs in December 1998 and 8 million in December 2006. That works out to about 1.3 million net new jobs. By comparison, in Texas, there were about 9.1 million jobs in December 1998 and 10.2 million jobs in December 2006. That works out to 1.1 million net new jobs. So during Bush’s two terms in office -- which, we’ll note, includes a period before Perry was governor -- the number of net new jobs in Florida was 186,800 higher than in Texas. Does Bush get credit for the job growth? Bush took a measure of credit during his speech. And on his PAC’s website, Bush also took credit for growth saying that "his limited-government approach helped unleash one of the most robust and dynamic economies in the nation, creating 1.3 million net new jobs ... ." Is that justified? We started by asking his spokesman if he could point to anything that Bush did to fuel that job growth. "Creating 1.3 million new jobs and leading the nation in job creation over your final five years in office doesn’t just happen by riding an economic wave," Matt Gorman said. "That takes strong, pro-growth economic policies like those put in place by Gov. Bush. He consistently improved Florida's business climate, including cutting taxes every year he was in office." PolitiFact has frequently noted that when it comes to the economy and jobs, assigning credit (or blame) for a given statistical accomplishment isn’t as clear cut as politicians would like voters to believe. Much has to do with timing: Bush was fortunate to have governed during some economically robust years. "It is very hard to measure how much credit Gov. Bush should get for the job creation in Florida during his eight years, since so many different factors affect a state's job creation," George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair said. Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, compared the state’s economy to an omelet with many ingredients going into the final product. Snaith said it’s "difficult to point to one specific ingredient as being responsible for the omelet itself. Florida’s economy performed very well during this time period, the economic omelet was quite tasty. Not all of the ingredients, however, originated in Tallahassee’s kitchen. Low interest rates and a global thirst for oil impacted these state’s economies but neither had any control of these important ingredients." Moody’s economist Kwame Donaldson added that in the early 2000s, Nevada and Arizona experienced a similar growth trajectory as Florida, suggesting that Bush’s policies were not singularly responsible for his state’s growth. (Arizona, for instance, had a Democratic governor for the second half of the period in question.) Construction fueled Florida’s job growth -- and then bust The experts added that it’s worth looking at what happened after Bush left office. Texas’ job growth during that time frame was also relatively strong – a 19.6 percent increase in Florida vs. a 12.5 percent increase in Texas. Both states were higher than the 7.6 percent for the country as a whole over that period, said David Cooper, an expert on state labor markets at the Economic Policy Institute. Construction employment in Florida grew by 46.6 percent over that time frame -- more than double the growth in Texas and the nation. Then, when the recession hit, the construction job market in Florida nosedived. As a result, "Florida’s job losses were much more severe than in Texas," Cooper said. "I am not sure that the job growth during Jeb Bush administration should be celebrated, because it was primarily fueled by a housing bubble that burst as Bush’s term was ending," said Donaldson of Moody’s. "Florida is still struggling to recover from this housing bust." Sinclair concurred. "Although it makes more sense for a governor to compare across states in order to somewhat control for national level events, it would also be fair for him to take some of the blame for the worse performance of Florida so soon after he left office if he wants to take credit for the good times," she said. Texas, by contrast, was not as hard hit because it had stronger bank regulation, meaning it didn’t have as many bad loans as Florida, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. As The Economist explained in 2010, "Texas has strict rules on home-equity lending, relative to other states, and this has helped to prevent ratios of loan size to home value from rising as high as they have elsewhere." Residential construction fell by about two thirds in Texas, but it collapsed by even more -- 85 percent -- in Florida, said Moody’s senior economist Chris Lafakis. "I certainly wouldn’t blame only Gov. Bush for Florida’s recession — there were many culpable parties that overlooked and underestimated the effect of horrific lending standards and bad mortgages — but Gov. Bush certainly didn’t prevent or mitigate the recession either," he said. "Vermont is an example where state policy restricted the housing boom but prevented the housing bust." It’s also worth noting that the sheer number of new jobs doesn’t say much about how well they paid, said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University economist who is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Texas and Florida are both places that get a big influx of migrants either from other states or immigrants from other countries and I think they drive a lot of job creation in both places, often low-wage job creation," Holzer said. Our ruling Bush said that during his eight years in office, "we created 1.3 million net new jobs, more jobs created than Texas." He got his numbers right, but it’s worth noting that no governor is solely, or even mostly, responsible for economic growth in their state -- and if he wants to take credit for the expansion on his watch, then he also needs to shoulder some of the blame for the bust that followed his departure from office. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-06-03T15:28:10	2015-06-02	['Texas']

pomt-14593	Americans "are working longer hours for low wages . . . and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/04/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-exaggerates-concentration-wealth-in/	Sen. Bernie Sanders repeated his ongoing theme that the rich have gotten richer and the United States needs to reverse income inequality during the Democratic president debate on Feb. 4 at the University of New Hampshire. "Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged," Sanders said. "They are working longer hours for low wages. They are worried about the future of their kids. And yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent," he said. "(That's) not what America is supposed to be about." PolitiFact has looked a couple of variations on his claims about wages, hours and income distribution. In the past, Sanders has said wages have gone down. He didn't make that claim Thursday night, perhaps because when we looked at data, we found that most reports concluded that wages have been flat since the 1970s. Instead, he characterized wages as low, a value judgement we won't quibble with. On the question of hours, we found mixed evidence that Americans are working longer during the week. The best data, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, show average weekly hours for production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector have actually declined a bit since the 1960s. The trend flattened out at the beginning of this century and took a temporary dip during the Great Recession, but broadly speaking the numbers don't support the longer hours claim. Gallup surveys have found that workers report working longer hours than what the BLS numbers show. However, historical data from those Gallup surveys reveal that there hasn't really been a change in the number of hours that full-time employees report working between 2001 to 2014. On the other hand, when the Brookings Institution looked at a small slice of the middle class -- the middle 10 percent of families -- they found an increase in hours worked among mothers who were toiling longer to maintain their family's standard of living. Finally, there are plenty of data showing that new income is becoming concentrated in the richest Americans, which is Sanders' overarching theme. The question is to what degree. Sanders said Thursday night and during recent interviews that it's "almost all" new income. A year ago, he was saying it was 99 percent. There's no handy-dandy, universally agreed-upon formula to calculate an exact amount, but the economist that Sanders has been relying on concluded in 2015 that the top 1 percent had accumulated 91 percent of the income gains made from 2009 to 2012. That would be "almost all." But when the analysis was updated in 2015, the estimate dropped to 58 percent, a ratio Sanders has publicly acknowledged. That may be just over most of the new income, but it’s far from "almost all." One important caveat: One economist we consulted told us that the calculation Sanders relies on, which looks at pre-tax income minus all government payments, uses a method that tends to make the rich look richer. Our ruling Sanders said Americans "are working longer hours for low wages ... and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent." The issues are whether Americans are working longer hours -- on average, they're not -- and whether "almost all" new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. A lot of it has, but not "almost all." If Sanders were to argue that a disproportionate amount of income and wealth is going to the very richest Americans, he'd be right on the money. But he's over-exaggerating. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-04T22:27:33	2016-02-04	['United_States']
pomt-14072	Under Donald Trump's tax plan, "the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/20/jennifer-shilling/top-01-would-be-big-winner-under-donald-trumps-tax/	For being Hillary Clinton surrogates, two Wisconsin lawmakers sounded rather like Bernie Sanders when they got on the phone with reporters to denounce Donald Trump’s tax plan. "For the billionaires, by the billionaires," state Rep. Cory Mason of Racine declared in the May 11, 2016 teleconference, which was arranged by Clinton’s Wisconsin campaign. Mason was joined by fellow Democrat Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, the Senate minority leader. Her attack was more specific. Shilling stated that with Trump’s plan, "the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined." Economic inequality has been a signature issue for Sanders, whose presidential campaign has kept Clinton from claiming the presumptive nominee title Trump has on the Republican side. When Sanders said in Madison that the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, we rated his claim Mostly True . Let's take a look at Shilling’s one-tenth of 1 percenters claim -- which, as we’ll see, was made at something of a moving target. The figures Standing in the lobby of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan in September 2015, Trump rolled out his tax reform plan -- which some analysts immediately saw as a boon for the wealthy. He proposed significant cuts across the board, PolitiFact National found, but the wealthiest would get the most in tax cuts. For the highest income earners, the top income tax rate would drop from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. When we asked about Shilling’s claim, Clinton’s Wisconsin campaign cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of two Washington, D.C. think tanks: the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. The analysis found that on average, under Trump’s plan, households at all income levels would receive tax cuts -- but the highest-income households would receive the largest cuts, both in dollars and as a percentage of income. More specific to Shilling’s claim: The highest-income 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- those who had an income of over $3.7 million in 2015 -- would get an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million in 2017. That same group would receive 18 percent of the tax reduction, while the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers would receive 16.4 percent of the reduction. At our request, the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice also did calculations, which came out nearly the same: The top 0.1 percent would get 17 percent of Trump's proposed tax cuts and the bottom 60 percent would get 13 percent of the cuts. To some extent, this isn’t a surprise, in that the wealthiest pay the lion’s share of income taxes. In a June 2015 report, the Tax Policy Center said the top 0.1 percent pay 21.1 percent of all individual income taxes and the bottom 60 percent pays 1.5 percent. Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, also ran the numbers and told us Shilling’s claim is accurate. But Cole noted that under Trump’s plan: -- People in the 40th to 60th percentiles have about 99 percent of their income tax liability removed. -- People in the 0 to 40th percentiles who paid positive income taxes have about 100 percent of their income tax liability removed. "So the reason Trump’s plan doesn’t cut middle-class income taxes by more than that is, well, you can’t cut middle-class income taxes by more than that," Cole said. So, the figures back Shilling. The thing is, shortly before she made her claim, Trump’s tax proposal was changing. Sort of. Maybe. Or was it? Trump’s equivocation In the three days prior, Trump said he might raise, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Then he indicated the wealthy would get tax cuts, but the cuts might be less than what is in his plan. And then Politico reported that Trump’s campaign had enlisted conservative economists to revise his plan, and that they were advising a top tax rate of 28 percent -- higher than the 25 percent in Trump’s proposal. All of which has caused some confusion as to what Trump would do with taxes. Nevertheless, by the time Shilling made her statement, Trump had not changed his tax proposal, which remained on his campaign website. (Indeed, for what it's worth, the day after Shilling’s claim, a Trump spokeswoman told the New York Times: "There are no changes being made to the plan.") Our rating Shilling said that under Trump's tax plan, "the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined." A report from a respected nonpartisan research group calculates that the 0.1 percent -- those making more than $3.7 million per year -- would receive 18 percent of the tax cuts under Trump’s proposal. The bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, meanwhile, would enjoy only 16.4 percent of the cuts. Another tax group found similar figures. Trump has indicated he might make alter his tax proposal, but he hadn’t as of when Shilling made her statement -- so we rate the statement True.

pomt-05035	Says New Jersey’s tenure law "has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/12/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-state-reformed-its-tenure-law-/	Gov. Chris Christie didn’t get everything he had proposed from a tenure reform bill the state Legislature passed recently. But the Republican governor told a national audience this week teachers will lose tenure after receiving negative evaluations, one element of his education reform plan. That’d be a win for the governor, if it were true. But it’s not that simple. Christie said after the New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, spent two years campaigning against his tenure reform proposals, they finally "came to the table. And we negotiated New Jersey's tenure law, which is over 100 years old, the oldest tenure law for K to 12 education in the country, has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure," Christie said during a July 9 speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. "We're putting accountability back into the system." PolitiFact New Jersey found teachers who receive negative evaluations may be fired, but under the legislation -- passed by both houses of the Legislature on June 25 but not yet signed by the governor -- teachers still have the right to appeal, the core job protection afforded by tenure. Christie has described tenure as a job for life, but a process through which districts can fire teachers has always existed. Critics, however, argue the system is so costly and time-consuming that it deters districts from using it except in extreme cases of misconduct. State law says tenured teachers cannot have their pay reduced or be fired except for inefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct or other just cause, and then only after a hearing. That does not change with the new legislation. Tenure charges are still subject to a hearing, though the process has been overhauled in an effort to make it easier to dismiss teachers. Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie, said the governor "did not go into full detail and, for the sake of brevity in a speech, merely abbreviated the process which clears the way for revocation of tenure." "This is a sea change in the law," Drewniak said. "Prior to the tenure bill, teachers could be removed for only a handful of reasons in a process that was massively expensive for school districts and ridiculously time consuming. For the first time, there is a statewide evaluation system that can be used to remove poor-performing teachers through a more streamlined process." The legislation creates an evaluation system with four possible ratings: ineffective, partially effective, effective and highly effective. Superintendents will be required to file a charge of inefficiency against a teacher who receives either two consecutive ineffective ratings or a partially effective rating and then an ineffective rating the next year. Superintendents, under exceptional circumstances, may defer filing tenure charges for a year against a teacher who receives two consecutive partially effective ratings or an ineffective rating and then a partially effective rating the next year. But the charges must be filed if the teacher does not receive a positive evaluation the next year. Still, tenured teachers facing a charge of inefficiency maintain the right to dispute those charges with a third-party, though the process has been changed. For instance, arbitrators, rather than administrative law judges, will now hear cases involving tenure charges. We can’t know now whether that process will definitely make firing inefficient teachers easier, but what is clear is that tenure isn’t immediately revoked after two negative evaluations. Our ruling Christie said New Jersey’s teacher tenure law "has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure." For the large part, superintendents must file tenure charges against teachers who receive two consecutive negative ratings on annual evaluations. In those cases, teachers may ultimately be fired, but they don’t automatically lose their tenure and, therefore, maintain the right to appeal the charges levied against them.

pomt-10336	"Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/21/john-mccain/the-campaign-trail-leaves-little-time-for-hearings/	An ad for Sen. John McCain makes the case that Sen. Barack Obama is a foreign policy lightweight who has voted against funding for troops. "Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan," an announcer states. "He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops — positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working." See our story for details about the ad's other claims. Here we'll look at the statement on hearings about Afghanistan. The basis for McCain's attack here is that Obama serves on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and chairs the subcommittee on Europe. You might ask why the subcommittee on Europe should hold hearings on Afghanistan, which is in Central Asia. But we're familiar with this claim because Sen. Hillary Clinton made the same argument during a Democratic debate on Feb. 26, 2008. Obama "chairs the Subcommittee on Europe," Clinton said during the debate. "It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan." Obama responded then: "Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan." Back then, we talked to a spokesman for Sen. Richard Lugar, who served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee from 2003 to 2006, when Republicans controlled the Senate. Lugar's spokesman said something as major as NATO's role in Afghanistan would typically be held before the full Foreign Relations Committee, rather than Obama's European subcommittee. See our full item here. The committee is now chaired by Democratic Sen. Joe Biden, who has also said such hearings should happen before the full committee. And Sen. John Kerry has said that if it were to happen at the subcommittee level, it should go to his subcommittee on Near East and South and Central Asian Affairs. About a month after the debate exchange between Clinton and Obama, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened for an afternoon hearing with testimony on Iraq from Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus, which Obama attended. That morning, though, Obama chaired a full committee hearing on nominations for ambassadors to Europe, including Kurt Volker to be the U.S. permanent representative on the Council of NATO. During the hearing, Obama talked in some depth about NATO and Afghanistan. "Afghanistan, NATO's first major mission beyond the borders of Europe, has been overlooked and undermanned by many members of the alliance, including the United States," Obama said. "Success in Afghanistan, I believe, is critical to American national security and to the security of the entire world, and a failure there would not only endanger our nation and global stability, it would cast serious doubt on the ability of NATO's military and political architecture to uphold our security in the 21st century." When Clinton laid out her argument for why Obama should have held hearings, we found that she had her facts straight and gave her a True rating. McCain's ad, though, doesn't make the detailed case that Clinton did as to why Obama should have held hearings on Afghanistan in the first place. And in the months since Clinton made her claim, Obama did chair a meeting of the Foreign Relations committee in which Afghanistan was discussed at some length (though it arguably was not the primary reason for the meeting; the ambassadorships were). Taking all of this together, we find we have to lay out a number of explanations for McCain's statement on hearings, but in essence, he's right. Obama did not hold hearings that dealt directly with Afghanistan. We rate McCain's statement Mostly True.

pomt-00374	Says Joe Radinovich "was cited 30 times for not paying court fines."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/10/congressional-leadership-fund/joe-radinovich-no-stranger-traffic-court/	Do the crime (or petty misdemeanor), pay the fine. That’s an adage of justice. What to make, then, of a congressional candidate who’s cited more than 30 times with driving and parking violations but fails to pay in eight of those cases until the courts sic a collections agency on him? Minnesota’s Joe Radinovich says it was all an oversight, and a number of his tickets were a result of parking overtime in a meter zone -- not exactly high crimes -- although he’s also had a few speeding citations over the years. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to elect Republicans, says the behavior of Radinovich, a Democrat running for the open seat in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District, shows he is a "typical politician," one who will raise your taxes yet "refuses to pay his own bills." We went to the records. They show Radinovich, a former state representative now vying to represent the Iron Range district in the nation’s capital, has been something of a ticket scofflaw until recently. He had his driver’s license revoked for a time. And he only paid the state's collections agency for the last four of his outstanding fines recently, at $75 each, months after he was originally ticketed and right when those tickets and fines became fodder in the 2018 congressional race. The claim The claim against Radinovich arose when the Congressional Leadership Fund, a PAC allied with U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, put out a TV ad and news release on Aug. 17. An announcer in the ad says, "Joe Radinovich votes to raise our taxes, but refuses to pay his own bills. Radinovich voted for a $2 billion tax hike, hurting working families. But Radinovich was cited 30 times for not paying court fines. "And after refusing to pay his bills, Radinovich was turned over to a collection agency eight times." The tax part of the claim refers to Radinovichs vote in the Minnesota Legislature for an "Omnibus Tax Bill" in 2013, according to KSTP-TV in Minnesota. The bill raised income taxes on Minnesota's highest earners by $1.1 billion dollars but also raised cigarette and other tobacco taxes by $430 million, the TV station said. The bill closed $400 million worth of corporate tax loopholes and increased taxes on some estates by $80 million, the station said. As for the tickets, the Congressional Leadership Fund accessed Minnesota court records, which are available online. Those records show the date a citation is issued, the alleged offenses, the plea and disposition of the charges and the collection of a fine if one is issued. The Congressional Leadership Fund’s ad led KSTP to do a "Truth Test" on the claim. That Truth Test -- in which the station gave the Congressional Leadership Fund’s claim an A minus -- in turn led Radinovich’s Republican opponent in the congressional race, Pete Stauber, to issue his own statement on Aug. 23. Stauber said that Radinovich "won't even pay his own bills and take responsibility for his own actions." Radinovich’ response Radinovich responded quickly to the Minnesota media. "I reject that they're a character issue," the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party member said of the tickets and fines, according to an Aug. 23 story in the Duluth News Tribune. He called the issue "a headache," the newspaper reported, and said he would be more careful about it going forward. He also said he uses a post office box and does not get mail at his physical address in Ironton, Minn., which sometimes led to a delay in his receiving notices. "The vast majority of violations occurred in Hennepin County in the last several years, when Radinovich worked as an aide to onetime city councilor and current Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey," the News Tribune reported. "It was tough to avoid parking tickets sometimes," Radinovich said in the story. He said construction and a lack of other parking options forced him to use streetside meters, which would expire while he became preoccupied with the business of the day. What the record shows PolitiFact accessed the Minnesota state court system’s online records. The records showed 32 cases against Radinovich dating to 2004, when he was 18, most of them minor and all leading to convictions or findings of guilt. They included two cases in 2018, 12 in 2017 and one in 2016. Where the level of offense was listed, all were labeled as misdemeanors. Other details: Sixteen of the 32 cases involved parking meter violations. Four involved speeding, the most recent in July 2017 when records show Radinovich was accused of driving 69 mph in a 55 zone. A 2006 case showed a conviction for driving on a revoked license. The circumstances of the revocation were not detailed in the online record. In 2009, Radinovich was charged with speeding, accused of going 81 in a 65 mph zone. The records say the court requested a driver’s license suspension that October for failure to appear in court, and requested reinstatement of the license the following March when payment was made. The collections Eight of the cases wound up going to a collection agency after Radovich was late paying his fines, records show. That does not mean private bill collectors were on Radinovich’s tail, however, because the state courts switched in 2010 from using private collectors to using the Minnesota Department of Revenue, Kyle Christopherson, a communications specialist with the Minnesota Judicial Branch told PolitiFact. Every one of Radinovich’s collection matters therefore would have been handled by the revenue department. Of the underlying offenses in those collection matters, six were for parking overtime in a meter zone. One was for obstructing traffic with a vehicle. One was for a violation that was unspecified in the online docket but was related to a vehicle registration, permit or license plates. Radovich pleaded or was adjudicated guilty in each case case against him, whether it went to collections or not, the records show. Petty stuff? That’s what Radinovich suggested. The Duluth News Tribune quoted him as saying, "I take full responsibility for this. It's a series of petty misdemeanors and that's the extent of it." When contacted by PolitiFact, Radinovich's congressional campaign did not dispute the tickets and late payments. Campaign spokesman Bennett Smith said the earliest driving offenses are from when Radinovich, now 32, was a young man. Radinovich's mother was shot and killed in a family murder-suicide in 2004, according to Minnesota media reports. "Like many people in their late teens and early 20s, Joe has done a lot of growing up," Smith said. "He's matured and is a different person." As for the numerous parking offenses, Smith said the Republican-supporting PAC is "oversensationalizing his ability to find convenient parking when he was working for the mayor." Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund said Radinovich was cited 30 times for not paying court fines. Radinovich unquestionably did not pay a number of his traffic and parking fines when due. The 32-year-old was charged in 32 separate traffic or parking cases since he was 18. But a single case can involve one or more legal citations, and this is where the Congressional Leadership Fund’s characterization can get a bit tricky. The PAC said Radinovch was "cited 30 times for not paying court fines," but a "citation" can mean, in the legal sense, a ticket or a charge. Or it can mean a notation in the record. It is unquestionable that the Minnesota court records note Radinvich’s repeated failure to pay fines when due. That did not mean Radinovich faced 30 new misdemeanor charges strictly for failure to pay; rather, the PAC told PolitiFact that it used the word "cited" as a reference to court notations of Radinovich’s failure to pay on time, and these notations were not just in the cases sent for collection. With that caveat, we rate the Congressional Leadership Fund’s claim Mostly True.

Bush and Republicans for fiscal decisions of the past decade. But in some cases, the Democrats have gotten their facts wrong. In a speech on the Senate floor on June 24, 2010, Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island criticized the Bush Administration for squandering a federal surplus. "When George Bush took office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus," Whitehouse said. "It was returning more money to the federal government than we were spending. It was an annual budget in surplus. We had a national debt at the time, but with the annual budget in surplus, our Congressional Budget Office — the nonpartisan, not Republican, not Democratic, professional Congressional Budget Office — had estimated that, when George Bush took office, we would be a debt-free nation by 2009. We would be a debt-free nation by 2009. That was the trajectory that Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Democratic Congress left, along with those annual budget surpluses, when George Bush and the Republicans took office." We won't delve into the varying degrees of blame that Clinton and Bush deserve for the current deficit and debt in this item. But when Whitehouse says that "Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus," he's wrong. When Clinton handed over the reins to Bush, there was a Republican Congress, not a Democratic one. In fact, it wasn't even a close call: For the last six years of Clinton's term, the GOP had been in control of both the House and the Senate. We'll note that on the numbers, rather than the party labels, Whitehouse is correct. In 2000, Clinton's final year in office, the federal government ran a surplus of $236 billion. The following year, Bush's first as president, the surplus was $128 billion. That was the last time the government ran a surplus, at least as of now. In early 2001, the CBO did indeed predict surpluses as far as the eye could see -- enough to eliminate the debt by 2009, as Whitehouse said. When we contacted Whitehouse's office, a spokesman acknowledged that the statement could have been articulated more clearly, but added that the senator was referring to the 1993 Clinton budget, which was passed narrowly by a Democratic House and Senate with widespread Republican opposition. Many economists argue that this blueprint set the table for the budget surpluses of the 1990s. So we see where Whitehouse, who got elected to the Senate in 2006, is coming from with this explanation. But when we looked at the words he spoke on the Senate floor, we decided that they did not indicate he was referring to the 1993 budget. In cases where we think someone simply misspoke inadvertently, we give them leeway. And we'll credit Whitehouse for repeating the numbers accurately. But in this case, Whitehouse said the same mistake twice -- and it was crucial to the point he was making on assigning partisan blame. Any listener not intimately familiar with budget legislation from the 1990s would be led to believe that the Democrats controlled Congress when Bush became president. So even though the mistake was inadvertent, we think it's sufficiently noteworthy to call out Whitehouse. We rate his statement False.

pomt-00267	Says Tammy Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation "to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA, "later a veteran died" and Baldwin "covered it up."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/03/leah-vukmir/leah-vukmir-partially-accurate-faulting-tammy-bald/	On the campaign trail and in radio talk show interviews, Leah Vukmir has attacked U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin for months over the scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Tomah, Wis., where veterans were over prescribed opioid painkillers. But as the Nov. 6, 2018, election draws nearer, the Republican challenger’s attacks on the Democratic incumbent are reaching a crescendo. Vukmir hammered Baldwin again over the Tomah VA scandal on TV public affairs programs that aired Sept. 23, 2018 in Green Bay and in Madison. They were something of a prelude to a TV attack ad on the scandal that Vukmir aired three days later. So, let’s take a look at one of the attacks. Vukmir was asked on "Capital City Sunday" on WKOW-TV in Madison how she would have handled the Tomah VA matter differently. She responded by claiming that Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation "to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA, "later a veteran died" and Baldwin "covered it up." All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Let’s break down the three-part attack, starting with a quick review about what we know about Tomah. The scandal Problems at the Tomah VA first made news in January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. Doctors were handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place "Candy Land." The attacks on Baldwin began in early 2017 from a super PAC largely funded by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. The group claimed in a radio ad that Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about "overmedicated veterans," she made "deadly mistakes" and "three veterans died." We rated that False, based on how and when the deaths occurred and the "deadly mistakes" part of the claim. Now to Vukmir’s claim, which doesn’t go so far as to blame Baldwin for a death. 1. Baldwin ‘only one’ to have a report The first part of Vukmir’s claim is that, among the Wisconsin members of the U.S. House and Senate, only Baldwin received a report "outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA." The report was done by the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office of Inspector General following a 2½-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin’s office received it on Aug. 29, 2014. Baldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time. So, Baldwin had been informed about the problems at the Tomah VA before they were exposed publicly. And she doesn’t dispute that she was the first member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation to get the report. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. 2. ‘Later a veteran died’ Former Marine Jason Simcakoski died of a "mixed use toxicity" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol. Simcakoski death, however, occurred Aug. 30, 2014 — just one day after Baldwin received the VA inspector general’s report about Tomah that Vukmir highlights. So, it’s misleading to say "later a veteran died," given that Baldwin had not had time to act on the report. 3. Baldwin ‘covered it up’ The third part of Vukmir’s claim is that Baldwin "covered it up" — a reference to the entire Tomah VA matter, not solely to Simcakoski’s death. In the interview, Vukmir elaborates by saying Baldwin tried to "fire one of her aides that brought the issue forward, offering the aide "taxpayer hush money" and hiring "Hillary Clinton's attorneys" to "cover this up." Let’s break down these sub-points. An important point: It’s clear Baldwin did not take steps publicly on the scandal until the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose — months after she received the inspector general’s report and Simcakoski’s death. At the same time, there is no evidence that she took active steps to cover up the matter. Firing: Baldwin did fire an aide, but it’s not entirely clear she did so because the aide "brought the issue forward." In January 2015, after the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose, Baldwin had called for the VA to investigate Tomah but remained under fire for inaction on the scandal. Baldwin then fired Marquette Baylor, her deputy state director, without explanation, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed. Whistleblower and former Tomah VA employee Ryan Honl told the newspaper he had talked with Baylor for two hours in late November 2014 about the Tomah VA and that she discouraged him from going public with his concerns, saying that doing so might get her and others fired. Baylor later said she had prepared three memos on the Tomah situation for Baldwin's review and forwarded them to her supervisors; she alleged they were either not delivered to Baldwin or were ignored by Baldwin. ‘Hush money’, Clinton lawyer: Baldwin did offer a severance payment to the fired aide and did hire a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer. But this needs further explanation. As part of the firing, Baldwin's office offered a severance package to Baylor that would have included a confidentiality agreement and a payment, the Journal Sentinel reported. Attorney Marc Elias, who was the top lawyer in Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, was hired by Baldwin with campaign funds to review how her office handled the Tomah VA matter. He said the U.S. Senate's chief employment lawyer had helped put together the offer and described the confidentiality clause as routine. Baldwin later said the deal would have included a payment of about $17,000, which would have been from Senate funds. Baylor later rejected the offer and, according to Baldwin, sought more than four times that amount. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. Elias said Baylor’s handling of the Tomah VA matter was only one reason she was fired. ‘Cover up’: In addition to not releasing the inspector general report, Baldwin was slow to address the Tomah VA matter publicly. But ethics complaints filed against her alleging a cover up were found to have no merit. Baldwin avoided questions about the matter for weeks after the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose; and it took attorney Elias nearly a month to confirm Baylor’s firing. After being fired, Baylor filed an ethics complaint accusing Baldwin of engaging in a political cover up by firing her for her alleged role in the mishandling of a whistleblower complaint. The complaint asked the U.S. Senate Ethics Select Committee to investigate Baldwin. The committee dismissed Baylor’s complaint and two similar complaints filed by groups, saying they lacked merit. Our rating Vukmir says Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation "to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA, "later a veteran died" and Baldwin "covered it up." Baldwin was the only one, and she didn’t make the report public or go public with her concerns until the scandal made news. But she received the report only a day before the veteran died. On the cover up part of the claim, there was on inaction on Baldwin’s part -- not releasing the report, declining for weeks to answer questions and to confirm that she had fired a top aide. But there is no evidence Baldwin took active steps to cover up the matter, and a Senate committee determined that Baldwin had not engaged in a cover up. For a statement that contains elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-08186	"Oregon, once again, remains among the top five hungriest states in the nation."	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/27/oregon-food-bank/oregon-one-nations-most-food-insecure-states-it-am/	Oregon doesn’t have a stellar track record in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s annual report on hunger, or as the report refers to it, food insecurity. The state is routinely above the national average and, despite much research, experts still aren’t sure exactly how to go about reversing this trend or, for that matter, why it exists at all. Whatever the case, the trend continues, and as proof we have the most recent study from the USDA. We also have a press release from the Oregon Food Bank alerting us all to the realities detailed within the report. "Hunger in Oregon continued to hover far above the national average as the Great Recession battered Oregon’s economy, according to the 2009 hunger report released today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture." It continues: "Oregon, once again, remains among the top five hungriest states in the nation, as it was last year." There’s a pretty big tendency, whether you’re writing a press release or a news article, to take this sort of data and compare one state to the next. In fact, that tendency is so strong, that while we were looking into the Oregon Food Bank’s assertion that our state is "among the top five hungriest in the nation" we came upon at least three articles that went one further and called Oregon the third hungriest state. There was a column in The Oregonian, an article in The Statesman Journaland a short brief by The Associated Press. But rarely -- heck, never -- are statistics so simple. We decided to see whether the report really backed up these various assertions. We started with the Food Bank itself to see which information from the report it was using to back up the "among the top five" claim. Jean Kempe-Ware, the spokeswoman, pointed us to the table that shows the "prevalence of household-level food insecurity and very low food security by state" for 2007-2009. The report offers two numbers for each state. The first is the percent of households that are suffering from either low or very low food security. The second category focuses on just those households suffering very low food security. In previous years, that category, she said, had been described as "hungry." Kempe-Ware said she focused on that second category. If you rank the states from highest rate to lowest rate, Oregon winds up in third place at 6.6 percent or, to put it another way, ahead of 47 other states. Now, this is where the state media seem to have stopped. By this measurement, Oregon is the third highest for those feeling extremely food insecure. To her credit -- and in an effort to be better safe than sorry -- Kempe-Ware went one further than the journalists and also looked at whether the state’s position would change much if you considered Oregon’s margin of error of plus or minus 1.02 percent. If you apply each state’s margin, in either direction, at the same time, Oregon winds up in fifth place, ahead of 45 other states. (It’s important to note here that the margin of error varies by state depending on how many residents were surveyed and the state’s overall population.) Based on these numbers and some additional advice, Kempe-Ware said "among the top five" felt like a fair estimate to her. We can see why. But there’s a lot more happening in these numbers that is worth exploring. For starters, we wanted to take a look at the first category that includes not just very low food security but also low food security. If you look at that number, Oregon’s prevalence of food insecurity jumps to 13.9 percent, but it ranks at 18th highest, or, to put it more accurately, it comes in higher than 32 other states. Not great marks, but certainly better than third or fifth. That’s just the beginning, however. The rankings that we’ve outlined here are all suspect. Just because Oregon might be near the low side of its margin of error doesn’t mean all other states will be. Of course, there are national factors that would probably weigh on all states, but for statistical purposes, there are a lot of possible variations. Let’s go back to the Food Bank’s preferred "very low food security" level. Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that Oregon’s rate is the lowest statistically possible, meaning 5.58 percent (that’s the initial estimate of 6.6 percent minus the 1.02 percent margin), but all the other states are at the high end of their margin. Well, that would put Oregon higher than just 18 other states. Conversely, if Oregon’s rate were the highest possible and all other states were at their lowest, Oregon would rank the out and out hungriest. The take-away: Oregon can appear first or lower than 31 other states. If you use the first set of numbers (remember low and very low food security?) you get an equally perplexing range of 3rd to 43rd highest. For more input we turned to Mark Nord, one of the authors of the USDA report. He helped shed light on a few points. First, he said, it was pretty apparent that Oregon was among the nation’s leaders in very low food security. But, he said, "we kind of discourage ranking by indicating how large the margins of error are. What we try to emphasize is states that are above the national average and states that are below the national average." Oregon is above the national average. Mark Edwards, an associate professor of sociology at Oregon State University who has helped advise the Oregon Food Bank on this report and has also been tracking and looking into the causes of food insecurity in Oregon for the last decade, said much same. The numbers allow for a lot of leeway in all directions, Edwards agrees, but he still maintains that the report highlighted real problems with hunger in Oregon. As proof he pointed to past reports that have consistently showed Oregon near the top. "The fact that we repeatedly come out higher than other states convinces me that there's something unique going on in Oregon that's a problem." There are, naturally, other broader issues with the survey, according to its detractors. John Charles at the conservative-leaning Cascade Policy Institute said the study’s findings, which depend on the respondents’ subjective interpretations of various questions, offer little hard data. Instead, he said, the jobless rate might offer a better indication of how many individuals are struggling to get by. That number -- 10.5 percent -- and the food stamp rate -- one in five Oregonians -- also indicate a lot of people in Oregon who have trouble buying food. We can see why Kempe-Ware felt that "among the five hungriest" was a safe statement. We can even see why some journalists felt that "third highest" was appropriate (we might have been tempted to use the same language ourselves). There are some numbers here that would appear to back them up. And two experts agree that Oregon is on the high end of things -- certainly higher than the national average. Still, those same two experts discourage out-and-out rankings. Then there’s the fact that quite a bit of variation is possible no matter how you look at the numbers. For those reasons, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Oregon Food Bank	None	None	None	2010-11-27T06:00:00	2010-11-15	['None']

pomt-05519	Says "unemployment tripled" in Dane County due to Kathleen Falk’s tax policies	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/12/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-unemployment/	Enter the phrase "Madison liberal" into Google and up pop 17,000 hits. Many of those involve conservatives affixing that label to Kathleen Falk, the labor-backed Democrat seeking to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election. As the recall election became official, the pro-Walker Republican Governors Association got in on the action. In a TV ad by its political arm (Right Direction Wisconsin PAC), the group features a mock Internet search on Falk, who was the Dane County executive from April 1997 to April 2011. (It’s similar to the ad taking on Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, another Democratic candidate in the race, a claim we already evaluated) "Kathleen Falk is a longtime Madison politician," the narrator says as search results pop up. "Huh." "Backed by government employee unions. Oh boy." It continues: "She raised taxes every year she was county executive. Huuuuh. And under her watch, unemployment tripled. Oh oh." The narrator’s final words: "Typical liberal Madison politician. Raised taxes and lost jobs. Kathleen Falk for governor? I don’t think so." We previously rated True a claim by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch that Falk raised property taxes by millions of dollars every year and approved the second highest increase in the state in 2010. But what about the joblessness claim -- that unemployment tripled during her time? And that the blame for the rise falls solidly on Falk’s shoulders? The numbers Dane County’s low unemployment rate compared with the rest of Wisconsin is notable. The county’s rate is typically a couple percentage points or more lower than Wisconsin as a whole, thanks in part to state government and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show. Unemployment was at just 1.7 percent when Falk took office in April 1997, and in her first full month on the job dipped to 1.5 percent. It held mostly under 3 percent until 2002, hovered between 3 and 4 percent until 2009, then spiked up for almost two years before receding a bit as she left office in April 2011. Dane County was growing at the time and overall employment was up, but the labor market couldn’t keep up with those seeking work. When Falk stepped down, the unemployment rate was at 5.2 percent, compared to Wisconsin’s overall rate of 7.5. In sum, the county’s unemployment rate grew during her tenure. Did it triple? It more than tripled if you compare the rate in her first full month to her last full month. The same is true when comparing the raw number of unemployed at those two points. And the same is true if you use her partial month in April 1997 as the baseline. There’s still another way to get there: When unemployment reached 6.7 percent at its height during her term, that was well over three times higher than Dane County’s rate when she came in. So the RGA is solid on the numbers. Responsibility But beyond the numbers the ad asserts that Falk and her policies were directly responsible for the jump. In the ad, the narrator notes the increase happened "under her watch." A website the RGA PAC set up to accompany the ad makes a stronger cause-and-effect link: "With Kathleen Falk’s tax hikes, came higher unemployment, too." As noted, taxes did go up. And some economists link high taxation to limits on economic growth. But it’s a stretch to pin the ups and downs of the economy in Dane County solely on Falk alone, much less pinpoint her tax increases alone. The trends are the work of multiple forces at the local, state, national and global level. The two big spikes in unemployment during Falk’s time coincided with national recessions, the latest fueled by the global meltdown in housing and financial markets. And on taxes, Falk mostly held to a yearly tax hike tied to inflation plus population growth. Only 15 of the state’s 72 counties had a lower cumulative tax levy increase during the time she was exec, we found in an earlier item. In short, the RGA claim is accurate on the numbers, but misfires by tying Falk so closely to the unemployment rise. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-14097	"Big rooftop solar's plan forces Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar."	/nevada/statements/2016/may/13/solar-energy-fairness/solar-subsidy-claims-need-more-evidence/	A group backed by Nevada’s energy monopoly is airing television ads that aim to cast a shadow over the well-publicized complaints of the rooftop solar industry. Solar Energy Fairness (which is backed by NV Energy, the state’s electric service monopoly) is airing an ad throughout Nevada with a narrator warning that "big rooftop solar" is trying to trick consumers into supporting a "government-mandated subsidy with no limits." "Big rooftop solar's plan forces Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar," it warns. The rooftop solar battle has seen angry protests and everyone from presidential candidates to actor Mark Ruffalo speaking out on the issue, so we thought the subsidy question was one that needed to be answered. A primer on net metering The gist of the subsidies question centers around Nevada’s net-metering program. Like most states, Nevada has a net-metering law that allows ratepayers who install solar panels and microturbines to sell excess energy they generate for use by their neighbor. Lawmakers created the program in 1997 to encourage shifting more of the state’s energy production to renewable sources. Generally, the idea is that utility companies will buy excess energy at the retail rate, so the "seller" is charged only for their net energy use. The process is an incentive for customers to make the investment in solar energy to lower their power bills. Critics of net metering, however, say solar customers are getting an unfair advantage because they’re not paying for the network that harnesses and distributes electricity. And in 2015, Nevada’s Public Utilities Commission agreed. The regulatory group effectively lowered the amount of credits solar customers can receive after determining that net metering participants were receiving an unreasonable subsidy. That prompted a revolt from solar companies, who left the state in mass, laying off workers and fighting to reverse the commission’s ruling through the ballot. The evidence Solar Energy Fairness (the group behind the ad) claimed that net-metering participants in Southern Nevada received $623 in annual subsidies under the former plan. In Northern Nevada, the annual subsidy was $471, the group claimed. In explaining the regulatory change, the PUC said that net-metering participants see a cost shift, or subsidy, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars over an extended period of time. That cost-shift contradicted a 2015 Legislative directive to reduce any "unreasonable shifting of costs" from net-metering participants to other energy customers. But net-metering customers make up a tiny percentage of all energy customers in the state, so the commission’s highest estimate of a per-month subsidy for other power customers would be between $1-3 a month, depending on inclusion of a rebate program. While the ad itself refers specifically to the net-metering program, it’s worth noting Nevada has previously subsidized rooftop solar installation to the tune of $225 million through a rebate program approved by the state Legislature. Arriving at a figure Determining the exact subsidy figure is complicated. Utility commissioners outlined 11 possible variables in their ruling to determine the value of the net metering. It included a broad range of possible costs and benefits, ranging from the avoided energy that would be needed to replace locally produced solar electricity, total grid capacity and the possible social and environmental boons. The sticking point for many is that the commission only used two of the 11 factors (reduced line losses and capacity) when determining the value of excess energy produced through net metering — the other nine were not used because they were difficult to quantify. Rooftop solar advocates, like Chandler Sherman of advocacy group Bring Back Solar, say omission of the other nine factors nullifies the subsidy argument entirely. "These are real tangible benefits," she said. "This is real dollars and cents the utility is saving." The problem is that arriving at a more balanced measurement of the full costs and benefits of net metering is really difficult. Devin Hartman, a former energy analyst with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote a policy brief criticizing the "utter lack of convincing evidence of cost-shifting" in the commission's report. But he acknowledged that actually putting down a dollar figure for some of the benefits can be speculative as well. Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and current director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group, said expanded rooftop solar penetration undermines the ability of utility commissions to set rates, and said the presumed benefits generally are outweighed by costs. "Solar is intermittent," he said. "You have to ignore it for purposes of planning capacity." Hartman told PolitiFact that the existence of a net-metering subsidy depends on variable market factors, but writing off all potential benefits likely leads to a flawed outcome. "Methodologically, you can come up with a better estimate than saying, ‘we just don’t have anything,’ " he said. "There was room for improvement, even though the task itself was very difficult." Another difficulty is the lack of standardized metrics used to measure potential net metering subsidies. A 2013 Rocky Mountain Institute study found many states overlap in their measurements of cost and benefits, but contain a "significant range of estimated value across studies." An independent analysis Both sides point to an independent analysis of Nevada’s net-metering program, done by Energy+Environmental Economics in July 2014 at the request of the commission. Rooftop solar advocates often refer to a section proclaiming a $36 million benefit for all consumers through net metering, but several factors in the study — like the price of solar per megawatt hour — have substantially changed since the report was issued in 2014. Still, it’s worth noting that study did not detect a major cost shift either way. Solar Energy Fairness spokeswoman Nicole Willis-Grimes said the Legislature has requested an update to the "E3" study, and Bring Back Solar’s Sherman says that SolarCity and non-profit group Natural Resources Defense Council are preparing their own study on the alleged cost-shift. Best estimates So what does all of this mean for the average energy customer who isn’t in the net-metering program? The subsidy figure used by Solar Energy Fairness likely represents the worst-case scenario, as it’s difficult to foretell the actual cost and benefits of the net metering program because so many factors have changed since the last independent report was filed in 2014. Though the assumed monthly subsidy cost is relatively small, Solar Energy Fairness spokeswoman Nicole Willis-Grimes notes that the number of net-metering applications skyrocketed in 2015 — going from around 6,000 participants between 1997 and June 2016 to more than 24,000 applications over the following six months. Our ruling A pro-NV Energy backed group is running ads claiming that "Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar." The net-metering subsidy question is complex and likely takes more than a 30-second television ad to explain in full. The root of the subsidy claim comes from a Public Utilities Commission decision that has been criticized for focusing too narrowly on the costs of the program.

pomt-10394	"I've supported every investigation (into Hurricane Katrina) and ways of finding out how – what caused the tragedy. I've met with people on the ground. I've met with the governor."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/11/john-mccain/with-two-notable-exceptions/	One of the ways Sen. John McCain is trying to put distance between himself and President Bush is by criticizing the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. But to pull it off, he's having to sidestep politically sensitive votes he took in 2005 and 2006 to limit Democrats' ability to investigate federal response to the disaster. At a press conference in Baton Rouge, La., on June 4, 2008, the presumptive Republican nominee was asked why he twice opposed creation of an independent commission to probe such issues as the government's role and the impact of the storm. McCain responded that he had backed every probe into the disaster. "I've supported every investigation (into Hurricane Katrina) and ways of finding out how — what caused the tragedy," McCain replied. "I've met with people on the ground. I've met with the governor." But McCain twice joined other Senate Republicans to beat back Democratic efforts led by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to launch an independent probe that could have embarrassed the administration. Those efforts came at a time of particularly bitter recriminations over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, while the White House was refusing to release certain documents or to make senior officials available for sworn testimony before Congress, citing the confidentiality of executive branch communications. In the GOP-controlled Senate, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee had launched a probe of the federal role in hurricane preparedness and its response. Republican leaders expressed faith in the bipartisan investigation and derided Democratic efforts to charter an independent commission to conduct a parallel inquiry. An aide to then-Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., called amendments to establish an independent Katrina commission "taxpayer-funded flatulence that would just waste time and money to distract from the inquiry already well under way in the Senate." On Sept. 14, 2005, McCain and 53 other Senate Republicans rejected an effort by Clinton to establish the commission by attaching an amendment to a spending bill. Republicans said the move violated Senate rules, by attempting to legislate policy via a spending bill. Less than five months later, on Feb. 2, 2006, McCain joined with 52 Senate Republicans in a vote to kill a Clinton effort to attach a similar amendment to a tax bill. The Republicans countered Clinton's proposal by offering to create a bipartisan congressional committee consisting of senators and representatives to examine the hurricane response, but Democrats rejected the idea. Sen. Barack Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee each pounced on McCain's gaffe, sending e-mails providing the dates and vote numbers of the two Senate votes. "John McCain seems perfectly comfortable misleading the American people rather than telling them the truth," said DNC spokeswoman Karen Finney. McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the Arizona senator was not familiar with the votes referenced in the question at the press conference, and was referring to his support for the Senate Homeland Security Committee investigation that was ongoing while Clinton offered her amendment. He issued a statement chastising Obama for launching "tired negative attacks." As for McCain's claim that he met with "people on the ground" and then-Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, his campaign would not provide information to back it up. But in March 2006, McCain was among the first senators to visit stricken districts of New Orleans, partly at the behest of the community activist group Women of the Storm, and he subsequently called for expanded funding to rebuild portions of the city. Media accounts of the visit state he was briefed by civic and business leaders and Army Corps of Engineers officials. Though there are no accounts of McCain and Blanco meeting, McCain and Louisiana state officials did consult on hurricane-related matters, such as in late 2006, when he was a player in unsuccessful House-Senate negotiations over a water resources bill that took up how much oversight to apply to future Army Corps of Engineers projects. McCain clearly showed empathy over the government's response to the disaster and the scope of the damage. But he overlooked his participation in two outright Senate rejections of Democratic efforts to establish an independent Katrina commission, so we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13103	Says "Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/04/americans-united-change/does-gop-wisconsin-sen-ron-johnson-call-social-sec/	Social Security is one of the most commonly used vehicles for attack ads in election campaigns. And the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, which will be decided Nov. 8, 2016, is no exception. Republican incumbent Ron Johnson said his Democratic challenger, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, "voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors" and "tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants." Our rating was Mostly False. Feingold did support a measure that increased taxes on Social Security benefits for higher-income seniors, not across the board, but did not try to give benefits to illegal immigrants. Mostly False was also our rating when the Wisconsin Democratic Party said Johnson "supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age" for Social Security. Johnson has said he is open to considering such proposals and he voted for a federal budget proposal that contained them. But voting for a federal budget proposal and its myriad programs isn’t an explicit show of support for cutting benefits and raising the retirement age for Social Security. (Go here to see all of our fact checks in the Johnson-Feingold race.) Now comes Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group that released an ad Oct. 26, 2016 that makes this claim: "Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program." We’ll check both parts. ‘Ponzi scheme’ During the U.S. Senate campaign in 2010, in which Johnson ousted Feingold, Johnson said Washington politicians "run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme" (a claim we rated Mostly False). A Ponzi scheme is illegal -- it’s an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors. Johnson has emphasized the pay-as-you-go nature of Social Security -- using taxes on today’s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans -- and decried the "raiding" of the Social Security trust fund. The claim from Americans United for Change, though, is that Johnson currently calls Social Security a Ponzi, not that it’s run like one. The Huffington Post reported that Johnson told a local Americans for Prosperity group in June 2016: "We’ve got to convince more of our fellow citizens that Social Security really is — and by the way, I was wrong when I said this in 2010, I said it’s a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes are illegal. So, Social Security is — it’s a legal Ponzi scheme." Johnson has also called Social Security a legal Ponzi scheme on other occasions during the current campaign. ‘Privatize the program’ The Huffington Post article said Johnson supported privatizing Social Security, but that the public wasn’t ready for the idea. He was quoted as saying: "Currently, politically, you can’t do it." The article didn’t say whether Johnson explained what sort of privatizing he would favor. Johnson’s campaign did not dispute the Huffington Post story, which the website said was based on a recording it obtained. The campaign told us Johnson is willing "to consider any serious proposal that would protect Social Security." In 2015, Johnson told a small of group of people he would "take a look" at a form of privatization, according to a video clip that was posted to YouTube. He said perhaps he would be open to raising taxes for Social Security if people could keep part of the funds rather than having them go to the Social Security fund. Johnson also said it "was a shame" that a privatization initiative from President George W. Bush wasn’t explored more fully. And that brings up an important point. The claim that Johnson "wants to privatize the program" could be taken to mean a complete privatization. But there is no indication he backs that. The Bush initiative amounted to partial privatization. It would have allowed younger workers to contribute portions of payroll taxes into government-approved private mutual fund accounts. Our rating Americans United for Change says: "Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program." Ponzi schemes are illegal. Johnson calls Social Security a legal Ponzi scheme to emphasize that it uses taxes on today’s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans. Johnson has expressed support for some form of privatization of Social Security, such as allowing individuals to invest some of their Social Security contributions, but it’s not clear that he backs complete privatization. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9edf489e-cf8b-41ad-b0f3-359c9ac03823	None	Americans United for Change	None	None	None	2016-11-04T19:11:47	2016-10-26	['None']

pomt-03076	Says Maggie Hassan is the only female governor in the country.	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/sep/27/nh-afl-cio/new-hampshire-afl-cio-says-maggie-hassan-only-fema/	New Hampshire voters made a splash in November 2012 by sending the country’s first all-female delegation to Congress. The state also elected Democrat Maggie Hassan as its governor. With women continuing to be underrepresented politics, the electoral sweep garnered national attention, including from political powerhouse EMILY’s List, which backs female candidates. EMILY’s List hosted its second "Madam President" town hall discussion in Manchester, N.H., on Friday, Sept. 27, 2013. Hassan was among the speakers at the event, which focused on promoting women candidates for political office, including the presidency. Coverage of the event quickly took to social media. "At Emily list event in manchester nh," reads a message posted to the NH AFL-CIO’s Twitter account on Friday morning, Sept. 27. "Gov Hassen (sic) address a gathering as only women governor in the country." People quickly took to Twitter to tweak the tweeter’s grammar — and also to challenge the assertion that Hassan stands alone as the only female governor in the country. So we decided to check into it. Hassan is actually one of five women who are currently serving as governors. She’s joined by Republicans Jan Brewer of Arizona, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Nikki Haley of South Carolina, and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Hassan is the only Democrat in the bunch -- and female governors are scarce. The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey has compiled a definitive history of the country’s female governors. The center determined that 35 women have served as governors in 26 states. The first state to elect a female governor was Wyoming, where voters put Nellie Tayloe Ross into office in 1924. Before that, the former Wyoming Territories also passed the first law in U.S. history explicitly granting women the right to vote. Wyoming went on to approve the first constitution in the world granting full voting rights to women in 1889. In New Hampshire, former state Senate President Vesta Roy holds the title of the first woman to serve as governor. Roy, a Republican, held the position for seven days after the death of Gov. Hugh Gallen in 1982. She was replaced a week later when Gov. John H. Sununu was sworn into office. The Granite State's first elected female governor was Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, who served from 1997-2003, and was later elected to the U.S. Senate. Arizona claims the title of the first state to elect four women to serve as governor. It was also the first state to elect two successive women governors. Throughout history, 20 Democratic women and 15 Republican women have served as governors. Before Hassan took office, the last two Democratic governors were Christine Gregoire, of Washington, and Beverly Perdue, of North Carolina, who both served until 2013. Hassan’s distinction as the country’s only Democratic female governor at the moment might have been the distinction the AFL-CIO was aiming for when it tweeted about Hassan’s speech at the event in Manchester. We placed a call to NH AFL-CIO headquarters to inquire about the source of their tweet. President Mark MacKenzie said he was responsible for publishing the information, and acknowledged the error. MacKenzie said he was attempting to summarize information from Hassan’s introduction. "I think I made a mistake," he said. "I’m new at tweeting, and so I was trying to tweet and listen and tweet and listen and take pictures." Our ruling The New Hampshire AFL-CIO stated that Gov. Hassan is the only female governor in the country. While Hassan is the only Democratic governor, she’s one of five women holding governorships around the country. While that’s still far from being representative of the gender balance in the country, Hassan isn’t the only female governor. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03640	South Carolina has a labor shortage, specifically in the meatpacking industry.	/georgia/statements/2013/may/03/lindsey-graham/graham-points-hard-fill-jobs-immigration-debate/	Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a member of the bipartisan Gang of Eight senators pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. Graham has repeatedly used his state’s labor issues to justify guest worker programs for low-skilled and agricultural workers. "Nobody wants to displace a willing American worker, but I can tell you in South Carolina there are certain jobs, like in the meatpacking industry, that as an employer you can advertise all day long every day of the week and you’re not going to get that workforce," Graham said during a February 2013 Senate hearing. The senator made similar comments to a South Carolina Rotary Club. "When you go to these meatpacking plants in Saluda (S.C.), harvesting the crops or servicing the hotels along the coast, you may not believe it, but it is true -- there is a shortage of labor in some parts of our economy, even though we have high unemployment," Graham said. We wanted to know whether Graham’s comments about a labor shortage in some areas were correct. South Carolina’s jobless rate is higher than the national rate. That state and Georgia’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March. The national rate was 7.6 percent. So why would jobs go unfilled? The issue may be one of wages, not workers, said Steve Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. "Real wages in meat/poultry processing have declined about 40 percent in the last 30 years. These are not the lowest-paying jobs, but they are nasty, not pleasant work," he said. "If the job pays dramatically less than it previously did, that means there is a wage issue and not a jobs issue." The national average hourly wage for slaughterers and meatpackers was $11.99 in May 2012. In South Carolina, the average hourly wage was $11.36. In 2010, the national hourly wage for the job was $11.55; South Carolina’s wage was $8.81. Because of the nature of the work and the pay, the jobs may not attract enough applicants, said Mark Grey, an anthropology professor and director of the Iowa Center for Immigrant Leadership and Integration. The nonprofit, nonpartisan center at the University of Northern Iowa notes that its programs incorporate "a strong appreciation for the critical role newcomers play" in the state’s economy. "(Meatpacking) wages have increased, but still at $16 per hour (on the high end), the job would probably not be appealing to anybody with any kind of education," he said. In Saluda County, S.C. -- the area mentioned by Graham -- the unemployment rate for residents with less than a high school diploma was 19.1 percent in 2011, the most recent federal data available. The rate dropped to 10.9 percent for high school graduates with no college. Statewide unemployment that year was 10.5 percent. To sum up, research shows that South Carolina’s unemployment is almost a full percentage point higher than the national average, and the rate for lower-educated residents is even higher. But in the meatpacking industry, the nature of the work and the wages often turn off many American workers, those on both sides of the immigration debate said. Graham said that there was a problem filling certain jobs, even amid high unemployment. But his statement lacks context about wages and conditions in the meatpacking industry.

pomt-05488	"We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/18/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-his-administration-has/	President Barack Obama touts his administration’s record holding trade partners accountable by drawing a contrast with President George W. Bush over China. "We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration," he said in an April 13, 2012, speech in Tampa, Fla., before a trip to Colombia. Here’s how he set it up: "Now, one of the ways that we've helped American business sell their products around the world is by calling out our competitors, making sure they're playing by the same rules. For example, we've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration. We just brought a new case last month. And we've set up a trade enforcement unit that's designed to investigate any questionable trade practices taking place anywhere in the world." It’s a claim he’s made before, published in the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times. We wondered, is it true? ‘The honeymoon’ We asked the White House for support for the president’s claim. Obama referred to cases brought against China before the World Trade Organization, said spokesman Matt Lehrich. The WTO is a group of more than 150 governments that sets and enforces international trade rules. Since the United States and China are both members, it’s a pivotal place they can go to settle disputes with one another. There are other important types of trade cases, such as anti-dumping cases brought before the U.S. International Trade Commission, but those are brought by private industry, said Peg O’Laughlin, public affairs officer for the ITC. Other kinds of enforcement cases include those brought under Section 301 or 201 of U.S. trade laws. They're rare now because, under WTO rules, the United States isn't supposed to regularly turn to that sort of unilateral action, said Paul Blustein, a trade expert with the Brookings Institution. So while there are a wide range of trade measures available, the experts we consulted said focusing on just WTO cases seemed reasonable. The Obama administration has brought six cases against China before the WTO in less than one term, while the Bush administration brought seven cases over two terms — thus, the claim "at nearly twice the rate." But there’s a distinction between the two presidencies, what we’ll call China’s "honeymoon." China joined the WTO in 2001, after Bush took office. At that point, member countries essentially gave China a grace period to follow the new rules. "Business was just rushing into China … those were good days," said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow for the Peterson Institute for International Economics who writes about U.S.-China trade and worked in the Carter and Ford administrations. "Nobody was wanting to bring cases in particular. (China) probably got more of a grace period than would normally be expected because of the business boom." The United States became the first country to file a trade case, over trade barriers against integrated circuits, in March 2004. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in 2004 that China had needed time to adjust its tax and regulatory policies to comply with WTO standards, but that after two years "the honeymoon" was over, according to Congressional Quarterly and other news organizations. The Obama administration, on the other hand, had no such delay — plus it could take advantage of work started under Bush to file a first case within six months of taking office. That’s not to say Democrats back in 2004 weren’t arguing the Bush administration could have acted sooner. "One case brought as a political talking point does not make up for the administration's failure to develop a China trade policy over the past three years," Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top-ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, was quoted as saying in Congressional Quarterly in 2004. "This is an open-and-shut case that the administration should have addressed years ago." A Bush-era deputy U.S. trade representative says Bush realistically had five years to bring cases against China — not seven. "The first year of China's membership was eaten up giving them a chance to prove compliance," said John Veroneau, who also worked in the Defense Department under President Bill Clinton. "The second year was eaten up jawboning about problems and preparing the facts and analysis to be able to bring a WTO case. At the beginning of the third year, we brought the first case." That changes the math, putting Bush’s rate of cases much closer to Obama’s. Rather than nearly two cases a year for Obama vs. about one for Bush, the comparison would be nearly two cases a year for Obama vs. about one and a half for Bush. Driving factors The trade policy of the president isn’t necessarily the largest factor driving the rate of trade cases, said Hufbauer, the expert with the Peterson Institute. Other considerations out of Obama’s control (and Bush’s) held greater sway, he said. • When the country has more trade, you’re going to have more cases. And trade with China has boomed over the decade. • The economic climate matters. While the government brings cases to the WTO, its staff relies on private companies to come forward with strong evidence of wrongdoing. That requires companies to be motivated to do the legwork. In boom times, there’s less motivation. An economic downturn makes a difference. "Private companies have been much more aggrieved in the last few years than the first few years." • China hasn’t been as welcoming. "It just isn't as friendly to companies as it was during the Bush administration," Hufbauer said. "That wasn't because of the Bush administration — but because of the times. … This is leading companies to see more of the downside." That means they’re more willing to spend time to help the government build trade cases. One piece of evidence that Obama’s administration has been deliberately more aggressive than Bush’s deals with use of safeguards under Section 421 of U.S. trade law, which will be allowed by the WTO through 2013. The section allows U.S. industries to request blocking particular imports from China to protect American companies. While the Bush administration refused several such requests, Obama approved one on tires. "There is a very sharp change in that," Hufbauer said. But the White House told us Obama’s statistic relied on WTO cases, not other types of trade measures, so we're basing our ruling on that measurement, which independent experts said was a good metric. Our ruling Obama said his administration has "brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration." Though the statistic takes into account the fact that China didn’t join the WTO until nearly a year into Bush’s term, it fails to acknowledge time for China after it joined to adjust to new WTO regulation. By contrast, Obama's administration could hit the ground running. The math still favors Obama, but not by as much as he claims. Also, there are several external factors that affect an administration's decision to pursue trade cases. Those are important details and context. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-02749	School children can earn higher grades by studying Islam under a new "nationwide Muslim outreach program" announced by President Barack Obama.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/16/blog-posting/viral-post-claims-barack-obama-has-begun-nationwid/	Several readers recently asked us to check a claim that’s been spreading widely through chain emails and on social media -- that the Obama administration is pursuing a "nationwide Muslim outreach program for children" in grades K through 12. Here’s some of the text that usually accompanies the claim: "At a press conference today, President Obama announced plans for the first ever federally funded Muslim outreach program. The program will be available nationwide for all elementary school students grade K-12 beginning February 1st, 2014. The program is designed to educate children about the fundamentals of the Muslim religion and Islamic belief. "President Obama spoke with reporters to explain why it is so important that these outreach programs exist. ‘The Muslim community deserves our full understanding and respect,’ Obama said. ‘We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. These folks are not all bad. In fact, most of them are hard-working citizens just like you and me. I encourage every student in America to participate in your school’s Muslim outreach program. Learn about the Muslim community, the beauty of the Sunnah and the magic of the Qur’an.’" The item cited "35-year-old Paul Horner, a teacher at Starks Elementary School in Louisiana," who purportedly told MSNBC that he is "excited about the new program," because "if Becky has a D+ in math she can take a three week after-school class on the Qur’an and would then have an A in Math. That’s a win-win for everyone!" It closed by urging any parents of students who "would like to volunteer and teach the Muslim religion" to "call the Nationwide Muslim Youth Outreach hotline at (202) 863-8500." This all sounded fishy to us, so we checked with the White House, which confirmed that no such press conference had ever happened. Nor was there any such program. We also rooted around the Internet and discovered that a portion of the text originated with an "article" in the National Report, a satire website. In fact, when we fact-checked the previous iteration of the claim from National Report in October 2013 -- that "Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month" -- we rated that Pants on Fire. This is only the latest example of satire passed off as truth on the Internet. We took a detailed look at the phenomenon here. The recently circulating item about the Muslim outreach program included some of the same language as the National Report item, but it was substantially rewritten. Not only was the topic somewhat different, but the quote from "Horner" was added, among other things. (The website of Starks High School in Starks, La., -- which includes students from K-12 -- does not include any staff member by that name.) In addition, the phone number listed as being for the "Nationwide Muslim Youth Outreach hotline" was actually the phone number of the Republican National Committee. RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski confirmed that the RNC had nothing to do with the piece. "We’ve gotten calls from people giving us a heads up about this. We didn’t have anything to do with this and are telling people as much when they call," she said. The furthest back we could trace the language was to a Dec. 7, 2013, post on the website Conservative Frontline. While the National Report acknowledges that its stories "are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report" and at one time included a disclaimer that that "all news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news," we could not find any indication that Conservative Frontline is designed to be a satire site.

pomt-11982	New York has "the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state."	/new-york/statements/2017/sep/29/edward-cox/new-york-has-most-people-leaving-other-states-coun/	New York state’s population declined last year for the first time in a decade. State Republican Chairman Edward F. Cox blames the drop on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Cuomo's economic policies make it hard for employers to add jobs, especially in upstate New York, so residents are leaving the state for better employment opportunities elsewhere, he said. "We have the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state," Cox said. Thirty other states also lost population to other states last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Is Cox right that New York state tops that list? Latest data New York state lost a net 191,367 residents to other states between July 2015 and July 2016, more than any other state. Where are they going? The most popular destination is Florida, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Almost 70,000 New York state residents moved to the Sunshine State in 2015. The second-most popular destination was New Jersey, which gained about 50,000 people from New York state. California ranked third with almost 37,000 people from New York. Brooklyn had the largest exodus from New York with a net 43,264 people moving from the borough to another state. Only three counties — Ontario, Saratoga, and Warren — had more people move in from another state than out. Since 2011 Last year was the worst year for domestic migration in New York state since at least 2011, the data shows. The state had a net loss of 90,342 people to other states between 2010 and 2011. That count has increased each year since, except for a short-lived dip in 2013. New York lost a net 846,669 people to other states between 2011 and 2016, more than any other state. Illinois recorded the second-highest outmigration in the country with a net loss of 540,166 residents. Again, Florida and New Jersey attracted the most New York residents. Almost 300,000 of them moved to Florida between 2011 and 2015. New Jersey ranked second, drawing about 225,000 people from New York state. Pennsylvania was the third most popular destination, with about 160,000 people migrating from New York state At the same time, New York state’s population has increased by 367,179 since 2010 thanks to almost 1.5 million births and migration from other countries. Migration rates Beyond raw counts, New York state has the biggest outmigration rate among the states if considering just domestic migration. Ten of every 1,000 New York state residents moved to another state in 2016. Illinois ranked second, with nine of every 1,000 residents in that state moving to another state. Governing magazine charted each state's migration rate -- the difference of in-migration and outmigration -- per 1,000 people in 2015-16, and it also included people coming and going from outside the country. New York state ranked fifth behind Illinois, Wyoming, North Dakota and Kansas. Our ruling Cox said New York has "the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state." By raw numbers alone, Cox is right. Census data shows more people are moving from New York state to other states than move from any other state. And the flow has become larger since 2011. Given that New York state has the nation's fourth-largest population, nearly 20 million, it's not surprising the numbers dwarf smaller states. But by proportion, and when including international migration, several other states have bigger outmigration rates. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05944	"Romneycare sent costs spiraling out of control" in Massachusetts, "hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets."	/florida/statements/2012/jan/26/winning-our-future/pro-gingrich-super-pac-blames-romneycare-spiraling/	Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are on the same side, says an ad from from a pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC. "Think you know Mitt? Think again," says the ad from Winning our Future, which is spending a reported $6 million on the air in Florida. The ad then makes the point that the health care law Romney signed when he was governor of Massachusetts in 2006 is much like the one President Obama signed in 2010. "When Mitt Romney invented government-run health care, Romney advisers helped Barack Obama write the disastrous Obamacare," a narrator says. "Romneycare sent costs spiraling out of control, hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets." Yes, Romney’s health plan is a lot like the plan Obama ushered into law. No, it’s not government-run health care. These are old talking points that we’ve fact-checked many times. Here, we wanted to look specifically at whether "Romneycare sent costs spiraling out of control, hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets." First, a little about the health care plans: Generally speaking, both laws leave in place the major insurance systems. There’s employer-provided insurance for workers and their families, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the very poor. Both laws require people to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." Both laws also seek to cover the uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to moderate-income people to buy insurance. Companies that don't offer insurance will typically pay penalties, with exceptions for small business. Massachusetts paid for the plan with some new state spending, but also with help from the federal government. In part because the Massachusetts plan is so similar to the national plan, health policy analysts have tracked the outcomes there closely and publish regular reports. In reviewing these reports, we found consensus that the high cost of health care is still a concern for Massachusetts. Also, more people have insurance in Massachusetts, so overall spending is up. But cost increases for individual households are largely due to the fact that health care costs have been rising across the country, regardless of the Massachusetts plan. We found little to suggest that the Massachusetts plan caused costs to go up more there than they did elsewhere. In an examination of the state’s health plan published in June 2011, the Boston Globe concluded that health care costs are on the rise in Massachusetts, just as they are elsewhere, but it’s not fair to blame the Romney plan for the trend. "Massachusetts does have the highest health care costs in the nation, but it owned this dubious distinction long before ‘Romneycare’ was born," the Globe said. Similarly, a January 2012 report in the scholarly journal Health Affairs concluded that affordability remained an issue for the state’s health care system. But the plan’s expansion of coverage also means that more people have insurance, and consumers have lower out-of-pocket expenses. "Going forward, the success of health reform under the Affordable Care Act in Massachusetts, and in other states, will depend on the ability of policy makers and stakeholders to come together to take on the considerable challenge of reining in health care costs," the report said. When we contacted the Romney campaign, they pointed us to statistics from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that showed while the cost of insurance has still been increasing in Massachusetts, it’s increasing more slowly than it did in the years before reform. We asked Winning Our Future for evidence to back up its claim, but we didn’t hear back. Our ruling The Massachusetts health plan expanded coverage to many people who didn’t have insurance before, and that did cost the state and federal government money. Also, consumers saw increases in their health care costs. But there’s little to show that the health plan Romney signed as governor caused the increased costs that affected household budgets. In recent years, health care costs have been rising around the country, and Massachusetts is not exempt. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04469	Gov. Nathan Deal "has taken at least $15,600 from the (Koch brothers), their businesses, and their employees."	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/09/patriot-majority-usa/group-attempts-link-deal-koch-brothers/	When it comes to the game of big-money politics, there are few competitors more influential than the Koch brothers -- and supporters of President Barack Obama don’t like the way they play. Charles and David Koch support libertarian and tea party principles of lower taxes and smaller government, using some of their vast wealth to back causes and candidates that often oppose the president’s policies. The Koch brothers, who own myriad businesses under the umbrella company Koch Industries, have a combined reported fortune of $35 billion. One group recently came to Georgia to ask Gov. Nathan Deal to denounce the Koch brothers for "funding laws like voting restrictions that hurt Georgians." Georgia is one of several states in recent years to pass laws requiring various forms of photo identification at the polls, to the dismay of civil rights groups and Democrats. "Deal has taken at least $15,600 from the Kochs, their businesses, and their employees," Patriot Majority USA, which describes itself as a bipartisan organization, wrote in the news release. The group held a news conference at the state Capitol on Oct. 1 as part of its national tour to push solutions that it says will encourage economic growth. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether this group had its numbers right and whether any context was missing. Patriot Majority USA describes itself as an organization hoping to empower all Americans. Its action plan includes providing more money for public schools, improving the nation’s roads and bridges, supporting the federal health care law’s provision that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance until the age of 26, and closing tax loopholes for special-interest groups. Efforts to reach Deal’s office for comment were unsuccessful. Deal spent $8 million during his successful 2010 campaign for governor. Christy Setzer, a media representative for the organization, sent us a weblink that listed five separate contributions to Deal from individuals it claims are employees who work for companies owned by the Koch brothers. One of the individuals mentioned was James S. Balloun, a longtime leading Atlanta businessman and civic leader. State records show Balloun has made campaign contributions to a number of prominent Republicans, including Casey Cagle, Karen Handel, Sam Olens and Sonny Perdue, as well as to Deal. Balloun was named a director of Georgia-Pacific in 1998. The company was purchased by Koch Industries in 2005. As Patriot Majority USA stated, Balloun made contributions of $5,000 and $2,500 to Deal in 2010, according to state campaign finance records. Balloun, however, listed himself as retired when those two contributions were made. Setzer acknowledged that Balloun retired as a Georgia-Pacific director well before he made the contributions to Deal. She said, though, that Balloun was no "run of the mill" employee and that "there has been speculation in various blogs that Balloun continues to carry water for G-P." The other contributions Patriot Majority USA mentioned came from Georgia-Pacific and donors who work at the company. Balloun said he has never met the Koch brothers and noted that he had retired from Georgia-Pacific when Koch Industries bought the company. Balloun said he was a supporter of Perdue, who was governor from 2003 to 2010. He felt Deal would govern with a similar approach, he said, so he gave money to the Deal campaign. As for Patriot Majority USA’s claim that Balloun continues to carry water for Georgia-Pacific, he said: "There’s speculation that the Earth is flat, too." PolitiFact Georgia also found some contributions made by Georgia-Pacific and at least one executive, Curley Dossman, to Democrats in Georgia, including former Attorney General Thurbert Baker and former state Sen. Dubose Porter. Those contributions totaled $2,000. So does that mean the Koch brothers support the policies of these two Democrats because of these contributions? To sum up, Patriot Majority USA says Deal accepted $15,600 in campaign contributions from businesses owned by the Koch brothers or employees who work for those companies. One of those employees cited had retired by the time he made two contributions to Deal totaling $7,500, nearly half of what Patriot Majority USA mentioned in its news release. The information in the release is not accurate. We rate it False.	None	Patriot Majority USA	None	None	None	2012-10-09T06:00:00	2012-09-30	['Nathan_Deal']
pomt-11285	Says the 2015 vote on the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act "was not a vote to deny access to the U.S."	/florida/statements/2018/apr/24/gwen-graham/did-gwen-graham-vote-favor-legislation-denying-res/	Gwen Graham’s opponents for Florida governor criticized her during the first Democratic debate over a past vote to put extra restrictions on Syrian refugees. Orlando-area businessman Chris King said the 2015 vote made it harder for Syrian refugees to come to this country (even though it never passed). Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum pointed out how former President Barack Obama was against the legislation. Graham, who served one term in Congress representing north Florida, said her vote on the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act would not have banned refugees from the country. "That vote was not a vote to deny access to the United States," Graham said April 18 in Tampa. "It was a vote that would only have certified the process that was in place." Given the pushback from her opponents, we wondered if Graham was right about the effect of the legislation. The SAFE Act did not explicitly deny refugees’ entry to the United States. However, Graham downplayed the new burden it would have placed on the processing of certain refugees that would have slowed the process, likely resulting in at least a pause in admissions. What did the the SAFE Act mean for refugees? The Republican-controlled U.S. House passed the SAFE Act (HR 4038) in response to the Nov. 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris that resulted in more than 130 deaths. The vote was 289-137. Forty-seven Democrats, including Graham, broke from the party and voted for the legislation. The bill never made it through the Senate. Supporters at the time said the bill would increase national security. "In light of new threats, we must strengthen our vetting process," Graham told reporters at the time. "We must be able to identify those who wish to do us harm, while continuing to offer a safe haven to those in need of refuge from war and persecution." But opponents including the Obama White House said the bill would in effect prevent Syrian immigrants from coming to the United States. The end of the statement by the White House indicated Obama would veto the bill if it made it to his desk. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So what would this legislation have really have meant for Syrian refugees? Under the existing requirements, experts said refugees experienced a processing time of 18 to 24 months in 2015. Refugees had to undergo a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, "cultural orientation" classes, and one final security clearance. The legislation would have added a layer of certification to the process that was in place. It would have required each refugee case to have the sign-off of three agency heads. Here’s a key portion of the text: "A covered alien may only be admitted to the United States after the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence, certifies to the appropriate Congressional Committees that the covered alien is not a threat to the security of the United States." Had this become law, it would have extended the waiting period for these applications. "To ask that we have my FBI director make personal guarantees would effectively grind the program to a halt," U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a news conference after the bill passed the House. So a more reasonable interpretation of this bill is that it would have slowed down or temporarily paused refugees from coming in to the United States. That is important context in understanding Graham’s defense. "The bill did not specify how the certification process would work, so DHS, the FBI, and the Office of the National Intelligence Director would be tasked with agreeing on standards—which could take months (and result in a pause)," said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a nonprofit organization that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees, agreed that nothing in the legislation stopped refugees from coming in. But he said the measure would have crippled the existing program. "Such a new security layer would have added a major bureaucratic hurdle without value, as it would largely be redundant to the existing (checks)," he said. The flow of Syrian refugees has decreased significantly since 2016 when the U.S. resettled more than 15,000, according to the Refugee Processing Center. In calendar year 2017, the country let in 3,024 refugees from Syria. So far this year, that number is just 11. A few days into his administration, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to indefinitely suspend the entry of Syrian refugees. A revised order in March 2017 suspended refugee entry for 120 days, but did not single out Syrian refugees for indefinite admission. Refugee admissions eventually resumed under "enhanced vetting." In September 2017, Trump also reduced the cap on refugees coming to the United States from anywhere in the world to 45,000. Our ruling Graham said her 2015 vote for the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act was "not a vote to deny access to the U.S." Graham’s take on the legislation requires some context. While it would not have prevented Syrian entry outright, it would have installed a significant new layer of bureaucracy that would have at least delayed their entry. The bill would have required the signature of three agency heads for each case, an extraordinary hurdle on top of previous requirements. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03270	"Obamacare … carries on even under a government shutdown."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/08/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-government-shutdown-wouldnt-sidelin/	Some congressional Republicans are threatening to deny funding for government operations unless a provision is included to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law. Because defunding Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment is a nonstarter for Democrats, lawmakers are now openly pondering the possibility of a government shutdown. Other Republicans -- including Paul Ryan, the party’s former vice presidential nominee -- are warning that a government shutdown is a bad idea and won’t work anyway. That was a point he made on the Aug. 4, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. "Obamacare is an entitlement like Medicare and Social Security is, and so the entitlement carries on even under a government shutdown scenario," said Ryan, who is also the House budget chairman. First, some background. Shutdowns occur when appropriations bills expire, and Congress and the president are at an impasse. A shutdown typically prevents federal agencies from carrying out any functions deemed non-essential. A shutdown last occurred in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. That led to two shutdowns -- one for five days in November 1995 and the other for 21 days from December 1995 to January 1996. Some government functions are not reliant on congressional appropriations, and these can usually continue unimpeded in the face of a shutdown. Several elements of the health care law fall into this category. Here’s a summary of some of the key provisions of the health care law and how they might be affected by shutdown. Insurance exchanges and premium subsidies Ryan referred to Obamacare being like such "entitlements" as Social Security and Medicare, which are not affected by shutdowns. An entitlement is a government program that is funded by a formula, rather than by the kinds of specific congressional appropriations that run out in a shutdown. Any American who meets the criteria for receiving the benefit will keep receiving payments even in the absence of congressional appropriations. The health care law creates online marketplaces where uninsured Americans can purchase health insurance, and it offers them means-tested subsidies to help pay the premiums for those plans. The subsidies fit the definition of an entitlement most directly. Because the subsidies are provided in the form of tax credits, they are not subject to appropriations, and thus should be able to proceed during a shutdown. As for the operations of the exchanges themselves, these too seem likely to be unaffected by a shutdown, although for a different reason. The independent Congressional Research Service has concluded that implementation of the insurance marketplace is being funded by long-term appropriations -- funding streams that won’t be cut off during a government shutdown. There’s one caveat, however: Delays could still occur if federal agencies have no workers, or too few, to carry out needed tasks. This has been an issue in the past with Social Security Administration employees. The agency’s operational employees are paid through appropriated funds. Would a shutdown prevent employees from going to work, potentially halting operations? A 1981 attorney general's opinion protects the right of at least some Social Security workers to carry out necessary functions -- and that’s essentially what happened during the 1995 shutdowns. According to Social Security's official history on its website, 4,780 employees remained at work at the start of the four-day shutdown, while the other 61,415 were furloughed. But this cut "significantly impacted the Agency’s service to the public," the account said, and on the second day, additional employees were recalled to work. The second shutdown -- which lasted three weeks, the longest in history -- could have brought even more severe consequences. But the agency deployed 55,000 employees and operations remained close to normal. Noting the past experience of Social Security, CRS wrote, "it may be reasonable to infer that any similar benefit programs" under the health care law would have enough administrative flexibility to keep operations going during a shutdown. In other words, there’s no guarantee, but it’s likely that operations will continue. Tax provisions In general, tax collection is not affected by a shutdown. Anyone who incurs taxes is still liable for paying them on a quarterly or annual basis, even if the IRS is in shutdown mode. In addition, exceptions exist for processing tax payments received during a shutdown. Some Obamacare taxes, such as those on branded pharmaceuticals, need to be calculated and assessed in writing by IRS before the manufacturer pays them, so these could be affected by a shutdown, according to the Congressional Research Service. But even if there’s a delay, the taxes will ultimately be paid, shutdown or not. This is true for the mandate on individuals to purchase health insurance; people who run afoul of this pay their penalty through their tax return. Regulations Many key aspects of the health care law are regulatory in nature -- for instance, rules about what insurers have to cover, how much insurers need to spend on health-related expenses and protections for patients with pre-existing conditions or those with young adult children. While these are all part of the health care law, a government shutdown wouldn’t really affect them. At most, enforcement efforts might lag during a shutdown, but the rules will remain on the books and will have to be respected. "At most, government enforcement activity might be put on hold, but after the shutdown people could be investigated and held liable for violations they committed during the shutdown period," said Ronald Levin, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. We will conclude by emphasizing the rarity of government shutdowns, and the absence of any that lasted any significant period of time. "It depends how long any shutdown goes on," said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "It's easy to be creative for a short period but harder after a while." Our ruling Ryan said that "Obamacare … carries on even under a government shutdown." For various reasons, most key parts of the law -- the insurance marketplace, the premium subsidies, and the taxes and regulations -- should continue unimpeded. But shutdowns are rare and unpredictable, so we can’t be entirely sure that there will be no major interruptions. We rate his claim Mostly True.

They are the bedrock of our defense industrial base."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/09/donald-trump/how-vital-our-national-security-are-steel-aluminum/	When President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, the stated reason was national security. "The president is exercising his authority to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports in order to protect our national security," the White House said in a statement. Specifically, the White House cited section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which it said "provides the president with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security." Hours before he officially announced the tariffs, Trump said he was "taking action to protect American industries that are vital to our national security, including American aluminum and steel. … Aluminum and steel are the backbone of our nation. They are the bedrock of our defense industrial base." Is Trump right that American aluminum and steel "are vital to our national security" and "the bedrock of our defense industrial base"? Dueling departments In an undated but recent memo, Defense Secretary James Mattis acknowledged concerns about "unfair trade practices," but he emphasized that "the U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum each only represent about 3 percent of U.S. production." In other words, domestic production in the United States is more than 30 times the amount required to satisfy Defense Department needs -- before having to use a single ton of imported steel. Defense’s share of the high-purity aluminum produced domestically is a bit higher -- 10 percent -- but here, too, this "is more than adequately met" by existing U.S. sources, according to the Aerospace Industries Association of America. The Pentagon’s small share of U.S. steel and aluminum output would seem to undercut the argument of national security as a credible justification for the tariffs. However, the decision to impose tariffs for steel and aluminum imports was made based on a different argument by the Commerce Department, which is headed by a longtime free-trade skeptic, Wilbur Ross. In a pair of January 2018 reports, the Commerce Department addressed the role of the American steel and aluminum industries in preserving national security. In both cases, the department said that action against imports was necessary. The department concluded that the present import situation was "weakening our internal economy," which it noted was language included in the 1962 law. Specifically, the law says: In the administration of this section, the director (of the Office of Emergency Planning) and the president shall further recognize the close relation of the economic welfare of the nation to our national security, and shall take into consideration the impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare of individual domestic industries; and any substantial unemployment, decrease in revenues of government, loss of skills or investment, or other serious effects resulting from the displacement of any domestic products by excessive imports shall be considered, without excluding other factors, in determining whether such weakening of our internal economy may impair the national security. The law offers a more expansive definition of national security than might be obvious on the surface. Both Commerce reports cite a variety of elements of "national security" that fall well beyond the scope of military activities. National security, according to the steel report, "encompasses U.S. critical infrastructure sectors including transportation systems, the electric power grid, water systems, and energy generation systems." Similarly, the aluminum report cites "critical infrastructure sectors that are central to the essential operations of the U.S. economy and government, including power transmissions, transportation systems, manufacturing industries, construction, and others." Keeping a viable industrial base Wayne Ranick, spokesman for the United Steelworkers labor union, said he has no quarrel with the Defense Department’s 3 percent calculation. However, he argued -- as the Commerce Department did -- that "to sustain that 3 percent, there must be viable U.S. aluminum and steel mills." Ongoing viability, Ranick said, requires operating at 80 percent capacity. "Mills that have so few orders that they must operate at less than 80 percent capacity shut down sections, lay off workers and lose money," he said. "When too much money is lost, the company goes bankrupt and the mill closes." He pointed to findings by the Commerce Department that there’s only one company left in the United States that produces the Navy armor plate used to build the Virginia Class Submarines, and that only one smelter produces the high-purity aluminum required for defense aerospace needs. Skeptics, however, see this argument as industry concerns masquerading as national security concerns. "Steel and aluminum are widely traded commodities in international markets, and the U.S. has ample production capacity to satisfy its defense needs," said Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which generally has a free-trade bent. "The case for tariffs made by the Commerce Department is that other countries underprice steel and aluminum, hurting U.S. production. This is not a national security argument." Impacts not considered Critics of the tariffs say they can cause at least as many national security headaches as they solve. For instance, the tariff issue has already irked U.S. allies whose assistance is needed in countless military and diplomatic situations across the globe. Those allies also tend to be valued customers for the U.S. defense sector, which has a sizable trade surplus with the rest of the world. "When relations overall are good, we export quite a lot of military equipment to allies and partners," said Remy Nathan, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association. Because a lot of that business come from maintenance, repair and spare parts of U.S.-made military items, this is "the gift that keeps on giving." There’s also a concern that the tariffs could kick off a global trade war, with unknown but potentially significant impacts on the availability of other inputs needed by the U.S. military, not to mention the economy at large. A Bloomberg article noted that access to solid rocket fuel is a commodity that should be much more worrisome for the United States than either steel or aluminum. In the meantime, the decision to justify the tariffs based on national security could embolden other countries to impose trade barriers of their own on the basis of "national security," with negative impacts for the United States. In addition, while the tariffs would likely aid domestic producers of aluminum and steel, they would presumably raise prices for companies that turn those raw materials into finished products, and this could hurt national security as well. This is especially acute for companies that sell both to private sector companies and the Pentagon, Nathan said. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said that American aluminum and steel "are vital to our national security. ... They are the bedrock of our defense industrial base." Military purchases account for a small fraction of U.S. production for both metals, to say nothing of foreign imports. Critics add that the tariffs could have negative impacts on national security that aren’t taken into account by the White House or Commerce Department. Bolstering Trump’s point, however, the 1962 law used as justification for the tariffs specifically allows a more expansive definition that adds far-reaching critical infrastructure to specific military activities.

pomt-02852	Medicare Part D "was far more expensive than the Affordable Care Act and unlike" the act, "was never budgeted."	/texas/statements/2013/nov/18/facebook-posts/obamacare-law-was-funded-and-expected-save-billion/	"Obamacare? Expensive?" says a photo-quotation mashup that a reader sent us on Facebook. Beneath a photo of President George W. Bush making a face, the caption reads, "Bush’s Medicare D was far more expensive than the Affordable Care Act, and, unlike the ACA, was never budgeted." The Facebook-shared image is unattributed, but its caption tracks word-for-word with an Oct. 18, 2013, tweet and blog post by writer and pundit Andrew Sullivan. Sullivan’s post doesn’t elaborate on Part D -- Medicare’s prescription drug program, created in 2003. But others have made similar comparisons. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in a Dec. 29, 2009, New York Times blog entry about "the trouble Republicans have been having as they try to explain why, if they consider the fully-funded, deficit-reducing Democratic health care reform unaffordable, they voted for the completely unfunded Medicare drug benefit six years ago." Did Congress "budget" enough for the promises made under the Obamacare law but not those in Medicare Part D -- and was Part D "far more expensive"? ‘Budgeted’ Via email, Krugman told us, "Not sure about what ‘never budgeted’ means, or exactly how ‘more expensive’ is defined. But the ACA designated cost savings and revenues to pay for the outlays; Part D just specified outlays with no offset." Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization), told us by email, "It's certainly true that the ACA was funded while Medicare Part D was not." Part D is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for senior citizens on Medicare. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them. Obamacare requires Americans to buy health insurance, extends Medicare to cover more people and makes numerous other changes. Auerbach said, "The ACA was funded in the sense that taxes were increased to pay for the estimated expenditure cost. Medicare Part D provided a new benefit with a substantial long-run cost... and did not raise any taxes." Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us by email, "Medicare Part D was always coming out of general revenues (unlike most of the rest of Medicare)," because the federal deficit was a less prominent concern at the time, "whereas ACA/Obamacare was drafted in a more deficit-conscious era." Ellis’ group, based in Washington, D.C., describes itself as a nonpartisan watchdog advocating more transparency and less waste in government spending. In a Nov. 3, 2013, fact-check, PolitiFact summed up tax increases in the Obamacare law, aside from the penalty Americans will pay if they don’t have approved health insurance: Medicare payroll taxes for the wealthy, investment income taxes and others on insurance companies, the health care industry and more are included. Other provisions are intended to push Medicare costs down. Medicare Part D wasn’t "funded" in that a source of money was not created or dedicated to offset all its costs -- say, a tax increase or other funding mechanism. Medicare trustees’ March 23, 2004, report explained Part D would be financed with general revenue (mostly federal income taxes) plus the enrollees’ premium payments and some money from the states. Because the premium amounts and the amount of general revenue would be reset each year, they could be adjusted to cover anticipated costs, the report said: "Thus, Part D income will automatically track Part D expenditures fairly closely." Which cost(s) more? Part D and Obamacare are intended to extend into the future. How does one measure the cost of such efforts? One way is to look at projected costs over a 10-year span, as PolitiFact Virginia did in a Dec. 7, 2010, fact-check. Which 10-year span? The photo-quotation that touched off this story gave no context. First we looked at the cost estimates available to members of Congress when they voted. On Nov. 20, 2003, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Part D’s gross cost would total $409.8 billion from 2004 through 2013. The net cost of the entire Medicare Modernization Act, including Part D and expected revenue increases, was given as $394.3 billion ($501 billion in today’s dollars). On March 18, 2010, the CBO and Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Obamacare law’s net effect would be to save the government -- that is, reduce the federal deficit -- $138 billion from 2010 through 2019 ($148 billion in today’s dollars). Later estimates have varied, and realities are also kicking in. PolitiFact found in a June 15, 2011, fact-check that Medicare Part D costs were coming in 28 percent to 40 percent lower than projected by the CBO in 2003. Among the reasons: Fewer people than expected used the program and expiring patents made some name-brand drugs cheaper. The Obamacare law isn’t fully implemented yet, but Ellis said, "The tricky thing about the ACA/Obamacare is that it counts on a lot of moving parts and a lot of assumptions to get to the savings number. If things don’t work out as planned, it won’t be a deficit reducer… whereas after nearly a decade we know what Medicare Part D cost." Bob Moffit, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Center for Health Policy Studies, pointed out by phone that the Medicare trustees have expressed doubt that Congress will leave its cost-reducing measures in place -- particularly the "sustainable growth rate" formula meant to lower Medicare payments to doctors. The Medicare trustees’ May 31, 2013, report said, "At a minimum, readers should not assume that the SGR-related payment rate reductions will take place." That report’s forecasts included a prediction that Part D’s general revenue outlays from 2013 through 2022 could total $852 billion but, the trustees wrote, "Medicare’s actual future costs are highly uncertain and are likely to exceed those shown by the current-law projections in this report." As for the Obamacare law, the CBO said in a May 14, 2013, blog post that its most recent prediction of the act’s total budget impact was a July 24, 2012, estimate that repealing the law could raise the federal deficit by $109 billion ($111 billion in 2013 dollars) from 2013 through 2022. But "projections of the effects of the ACA" are "highly uncertain," the CBO warned, with other factors including the law’s overall effect on the nation’s health systems and the Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of expanding Medicaid eligibility. The law had required states to widen Medicaid access. Krugman gives a different measure in his late-2009 blog entry: "According to the Medicare trustees, Part D created a $9.4 trillion unfunded liability over the next 75 years." The trustees’ 2013 report updated that estimate to $9.2 trillion for 2013-2087. A June 17, 2013, PolitiFact Virginia fact-check showed that January 2013 Government Accountability Office estimates of the Obamacare law’s cost over 75 years could result in two scenarios: It could raise the national debt $6.2 trillion if its cost containment measures were phased out, or it could save the government $13.3 trillion if it works as intended. A GAO analyst said the report did not say whether one outcome or the other is more likely. Our ruling The image shared on Facebook said, "Bush’s Medicare D was far more expensive than the Affordable Care Act, and, unlike the ACA, was never budgeted." It’s a vague claim without context. Looking for a reasonable way to evaluate it, we found the Obamacare law was "funded" and Part D "unfunded" and that, using estimated 10-year costs at inception, the former was projected to save $148 billion and the latter to cost something under $501 billion (in 2013 dollars). We rate the claim as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-14966	"You wonder why you don't see Rand Paul as much; he's still shopping for his billionaire. He's like the only one who hasn't found a billionaire to fund his super PAC."	/missouri/statements/2015/oct/20/claire-mccaskill/campaign-finances-more-complicated-claire-mccaskil/	Sen. Claire McCaskill has noticed Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul’s recent drop in the polls, and she thinks she knows why. Paul hasn’t found a financier to bankroll his campaign, she told Bill Maher on his Aug. 21 show. In fact, she said the Kentucky Republican is the only GOP presidential candidate "who hasn’t found his billionaire to fund his super PAC." "You wonder why you don't see Rand Paul as much; he's still shopping for his billionaire," McCaskill said. "He's like the only one who hasn't found a billionaire to fund his super PAC." With the importance money will play in the 2016 presidential race, we wonder if Paul is the only GOP candidate without a wealthy backer. We reached out to McCaskill for evidence, but her office did not respond. Paul’s big backers McCaskill used the word "billionaire," which is certainly an exclusive club. The problem is there is no easy way to determine who’s a billionaire versus, say, a super-rich millionaire. That’s part of how Donald Trump can say his net worth is $8.7 billion while others peg the number at about $3 billion. Also, it’s important to note that the presidential candidates don't have super PACs because, legally, super PACs and candidates cannot work together, said MU economics professor Jeffrey Milyo. "The senator’s comment is misleading about the nature of the law, but that sort of sloppiness is very common, in part because the issues are somewhat complex, and in part because it serves the purpose of the speaker," Milyo said in an email. Logistics and legalities aside, at the heart of McCaskill's claim is the suggestion that no wealthy supporters have stepped up to support Paul in a big way. That’s not correct. Campaign finance records compiled by OpenSecrets.orgshow that on June 19, Jeff Yass gave $1 million to America's Liberty, a super PAC that supports Paul. He also has given $250,000 to Concerned American Voters, another super PAC that supports Paul. Yass is the founder of Susquehanna International Group, a privately held global trading firm. Yass is rich. How rich is unclear. Reuters described Yass as a billionaire in a June story about campaign giving.PhillyMag.com described Yass as Paul’s "(very) rich friend in Philadelphia." Yass doesn’t make Forbes’ 400, but that list includes people with net worths of $1.7 billion or more. Paul has another wealthy backer in Scott Banister, a self-described capitalist who sits on the board of directors for multiple companies. Scott and his wife, Cyan, have served as angel investors for almost 100 companies, including Zappos, according to Fortune. Banister has given a combined $1.2 million to Concerned American Voters. In all, $5 million has been raised for the two super PACs that support Rand Paul. In comparison, Right to Rise, a super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has a war chest of more than $100 million. Is Banister a billionaire? Again, we don’t know for certain. The other candidates So Paul does have the support of some wealthy donors. And Yass has been described as a billionaire. What about the rest of the crowded GOP field? We found three who don’t appear to have the backing of someone who can write a big check. PACs supporting former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Virginia Gov. James Gilmore haven't broken the $1 million mark and haven't received significant help from one donor in particular, Federal Election Commission filings show. Security is Strength, a super PAC that supports Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., lists $500,000 donations from billionairesRobert McNair and Ronald Perelman. Former Arkansas Gov.Mike Huckabee’s super PAC has relied heavily on the support of Ronald Cameron, who donated $3 million, according to OpenSecrets.org. Steve Wynn has supported New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; T. Boone Pickens is helping Bush; and Robert Mercer is with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, according to FEC filings. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has been helped out by Larry Ellison and Norman Braman. Donald Trump has, well, himself. And Republicans aren’t the only ones who have support from wealthy donors. Seven people have given $1 million to the super PAC supporting Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according toOpenSecrets.org. Yet, the numbers don't tell the whole story. As MU political science professor Marvin Overby points out, candidates have been well-funded in past election cycles, but they still failed to secure the nomination. "A wealthy donor, like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, can make a candidate, like Newt Gingrich in 2012, more viable for a longer period of time," Overby said. "But there are reasons Gingrich didn’t get the GOP nomination: Despite a wealthy backer, he was the wrong candidate, with the wrong message, and a troubled organization." Our ruling McCaskill said Paul’s failure to gain traction in the crowded GOP field may have something to do with the fact that Paul is the only candidate to have not found his billionaire. There are two problems with this statement. There are candidates running for president who don’t have a billionaire, and Paul has a reported billionaire backer in Yass. We rate McCaskill’s statement False.	None	Claire McCaskill	None	None	None	2015-10-20T15:19:40	2015-08-21	['Rand_Paul']

pomt-06146	"Rhode Island is leading our nation in foreclosures."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/20/theresa-price/rhode-island-activist-says-state-has-highest-rate-/	There's no doubt that Rhode Island's economy is in rough shape, and one element of that problem is the number of people poised to lose their homes because they can't make their mortgage payments. During a Dec. 10, State House rally to highlight the plight of the homeless, and some legislative proposals to relieve it, Theresa Price, a board member of Direct Action for Rights and Equality (DARE), complained about the number of evictions caused by banks taking over properties. "Rhode Island is leading our nation in foreclosures," she said. Two days after the rally, Jim Ryczek, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, sent us an unsolicited e-mail saying Price had misspoke. "Rhode Island ranks highest in New England in both foreclosure starts and serious delinquencies, not the entire nation. We did not mean to claim the lead for the entire U.S." That sentiment was echoed by Christopher Rotondo, a DARE organizer, when we called to get the source of Price’s numbers. Price did not respond to repeated requests for a comment. We decided we needed to get the facts ourselves. We found earlier numbers on various websites confirming that Rhode Island isn't at the top of the list. But we weren't sure if they were the latest numbers. The Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade association that releases quarterly statistics from more than 120 real estate companies that submit delinquency and foreclosure counts, sent us its latest numbers from July through September 2011. They reported: * 4.27 percent of Rhode Island's housing units are in the foreclosure process. Rhode Island ranks 12th, not first. Connecticut (4.8 percent) and Maine (5.7 percent) rank even higher. Florida, at 14.5 percent, is at the top of the list. * 1.66 percent of the state's housing units entered the foreclosure process during the third quarter of 2011. Here, we had the dubious distinction of being tops in New England and fourth in the nation. Only three other states -- Arizona (1.67 percent), Florida (1.96 percent) and Nevada (2.48 percent) -- had higher rates. * 8.48 percent of the state's housing units are owned by people who are at least one payment behind on their mortgage. Rhode Island ranks 19th by that measure, the worst in New England. Mississippi, at 13.2 percent, is number one. We also checked with RealtyTrac, an online marketplace for foreclosed properties. It reported on Dec. 15 that, in November, one in every 954 Rhode Island units had been the subject of a foreclosure filing, putting us 21st in the nation for the second month in a row. In New England, New Hampshire had a worse rate - 1 in 735. Rhode Island fares better than the national average of 1 in 579. Different organizations collect their numbers differently, warned Brenda Clement, executive director of the Housing Action Coalition of Rhode Island. Nonetheless, "Rhode Island has, from the very start of this foreclosure mess, consistently ranked in the top ten and usually in the top five across the country in terms of foreclosures and highest in New England," Clement said. Our ruling In the push to rally support for legislation to fight homelessness, DARE official Theresa Price said, "Rhode Island is leading our nation in foreclosures." Clearly that's not the case. Other states consistently have worse rates when it comes to foreclosures, although Rhode Island's -- whether you look at new foreclosures, ongoing foreclosures or delinquent payments -- are well above the national average. If Price had said we lead New England, that statement would not have been clearly true either. Depending on how the data are collected, people in other nearby states may face a greater foreclosure threat. Ryczek, of the Coalition for the Homeless, gave a more accurate characterization of the New England figures after the fact. But, in her speech to hundreds of people outside the State House, Price wasn’t talking about New England. She was talking about the United States. Her fallacious foreclosure factoid is False.

pomt-09033	Japan's "interest on its own debt" is "25 percent of its national budget"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/06/daniel-senor/senor-inflates-japans-interest-payments/	It's hard to talk about the economy without mentioning debt. That point was clear during this week's segment of ABC's This Week. Talking about stimulus spending and unemployment benefits, the round-table discussion eventually turned to the question of debt and long-term fiscal sustainability. "You begin to get in a situation where the interest payments on the debt become unsustainable, the debt becomes unsustainable, and there's a lot of uncertainty. There's uncertainty now about the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, the impact that'll have on the economy, the impact on health care, the Obamacare spending, what impact that will have, possible cap and trade. And people are just sitting on the sidelines saying, 'Where does this end?'" said Daniel Senor, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Bush administration official. To demonstrate his point, Senor brought up Japan as an example of a country whose debt is unsustainable. "I mean, if you look at just the interest payments alone that the Japanese government pays, it accounts for 25 percent -- the interest on its own debt, 25 percent of its national budget," said Senor. That comment caught the attention of Paul Krugman, a Princeton economist who was also at the round-table. "That's just not right," objected Krugman. Jake Tapper, the show host, moved the argument along, but not before inviting PolitiFact to act as an objective judge. So we decided to investigate. We'll leave the debate about Japan's financial stability to economists, however, and focus on the numbers. Is a quarter of Japan's budget going solely to the interest payments on its debt? The details of Japan's fiscal condition are nicely summarized in a document put out by the Japan Ministry of Finance in February 2010. Page two of the report indicates that Japan spends 22.4 percent of its budget on "national debt servicing." Debt servicing consists of interest rate payments and bond redemption, which is essentially a repayment of the loan principal. Looking at interest rate expenses alone, that percentage is 10.6 percent. One can also look at the percentage as compared with the budget that does not include debt-related expenditures. That works out to 13.7 percent. Either way, Senor was off by a significant amount. We checked with Senor, who told us that even if we go with the 13.7 percent, his broader point stands -- Japan's debt is not sustainable. As we said before, that's a mess we'll leave to the economists. Our goal was to see if Senor was using the correct figures, and we found that he wasn't. Even if we go with the higher of the two figures, Senor missed the target by nearly half. For that, we give him a False.	None	Daniel Senor	None	None	None	2010-07-06T18:14:58	2010-07-04	['Japan']
pomt-10351	U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan include a "few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/11/john-mccain/thousands-of-green-card-soldiers-in-iraq/	Update: We originally addressed this when it was released as a web ad on Memorial Day. On July 11, the McCain campaign released the same video as a national television ad. Because it will be new to many people seeing it for the first time on television, we decided to re-post the item. In a Web ad released on Memorial Day, Sen. John McCain praises the many Hispanic soldiers serving in the U.S. military, some of whom are not yet legal citizens of the United States. "My friends, I want you, the next time you're down in Washington, D.C., to go to the Vietnam War Memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite," McCain begins. "You'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names. "When you go to Iraq or Afghanistan today, you're going to see a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background. "You're even going to meet some of the few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country, who love this country so much that they're willing to risk their lives in its service in order to accelerate their path to citizenship and enjoy the bountiful, blessed nation. "So let's, from time to time, remember that these are God's children. They must come into this country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them." We checked with the Defense Department to see how many noncitizens are serving in the U.S. military, and if McCain was accurate that there are thousands serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. The short answer is that McCain is right. As of Feb. 29, 2008, there were 20,328 noncitizens on active duty in the military (about 1.5 percent of the entire active military), according to a report provided by the Pentagon. Of those, 4,112 were serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, or in support of those operations elsewhere. There were another 2,236 whose citizenship was "unknown." These are legal residents with green cards who have not yet become naturalized citizens. There are citizenship incentives for those who enlist. All immigrants who serve honorably in the military during wartime are eligible to file for immediate citizenship under special wartime provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. An analysis of the Pentagon report by PolitiFact determined that about a quarter of the "green card" soldiers are originally from Spanish-speaking countries. In addition, there are 10,533 naturalized citizens serving in the military who were born in Spanish-speaking countries. The thousands of noncitizens serving in Iraq and Afghanistan is one of the military's little-known facts. But apparently not to McCain. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06426	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s "actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/24/brett-hulsey/gop-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-killed-15000-jobs-d/	On the day Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker held a forum n creating jobs, state Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, tried to steal some of his thunder. Hulsey sent a tweet, made himself available to reporters and issued a news release on Oct. 18, 2011, all to highlight his view of Walker’s record on jobs. In the news release, Hulsey declared: "Governor Walker’s actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs." That’s an ear-catching claim. It would mean that Walker -- who promised to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term -- not only presided over a period of staggering job losses, but in effect took out 15,000 of them himself. Hulsey cited five sources to back up his claim -- three are estimates and two use hard numbers. We’ll start with the estimates. 1. Think tank estimate: 9,900 jobs Hulsey’s news release cited a February 2011 report on Walker’s 2009-2011 budget-repair bill by the Institute for Wisconsin’s Future, a liberal research and advocacy group based in suburban Milwaukee. The bill, which led to unprecedented public protests in Madison because it curbed collective bargaining rights, made public employees pay more for their pensions and health insurance. The institute said the higher benefit payments would reduce the public workers’ take-home pay and thus, their spending power, eventually leading to the elimination of 9,900 private-sector jobs. So, these are not jobs already lost, but potential losses that would have begun since Walker signed the bill into law in March 2011. Jack Norman, the institute’s research director, provided this example: If a typical state worker now takes home $70 per week less in pay because of higher payments toward pensions and health care, the worker might decide not to buy a ladder from the hardware store one week, not to buy a child’s coat from the department store the next and to postpone a dentist appointment the following week. Over time, he said, that worker’s reduced purchasing power means less income for those businesses, which eventually will reduce their work forces. Norman said the institute has been revising its projections, and now estimates 16,000 jobs will be lost over the course of one year because of the budget-repair bill and because of spending cuts Walker made in his 2011-2013 state budget. We should note that while both budget measures were proposed by Walker, they needed to be adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature to become law. Norman said the job-loss estimates were made using "economic modeling software" called IMPLAN. We found that IMPLAN is used by consultants, university researchers and government agencies to make various economic projections. When we asked Hulsey if he had other evidence to back the 9,900 lost jobs part of his claim, he cited a March 2011 news article on a similar estimate made by University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Steven Deller. According to the article, Deller said 21,843 jobs would be lost within two years because of the budget-repair bill and Walker’s budget proposal. Like Norman, Deller cited reduced spending from public workers and public agencies that he said would result from Walker’s two budget measures. But that’s a narrow view of the economy. We asked Thomas Miller, resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., about estimating job losses in this way. "You can’t wall off one limited portion of the population and decide that whatever is done to them is good or bad," he said. Miller said the economy is affected by many factors, including the finances of state government. Walker essentially reallocated some of the state government’s resources by having employees pay a larger share of their benefits. In the big picture, he said, such a move, among other factors, could help employment. So, Hulsey relies on predictive estimates in claiming that those moves will eventually kill 9,900 jobs. But there simply isn’t evidence that Walker’s actions, as Hulsey claims, are "directly responsible" for that many jobs being eliminated. 2. Train construction estimate: 2,300 jobs Hulsey cited a November 2010 memo from the Wisconsin Legislature Fiscal Bureau that estimated the number of jobs that would have been created in connection with construction of a high-speed rail project between Milwaukee and Madison. The next month, the federal government pulled funding for the project after Walker, who had not yet been inaugurated, expressed his opposition to it. The memo, however, does not use the 2,300 figure and did not estimate jobs, per se. Rather, as we reported in a December 2010 PolitiFact item, the memo estimated that over six years, the rail line construction itself plus economic activity generated by it would create a certain number of jobs’ worth of work each year. That figure ranged from 250 to 5,535 per year. It should be noted that -- like the study of the potential jobs lost due to pension and health changes -- this looked at only one side of the picture. As we noted in another PolitiFact item, the estimates don’t take into account jobs that might have been lost due to more people riding trains and fewer using cars or other modes of transportation. So the advertised increase, on a net basis, may have been less. But there is some ground for Hulsey saying that Walker prevented roughly 2,300 jobs from being created by blocking the train project. It’s certainly true that a certain number of jobs would have been created to build the line itself, and Hulsey’s figure is within the range of credible estimates. 3. Wind-energy estimate: 950 jobs Hulsey cited comments by Denise Bode, chief executive officer of the American Wind Energy Association lobbying organization, in a January 2011 news article. Speaking about a bill proposed by Walker that would limit where wind turbines could be located, she said the measure would shut down 12 planned wind farm projects that could produce about 950 full-time jobs for one year. Since Walker introduced the bill, some of the 12 projects have been canceled while others remain on hold as Walker attempts to work out a compromise measure. So, there is evidence that Walker’s action prevented at least some jobs from being created. But Hulsey assumes that all 950 jobs -- which were projected, not certain -- will never be created and that is still an open question. Now, let’s go to the sources that used hard numbers: 1. State government positions: 1,030 jobs Hulsey cited a July 2011 fiscal bureau memo that said Walker’s 2011-2013 budget reduced the number of full-time-equivalent positions in state government by 1,032. That’s a firm figure. But it’s not what it might appear to be. Bob Lang, director of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, told us: "I would not portray these 1,000 (positions) as people who got laid off." Rather, he said, the budget eliminated authorized positions that theoretically could have been filled -- but many had been vacant for a year or more and the budget ordered that they be taken off the books. So, it’s not clear that anyone lost a job because of this Walker maneuver -- and in any case, certainly nowhere near 1,000 jobs were killed. 2. School layoffs: 1,000 jobs Hulsey cited news reports of the layoffs of teachers and other educational staff in Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha and Germantown, all in southeastern Wisconsin, and in Wisconsin Heights, northwest of Madison. The articles reported a total of roughly 1,000 layoffs in those school districts. Hulsey said he attributes all the layoffs to nearly $800 million in reduced state aid to schools in Walker-proposed and the Legislature-adopted budget. But again, it’s not that simple. In the article Hulsey cited about 519 layoffs -- including 354 teachers -- at Milwaukee Public Schools, the MPS superintendent said the layoffs were the result of a number of budgetary factors, not just the reduction of state aid. Moreover, MPS had laid off 482 educators in June 2010, five months before Walker was elected, which indicates that other factors trigger layoffs. Similarly, the article Hulsey cited that reported the Kenosha layoffs said the layoffs were the result of federal and state budget cuts as well as a previously-negotiated increase in staff pay. So, while Walker’s budget was a factor in some teachers losing their jobs, Hulsey cannot back his claim that 1,000 school layoffs all were caused by Walker. OK, what’s the final assessment? Hulsey said Walker’s "actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs." Two-thirds of his claim is based on estimates of the effect of reduced spending by government employees and government agencies as a result of budget actions taken by Walker. The estimates, however, don’t tie the spending reductions to actual job losses and take a very narrow -- some would say wrongheaded -- view of how the economy works. Hulsey’s claims of perhaps a few thousand jobs not being created because of actions taken by Walker regarding high-speed rail and wind energy have some merit. But his claim that the state budget killed 1,000 jobs appears to be off altogether. In sum, Hulsey isn’t close to demonstrating that actions taken by Walker are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs. We rate his statement False.

pomt-15222	"The Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won women since 1988."	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/09/heather-mcghee/republican-presidential-nominee-hasnt-won-over-wom/	Personal attacks against Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly may have cost Donald Trump an invite to an influential conservative powwow, but a prominent progressive activist says "batting away" the frontrunner’s misogyny will do little to help the GOP. Heather McGhee, president of the liberal economic think tank Demos, said on Meet the Press that the Republican Party has both institutional and structural biases against women. "I think it’s important to remember the Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won women since 1988, so this is a very deep problem for the party," McGhee said Aug. 9, 2015. "It’s not going to be enough for anyone, a commentator or one of the candidates, to just disavow Trump’s sort of interpersonal sexist comments." We were curious about McGhee’s 1988 statistic. Is it true that no GOP nominee candidate in almost three decades has earned more support from women than the Democratic nominee? McGhee pointed us to an article published Aug. 7, 2015, in the New York Times. Even though the article repeats the statistic without citing a source, we found several datasets that corroborate the claim with slightly different numbers. To be clear, the source of the information is surveys of voters, and includes exit polling data, so it's not an official record. But the surveys are widely cited as the best data available. In 1988, Republican nominee George H.W. Bush received a single percentage point more of female votes (at 50 percent) than Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, according to research by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Since then, no GOP candidate has "won" the women’s vote. Women overall have had a higher voter turnout than men in every presidential election for 35 years, almost always favoring liberal candidates. Their allegiance to the Democratic party is reflected in congressional races as well. Barack Obama earned 56 percent of women’s votes in 2008 — one of the highest shares of female voters ever — and 55 percent in 2012. Why do more women vote for Democrats? Aside from more women simply identifying as Democrats than men, women are also more likely to favor left-leaning policies of more government assistance for poor Americans, children and the elderly; providing better access to contraceptives and reproductive health; and protecting the environment, according to the Pew Research Center. Other factors include the rise of the powerful pro-choice PAC Emily’s List in the 1980s and 1990s and the controversy over Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, added Karen O’Connor, a professor of political science at American University's Women & Politics Institute. "Women were very angry," O’Connor said of the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee’s questioning of Thomas’ former employee, Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment. The partisan gap has solidified in recent years, but experts say the female vote began to align with Democrats in 1980, eight years before Bush won a slight majority of female voters. Kelly Dittmar of Rutgers’ Center for American Women and Politics lists the feminist movement, increased participation in the labor force, and greater reliance on government programs as reasons for the shift. At the same time, men have shifted right, she said. Women generally favored GOP candidates from the suffrage movement in 1919 through the 1950s. Republican President Herbert Hoover was known as "the woman's candidate" in 1928, according to feminist scholar Jo Freeman. Democratic presidential candidates lost the female vote by double digits in 1952 and 1956, according to Gallup data. "Early on, white upper-class women were Republicans," explained O’Connor. Then came the 1960s, with both parties responding to the feminist movement. The era of bipartisanship was reflected in the presidential elections, with Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson and Republican Richard Nixon each receiving substantial majorities of female votes. By the late 1970s, however, the political divide in women’s votes resurfaced and changed course. Christina Wolbrecht, a professor who studies gender and politics at the University of Notre Dame, points to a specific watershed moment: the 1980 Republican convention, when the party for the first time refused to endorse the Equal Rights Amendment. "By the early 1980s, the two parties stood on opposing sides of the debate over women’s rights," Wolbrecht wrote in The Politics of Women’s Rights. Not that the GOP wasn’t aware of the divide. In his first term as president, Ronald Reagan responded by enacting policies that appealed to women. "Reagan supported things like tax credits for child care and individual retirement accounts for homemakers, and the White House Working Group for Women was created in 1983," said Dittmar of Rutgers. "He also appointed some women to high-profile posts (such as) Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court." In his 1984 re-election, Reagan beat Walter Mondale and his female vice presidential pick with 56 percent of women supporting him. The experts said women are more driven by party lines than female candidates, which will make it hard for Republicans to upend the trend in 2016. Our rating McGhee said, "The Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won women since 1988." The data, based on surveys of voters, backs her up. George H.W. Bush won his 1988 election campaign with just 1 percentage point more of female votes than his Democratic opponent. No Republican has "won" the fight for more women’s votes since. We rate McGhee’s claim True.	None	Heather McGhee	None	None	None	2015-08-09T18:47:23	2015-08-09	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03467	Says the success of his economic agenda is supported by the fact "we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/16/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-success-office-reflected-2-point/	Gov. Scott Walker has long emphasized falling unemployment rates as evidence that Wisconsin’s sluggish job growth is heading in the right direction. In his January 2013 "state of the state" speech, Walker highlighted the decline from 7.8 percent unemployment the month before he took office in January 2011 to the 6.7 percent figure for December 2012. Now, with the recent uptick to 7.1 percent unemployment in the first quarter of 2013, Walker has reworked his message. Asked by host Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s Upfront show about Democrats criticizing him for focusing on a potential presidential bid instead of the governorship, Walker replied: "They can’t argue with the success. We went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower. The deficit was $3.6 billion when I took office. We now have a half a billion dollar surplus." Let’s take a look at the new talking point on the unemployment rate. Walker says the success of his economic agenda is supported by the fact that "we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower." Is he right? According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures from monthly household surveys, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate peaked as the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009. That peak -- 9.2 percent -- is the figure Walker selected as a four-year comparison point. And it did fall 2.1 points in that time, so the numbers are accurate. But the statement is complicated by other factors, especially the phrase "when I decided to run." The unemployment rate was surging up in late 2008 and early 2009, so the timing makes a big difference. For instance, Walker officially announced his long-expected candidacy in spring 2009. The most recent unemployment figure at the time was 8.4 percent. But news reports as far back as August 2008 described Walker as "expected" to run. The latest unemployment rate at that time was 4.7 percent. When we asked Team Walker for backup, spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster said, "he is not referring to the specific moment he decided to run, but generally to the climate during the time he decided to run four years ago." Doyle and Walker Then there’s the issue of who gets credit for the drop from 2009 to 2013; Walker couched the two-point decline as part of "the success" he can point to as governor. Here’s the timeline: -- From its 9.2 percent peak in June-July 2009, the rate fell almost monthly during the late stages of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s second term, dropping 1.4 points to the 7.8 percent mark in December 2010 when Doyle left office. So exactly two-thirds of the drop Walker mentions happened on his predecessor’s watch. -- After Walker took office in January 2011, the rate ticked down but was essentially flat for nine months before falling slowly to 6.7. Then it reversed course early in 2013, taking some of the luster off the positive trend. That left the total drop during Walker’s time at 0.7 points. So one-third of the drop compared to four years ago came during Walker’s administration. We asked Webster about this, and she responded in an email: "The Governor was providing a frame of reference for where we were and where we are now." A bit of perspective, before we wrap up. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is lower than the national figure (7.1 vs. 7.6 percent). Among seven Midwest states, Wisconsin trails far behind Iowa (4.7) and Minnesota (5.3), but is well ahead of Illinois (9.3), Indiana (8.5) and Michigan (8.4). Wisconsin is fourth of the seven states in improvement in the unemployment rate since the month Walker took office in 2011. Our rating Walker said the success of his agenda is supported by the fact that "we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower." Walker’s numbers are on target if you go back "four years." But he muddies the waters by describing that as when he "decided to run" -- and that skews the picture when it comes to improvement. His decision came at an earlier date, when the unemployment rate was either much lower (at the time of his official announcement) or even lower than that (when he was unofficially running). Finally, the construction of the claim is misleading in part on the issue of who gets credit for the improvement. He discloses that he’s going back in time before he was governor but omits Doyle’s record and claims the "success" as his, glossing over the fact that only one-third of the gains took place on his watch. There’s an element of truth here, but critical facts are left out. That’s why we’re rating his statement Mostly False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-06-16T06:00:00	2013-06-16	['None']

pomt-02672	"Crime in Atlanta is down 18 percent since 2009."	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/10/atlanta-police-foundation/police-foundation-target/	Just in time for the Christmas holidays, people who give their time and money to help the Atlanta Police Department received good news in the mail. A flier from the nonprofit Atlanta Police Foundation arrived with this impressive headline: "Crime in Atlanta is down 18 percent since 2009." That is something to feel good about. But is it true? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look deeper into the foundation’s claim, especially given that, at several times during the year, residents have been rattled by -- and outspoken about -- high-profile neighborhood crimes. To make the claim of an 18 percent drop in crime, the foundation compared crime data in the first 45 weeks of 2009 against data for the same 45 weeks in 2013. The foundation focused on what are known as Part 1, or major, crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto thefts. The foundation pulled straight from records of the Atlanta Police Department, which show: 2009 2013 % difference Murders 72 70 -3 Rapes 95 93 -2 Robberies 2209 2020 -9 Aggravated assaults 2302 1970 -14 Burglaries 7654 5010 -35 Larcenies from auto 9447 7988 -15 Other larcenies 7191 6902 -4 Auto thefts 4898 3867 -21 All Part 1 offenses 33,868 27,920 -18 The 18 percent decline was calculated by taking the Part 1 offenses for 2009, subtract the Part 1 offenses from 2013, then divide the difference by the Part 1 Offenses in 2009. Step 1) 33,868 - 27,920 = 5,948 Step 2) 5,948/ 33,868 = 0.1756 (rounded to .18 or 18%) Robert R. Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice and director of the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange at Georgia State University’s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said the calculations are "legitimate." This is "one of several ways to calculate what’s happening with crime," he said. "It relies on raw figures, Friedmann said. "If you actually calculate rates, then the decline will be higher than 18 percent since the population has increased." The claim by the foundation, which raised and spent more than $2 million in 2012 to support police department initiatives, was "fair for the purpose it was done for," he said. "I read PolitiFact, and I would rate it as a True," Friedmann said. "I wouldn’t have an issue with it." Jack Levin, the director of the Brudnick Center on Conflict and Violence at Northeastern University, said the Atlanta Police Foundation could have provided its supporters a "clearer picture" of crime in the city had it shown the crime trends from 2009 to 2013, rather than a 45-week-to-45-week comparison. "But using a baseline of 2009, it doesn’t look like they were trying to put one over on the public," Levin said. Homicide rates were the lowest in decades in 2009, so someone wanting to make the city look better would likely have chosen another year to compare with 2013, he said. Had the foundation chosen to compare the 45 weeks of 2013 with the same weeks in 2010, 2011 or 2012, crime also would have been down, but not as much as compared with 2009. The Christmastime flier was sent to supporters "as a reminder of the impact that their donations have had funding critical programs spearheaded by the APF," said Miguel Sepulveda, the foundation’s vice president for communications and director of Crime Stoppers of Greater Atlanta. Earlier this year, the foundation sent supporters a postcard, directing them to a more detailed crime report, Sepulveda said. The recent flier didn’t give the reader any specifics to support the foundation’s claim. "Perhaps, we should do that," Sepulveda said in an email exchange. "We used the first 45 weeks because those were the most current stats available for 2013 at the time the [flier] went to print," he said. Mayor Kasim Reed made crime fighting a topic of his second inaugural address this week. He rated the Police Department’s expansion to 2,000 workers as a first-term milestone and promised to "double-down" efforts to address crime in his second term. Crime has brought the city some unflattering headlines. For instance, Forbes magazine ranked Atlanta as the ninth "most dangerous city" in the nation for 2013, down from sixth in 2012. The magazine creates the annual list by using the FBI's Crime Statistics database screened for cities with populations of 200,000 and higher. Experts generally downplay these rankings, and the FBI specifically warns against using its statistics for city-against-city rankings. But there’s no evidence that the foundation’s flier claim was anything but accurate based on the available data. We rate the statement True.

pomt-15180	"Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine … and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people."	/rhode-island/statements/2015/aug/23/rhode-island-center-freedom-and-prosperity/ri-center-prosperity-freedoms-rails-against-regula/	Rhode Island has issued a controversial vaccination requirement designed to fight HPV, or human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted virus that can cause cancer. The requirement, ordered by the Rhode Island Department of Health, took effect Aug. 1. It has drawn fire from a group of critics that included the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, which calls itself a "free enterprise think tank." The new policy calls for the vaccination of all seventh grade boys and girls before the start of school. The requirement does not apply to students whose doctors cite a medical problem; or to students whose parents object for religious reasons. And the health department defines religious reasons very liberally. Before a series of public information meetings on the vaccination requirement, the Center for Freedom and Prosperity posted this statement on its website: "Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine … and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people." We telephoned Mike Stenhouse, the center’s founder and chief executive officer, and asked him for his sources. We didn’t get anything from him right away. So we did our own research and found that Virginia is the only other state to require students to receive immunization for HPV. Virginia’s vaccination requirement, which is only for sixth-grade girls, took effect in 2008 following an act of the legislature. Rhode Island’s policy is the product of a regulatory process that began in 2013 under the leadership of Michael Fine, then the state’s director of the Department of Health. In both states, HPV vaccination policies use the word "required" and both have opt-out provisions. In Virginia, parents have "sole discretion" on whether their children receive the vaccination. Stenhouse labels the policies in Virginia and Rhode Island as mandates. But Jason L. Schwartz, an assistant professor at the Yale University School of Public Health, says you can’t call policies with such liberal exemptions mandates. The breadth of Rhode Island’s opt-out provisions may not have been clear to the public — or to Stenhouse — before a public meeting Aug. 5. That’s when Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, the new director of the Department of Health, told parents that their philosophical objections would qualify for the religious exemption spelled out in the regulations. But what about the center’s claim that Rhode Island imposed the requirement by "regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people"? And, as the center says later in its policy statement, was the health department’s decision an example of "regulatory despotism" that "bypasses the traditional democratic process"? While it’s true that the General Assembly did not pass a law for the HPV vaccination, existing Rhode Island law gives the health director the power to adopt regulations to protect public health. And, of course, the health director is appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of, the governor. Further, control of health-care policy by the executive branch is common in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, makes decisions affecting the health welfare of the country without first getting an act of Congress. "To say it’s anti-democratic would be a misunderstanding of how we structure our government in the United States," says Schwartz, the Yale professor, who co-authored a recent article about state vaccination requirements for the Journal of the American Medical Association. Also it’s not as if the state adopted the regulation in a back room somewhere — even though Stenhouse’s organization on July 30 described the news of the requirement as a "stunning revelation." On Dec. 2, 2013, Fine, the former health director, filed a notice of public hearing for Jan. 16, 2014, and also solicited written statements on the issue. In response to criticism, the department delayed the beginning of the program from Aug. 1, 2014, to Aug. 1, 2015, according to a form for the regulation that was filed with the Office of Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea. The Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union registered its ardent opposition to the proposed regulation at the hearing and in written comments. On Jan. 27, 2014, the ACLU called on the health department to reconsider the proposal. The ACLU also criticized the requirement on Facebook. That’s seems like debate to us. We tried to get Stenhouse to explain what the center meant by the phrase "regulatory fiat." He declined. Instead, he sent us a written statement in which he said the center "stands by its statement" and he challenged PolitiFact’s fairness and objectivity. Our ruling The center says "Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine … and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people." The center, in its statement, got two things right and two things wrong. It was right about Rhode Island being the second state and it was right that the requirement was not adopted by "the elected representatives of the people." It was wrong when it said the vaccination requirement was imposed "by fiat" and "without public debate." In 2014, the ACLU sharply criticized the vaccine requirement at the public hearing and debated the proposal in social media and on its website. As for acting by fiat, the regulation was put in place through a process established by law. And comments at a public hearing influenced that process, leading to a decision by the director of health to delay execution of the policy for one year. More recently, the new health director told the public that philosophical objections were enough to qualify for the religious exemption. In other words, parents can pretty much say whatever they want to get exemptions for their children. For those reasons, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-12311	"5.7 million -- that’s how many illegal immigrants might have voted" in 2008.	/florida/statements/2017/jun/22/ainsley-earhardt/following-trump-voter-fraud-allegations-claim-57-m/	President Donald Trump’s unfounded allegations that millions voted illegally in 2016 is back in the news, with his supporters pointing to a new analysis that claims millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2008. Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt talked about it on the morning show recently. "5.7 million -- that’s how many illegal immigrants might have voted" in 2008, she said. Her comments referenced an article in the Washington Times, a conservative newspaper. Trump has made repeated claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we’ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again (and we debunked a claim by his spokesman Sean Spicer). The claim made on Fox and Friends is based on an extrapolation of a controversial study that relied on a very small number of responses. Researchers involved in the underlying survey of voters have cautioned against using their data to reach conclusions about noncitizen voters. Study about the 2008 election We emailed a spokeswoman for Fox News and did not get a reply; however, the Washington Times article showed that the information came from Just Facts, a think tank that describes itself as conservative/libertarian and was founded by James D. Agresti, a mechanical engineer in New Jersey. Agresti’s conclusions are based on data from a paper by Old Dominion University researchers who used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, or CCES. He multiplied the findings in that data with U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the noncitizen population to come up with a conclusion about the number of noncitizen voters nationwide. It’s important to note that the CCES researchers have disputed the conclusions Old Dominion researchers reached about noncitizen voters. Here’s how the studies unfolded: In 2008, the CCES surveyed 32,800 adults nationwide online about their political views. Respondents answered at least 100 questions before they made it to the citizenship question, one of the last questions asked. The survey showed that 339 identified themselves as noncitizens -- about 1 percent of the total respondents. Then of the 339 self-identified noncitizens, 39 of those claim to have voted, said Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of the main researchers. That’s 39 respondents out of 32,800 people who are now being used to extrapolate millions of illegal voters. Schaffner has warned that with a subset that small, the responses might be unreliable. "Survey respondents occasionally select the wrong response by accident—perhaps because they are rushing through and not reading the questions carefully, because they do not fully understand the terminology being used, or because they simply click on the wrong box on the page," Schaffner wrote in a Politico magazine article after the November election. Subsequent CCES surveys provide more evidence that some respondents answered the question wrong. There were 20 respondents who identified themselves as citizens in 2010 but then in 2012 changed their answers to indicate that they were noncitizens, which Schaffer said is "highly unrealistic." In 2014, researchers at Old Dominion University used the CCES data in 2008 and 2010, as well as voter records in 2008, to conclude that more than 14 percent of noncitizens indicated that they were registered to vote. Their best guess at the portion of noncitizens who voted was about 6.4 percent, or 1.2 million votes cast. The researchers at CCES (including Schaffner; Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist; and Samantha Luks, managing director of scientific research at YouGov) have criticized the methodology used by Old Dominion. They said it didn’t fully consider the possibility that people responded to the survey inaccurately. "You are ignoring the measurement error in a very small group which is going to inflate those numbers," Schaffner said, "then you assume this is a random sample of all noncitizens in the country, which it probably isn’t." More than 100 political scientists from universities and colleges wrote an open letter in January disputing the Old Dominion paper as evidence for Trump’s claim that millions of noncitizens voted. "In a survey as large as the CCES, even a small rate of response error (where people incorrectly mark the wrong item on a survey) can lead to incorrect conclusions," they wrote. "The scholarly political science community has generally rejected the findings in the Richman et al. study and we believe it should not be cited or used in any debate over fraudulent voting." Jesse Richman, one of the Old Dominion researchers and a political science professor, told PolitiFact he still stands by his research and responded to the criticisms by CCES researchers in a working paper in February. Agresti of Just Facts, the source of the numbers cited on Fox and Friends, used the same data from CCES and Old Dominion and concluded that between 594,000 to 5.7 million noncitizens voted illegally in the 2008 election. Agresti said his number on the high end of his range was higher than Old Dominion because he used different methodology in his calculations. Other research has found small numbers of noncitizen voters Setting aside surveys, another way to find noncitizen voters is to examine state voter records and compare that with data about immigration status. But states have struggled with attempts to do that. Florida tried before the 2012 election and scrapped the effort amid many errors. We interviewed other election experts: Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine; Lorraine Minnite, political science professor at Rutgers University; and Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has tracked voter fraud allegations since 2000. All three rejected Agresti’s conclusions. There have been some instances of noncitizens voting, but actual evidence has shown small numbers among millions of votes cast nationwide. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who co-chairs Trump’s voter fraud commission, has obtained a total of one conviction for noncitizen voting since 2015. North Carolina’s 2016 post-election audit showed a few dozen noncitizen voters out of 4.8 million votes cast. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced in February that since he took office in 2011, he has identified 126 noncitizens who cast ballots. Our ruling Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, "5.7 million -- that’s how many illegal immigrants might have voted" in 2008. The number comes from a conclusion by Just Facts, a conservative/libertarian think tank. Just Facts’ numbers came from a study by Old Dominion University researchers. That study was based on a survey which showed that 39 people out 32,800 claimed to be noncitizens who had voted. Just Facts used data from the study and Census estimates on the noncitizen population to come up with a national figure of noncitizen voters. But other researchers and political scientists have said the small number is not a reliable source of data on noncitizen voters nationwide. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09139	"The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/14/john-boehner/boehner-says-house-has-always-passed-budget-resolu/	On the June 13, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, got into a back-and-forth over how diligent lawmakers have been in passing a budget in recent years. Hoyer said that "the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06," while Boehner claimed "the House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era." With dueling claims like these, we had no choice but to step in and play referee. In this item, we'll look at what Boehner said; in a separate item, we'll look at Hoyer's comment. First, a little background. The budget process used by Congress today was set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Both the Senate and the House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation and other fiscal policy items. This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it. The budget process is distinct from the series of appropriations, or spending, bills that actually allocate money for specific purposes. Unlike the appropriations bills, the budget resolution doesn't carry the force of law. In fact, unlike a law, the budget resolution is not signed by the president after it passes both chambers. If a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can still use parliamentary procedures to proceed to appropriations bills, but the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate. That's why the expected failure of the Democratic House majority to pass a budget for fiscal year 2011 has become a talking point for Republicans. According to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the House has indeed passed a budget every year since the Congressional Budget Act first took effect for fiscal year 1976. So if the House does not pass a budget for fiscal year 2011, it will be the first time since the current rules went into force. However, we should also note that the House has not always been joined by the Senate in passing a budget -- a factor that explains the difference between what Boehner and Hoyer said. Since 1983 -- the first year the House and Senate stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and began passing one per year -- the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, then under Democratic control, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind, and on three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007) the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. Because Congress always works on the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, the Republican Congressional majority failed to pass a finished budget in three years: 1998, 2004 and 2006. So Boehner is correct that the House has always passed a budget resolution, even though on three occasions, it later failed to work out differences with the Senate and pass a final, identical version, and once the Senate, under Democratic control, had no budget resolution. We'll note that caveat, but we don't think his failure to mention that point undermines the accuracy of his statement. So we rate Boehner's statement True.

pomt-11677	Says Sandra Bullock said to Hillary Clinton, "If you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again."	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/04/flash-24-daily/no-sandra-bullock-didnt-disparage-hillary-clinton/	A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isn’t happy with how things are going. "Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,’" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October. While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didn’t include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name. The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her "new film," Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate. At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans. "I don’t agree with that at all," Bullock said. "That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement." The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl. "I would like my rights represented and those of my son — very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them," she says. "When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good." We found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton "if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again." We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-08248	"My debt to GDP was the lowest or one of the lowest of modern presidents. My taxes to GDP was the lowest and my spending to GDP" was too.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/12/george-w-bush/former-president-george-w-bush-defends-his-fiscal-/	During the tour to promote his presidential memoir, Decision Points, George W. Bush defended his fiscal record in an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show. In the interview, Bush said that the ratio of the deficit to gross domestic product during his time in office "was lower than Ronald Reagan's by half. Lower than my dad's. And only [worse than] Bill Clinton among modern presidents. ... My debt to GDP was the lowest or one of the lowest of modern presidents. My taxes to GDP was the lowest and my spending to GDP" was too. We thought it would be worthwhile to see if Bush was correct. So we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole. The challenge is figuring exactly how to compare recent presidents. Let's start with the deficit. The most obvious way to do it is to add up all of the annual percentages for a president and divide by the number of years served, to produce an average. Calculating it this way -- and beginning our list of "modern" presidents with President Dwight Eisenhower -- we came up with the following order: Eisenhower (deficits averaged 0.53 percent of GDP), Clinton (0.76 percent of GDP), Richard Nixon (0.93 percent), Lyndon Johnson (1.1 percent), George W. Bush (2.0 percent), Jimmy Carter (2.4 percent), George H.W. Bush (3.98 percent), Reagan (4.23 percent). (We excluded John F. Kennedy and Gerald Ford because of their short tenures.) You can do the same with spending and tax receipts. For spending as a percent of GDP, the ranking from low to high is Eisenhower (18.1 percent of GDP), Johnson (18.7 percent), Nixon (19.2 percent), George W. Bush (19.6 percent), Clinton (19.8), Carter (20.8), George H.W. Bush (21.9), and Reagan (22.4). For tax receipts as a percentage of GDP, the ranking from low to high is Eisenhower (17.5 percent of GDP), Johnson and George W. Bush (tied at 17.6 percent), George H.W. Bush (17.9 percent), Reagan (18.2 percent), Nixon (18.3 percent), Carter (18.4 percent) and Clinton (19 percent). Whether Bush is correct depends heavily on which presidents you consider "modern." If you only go back to Reagan -- the earliest president that Bush himself cited by name in the interview -- then Bush is basically correct. Only Clinton did better when measured by deficit as a percentage of GDP, while no president dating back to Reagan scored better on spending or tax receipts as a percentage of GDP. By contrast, if you go back to Eisenhower -- the first fully post-World War II president -- Bush is in the middle of the pack on the deficit and on spending, and he's near the top on tax receipts. But there's another way to look at the deficit -- to compare a president's first deficit as a percentage of GDP to their last. This shows what direction the deficit went during their tenures. And on this one, George W. Bush does the worst of any president dating back to Eisenhower. The younger Bush went from a 1.3 percent surplus to a 3.2 percent deficit, a decline of 4.5 percentage points. The best was Clinton, who moved the deficit from a 3.9 percent deficit to a 2.4 percent surplus -- a positive change of 6.3 percentage points. The other presidents all had changes up or down that were roughly two percentage points or smaller. This suggests that Bush's fiscal record wasn't so sterling if you use a different measure than the one he did. But to analyze the accuracy of his statement, we'll stick closely to the words he used. George W. Bush is correct that he outperformed his father, Reagan and (mostly) Clinton. So if you consider those the "modern" presidents, he's essentially right. If you broaden the "modern presidents" to include those serving in the entire post-World War II period, Bush is about average. While we wouldn't have chosen to define the "modern presidents" to include just the four that Bush mentioned by name, we'll give him some deference in framing the question. So we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	George W. Bush	None	None	None	2010-11-12T19:00:00	2010-11-08	['None']

pomt-14956	"The word progressive ... was created as a substitute for ‘communist’."	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/22/jon-voight/actor-jon-voight-says-progressive-just-another-wor/	Cigar smokers of the world unite. Actor and conservative advocate Jon Voight engaged in a wide-ranging interview for Cigar Afcionado in which he got into the smoke-filled rooms of politics. The magazine released excerpts in advance of publication, and a Fox News website Fox411 wrote about Voight bemoaning how liberals have rebranded themselves. "I think the word ‘progressive’ is a very devious term. It was created as a substitute for ‘communist,’ " he said. "What they propose is the reverse of progress. It’s some that that (sic) does taste of communism and Karl Marx’s pernicious philosophy." We looked into the origins of the word progressive to see if it was created as a ruse to mask communistic thinking. What we found is quite the opposite. The progressive platform emerged as way to thwart the growth of nascent American socialist or communist movements. The birth of the progressive movement The progressive label showed up in the first decade of the 20th century. The Library of Congress describes the progressives as those who "tried to make big business more responsible through regulations of various kinds. They worked to clean up corrupt city governments, to improve working conditions in factories, and to better living conditions for those who lived in slum areas, a large number of whom were recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. Many progressives were also concerned with the environment and conservation of resources." Around the turn of the 20th century, children worked in factories, city bosses rigged elections, and corporate mergers had allowed single entities to enjoy monopoly or near-monopoly power. In nearly 80 industries, there was one firm that controlled over half the total output. The movement had many strands and at times drew support from both Republican and Democratic politicians. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt, having failed to win the Republican nomination, ran for president under the banner of the Progressive Party (in the popular press it was called the Bull Moose Party.) Some planks in the party platform resonate today. They called for limits and disclosure of campaign contributions, an eight-hour workday, a national health service, social insurance for the elderly, the unemployed and the disabled, and oversight of Wall Street. They also sought direct election of senators and creation of a national income tax. William Link, a progressive-era historian at the University of Florida, told us that while some activists focused on cleaning up slums and others on fighting political corruption, there was a unifying theme. "It was mostly an attempt to regulate and restrain the negative forces of industrial capitalism," Link said. "This meant public interventions -- often, of government, but not always -- designed to create a better society in the industrializing age." During the progressive era, the nation gave women the right to vote and regulated the meat and drug industries, as well as the railroads. The progressive agenda showed strong regional differences. In the South, it was part of the white supremacist movement. In the North, some factions were strongly anti-immigrant. Many progressives also supported Prohibition. A break from the socialists and Marxists Rutgers University’s website on this period said many of the leaders of the movement were members of "the middle and upper-class establishment" who believed that the excesses of industry were breeding conditions that amplified calls for more radical change. "Fear of the expansion of Socialism and Marxism provoked many in the upper class to support more moderate reform efforts as a means to ease the growing tensions between rich and poor and head off more extreme threats to their privileged role in society," the authors wrote. Charles Postel is an historian at San Francisco State University currently writing a book on the progressive era. Postel told us leading progressives such as President Teddy Roosevelt were quite clear on the relationship between their reform agenda and socialism. "Roosevelt lectured business leaders that they needed to get on board with the graduated income tax and similar reforms if they were to successfully defeat the socialists," Postel said. Historian Shelton Stromquist at the University of Iowa wrote that the progressive agenda split from Marxist thinking on the issue of class. While Marxist thought emphasized class consciousness as the key to change, the mainstream progressives looked to reforms such as better housing, work conditions and education to raise people out of misery. "They convinced themselves that class conflict and the 'parochial' class loyalties that bred it could be transcended," Stromquist wrote in Reinventing "the People": The Progressive Movement, the Class Problem and the Origins of Modern Liberalism. Stromquist wrote that modern-day liberals inherited this framework, saying, "Liberals have largely continued to deny the relevance of class to reform." Later progressives Most historians mark the years immediately after World War I as the end of the progressive era. Link told us the term fell out of favor for nearly three decades. It returned briefly in 1948 when former Vice President Henry Wallace (he served in Franklin Roosevelt’s last full term) ran a third-party bid for president under the Progressive Party. Wallace had virtually no chance to begin with, but after the Communist Party USA endorsed him, his campaign was doomed. Wallace himself praised aspects of the Soviet Union for promoting "economic democracy." That incarnation of the Progressive Party dissolved in 1955. The Wallace link aside, Link told us that Voight’s assertion is "absurd." "To say that it ‘substituted’ for communism is historically inaccurate," Link said. Our ruling Voight said that the word progressive was created as a substitute for communist. The historic record shows that the progressive movement emerged around the turn of the last century in response to the conditions created by runaway capitalism. Its policies aimed to regulate private industry, not eliminate it. That agenda enjoyed broad support from people who identified with both parties and led to many of the basic features of government today. Many of the movement’s mainstream supporters backed reforms as a way to head off more radical movements based on class identity rooted in Marxist thought. There was a brief period when the progressive label attracted support from avowed Communists, but that ended about 60 years ago and played no role in the creation of the term.

pomt-13200	The Democratic Party "is the oldest continuous political party in the world."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/24/tim-kaine/democratic-party-oldest-continuous-political-party/	It’s widely stated that the Democratic Party is the oldest political party in the world. PBS says the party is the "world’s oldest existing political party." In a 2003 book review, the Washington Post called the party the "world’s oldest political party." And at a rally in Wisconsin, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine repeated the claim: "When I was standing on that stage, and the balloons were falling after Hillary (Clinton) had accepted the nomination, and my 81-year-old mother was there with me, and all of our extended family, my mom said to me: 'Tim, this is the greatest night of my life,'" Kaine said in an Aug. 5, 2016 appearance in Milwaukee. "Now, she was saying that partly because of me, but, but she was saying it because it was a historic night for the oldest continuous political party in the world, and for the first time in the history of the United States, to have a woman nominated for president." We decided to take a stroll through the history books to see if Kaine was right about the Democratic Party being the oldest continuous political party in the world. The experts we reached gave us an answer: Yes, but. "It’s a very common statement and it’s largely true, but it’s a little complicated," said Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University. U.S. history Both parties can trace their beginnings to the start of George Washington’s time as president (1789), but the path is more direct for Democrats. The political parties that eventually developed in the United States were the first modern political parties in the sense that they drew broader representation from the general electorate than political groups in other nations. The Democratic Party traces its roots to the early 1790s. At that point, Congress was starting to divide into two groups, said John Aldrich, a Duke University political science professor who wrote the book, "Why Parties?: The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America." But as a modern-looking continuous political party, it dates to either 1828, with the election of Andrew Jackson or 1832, when the party held its first national convention. Republicans could trace their roots back to Washington’s administration as well -- but the word "continuous" is key in this context. "The Democrats have established their claim that they’re the oldest continuous political party because the name changes less,"Jillson said. "The (two sides’) agendas, though, go all the way back to the first Washington administration in the 1790s." The Republican Party can trace itself -- by three different names -- to Washington’s first years, during which Alexander Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury and Thomas Jefferson was Secretary of State and they argued with each other in Washington’s cabinet, Jillson said. "The two parties grow out of that (those arguments) and so it’s right to say that the Democrats are the oldest continuous party but the Republicans could make the claim that under three different names their party is just as old," he said. The Federalists, originally associated with Hamilton’s policies, became the Whigs, which became, ultimately, the Republicans, Jillson said. But the line from Federalists to Republicans is more obscure, Aldrich said. Most would say that while there are some connections, the Whigs and the Republicans were really new parties, especially when compared to the more or less direct line between Jefferson and today’s party, Aldrich wrote in an email. The Republican Party says its founding came in the 1850s. The Republican National Committee describes its formation at a meeting in Ripon, Wisconsin, in 1854 and the party’s formal organization at a convention in Michigan that same year -- long after the Democrats. It held its first national convention in 1856. In the whole world? "In the U.S., we know the Democratic Party is older than the Republican Party and so the question is, is it older than other parties elsewhere in the world?" said Casey Dominguez, an associate professor at the University of San Diego’s Department of Political Science and International Relations. There are only a handful of other democracies in the world to compare to, she said. Our experts primarily compared the U.S. political parties to those in Great Britain. American political parties are recognized for their broad electorate that tends to line up behind the two major political parties, whereas that dynamic came much later in Britain, Jillson said. When political parties were developing in the United States, the British counterparts were more aggregations of elites. The Conservative and Liberal parties in Britain can trace their roots to well before the founding of the United States. But it was not until the Great Reform Act of 1867 that Britain began to develop modern parties in the sense that a broader swath of the electorate was able to participate. Our rating Kaine said that the Democratic Party is "the oldest continuous political party in the world." The political parties that developed in the United States were the first modern political parties in the sense that they drew broader representation from the general electorate than their predecessors in other nations. In the U.S., the Democratic Party is older than the Republican Party.

pomt-02167	Says Scott Brown "voted to give oil companies big tax breaks."	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/apr/30/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-says-scott-brown-voted-give-oi/	The Senate Majority PAC, which employs several former aides to Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has again struck former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who’s now running in New Hampshire to oust Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. The April 27, 2014, ad, titled "Baggage," focuses on Brown’s connection to "big oil." "Scott Brown’s carrying some big oil baggage," the narrator says. "In Massachusetts, he voted to give oil companies big tax breaks. They make record profits. He collects over $400,000 in campaign contributions." In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Brown’s votes. We’ll tackle his campaign contributions separately. The Senate Majority PAC cited Brown’s votes in 2010, 2011 and 2012 against measures that would have kept the "big five" oil companies (Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips) from taking advantage of existing tax breaks. Sponsors of the measures sought to apply the roughly $24 billion in additional tax revenue toward energy efficiency and conservation. Specifically, the measures would have prevented those five oil companies from using these existing tax breaks: • Deductions on taxes paid to foreign governments • Deductions on domestic manufacturing costs • Deductions for intangible drilling costs • Percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells • Deductions for qualified tertiary injectant expenses Three of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the "big five" oil firms. In each of these three years, the measures failed -- by margins of 35-61 in 2010, 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. Majorities weren’t enough in the final two years, since those measures required 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, was the only Republican to vote in favor of the 2012 bill. In 2011, she voted the same way, along with fellow Maine Republican Susan Collins. In 2010, no Republican supported the measure. Brown joined most Republicans and a few Democrats from oil states in voting against the measure each time it hit the floor. Ironically, the Senate Majority PAC supports this year’s re-election bids of two other Democratic senators who voted the same way on these measures as Brown did -- Mark Begich of Alaska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. The bill’s opponents sometimes cited a March 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded that withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump. In general, then, the ad is correct that Brown sided with the position of "big oil" on these votes. However, the ad’s claim is phrased slightly misleadingly. Rather than voting "to give oil companies big tax breaks," Brown voted not to take away the tax breaks that oil companies were already using. Also, it’s worth noting that two out of the five tax breaks in question were not targeted only at oil companies but were tax breaks that non-oil companies could benefit from, as well. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC ad said Brown "voted to give oil companies big tax breaks." For three years in a row, Brown did indeed vote against measures that would’ve barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed. That’s slightly different than what the ad says -- rather than voting to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Brown voted to support the status quo. Still, the ad is correct to suggest that Brown was voting in concert with the biggest oil companies on that legislation. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03091	Says President Barack Obama "has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own (health care) law."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/25/tom-graves/rep-graves-says-obama-has-changed-aca-19-times/	The Republican effort to defund Obamacare threatens a government shutdown at the end of the month. U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., is one lawmaker who believes the dangers of the health care law justify extreme measures. Over the summer, Graves called the Affordable Care Act "destructive" and a "job killer." "We need to make every effort to ensure Obamacare is never implemented," he said. Graves said President Barack Obama’s actions highlight the law’s terminal flaws. "Something very important has happened since the president did win the election," Graves said on ABC’s This Week. "He himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law. So if it's so good for America, then why he is delaying it for his friends in big business?" We wondered if in fact, Obama has made that many changes in the law. Graves’ office pointed us to a letter from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank for Congress. The Congressional Research Service review listed 19 times the Affordable Care Act changed since it was passed in 2010. The report counted 14 public laws and five administrative actions that made a variety of modifications to the law. For the record, we note that a dozen of those adjustments took place before the 2012 election, and not after as Graves said. The timing seems less important than the substance of what was done. Changes to the Affordable Care Act Some items on the list qualify as significant in the eyes of the health policy experts we contacted. One of the country’s leading authorities on health care law, Timothy Jost at the Washington and Lee School of Law, pointed to three: A one-year delay in requiring firms with over 50 workers to provide insurance Scrapping a long-term care insurance program (for nursing home care, for example) called the CLASS Act Lifting the requirement on businesses to file a form called a 1099 for a variety of business expenses The administration acted on its own to delay the employer mandate, explaining that the systems were not in place to implement it. The other two changes came through votes in Congress. "Congress couldn’t find a way to make the CLASS Act actuarially sound," Jost said, "so they repealed it and put the money elsewhere." As for the business reporting rule, "businesses said this was a huge burden and Congress responded," Jost said. "There was strong bipartisan support, and you could find the votes to make those sorts of changes." In addition to those three, a program to create consumer health insurance cooperatives was retained but lost $2.2 billion in funding. Most of the items on the Congressional Research Service list, however, are less dramatic. Several clarified that certain government health insurance programs would count as coverage under the individual mandate. This included Tricare, which covers the military, and insurance through Veterans Affairs. Other adjustments extended tax breaks, such as a tax credit for families that adopt a child. There were changes in the Medicaid federal matching formula (to keep money flowing to Louisiana after Katrina), and a tweak to the calculation of income that determines the level of premium subsidies in the insurance exchanges. Such changes are common in Congress, according to our experts. "Legislators aren't perfect," said Jost. "They don't get everything right the first time. That’s the nature of the legislative process." It is also clear that Obama did not drive the majority of the changes. They emerged as Congress worked on various elements of a multi-faceted law. Still, Obama signed off on those changes as part of larger pieces of legislation. We’ve been here before Graves’ comments suggest that so many changes to the health care law means it's fundamentally flawed. Actually, major pieces of legislation rarely remain the same as the day the president signs them into law. The Medicare prescription drug benefit, passed under President George W. Bush, was changed several times after its initial passage. Both that law and the recent health care law lay a government program on top of a complex private market system, said Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University. "Patches on a patchwork mean making a coherent quilt very difficult," Marmor said. Even though the country had about two years to get ready for the Medicare drug program, about the same as with Obamacare, some pieces were not in place when the program launched, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University. "States were worried that bunches of people would show up on Jan. 1, 2005, and not be able to get their prescription drugs," Hoadley said. "So some of them started picking up the tab." Later, Hoadley said, the Bush administration pulled money from another fund to reimburse the states. The law required insurance plans to set up systems to keep an eye on people who took many different medications. The goal was to make sure the drugs were compatible. The purpose was sensible but as of 2005, the technology wasn’t ready. "The decision was made that while that requirement was still there, there would be no enforcement until they had time to get things up and running," Hoadley said. "It took several years of saying ‘Lets not focus on this; it’s not the most important thing’." Our ruling Graves said Obama "himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law." Based on the analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, Graves has the right number. However, he simplifies the way that many of those 19 changes came about, and by doing that, makes it seem as though the president were more directly involved. Graves cited these changes as evidence that the law is fatally flawed but he glossed over the differences among them. Some of the changes were significant and some were technical or tangential to the health care law itself. The basic number is right but there are lot of details of details missing from Graves' assertion. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Tom Graves	None	None	None	2013-09-25T10:24:09	2013-09-22	['None']

pomt-00055	The U.S. Geological Survey increased Yellowstone volcano eruption threat level to "high"	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/03/blog-posting/no-yellowstone-volcanos-eruption-threat-level-did-/	Amid partisan allegations of political disasters, should we be more worried about the natural variety—and cancel any upcoming vacations to the first national park in the United States? "Yellowstone super volcano threat level just increased to ‘high’ by USGS," warned the headline on a story posted with a "preppers" tag on Oct. 29 on Disclose.tv. (USGS is th acronym for the U.S. Geological Survey, which provides science about natural hazards.) The Disclose.tv website lets users submit and share topics and videos that are supposedly ignored, denied or inadequately covered "by the mainstream media, governmental institutions and other information keepers." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Disclose.tv said in an email to PolitiFact that 100 percent of its content is user-generated. But at some point before we reached out, the headline was changed to read, "Yellowstone super volcano threat level set to ‘high’ by USGS," and it said it was posted to "nature," not "preppers." The Epoch Times, which posted a story on Oct. 25 about an eruption threat, also updated its coverage, but with a correction. "The Epoch Times published a misleading headline declaring the threat of Yellowstone volcano eruption had increased to ‘high.’ Yellowstone volcano’s ranking of 21st on the U.S. Geological Survey’s assessment has not changed." Yet another publication, the Post Register in Idaho, reported that the threat had been bumped from "moderate" to "high," though the newspaper cautioned that the Yellowstone caldera isn’t expected to "explode in a mega eruption anytime soon." Perhaps anticipating—or responding to—confusion over the volano’s threat assessment, USGS published its own article on Oct. 29 that explains what it all means. Here are the facts: Earlier this month, the agency released an updated threat assessment for U.S. volcanoes for the first time since the original assessment was published in 2005. The new assessment accounts for new research and observations over the past 13 years. In the 2005 assessment, Yellowstone is listed as a "high threat" volcano. In the 2018 assessment, Yellowstone is listed as a "high threat" volcano. Each volcano also has an overall threat score, which considers factors including average recurrence of eruptions, what types of eruptions have taken place and nearby infrastructure. In 2005, Yellowstone was ranked 21. In 2018, Yellowstone was ranked 21. "This qualifies Yellowstone as a ‘high threat’ volcanic system," according to the USGS article. "This is not a change or any sort of upgrade in the threat posed by Yellowstone, and carries no implications for future eruptive activity. It is merely a way to provide a sense of Yellowstone’s threat level compared to other volcanoes in the USA." It’s also important to note that the assessment is not an indicator of which volcanoes are most likely to erupt, according to USGS. It’s also not a ranking of the most active volcanoes (and "active" means that a volcano has erupted in the past 11,650 years). Rather, assessments gauge the relative risk a volcano poses to people and property. So if a volcano erupts but no one is living on it, it has a very low threat because no people or property are at risk, according to USGS. Meanwhile, "a volcano that might experience only small explosions but that is surrounded by towns and near an airport has a higher threat, since lots of people and property are exposed to the hazard (even if the hazard might be a relatively small one.)" We’ll let Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey and scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, have the last word. "In a nutshell, this whole ‘bumped Yellowstone’s volcano threat to high’ thing is a massive job of misreporting," Poland said in an email. "The threat level for the caldera system is rated as ‘high’ in a report that was issued by USGS. That report updates an initial report from 2005, in which Yellowstone was also rated ‘high.’ ... Nothing has changed" We rate this statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-11-03T11:19:11	2018-10-29	['None']

pomt-08113	You "can't check out a library book without a photo ID."	/texas/statements/2010/dec/11/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-you-cant-check-out-library-boo/	Advocating for a law that would require Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told an interviewer this summer that "you can't get on a plane without a photo ID, you can't buy Sudafed without a photo ID, you can't check out a library book without a photo ID . . . We need to protect the sanctity of our votes," he told a representative of Americans for Prosperity in a June 11 interview at the Republican State Convention in Dallas. Most everyone knows that airline passengers have to hand up a photo ID before going through airport security. And since 2005, Texas pharmacies have been required by state law to make a person purchasing pills containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or nopseudoephedrine to display a driver's license or other ID containing the purchaser's photograph, as noted online by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy. Sudafed, a decongestant, contains pseudoephedrine, according to WebMD, a medical information website. But showing your ID to check out a library book? To our inquiry, Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz shared information we confirmed indicating that applicants for library cards from the Austin, Dallas or San Antonio public libraries must present a photo ID. His point: If a photo ID is needed to get a card, that's like requiring a photo ID to check out a book. You need a card before you can check out a book. In Austin, according to its library website, adults seeking a card must apply in person at any branch and present a current photo ID plus proof of home address. Minors seeking a youth card may also apply at any branch, with a parent or guardian, the site says. "They should bring current photo ID and proof of current residence address," a library site says. Next, we looked into whether libraries around the country have identical photo-ID policies. Not so, according to Amy Sargent, spokeswoman for the Chicago-based Public Library Association, a division of the American Library Association. Sargent, who undertook an overview at our request, said via e-mail that "for as many listings we found of libraries that require a photo ID, we found as many that don't, so it's safe to say that the requirement is not nationally consistent" or "even consistent among types of libraries (urban, suburban, rural, etc...)." "Even if a photo ID is a primary requirement," her e-mail says, "many libraries seem to make concessions for people without IDs." According to the association, individuals seeking a Chicago library card must present a current ID with their photo or two pieces of current identification, such a a personal check, voter registration card or a current telephone, gas, electric or cable TV bill. Applicants for cards from the El Paso public library must show a photo ID or, if lacking picture identification, one type of non-photo ID with their name and current address. According to the association, applications for a card from the Montgomery County (Md.) library must be accompanied by "official identification," such as a driver's license, a check with pre-printed address or a postmarked letter addressed to the applicant. Photo IDs are required to get cards at libraries in San Diego, Calif.; Scottsdale, Ariz.; Manchester, N.H.; and Troy, Mich., Sargent said. And what about practices in Texas? Gloria Meraz, director of communications for the Texas Library Association, said local communities set their own policies. At our request, she asked librarians to share their approaches. From the responses, we learned that the Plano Public Library does not require a photo ID from applicants for library cards, while public libraries in Alamo, Allen, Baytown, Haslet, Irving, Richardson, Taylor and Wells Branch do have the ID hurdle. Broadly, many libraries require photo IDs to get a card, some do not. Still, we found no instances of libraries requiring a photo ID when actually checking out a book. Walz of Dewhurst's office said the lieutenant governor makes his point. "If there are libraries that do not require a photo ID" to get a card, "there are certainly some that do," Walz said. Our take: Dewhurst's claim confuses activities that are subject to uniform regulations in Texas--boarding a plane, purchasing Sudafed--with one that is subject to inconsistent, local rules. Photo IDs are always required to board a plane or purchase Sudafed, while public libraries simply don't require photo IDs at checkout. However, patrons of most libraries have to show a photo ID when applying for a library card, a factor that gives Dewhurst's statement an element of truth. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12432	"We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/17/scott-walker/testing-scott-walker-claim-record-education-findin/	As Gov. Scott Walker laid out his 2017-’19 budget, he touted the "historic investment in our priorities" -- including K-12 education. To that end, Walker declared: "We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin." More money than ever before? With Walker’s budget now before the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, where it will undergo changes, we wondered if that was the case. We took a look at the budgets back to fiscal year 1991, which provides about 25 years of data and shows the trajectory before state funding jumped significantly in the late 1990s. The answer, we found, depends on how you crunch the numbers. Total state aid vs. inflation-adjusted For starters, we took Walker’s statement to mean K-12 education, not a picture that would include colleges and universities, and the "we" to refer to money directly from the state. That’s based on the context within Walker’s Feb, 8, 2017, budget address and the K-12 education fact sheet linked from the address itself. And when we reached out to Walker’s office, a spokesman pointed us to page 6 of the "Budget in Brief," where K-12 education is addressed. That page in the briefing document shows that state aid to schools for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (the years covered by Walker’s budget) would be the highest in raw numbers -- at least back to fiscal year 2009, where the chart on the page ends. The $11.5 billion over the two years would amount to the largest tally in state history. That figure shakes out to $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. But when you compare figures over time, it’s important to take inflation into account. That is, costs grow, prices grow, the economy grows. Adjusting for inflation puts everything on an equal footing. To get inflation-adjusted state aid, we took the raw numbers from past reports from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and gathered data back to fiscal year 1991. We put the figures through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator and also compared our inflation-adjusted numbers to those run by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Both calculations found that fiscal year 2003 was the highest inflation-adjusted year for state aid to schools. That year, the raw total in state aid was $4.8 billion. But the tally by the Taxpayers Alliance found that inflation-adjusted state aid that year totaled $6.5 billion. That’s far more than the $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion proposed for the next two years in Walker’s budget plan. The bigger picture Although inflation-adjusted state aid is the best measure, we decided to examine another calculation. In Wisconsin, state aid doesn’t tell the full story in terms of how much money is going to schools. What’s known as the "revenue cap" imposes a limit on funding by local school districts. That means that without a referendum to exceed the limit, if state aid to schools goes up, local property taxes would go down, leaving a district with the same amount of funding. At the same time, the state can give schools additional money outside the revenue cap. "The revenue limit did not go up the last two years," said Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance. "However, what they’ve done is for the past about six years they’ve been giving the schools money outside the revenue limit." That brings us to "per-pupil" funding. Knapp took the inflation-adjusted total of state aid and property taxes allocated to schools and divided that by full-time equivalent enrollment for fiscal years 1997 through 2017. If you slice the numbers that way, fiscal year 2011 is the highest at $13,112 per student. That compares to $12,329 in the current fiscal year. The challenge with calculating per-pupil aid is knowing enrollment numbers, which are difficult to predict for 2018 and 2019. Knapp said even this number comes with another important caveat. "Generally, per student funding has risen over the years, even after accounting for inflation," he said. "That it peaked in 2011 is also not a surprise as funding was cut in 2012. However, Act 10 saved districts enough to cover those cuts. Thus, you have to be careful about how you think about that. "Essentially, school costs were reset at a lower level in that year, and they have generally been rising since." Our rating Walker said in his budget address -- and in the weeks and months since -- that Wisconsin is investing more in education than ever in the history of the state. This is true in raw dollars but the statement doesn’t account for inflation-adjusted numbers, which is the best way to look at figures over time. When adjusted for inflation, fiscal year 2003 would be the highest ever. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-03406	"In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for (expanded background checks.)"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/01/joe-manchin/sen-joe-manchin-says-1999s-nra-supported-expanded-/	Washington may have moved on to immigration and the scandal du jour, but the gun law debate still simmers in states like Sen. Joe Manchin’s West Virginia. Dueling ads from the NRA and Manchin target West Virginia voters: "Tell Senator Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment!" and "Call the NRA and tell them to support criminal background checks!" Manchin’s not giving up his quest to broaden gun buyer background checks, the Associated Press reported June 26, 2013. The Democratic senator told Chris Matthews on MSNBC that he’s still making his case to the people in West Virginia to resurrect the bill that died in April. "When they start seeing what we have done to the bill, you know what they said? And you mean the NRA in Washington is against this? We have been fighting for some of these provisions for the last decade or more. "And I said, all we have done — and I said, guess what? In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this. I haven't changed. They changed, Chris." Was the NRA leadership for the provisions of Manchin’s gun proposal back in ‘99? ‘Instant criminal background checks’ We’ve checked related claims from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Barack Obama that Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, once supported wider background checks. It’s true he told a House subcommittee in May 1999 that "it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes for anyone." But the House rejected an expansion of background checks in June 1999 — a rejection the NRA supported. A Washington Post headline at the time said, "NRA Achieves Its Goal: Nothing." LaPierre’s testimony before the House subcommittee hadn’t been in support of background checks legislation — it was against an amendment from Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.. In his testimony, he outlined a set of proposals the NRA at the time found "reasonable," such as "instant criminal background checks." But the crux of his testimony was that he found provisions of the legislation unreasonable, such as the way the legislation defined a gun show, how the law handled inheritance of weapons, and that the instant check system didn’t destroy records of transactions immediately. The NRA ultimately backed legislation in the House that did expand background checks to sales at gun shows — but cut the time allowed for background checks to 24 hours, a change that ultimately killed the legislation. Manchin’s recent legislation, which he offered with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, addressed a number of the NRA’s concerns with Lautenberg’s 1999 provisions. (We summarized Manchin-Toomey back in April.) It didn’t apply background checks to transfers between close relatives. Its definition of a gun show increased the number of guns from 50 to 75 and excluded residences of private collectors. It ultimately would have cut the time allowed for background checks down to 24 hours. But the NRA still challenged applying background checks to transfers between distant relatives and "lifelong friends," for example, echoing its opposition to 1999 proposals. Our ruling Manchin explained his continued pursuit of expanding background checks, saying that in 1999, even "the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this." He’s correct that LaPierre, at the center of the most recent gun legislation battle, testified before lawmakers that the NRA supported "mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale."

pomt-13522	Says Gov. Pat McCrory "tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years."	/north-carolina/statements/2016/sep/01/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-ad-attacking-pat-mccrory-education-leav/	Education continues to be front-and-center in the North Carolina governor’s race. The latest ad from Democratic candidate Roy Cooper features a teacher talking about how teachers have to buy supplies for their jobs, and how she decided to move to another state that pays teachers more. "Gov. Pat McCrory talks about raising our pay, but he tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years," she says. "Like over 2,000 other teachers, I’m having to move to another state so I can do what I love and make ends meet. Someone needs to fix this." We wondered if McCrory really did suggest cutting education funding to the lowest share of the overall state budget in more than 30 years. First, though, we have to figure out what the ad was talking about. The state’s education budget is broken into three categories – higher education, community colleges and K-12. Since the ad is entirely about K-12 schools and the claim is spoken by that K-12 teacher, our first impression was that the claim was about K-12 funding. Cooper’s campaign told us it was actually referring to the total education budget. However, we believe a normal person viewing this ad will think it’s talking about K-12 funding. So we’ll look at both. Overall education spending North Carolina’s budget is tweaked annually, although the big-picture budget is set every other year, during odd-numbered years. In his 2015 proposal, McCrory suggested spending 56 percent of the budget on public schools, community colleges and universities in 2015-16, and 54.4 percent in 2016-17. It was that drop to 54.4 percent that Cooper’s campaign honed in on. They cited data from McCrory’s own budget that went back to 1981-82 and showed larger portions in all of those years. McCrory spokesman Ricky Diaz said the historically low proposal was because of uncertainty surrounding tax cuts. He added that the funding "was always expected to be increased when the legislature came back ... after the state's revenue picture became more clear as the governor's tax cuts took hold, improving the economy and in turn, increasing revenue." We should note here that the N.C. General Assembly did not take McCrory’s advice. In 2015 it allocated 55.5 percent of state funding to education for 2016-17, more than a percentage point above McCrory’s proposal. And in July 2016, lawmakers increased the 2016-17 share to 56.8 percent. And that 56.8 percent share is, furthermore, less than what McCrory suggested in 2016. His proposal that year would have given education 57.5 percent of the state budget. That would’ve been the highest share since 2009-10, not the lowest in 30 years. Neither of McCrory’s suggestions were adopted by the legislature, high or low. But the ad specifically said McCrory "tried to cut" education’s budget share, so it’s fair to look at what McCrory proposed instead of what actually passed. And on that evidence, the claim is accurate about McCrory’s 2015 proposal. His 2016 proposal, however, suggested the largest budget share for education since the recession. K-12 only Next we’ll look only at the portion of the budget spent on K-12 schools. In 1981-82, the state spent 44 percent of its money on K-12. In 2015, McCrory suggested a 2016-17 spending level of 37.8 percent of the budget. That’s a drop, but it was not the "lowest budget share in over 30 years." In 2008-09, 2010-11 and 2012-13, the budget’s share of K-12 funding was even lower. The 2008-09 budget was under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley. The other were under Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue. The first two were passed by a Democrat-led legislature, and the 2012-13 budget was passed by a Republican-led legislature. Per-pupil funding McCrory’s campaign pointed out that the budget shares for overall education spending and for K-12 specifically also fell while Cooper was in the General Assembly. Cooper served in the House of Representatives from 1987-91 and in the Senate from 1991 until 2001, when he became attorney general. From 1987 to 2001 the share of the budget going to all types of education dropped from 68 to 60.1 percent. The K-12 share dropped from 45.5 to 42.4 percent. So the same thing Cooper’s accusing McCrory of also happened when Cooper and his fellow Democrats were in charge of the budget. Cooper’s campaign defended his record, though. Megan Jacobs, his campaign spokeswoman, said education’s 60.1 percent budget share in Cooper’s final year in the Senate was "almost 6 percent higher than what McCrory proposed here. It was also the highest it had been since 1993-94, which was before (Cooper) rose to senior leadership." So both Cooper and McCrory oversaw budgets that gave a smaller slice of the pie to education. But both also oversaw increases to per-pupil funding – a metric experts agree is a more indicative measure of support. Cooper knows all about the importance of per-pupil spending; we previously ruled his claim that North Carolina is near the bottom nationally as Mostly True. And per-pupil funding – from a combination of state, local and federal sources – rose under Cooper and has also risen under McCrory. Let’s rewind 20 years to the 1995-96 school year when Cooper was midway through his legislative career. North Carolina schools got $5,090 per student, the equivalent of $7,916 in 2015 dollars. Cooper’s last budget was for 2000-01, when he was the Democratic majority leader in the Senate. Schools that year received $6,654 per pupil, the equivalent of $9,158 in 2015 dollars. For comparison, North Carolina spent $8,496 per student in 2013-14 – McCrory’s first budget, and a few dollars higher than the year prior – and an estimated $8,898 in 2015-16, according to the National Education Association. Our ruling Cooper said McCrory "tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years." McCrory’s proposed budget in 2015 did suggest doing exactly that for the 2016-17 school year, although McCrory later adjusted his proposal in 2016, when his budget’s share of education funding would’ve been the highest since 2009-10. That’s a detail the ad leaves out, along with the fact that the share of the budget going to education also declined when Cooper was in the legislature. Since the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/59591c46-5118-4647-82a3-682071f7ea26	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2016-09-01T14:51:27	2016-08-29	['Pat_McCrory']
pomt-14209	"Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-ad-ignores-fact-members-congress-ca/	A new television ad by Sen. Bernie Sanders describes a very lucrative method for making money if you're a politician in Washington. "Wall Street banks shower Washington politicians with campaign contributions and speaking fees," the ad says. "And what do they get for it? A rigged economy, tax breaks and bailouts, all held in place by a corrupt campaign finance system. And while Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches, they oppose raising the living wage to $15 an hour. $200,000 an hour for them, but not even 15 bucks an hour for all Americans. Enough is enough." The ad was played in New York in the days leading to the state’s April 19 primary. The ad was clearly going after Sanders' Democratic opponent, former U.S. Sen. and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who made lots of money giving speeches after leaving government in 2013. Sanders has argued that Clinton can't effectively regulate Wall Street when she has taken so much money from the big banks. But the language of the ad is much broader than that, making three references to Washington politicians in general and twice linking them to a $200,000 per hour payment. In addition, four of the 11 camera shots in the 30-second ad show the United States Capitol building, the headquarters of Congress. There are no shots of the White House or institutions such as the Federal Reserve or the State Department. The clear impression is that Sanders is talking — exclusively or not — about members of Congress, the premiere political class of Washington. Can they really accept more than $200,000 an hour for speeches? The ad is very misleading. Senators and representatives have been prohibited from accepting money for speeches since 1991. Before then, members of Congress would often accept speaking fees from the industries they oversaw, which critics characterized as a form of bribery. And it's not just members of Congress. In the House, for example, even senior staff can't be paid for speeches, appearances or writing an article. Junior staff also can't do it if the topic relates to their official duties. The executive branch has a similar ban. But once a person leaves government service, those rules no longer apply, and they're free to charge for speeches. As we reported a year ago, Clinton was typically earning honorariums of about $225,000 per speech and, in some instances, over $300,000 each. Again, these happened after she left office. When we asked the Sanders campaign about the ad's claim, they sent along a list of links reporting on what some former federal government employees were getting for their speeches. They included: * $100,000-$175,000 for George W. Bush, who insists on a non-disclosure agreement so the sponsors can't say what they paid the former president (Politico). * At least $250,000 for a speech in Abu Dhabi by former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. His predecessor, Alan Greenspan, reportedly received comparable pay to speak at the private Lehman Brothers dinner after he left the Fed (Reuters). But the Sanders camp also sent links to stories about Mitt Romney making $68,000 for a speech (USA Today) and Jeb Bush commanding about $50,000 per talk (New York Times). That's far less than $200,000, and neither has held any significant elected or appointed office in Washington. And none of these people listed by Sanders had any kind of vote in the recent debate over the $15 minimum wage (which also sounds like a veiled shot at Clinton). Finally, we should note that it's a stretch to say that someone who earns $200,000 for a speech is earning $200,000 an hour. Most speeches require some preparation, research and travel time. It's akin to saying that a pastor paid $30,000 a year is earning $577 an hour because that's how long a Sunday service lasts. Our ruling Sanders said in an ad that uses repeated shots of the U.S. Capitol that "Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches." His ad is disingenuous on many levels. Politicians trying to get to Washington, or those who have come from Washington, certainly can earn such fees, but members of the House and Senate and top officials in the executive branch are not permitted to accept payment for speeches. And Sanders' campaign is including politicians who have never served in Washington in any significant capacity. Because the statement contains a small element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19e74cb2-d6b7-4ba0-8088-ed2767c75a31	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-20T10:00:00	2016-04-15	['None']

pomt-01471	A 2011 measure passed into law with Wendy Davis’ support "removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like" the school funding case.	/texas/statements/2014/sep/30/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-blames-wendy-davis-limit-settlements-p/	UPDATE, 4 p.m., Oct. 8, 2014: We updated this article with detail about how the attorney general carries out the 2007 mandate that certain legal settlements win legislative consent. This change did not affect our rating of Abbott’s debate statement. Given an opportunity, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis pressed Republican Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, about his office continuing to battle school districts in court despite a state district judge ruling the school finance system to be both underfunded and unconstitutional. "The only thing right now coming between our children and appropriate funding of their schools today is you," Davis asserted in the pair's Sept. 19, 2014, debate in the Rio Grande Valley. "On behalf of the 5 million children of this state, will you agree tonight that you will drop your appeals and allow our schools to be appropriately funded?" Abbott responded by blaming legislators, including Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, for limiting his options. "Sen. Davis," Abbott replied, "there is actually another thing coming between me and settling that lawsuit. And that is a law that you voted on and helped pass in 2011 that removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like this." Did legislators including Davis move to keep the attorney general from settling lawsuits? We started this fact check by asking the Abbott campaign for elaboration. Spokeswoman Amelia Chasse pointed to a proposal that won legislative approval in 2011, with Davis among supporters. Then again, it came clear, the legislative leash on the attorney general’s ability to settle cases originated in 2007 action -- more than a year before Davis won her first Senate term. The 2007 law said the attorney general must get legislative approval/consent to settle matters with damages costing the state more than $25 million. The 2011 change lowered the threshold to $10 million. Resolving the school-finance matter would surely cost more than either limit. In 2013 and again in August 2014, state District Judge John Dietz of Austin ruled against the state in the case, though he also gave lawmakers until July 2015 to act. At the time of the Davis-Abbott debate, state lawyers overseen by Abbott were expected to appeal to the Texas Supreme Court (which they did a few days later). By email, David Thompson, a lawyer representing hundreds of districts in the litigation, told us either settlement threshold -- $10 million or the previous $25 million -- "would be substantially below what it will take to resolve the school finance lawsuit." Meantime, former state Sen. Steve Ogden, who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and authored the settlement thresholds that passed into law, told us by phone that Abbott can’t settle the school case without the Legislature’s permission "because it’s going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to do it." He and Rep. Tryon Lewis, R-Odessa, chairman of the House Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence Committee, were guided to us by Chasse. Both said the 2011 action effectively toughened and arguably reaffirmed the original restriction. Here are the details behind the legislation leashing the attorney general’s power: In 2007, according to legislative records, Ogden, R-Bryan, won passage of Senate Bill 2031,which required legislative consent or approval of the settlement or compromise of a claim or action against the state involving state expenditures exceeding $25 million. Specifically, the law barred the attorney general or any lawyer representing the state from entering into a settlement of a claim without legislative consent or approval. The new law said this limit applies if the settlement requires the state to pay damages exceeding the $25 million in a biennium or if it "commits this state to a course of action that in reasonable probability will entail a continuing increased expenditure of state funds over subsequent" two-year periods, which strikes us as sweeping in a possible resolution of the school suit. In May 2007, very few legislators objected to Ogden’s proposal as it headed toward Gov. Rick Perry. A House Democrat voted "no" in that body’s final vote and three Democratic senators cast "no" votes when the Senate later agreed to House amendments. Four years later, with Davis in the Senate, lawmakers and Perry signed off on Senate Bill 899, reducing the dollar threshold for legislative involvement. An accompanying analysis, by the in-house Senate Research Center, said: "In keeping with increased scrutiny of state expenditures, this bill would lower the threshold settlement amount requiring legislative approval from $25 million to $10 million." Senators including Davis unanimously advanced the reduction to the House, where it won approval with one Republican voting "no." To recap: Davis was not in the Legislature when lawmakers initially limited the attorney general’s ability to settle cases. She was a member of the Senate that approved a toughening. We asked Abbott’s office to explain how, day to day, the limit has been applied to cases. A spokesman, Jerry Strickland, replied after we initially published this fact check, saying by email: "Procedurally, when a settlement may implicate the statute, the opposing party is notified that any settlement reached will be subject to legislative approval. The terms of the settlement are negotiated before the settlement is brought to the Legislature. The Legislature can then approve, reject or request modifications to a settlement." We also asked about the attorney general’s biennial reports to lawmakers on such settlements; such reports were required by the 2007 law. Each biennium, Strickland said, the agency "provides privileged attorney-client communications concerning potential settlements requiring legislative approval. If a settlement is reached, the settlement is presented to the Legislature for consideration." Our ruling Abbott said Davis voted for a 2011 measure that removes the attorney general’s ability to settle lawsuits like the school funding case. That’s not so; a 2007 law created the legislative hurdle for major settlements -- and, significantly, Davis wasn’t a senator then. Still, this claim has an element of truth because Davis joined nearly every other lawmaker in tightening the limit in 2011 by reducing the threshold for settlements the attorney general may reach without legislative sign-off to those costing the state $10 million or less. Given how Abbott characterized the law at issue, we rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-02017	Ken "Block supports Obamacare."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/08/allan-fung/gubernatorial-candidate-allan-fung-says-his-republ/	In the contest to be the next Republican candidate for governor in Rhode Island, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung has released a TV commercial that lampoons supporters of his GOP opponent, businessman Ken Block. The commercial, called "Blockhead," portrays them with large, cube-shaped heads and has them espousing positions that most Republicans would find objectionable, as "Over the Waves," a song often heard during circus trapeze acts, plays in the background. One of the "blockhead" characters says: "Block supports Obamacare," a reference to the Affordable Care Act that Republicans in Congress have tried to repeal, gut or delay more than 50 times. When the ad was released June 2, 2014, Block's campaign manager Jeff Britt, publicly invited PolitiFact Rhode Island to evaluate the claim because, he said, it misrepresents Block’s position on Obamacare. How could we resist? Britt sent us an email stating, unequivocally, that "Ken never supported Obamacare." He added that Block, who "has frankly been a strong critic, pointing out in speeches and in radio interviews how devastating it has been to his business." When Block, president of a Barrington software firm, reacted to the commercial on Buddy Cianci's WPRO radio show, he made the same assertion: "I've never supported Obamacare, in fact I've whacked Obamacare pretty hard because of the negative impact it's had on my business and the cost of acquiring insurance." While we were waiting for information from the Fung campaign seeking the source of its claim, we examined a new flier from Fung’s campaign that made a slightly different claim about Block's support for Obamacare. It shows a green-faced Block, along with Gov. Lincoln Chafee, depicted as "Two Peas in a Pod" because both "have been cheerleaders for liberal agendas." "Both supported Obamacare," it asserts, characterizing Block's support in the past tense. So where's the truth? Unlike the television ad, which lists no source for its claim, the flier says the claim is based on Block's Nov. 15, 2013 appearance on the WPRI-TV show "Newsmakers." Four minutes into that program, Block states that he has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, including President Obama in 2012. "In 2012, I bought what Barack Obama was selling in terms of changes to health care for me as a small business owner, someone who buys insurance for employees. I can no longer afford to do what we're doing. And I believed that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, was going to provide the kind of relief that we needed in my business to insure my employees," he says. "And it turns out that the promise didn't live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote," Block continued. "I'm looking for answers and those answers didn't come." In other words, Block acknowledged in November that he did support the promise of Obamacare, signed into law in March 2010, and Obama's reelection in 2012, but stated that he no longer supports that law. And on March 31, the enrollment deadline for Obamacare, Block released a statement, published in The Providence Journal, characterizing it as "a horrible bill, ill-conceived, unilaterally passed by one party, and terribly implemented." He said it "raised taxes and massively disrupted the health insurance market in Rhode Island without increasing competition, access, or affordability." Even if Fung hadn’t seen that story, we know he is aware of Block’s earlier repudiation of Obamacare. That’s because when Fung appeared on "Newsmakers" on April 11, moderator Tim White challenged Fung over his internet ad that selectively quoted Block's November "Newsmaker" appearance. He noted that the Fung ad clipped out Block's phrase, "The promise didn’t live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote." Fung said he didn't have a problem with the omission. Despite this, the "Blockhead" commercial says "Block supports Obamacare," asserting that he supports the controversial health care law today. When the Fung campaign got back to us, spokesmen Patrick Sweeney and Robert Coupe argued that it is accurate to say that Block supports Obamacare today because Block has never called for repeal of the law, as other opponents have and has never formally revoked the support he acknowledged in the November "Newsmakers" appearance. On the latter point, we disagree. Block has repeatedly made it clear he no longer supports Obamacare. The very "Newsmakers" appearance the Fung campaign cites in its attack on Block shows that. In light of all the evidence, it is clear that Fung is making a ridiculously blockheaded claim. We rate it Pants On Fire.

pomt-11676	There is "substantial evidence of voter fraud."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-theres-substantial-evidence-vote/	President Donald Trump is closing the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a panel to investigate voter fraud that had attracted controversy during its short life. The commission -- headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- had been "bedeviled by internal dissension, threats of litigation and the refusal of some states to provide information. Its last known meeting was Sept. 12," NBC reported. The panel included a few Democrats, but its membership was majority Republican. One Democratic member of the commission even filed a lawsuit, demanding to be kept abreast of its activities. Separately, the Government Accountability Office, a federal agency, announced in October 2017 that it would probe its handling of voter files and other issues, in response to calls by Democratic lawmakers. In a statement on Jan. 3, 2018, announcing his decision to disband the commission, Trump said, "Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry. Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action." PolitiFact is separately checking a different assertion by Trump, that "mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data" to the commission. In this fact-check, we’re looking at whether Trump is correct that there is "substantial evidence of voter fraud." This is hardly the first time Trump has made an assertion of this sort. He has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we’ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Trump has not yet produced any evidence that supports these claims, and the White House did not respond to another request for this article. The White House’s previous argument In a press briefing on Jan. 24, 2017, a reporter asked his then-press secretary Sean Spicer how Trump came to believe that it’s possible that illegal votes were to blame for his popular vote loss. "I think there's been studies," Spicer responded. "There's one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens. There's other studies that have been presented to him. It's a belief he maintains." We determined that Spicer was conflating a couple different studies, and that those studies have been erroneously used to prop up claims that noncitizens have swayed elections by voting illegally. There is no study that shows 14 percent of the votes cast in 2008 were cast by noncitizens. That would have added up to more than 18 million fraudulent votes — an implausible assertion, considering the total noncitizen population was about 22.5 million in 2010. As for the study that "came out of Pew in 2008," it actually came out in 2012, and it’s about outdated voter rolls -- not fraudulent votes. The 2012 Pew study -- found that about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are inaccurate or no longer valid, but it did not find evidence of actual voter fraud. The study was about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. David Becker, the former director of Pew’s election program, tweeted in November 2016 that "we found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted." Meanwhile, the study that shows that "14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens" has been widely criticized for its methodology. Many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error. In a blog post, one of the authors, Old Dominion professor Jesse Richman, said he stands by his study, but "our results suggest that almost all elections in the U.S. are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions." Voter fraud uncommon Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread. • News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. • A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. "Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper," reads the 2007 report. • In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s administration tried to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the rolls. Meanwhile, ProPublica, an investigative journalism project, tweeted that "we had 1,100 people monitoring the vote on Election Day. We saw no evidence the election was ‘rigged’ " and "no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted illegally." Expert opinion In our previous articles on this topic, numerous election experts dismissed assertions like those made by Trump. Asked again for this article, experts agreed that nothing new had emerged as a result of the commission’s work. Trump’s claim "is not accurate at all," said Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who specializes in election law. "There has been no proof of substantial voter fraud in the 2016 election. We have seen really just a smattering of isolated cases." Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University political scientist and author of The Myth of Voter Fraud, said that her efforts to track the issue since 2001, including as an expert witness, has enabled her to study election processes up close in such states as Wisconsin, Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Kansas. Her conclusion? "I am not aware of any evidence of substantial voter fraud ever being offered or presented to state legislatures adopting voter ID laws, or in any of the litigation in which states, as defendants, have brought forth such evidence to defend why they adopted the laws," Minnite said. Our ruling In his statement, Trump said there is "substantial evidence of voter fraud." That wasn’t accurate before, and it isn’t accurate now. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12147	"It costs us about $33,000 a year (on average nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year."	/california/statements/2017/aug/09/kamala-harris/does-it-cost-75k-year-lock-inmate-california/	U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris believes taxpayers aren’t "getting a good return on investment" when it comes to California’s prison system. The California Democrat told the Women Unshackled forum in Washington D.C. in July that alternatives to locking up inmates, such as drug treatment programs, are far cheaper and sometimes more effective than prison sentences. Her figures for California’s per inmate costs were eye-opening. "Let’s look at the fact that there is an issue around how much we are paying — and again, this gets back to the economic cost — it costs us about $33,000 a year to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year," Harris said on July 18, 2017. Harris makes her claim at about the 16:50 minute mark in the video above. Harris made criminal justice reform a top priority during her time as California’s attorney general and has done the same so far in the Senate. Recently, she teamed up with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to push bipartisan bail reform legislation that would prevent minor offenders from sitting in jail if they can’t afford the cost of being released before trial. In discussing prison costs, Harris said governments should place a greater focus on crime prevention and drug treatment given the high cost of incarceration. We interpreted Harris's claim about per inmate expenses to mean the operational costs to house male and female inmates, including security, health care, facility upkeep and employee compensation. Advocates for criminal justice reform often argue that just looking at the operational costs of running prisons ignores the social costs of incarcerating Americans. We looked at those costs as well, but based our rating primarily on the evidence supporting the numbers Harris cited in her Women Unshackled appearance. Our research A spokesperson for Harris provided us with data on the cost of federal incarceration, from the independent Vera Institute of Justice, as well as numbers for California, based on Gov. Jerry Brown’s spending plan for the 2017-18 fiscal year. In its May 2017 report "The Price of Prisons," the Vera Institute examined the cost to house inmates at prisons nationwide. It obtained data for 45 states and found the total cost per inmate averaged $33,274. The institute advocates for reducing inmate totals and improving conditions in prisons. It reported receiving about three-quarters of its funding from the federal government. The study’s findings support Harris’ claim on the average cost of housing inmates nationally. But what about the California’s per inmate price of $75,000? For that figure, Harris’ spokesman cited a June 2017 article by the Associated Press. It estimated the cost per inmate would reach a record $75,560 in the current fiscal year. The AP based its estimate on the money Gov. Brown set aside in this year’s budget for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. To verify this figure and put it in context, we examined the governor’s 2017-18 budget and contacted the Brown Administration’s corrections and finance departments, as well as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. These sources pointed us to the projected $76,320 cost per inmate in Brown’s 2017-18 budget. That qualifies as "about $75,000" as Harris put it. A spokeswoman for the state’s corrections department told us California paid about $73,000 per inmate last fiscal year, also very close to Harris’ number. Cost in context While Harris’ numbers are nearly spot on, we wanted to know what’s driving this high cost to lock up prisoners in California. The expense to house each inmate has doubled since 2005, even as court orders reduced the prison population by about a quarter, according to the Associated Press. Several reasons account for the dramatic increase. Viewed simply, fewer inmates combined with higher corrections spending equals a higher per capita cost. But why are there fewer inmates and higher spending? California was forced to cut inmate levels after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that overcrowding in prisons violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The drop in inmates hasn’t led to the closure of any prisons and hasn’t led to a reduction of prison staffing that corresponds directly to the drop in inmates. Jonathan Peterson, an analyst at the Legislative Analyst’s Office, said that’s because there are security requirements at the prisons that don’t allow for the elimination of guards simply because there are fewer inmates. "Regardless of how many inmates are in a particular unit, you still need the one guard to open and close the doors," Peterson said. The governor’s budget expects a nearly 2-to-1 inmate to prison staff ratio for the current fiscal year. That’s down from a ratio of a 2.24-to-1 just two years ago. Higher employee costs Just as the inmate population started to drop, employee compensation in the prison system jumped significantly. The corrections department budget has gone up $1.2 billion since 2012 due to employee compensation and retirement costs, according to the Department of Finance. Of that increase, $436 million is directly tied to increased pension contributions by the state for prison employees. Additionally, in July 2013, the state opened the California Health Care Facility providing 2,600 beds for inmates needing medical attention. The facility has cost $288 million since it opened, the finance department reported. California voters have contributed to the shrinking prison population in recent years by approving ballot measures that reclassify many felony drug and property crimes as misdemeanors and improving chances for parole for offenders classified as nonviolent. These measures are expected to further reduce the prison population by thousands of inmates. If that happens and prison employee costs rise or stay stable, California’s per capita inmate expense will continue to be higher than other states. Our ruling Sen. Kamala Harris recently claimed "it costs us about $33,000 a year (nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year." A recent study that examined costs in 45 states plus data from California’s departments of corrections and finance support the senator’s statement. Digging deeper, we found reducing inmates in California’s prisons, which Harris supports, may actually increase the per capita costs she highlights. That will be especially true if salary and pension costs continue to increase as inmate numbers drop. Harris doesn’t make a specific claim about what’s driving these costs. Her statement centers on the costs alone to house inmates nationally and in California. The evidence supports the figures she cited. We rate Harris' claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-02034	"The numbers make it clear that Georgia voters are increasingly taking advantage of early voting opportunities."	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/04/brian-kemp/early-voting-grows-popularity/	In the run-up to the May 20 primary elections, Georgia voters were deluged with candidate robocalls. Former Gov. Sonny Perdue even began his automated call by apologizing for ringing voters’ phones at dinnertime on election eve. Perdue said he just had to make a last-minute pitch for his cousin David Perdue, who went on to finish first in the crowded GOP race for the U.S. Senate. For many people, the automated campaign calls aren’t just annoying, they also are irrelevant. For the primary, more than 239,000 voters went to the polls in advance of Election Day to cast ballots for U.S. senator, governor, and a long list of state and local officeholders. An additional 772,643 followed on Election Day. Secretary of State Brian Kemp said the numbers "make clear that Georgia voters are increasingly taking advantage of early-voting opportunities." Kemp was specifically comparing early votes from the primaries in 2010 (at 19 percent) to 2014 (at 24.2 percent), Kemp spokesman Jared Thomas said. We decided to see whether Kemp is right. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have early voting -- Georgia included. "We were one of the later states to come to the table. By that time, it had already become a pretty accepted practice," former Secretary of State Cathy Cox recalled. "It just makes such common sense in a busy world." The Georgia General Assembly passed legislation in 2003, allowing a one-week early-voting period, the Monday through Friday before Election Day. By the 2004 general election, when Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry for president, 13 percent of Georgia voters cast ballots early. Since then, the number of voters who have cast their ballots early has generally risen steadily, according to data from the Secretary of State’s Office. They soared to the highest level -- 53 percent -- in the 2008 election, when Barack Obama was elected president, the data show. Last month, they accounted for 24.2 percent of votes in the GOP and Democratic primaries. Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, said looking at the presidential elections in 2004, 2008 and 2012 and the midterm elections for governor in 2006 and 2010, "it’s clear that early voting is now quite common." "The fact that more than a third of Georgia voters cast early ballots in 2012 is impressive," Gillespie said. Here’s the specifics: Election Early votes Total votes cast % registered voters % early votes 2004 Primary 90,266 1,401,915 35% 6% 2004 Primary Runoff 36,076 559,920 14% 6% 2004 General 422,814 3,303,453 78% 13% 2004 General Runoff 25,145 254,376 6% 10% 2006 Primary 129,129 924,480 22% 14% 2006 Primary Runoff 51,865 396,360 9% 13% 2006 General 375,536 2,139,235 49% 18% 2006 General Runoff 51,171 219,485 5% 23% 2008 Primary 218,179 1,012,257 21% 22% 2008 Primary Runoff 91,292 464,189 10% 20% 2008 General 2,093,029 3,939,235 76% 53% 2008 General Runoff 553,614 2,109,917 41% 26% 2010 Primary 212,487 1,116,820 23% 19% 2010 Primary Runoff 88,734 688,261 14% 13% 2010 General 783,702 2,622,729 52% 30% 2010 General Runoff 57,965 290,325 6% 20% 2012 Primary 412,541 1,644,066 32% 25% 2012 Primary Runoff 98,562 412,222 8% 24% 2012 General 1,922,144 3,911,750 73% 49% 2014 Primary 239,031 987,618 20% 24% Source: Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp's Office PolitiFact has looked previously at the research on in-person early voting that’s been growing as more states have added this option. Before 2008, much of the research suggested that early voting did not raise the overall level of voter participation in presidential contests over several decades. But that year in Obama’s run to become the first African-American president, and in major elections since, prominent researchers have detected a small turnout increase due to early voting, especially among black voters. Some top researchers say the increase is not significant. "Our take on this is that instead of increasing turnout, it just makes it easier for those who would have voted on Election Day to show up at other times to vote," Jan E. Leighley, a co-author with Jonathan Nagler of "Who Votes Now? Demographics, Issues, Inequality and Turnout in the United States," told PolitiFact earlier this year. Cox said Georgia officials had hoped early voting would boost overall voter participation. But Maxine Daniels, who runs elections in DeKalb County, said she hasn’t seen that result. "It’s not an uptick in voting. It’s basically a shift in when people vote," Daniels said. "It just made it easier for the people who were going to vote anyway." There have been other benefits, Daniels and Cox said. Election Day lines are shorter, and counties have been spared the costs of adding more voting machines and ramping up staffing of the polls on Election Day, they said. Georgia has changed its rules on early voting more than once. After having early voting for one week in advance of the elections in 2003 and 2004, the law was amended in 2005 to allow a voter to request an absentee mail-in ballot without giving a reason up to 45 days ahead of a federal or state election or 21 days ahead of a special election. They could still vote in person in the week before the election. In 2010, the law was amended to in-person early voting for seven weeks without giving a reason. In 2011, early voting was reduced to 21 days, ending the Friday before the election and including at least one Saturday of early voting. To sum up, there’s plenty of evidence that Georgia voters are taking advantage of the chance to cast their ballots early. In the 2012 presidential election, 1.9 million early votes were cast. That’s up from about 420,000 in 2004, the first time Georgians could vote early in a presidential election. We rate Kemp’s statement as True.

pomt-00942	Cigarette butts "poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them."	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/23/karina-wood/ri-lung-association-representative-says-cigarette-/	A bill before the General Assembly would prohibit smoking on public beaches; the Senate Judiciary Committee took testimony on the proposal Feb. 12. There were only two speakers. One was Steven Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union,’s Rhode Island chapter, who objected to the provision calling for violators being charged with a misdemeanor. The other was Karina Wood of the American Lung Association, who cited the health dangers of secondhand smoke. But she also talked about another aspect of the issue -- the environmental problems posed by beach butts (the cigarette kind, not the anatomical variety). "Environmentally, cigarette butts are unsightly. They are the number one polluting litter on our beaches," she said. "I've been involved in beach cleanups myself with my kids and you'll be amazed, or maybe you won't, at how many of those butts are littering our beaches. And they're dangerous to animals -- wildlife, birds." "And also they poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them." We've heard plenty of reports over the years that cigarette butts are the biggest source of beach pollution in Rhode Island. But we wondered whether they are really poisoning children, especially babies, whom we think of as not being able to get around on their own. It turns out that Wood was talking about the risks to children of eating discarded butts. When we contacted her to ask for some documentation, she sent us to a few pieces of research. We also sought our own information on the toxicity of nicotine. Common blends of tobacco contain roughly 15 to 25 milligrams per cigarette. The amount of nicotine in a cigarette butt could vary but just a milligram or two can be enough to produce poisoning symptoms in a child. Those symptoms include "agitation, headache, sweating, dizziness, auditory and visual disturbances, confusion, weakness and lack of coordination," according to safety guide for various chemicals on the International Programme on Chemical Safety’s website. That database says the mean lethal dose for children who consume nicotine is about 10 milligrams, although we found another source that reported that the fatal dose was 40 mg to 60 mg for children. Nicotine, a neurotoxin, can kill by causing lung failure or by paralyzing the muscles that control breathing. How common is nicotine poisoning among babies or children? Wood pointed us to two studies. The first was published in the September 2009 edition of the journal Public Health by Jeffrey T. Quirk of the Erie County Department of Health in Pennsylvania. Using a national database covering about 100 U.S. hospitals, it estimated that there were 3,616 cases of cigarette poisonings and 756 cases of cigarette ingestion among children in the United States from 2002 to 2007. That's two a day, typically involving a child age 2 or younger.. Because Quirk only tallied injuries that received or required hospital treatment and didn't include children who might have been treated in homes or doctor's office, "the actual number of children's cigarette-related injuries may be much greater," he concluded. Although they were mostly "generally minor injuries, these events have the potential to induce serious complications," he said. The second study was done, coincidentally, in Rhode Island. For the 31-month period that began in January 1994, the state's Poison Control Center logged 146 cases in which children age 24 months or younger had ingested cigarettes or cigarette butts. Only one case occurred outside a residence -- in this instance it was a public park. In one third of the cases, the child vomited, often more than once. Two thirds of the children had no symptoms.There were no fatalities and the children generally recovered within 12 hours. Once again, that number probably underestimates the actual number of cases, the researchers said, because many parents might not have thought to call poison control. The youngest children in the study, age 6 to 12 months, accounted for 75 percent of the cases. Finally, we found a 2011 review article in Tobacco Control, a journal from the publishers of the British Medical Journal (now BMJ), which reports on 1,289 additional cases that appeared in the medical literature, 239 of which produced symptoms. "We found that severe poisoning by cigarette butts among young children was rare but possible," the researcher said. "It is clear that smokers must treat cigarette butts as toxic waste products and take more care in discarding them; children will mimic parental behaviour by putting these items into their mouths and sometime consume them in quantities sufficient to be toxic." Finally, we asked Wood if she meant to include babies in her statement. After all, most babies -- before they become toddlers -- can only eat what people feed them. She pointed out that older babies find plenty of stuff on the floor when they're learning to crawl. "By way of a personal anecdote, I observed my own daughter, when she was a baby of 11 or 12 months old and crawling, pick up a discarded cigarette butt on the beach and bring it to her mouth," Wood said. Dr. William Lewander, coauthor of the 1994 study and current director of pediatric emergency medicine at Hasbro Children's Hospital, said another child who picks up a butt might offer it to a baby and "once they start crawling, if a cigarette butt is dropped on the floor it's possible" for poisoning to occur. "A toddler running around is probably most at risk," said Dr. Thomas Novotny, of San Diego State University, coauthor of the 2011 study. For younger children "it's possible they would crawl around in the sand and put something in their mouth. If a 1 year old were to eat a few butts, they likely would have nicotine toxicity -- increased heart rate, irritability - and there have been some reports of seizures in the past." In sum, the scientific literature shows that it's not a rare event for doctors and poison control centers to have to deal with young children -- who tend to put just about anything in their mouths -- who have consumed cigarettes or cigarette butts. It's seldom fatal, but it can qualify as a medical emergency, and it doesn't take much to give a child symptoms of poisoning. We rate the claim True.

pomt-03511	The National Rifle Association was "founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/05/harry-alford/nra-founded-fight-kkk-black-leader-says/	On May 28, 2013, the Republican Party of Milwaukee County posted on its website a video that has been popping up elsewhere on the Internet. The video features African-American leaders speaking out against proposals to restrict gun rights at a Feb. 22, 2013 news conference in Washington, D.C. Among them: Harry Alford, president and chief executive officer of the D.C.-based National Black Chamber of Commerce. Alford, who spoke in Milwaukee in 2008, said at one point: "I want to thank the Lord for our Constitution. I also want to thank the NRA for its legacy. The National Rifle Association was started, founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan." Well known as a defender of the right to bear arms, the 5 million-member NRA does describe itself as "America's longest-standing civil rights organization." But is that why it was founded? Not even close. What the NRA says Here’s what the NRA says on its website about its founding: Dismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to "promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis," according to a magazine editorial written by Church. After being granted a charter by the State of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. Civil War Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who was also the former governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. senator, became the fledgling NRA's first president. An important facet of the NRA's creation was the development of a practice ground. In 1872, with financial help from New York State, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened a year later, and it was there that the first annual matches were held. No mention of religious leaders, slaves or the KKK. Brief histories of the NRA by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post contain no such mentions, either. We called and emailed the NRA to inquire about Alford’s claim, but the group offered no response. (Milwaukee County Republican Party chairman David Karst told us he wasn’t sure why the party posted the video on its website.) Alford’s evidence Alford’s wife, National Black Chamber of Commerce executive vice president Kay DeBow Alford, provided us three articles to back her husband’s claim. But none of them do. 1. PolicyMic.com: A January 2013 article on PolicyMic.com, which describes itself as a platform to "engage millennials in debates about real issues," notes that the NRA founders started the group because of the Union soldiers’ poor marksmanship and it calls the NRA the oldest civil rights organization in the United States. No mention of religious leaders founding the NRA to protect freed slaves from the KKK. 2. Ann Coulter: In an April 2012 opinion column, conservative author and commentator Ann Coulter said that when civil rights leader Robert F. Williams returned home to Monroe, N.C., after serving in World War II, the Ku Klux Klan was "beating, lynching and murdering blacks at will." In 1957, Williams got a charter from the NRA, founded the Black Armed Guard and repeatedly thwarted KKK attacks, Coulter wrote. She didn't say whether the NRA played a role in the guard's fighting the Klan. Again, no reference to religious leaders or slaves. And the fighting against the KKK -- whether it involved the NRA or not -- would have occurred more than 85 years after the NRA’s founding. 3. Psychology professor’s article: A January 2013 article by psychology professor Warren Throckmorton of Grove City College in Grove City, Pa., not only doesn’t support Alford’s claim, it disputes it. Throckmorton noted that the NRA’s website makes no mention of the KKK or getting guns in the hands of newly freed slaves. He said he found no evidence in the early charter of the NRA, or the biographies of the founders, either. Other evidence So, even tangentially, is there anything to Alford’s statement? Two historians -- Jerald Podair of Lawrence University in Wisconsin and Kenneth Janken of the University of North Carolina -- said there is no evidence to support the statement. But, as an aside, here’s more information on Coulter's reference to Williams, the civil rights leader, and the KKK in North Carolina. It’s from the University of Florida-produced documentary "Negroes with Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power": In 1956, Williams took over leadership of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was close to disbanding due to the Ku Klux Klan. Williams filed for a charter from the NRA and formed the Black Guard, an armed group committed to the protection of blacks. It's unclear, however, whether the NRA provided any assistance, based on what Williams' widow, Mabel, said in a University of North Carolina oral history interview. Mabel Williams said her husband altered the occupations of the members when applying for the NRA charter. "I'm sure when we joined and the years after then, had they known we were a black group, they would have revoked our charter," she said. Our rating Harry Alford, the head of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, said the National Rifle Association was "founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan." We can’t say whether he was misinformed or intended to mislead. But the NRA itself says the group was formed by Union Civil War veterans to improve soldiers’ marksmanship. And we found no evidence that religious leaders founded the NRA to protect freed slaves from the KKK. The claim is not only inaccurate but ridiculous -- Pants on Fire.

pomt-04786	Says "cities save an estimated $38 in dental costs for every $1 invested in fluoridation."	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/23/nick-fish/do-cities-really-save-38-every-1-they-spend-fluori/	The Portland City Council is set to vote early next month on whether to fluoridate the city’s drinking water -- and a ‘yes’ vote looks all but certain. City Commissioner Nick Fish said as much in a statement that started bluntly "I believe it is time to add fluoride to Portland’s drinking water." Part of his rationale, he explained in the statement, are the potential savings fluoridation offers. "In fact, cities save an estimated $38 in dental costs for every $1 invested in fluoridation," he wrote. We thought the topic was timely enough that we ought to do a quick check on this would-be fact. (Full disclosure: The Oregonian used the same fact in a Page 1 article on the subject of fluoridation.) We called Fish’s office and spoke with Emily York, one of the commissioner’s policy coordinators. She sent us a fact sheet from the Everyone Deserves Healthy Teeth Coalition that laid out the economic case in favor of fluoridation, including the $38 figure that Fish used. The figure, the fact sheet noted, came from a 2001 study published in the Journal of Public Health Dentistry by Susan Griffin, Karl Jones and Scott Tomar. It took some time, but we were able to get our hands on a copy of the study. A quick read revealed that the authors had indeed found significant savings from fewer instances of tooth decay and resulting dental care when communities fluoridated their water supplies. (PolitiFact Oregon recognizes that fluoridation has strong opponents who raise other issues -- but our purpose here is simply to examine the possible cost savings.) To get to the $38 figure, you need to do a little math. For a large community like Portland, the study’s authors estimated that fluoridation costs about 50 cents per person. Then it goes on to give a range of possible dental cost savings per person -- from $2.99 to $56.07, with a most likely savings (base case in financial jargon) of $19.12 per person for the 50 cents spent Just double the $19.12 in savings -- because that’s how much you get for half a dollar -- and you wind up with $38 in savings for each $1 spent. That’s a pretty decent return, to be sure. Now, there are a few caveats here. The study explicitly states that it does not take into account overhead costs of fluoridation or possible health issues that stem from fluoridation, such as dental fluorosis, which the study says "are negligible." We contacted one of the study’s authors, Scott Tomar, who teaches at the College of Dentistry at the University of Florida. In an e-mail he said the bottom line of the decade-old study was that "that community water fluoridation saves money under almost any scenario. It is actually one of extremely few public health initiatives that can make such a claim. Based on our analyses, an 18 to 1 return on investment is a reasonable estimate for Portland." We wanted something a little more specific, however, so we took a look at the actual numbers Portland would be facing. The figures are a little different for the Portland area because it’ll cost more than the estimated 50 cents per person to fluoridate. According to early estimates, it’ll cost the city about $5 million to get the project started and then about $575,000 annually from there on to fluoridate water for about 900,000 people. We worked the math and that means in the first year, Portland area residents would save about $3 in dental costs for every $1 invested. After that, it’d cost closer to 64 cents per person to fluoridate the water, meaning a savings of about $30 for each $1 spent. Fish was measured in his comments. He said that "cities save an estimated $38 in dental costs for every $1 invested in fluoridation" and, indeed, that was the estimate of one article that appeared in a peer-reviewed medical journal. Furthermore, the findings of this article are highlighted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its website on the subject. The savings for Portland, however, are slimmer, and we think that’s important context that is missing. We find this statement Mostly True.

pomt-02163	"Many" of the founding fathers were "very actively involved" in cockfighting.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/01/matt-bevin/were-founding-fathers-active-cockfighters/	Were the founding fathers cockfighters? It’s not a question we expected to ask this campaign season. But we’re going to ask it because a Kentucky Senate candidate recently claimed that "many" of the men who founded our nation also took an interest in the blood sport. Tea party-backed candidate Matt Bevin, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in a primary, drew criticism earlier this month after speaking at a cockfighters’ rally in Corbin, Ky. Cockfighting is illegal in Kentucky -- as it is in every state, 40 of which make it a felony -- but aficionados want to reverse such laws on a state-by-state basis. Bevin defended his presence at the rally on Louisville radio host Terry Meiners’ show in part by saying many of the founding fathers were participants. "But it's interesting, when you look at cockfighting and dogfighting as well, this isn't something new, it wasn't invented in Kentucky for example," Bevin said. "I mean, the founding fathers were all -- many of them -- very actively involved in this and always had been." We’ve checked some claims about historic politicians in the past, so we’ll try again with a look at cockfighting more than two centuries ago. Past claims Bevin’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this story, so we don’t know what he’s basing that claim on. However, these claims typically have concerned a handful of prominent founders, notably George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. Some other sources also mention Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Jackson, but Bevin’s claim specifically mentioned "founding fathers," so we didn't address them. Our research initially led us to the Humane Society of the United States, which has spearheaded a long fight to make cockfighting illegal and is one of cockfighting’s fiercest critics. In the early 1990s, the society contacted historians and experts about some of the founding fathers to see if there was any truth to the claims. According to the documents the society collected, the founders’ connections to cockfighting seem somewhat tenuous, though we acknowledge some limitations about this type of research -- namely that their surviving personal writings and other documentary evidence is limited. George Washington There is one reference in George Washington’s diaries that confirms that as a 19-year-old, the nation’s future first president attended a cockfight. "A Great Main of (co)cks fought… (be)tween Glouster and york for 5 pistoles each battle and 100 ye odd I left it with Colo. (John) Lewis before it was decided…," he wrote, according to information uncovered by the Humane Society. However, it’s unclear how excited the young Washington was, since the entry says he left before the fight ended, said Mary V. Thompson, a research historian at the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington. Another historian -- John P. Riley, formerly of Mount Vernon, Washington’s estate -- told the Humane Society that there is a vague reference to a cockfight elsewhere in Washington’s writings, but that Washington referenced other activities he enjoyed far more than he referenced cockfighting. "By the numerous references in his diaries and letters to foxhunting, card playing and attending the theater, we know that these were some of Washington’s favorite amusements," Riley wrote in 1993. "The two references to cockfighting in his voluminous writings and the absence of documentation or physical evidence of any cockpit at Mount Vernon leads me to believe that it was not an entertainment in which he participated in any great way." Thomas Jefferson The evidence on Thomas Jefferson is similar. "Although it is always much harder to disprove something than to prove it, I am confident that if Jefferson had any interest in cockfighting, I would come across some reference to it in my twenty-five years of working with his documentary archive," Lucia C. Stanton, the former director of research at Monticello wrote to the Humane Society in 1993. Stanton told PolitiFact that while it is impossible to tell what activities Jefferson took part in before he started prolifically documenting his life, it would be surprising if he had been actively involved in cockfighting as a young man yet made no mention of these activities in his later writings. Meanwhile, a transcribed memoir from the 1840s of a former slave of Jefferson’s seems to say pretty clearly that Jefferson did not participate in cockfighting. "Mr. Jefferson never had nothing to do with horse-racing or cock-fighting," former slave Isaac Granger Jefferson dictated to Charles Campbell in Memoirs of a Monticello Slave. In addition, Jefferson did raise fowl at Monticello, but it is a leap to say that he raised birds for sport. Finally, Jefferson helped write a 1799 law that was meant to deter gambling on activities like cockfighting. Adams, Franklin and other founders The evidence about the other founders is no more convincing. John Adams, who would become the new nation’s second president, has only one known reference to cockfighting -- his lament that young men waste time of the activity, said Amanda Mathews, assistant editor of the Adams papers with the Massachusetts Historical Society. "While they all probably attended one at some point or another, I don’t think any of the Adamses were ‘involved’ in any way," Mathews said in an email, referring to John Adams and his second cousin Samuel Adams. As for Franklin, some claims about his fondness for cockfighting involve his proposal to make the national bird a turkey instead of the familiar bald eagle. Some have taken this as a symbol of his association with cockfighting, but this seems too vague to serve as solid evidence. As for other founders, we will note that in October 1774, the Continental Congress, which would become the United States’ first governing body during the Revolutionary War, signed a resolution that, among other things, discouraged cockfighting. Fifty-seven members of the Congress signed the resolution, including such well-known founders like Jefferson, John Jay and Samuel and John Adams. Our ruling Bevin said that "many" of the founding fathers were "very actively involved" in cockfighting. In looking at the most prominent founders, we found no indications that any of the founders were avid and frequent participants. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01646	Says he "invested over $100 million in worker training."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/24/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-invested-100-million-worker-t/	In February 2012, one of the Democrats who aimed to unseat Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin’s historic recall election made an aggressive claim. Former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk said Walker enacted "the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history." We rated the statement True. Among the $1.1 billion in education cuts in Walker’s 2011-’13 state budget was a reduction of $71.6 million, or 30 percent, in general state aid for technical colleges. And the governor has since restored only a fraction of that funding. So, we wondered about Walker’s claiming in a new TV ad, which his campaign highlighted in an Aug. 13, 2014 news release, that he has "invested over $100 million in worker training." The system The state's tech school system has a long history and a large clientele. In 1911, Wisconsin became the first state to establish a system of state aid and support for industrial education, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. Currently, the Wisconsin Technical College System has 16 schools that serve some 380,000 students each year. The tech schools’ primary mission is occupational education and training, although they also provide general education, career counseling and other services. As for financing, the largest share of the tech system's funding, slightly more than 50 percent, comes from property taxes. But given Walker’s claim, our focus here is on state spending. State funding General state aid to technical colleges remained virtually unchanged during the eight years under the previous governor, Democrat Jim Doyle. It ranged between $118 million and $119 million per year. Walker cut the allocation to $83.5 million for each year of his first budget, causing the $71.6 million reduction for 2011-’13 that we mentioned. He kept the funding at $83.5 million the following year, then bumped it up to $88.5 million in 2014-’15, still well below the Doyle levels. But when Walker first made the reductions, the tech system told us it estimated that 60 percent of the reductions were offset by savings the system was able to make as a result of Act 10, Walker’s collective bargaining reform law. That law required most public employees pay for a larger share of their pension and health benefits. Beyond that, the reductions were in general aid -- which can be used for many purposes, including general education and overhead, as well as worker training. They weren’t cuts in funding strictly for worker training. The claim As for Walker’s claim of investing more than $100 million in worker training, the governor in February 2013 said he would invest $132 million from various sources, including nearly $100 million in state money, to build a faster system to track jobs data, tie technical school and university funding to filling high-demand professions, and require nearly 76,000 people to train for work to collect food stamps. A key point here is that, although Walker has not restored all of the general state aid he had cut to the tech schools, he was adding money to other types of job training. Here are some of the larger worker training allocations: $35.4 million in increased workforce training grants in a March 2014 law. It requires the state Department of Workforce Development to fund initiatives such as reducing waiting lists for technical college programs in "high-demand" fields and collaborative efforts by school districts, tech schools and businesses to train high school students in high-demand fields. $31 million in the 2013-’15 state budget to carry out a new requirement that able-bodied adults who don't have dependent children work or get work training in order to receive food stamps. $22.5 million in the 2013-’15 state budget for new "incentive grants" to University of Wisconsin System institutions for economic development programs, programs that aim to develop the workforce and programs that make post secondary education more affordable for state residents. $20 million in a March 2013 law to the state Department of Workforce Development to provide grants to private and public organizations for training unemployed and underemployed workers. Of that amount, $15 million is for grants and the rest to run the program. $4.21 million in additional money for the state's vocational rehabilitation program through a December 2013 law. Those initiatives alone exceed $100 million. Walker's campaign provided us a spreadsheet listing those initiatives and others totaling nearly $178 million. However, whether the full $178 million could be considered worker training is debatable. For example, $12 million is allocated for "WorkKeys," a job skills assessment that is intended "to help high school pupils identify necessary coursework and provide another indicator for career readiness." Our rating Walker said he has "invested over $100 million into worker training." The governor has directed more than $100 million into a variety of new worker training programs. But his statement needs clarification in that he also cut general aid to technical colleges, some of which is used for worker training. Our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-09675	In the House health care bill, "Something like 2 percent of the people would [be] eligible even to get the public option."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/18/ron-wyden/wyden-mistakenly-lowballs-number-people-eligible-p/	The House health care bill, with its exchanges, public option and nearly 2,000 pages of densely worded text, isn't the easiest thing to comprehend. So it's not surprising that even a senator with years of experience in health care policy can make a mistake while explaining it. In a Nov. 17, 2009, appearance on MSNBC's Morning Meeting With Dylan Ratigan , Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he's trying to prod Senate leaders into including a version of the public option that goes further than what's in the House bill. The public option would be a government-run plan offered as one of many alternatives on the new health care "exchange." The exchange is designed to help uninsured Americans, as well as those who don't work for an employer who offers health coverage, find reasonably priced health insurance. Beyond some startup money from the federal government, the public option would be paid for entirely by patient premiums. Wyden argued during his MSNBC appearance that a public option that reaches more Americans than the one in the House bill would have a better chance of ensuring competition for private insurers. And that, in turn, would promote cost control and improve customer benefits. In explaining how limited the current House bill version is, Wyden said, "Something like 2 percent of the people would [be] eligible even to get the public option." That's not correct. The Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan group whose estimates on the cost and impact of proposed bills are considered definitive -- said otherwise in an Oct. 29, 2009, letter to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. The CBO estimated that by 2019 -- the final year of the office's 10-year forecast -- 30 million people would be insured through plans offered on the exchange. But the CBO predicted that most of those 30 million would choose plans from private insurers. Only 6 million, or one of every five people buying on the exchange, would select the public plan, according to the CBO's estimate. (Anyone who's eligible to purchase insurance on the exchange would be able to choose either the public option or a plan offered by private insurers.) Now, 6 million people buying the public option amounts to just over 2 percent of the 282 million Americans who are under age 65 (that is, the 282 million Americans who aren't eligible for Medicare, the universal health insurance program for the elderly). But contrary to what Wyden said, it's not that 2 percent of Americans will be eligible for the public option in 2019; it's that 2 percent will choose the public option that year, according to CBO's estimate. The actual number of people eligible to choose the public option would be the entire pool of 30 million Americans in the exchange -- almost 11 percent of the under-65 population, or five times the proportion that Wyden indicated. When we spoke to Wyden's office, a spokeswoman immediately acknowledged that the senator had misspoken. In fact, when he returned to a different MSNBC program that night -- Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- he said, correctly, that the public option "has 6 million people in it." So while we applaud Wyden for correcting himself after the fact, his original comment was incorrect. So we're rating his statement False.

pomt-08955	Obama's dog has his "own plane"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/22/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-bo-flies-his-own-plane/	Talk about making sacrifices and tightening the belt. Bo, the Portuguese water dog that Senator Ted Kennedy gave to the Obama family as a present, apparently flies in his own private jet. That, at least, is the claim that seems to have gone viral on the Internet over the weekend. "As the rest of us toil on the unemployment line, as millions of Americans find their retirement accounts dwindling, their hours at work cut, and their pay scale trimmed, King Barack and Queen Michelle are flying their little doggie, Bo, on his own special jet airplane for his own little vacation adventure," wrote Warner Todd Houston, a blogger on Publius Forum. The rumor caught our attention, and not just because we're fascinated with the pet air travel industry. Is Bo really commanding his own jet? We decided to look into it. We quickly traced the origin of the rumors to the Morning Sentinel, a newspaper based in Waterville, Maine. On July 17, 2010, the paper published an account of the First Family's visit to the state's Acadia National Park. Among the details was a reference to Bo. "Arriving in a small jet before the Obamas was the first dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog given as a present by the late U.S. Sen Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and the president's personal aide Reggie Love, who chatted with Baldacci," the article stated. It seems that some people took this to mean that Bo actually arrived in his own jet. Air Force One is usually a Boeing 747, but the Trenton airport runway was too small for the plane, so the Obamas opted for a Gulfstream G3, the article stated. That plane can accommodate up to 19 passengers. To fit everyone in -- the President always travels with multiple staffers and aides -- the Obamas decided to travel in two smaller airplanes, the second of which carried several White House aides and Bo. Indeed, the Sentinel article was updated to clarify that there were many other people in the jet that carried Bo. "Today's story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obamas' dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers. The presidential party took two small jets to the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton because the airport was too small to accommodate the president's usual jet." To be thorough, we also checked with the White House. Katherine Bedingfield of the White House Office of Media Affairs told us that the claim is "baseless and absurd." Bo does not even require his own seat, and during the Maine trip he traveled on a government-owned plane with White House staff. We figured that at least some of the bloggers were being satirical, but from our review of reader comments that followed many of the entries, it's pretty clear that there are those who actually took this stuff seriously, so we wanted to set the record straight. So, Bo did indeed arrive in a separate jet, but it's ridiculous to claim that he has his own airplane. He traveled on a government-owned plane with government staffers who didn't fit in the small Gulfstream G3 that the First Family had to take because of the physical limitations of the Trenton airport runway. We rate this False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2010-07-22T11:16:09	2010-07-17	['None']
pomt-05434	"About 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now."	/florida/statements/2012/apr/27/rick-scott/gov-scott-says-230000-fewer-people-receive-unemplo/	A radio host recently asked Gov. Rick Scott for an update on his trademark 7-7-7 plan -- creating 700,000 jobs in seven years in seven steps. (We're tracking that promise on the Scott-O-Meter.) Scott said Florida’s economy is getting better in a lot of ways. "We’re doing well. We’re at a three-year low on our unemployment in this state... We generated around 100,000 net jobs so far, if you look at the federal numbers," he said in the April 18, 2012, interview with Orlando-based station WDBO. "But if you look at the state numbers, about 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now. "When you look around the state, tourism is up, the home market’s up, home sales are up, home prices are up. … So good things are happening, but we still have 900,000 people out of work," he said. What stuck out to us is his claim that 230,000 fewer people receive unemployment benefits than when he took office 15 months ago. That sounds like a drastic decrease, which Scott is taking credit for and in turn using as evidence that the state’s economy is improving. A spokeswoman with the state’s Department of Economic Opportunity, the agency that manages the unemployment compensation program, responded to our request about Scott’s claim. Spokeswoman Nancy Blum said the number of people receiving unemployment compensation dropped from 561,736 on Jan. 31, 2011, to 345,052 on March 31, 2012. That’s a total decline of 216,684. That’s pretty close to "about 230,000," which is the number Scott offered. Whether Scott is right to take credit for the decline -- and whether that is translating to a better Florida economy -- is more complicated. In 2011 and 2012, Scott and Florida lawmakers made a series of changes to the state’s unemployment compensation program that generally make it harder for people to receive benefits. Among them: Claims must be filed online. Applicants must complete a 45-question initial workplace skills review before receiving the first check (the 2012 law requires a numeric score). Recipients must either prove they contacted five prospective employers each week or meet with a career representative at a one-stop employment center. The department tied the maximum number of weeks to the unemployment rate, so that the number of weeks decreases with the rate and vice versa. The maximum number of weeks fell from 26 to 23. The state is no longer required to resolve doubtful cases in favor of claimants, and the use of hearsay in appeals cases is expanded. It’s easier to be disqualified based on a broadened definition of an employee’s misconduct that resulted in a lost job, and applies to certain misconduct outside of work. Meanwhile, businesses got tax breaks. A 2012 bill reduces unemployment compensation taxes for businesses by at least $50 per employee, with savings of $276 million the first year. The Miami Workers Center asked the U.S. Department of Labor’s civil rights division to investigate Florida’s unemployment compensation system over allegations that these changes act as barriers to people who deserve checks but can’t get them for lack of computer access or reading skills. A Labor department spokesman told us the investigation is ongoing. "The governor’s number in and of itself does not demonstrate any kind of economic recovery in Florida," said Valory Greenfield, staff attorney for Florida Legal Services, which represents the workers center. "What it tells me based on our experience working with claimants is that fewer people who are potentially eligible are getting into the program." In fact, since August 2011 the department has denied 131,115 applicants for failing to comply with the new law, mostly for failing to fulfill the work search or the initial skills assessment. Those denials resulted in a $30.3 million savings. Economists said Scott's number, while accurate, isn't necessarily a great economic measure on its own. They also said it's too soon to tell if Florida's more stringent eligibility requirements play a big role in the declining number of recipients. Part of the drop-off could be attributed to people whose benefits have expired. Since December 2011, 30,600 people have exhausted all state and federal unemployment benefits, according to the department. "So far I haven’t been able to see any hard data or evidence to quantify (either) effect," said Mekael Teshome, PNC Financial Services Group economist. What’s more relevant, Teshome said, is that jobless claims have been coming down since their peak in mid 2009, well before Scott took office. That somewhat undermines the idea that the drop is thanks to Scott. In fact, if you started counting in 2010 instead of 2011 when Scott took office, even fewer people -- 300,770 -- are receiving unemployment benefits. Some experts also pointed to the contracting size of the labor force, which helps to lower the unemployment rate but also indicates some people are no longer looking for work. About 15,000 people left the labor force from February, according to the state’s March 2012 labor report. The 15,000-person drop in the labor force was part of the reason why the unemployment rate fall from 9.4 percent in February to 9 percent in March. "Some of those are people whose benefits ran out and are now not looking for work," said Chris McCarty, director of the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. "Some of those are retirees who have left the labor force permanently." Our ruling Scott’s claim that 230,000 fewer people are receiving unemployment benefits than when he entered office is pretty close to the actual drop (216,684). A couple of caveats here. The figure is not completely an indicator that the economy is improving, as Scott suggests, and is somewhat the result of a strict new state law. Also, the trend of jobless claims started falling in mid 2009, more than a year before Scott took office. That undercuts, to a point, the suggestion Scott should get the credit. Scott’s statement is accurate but can use some additional information. That’s our definition of Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-04-27T16:25:51	2012-04-18	['None']

pomt-08490	Say Matt Wand cut Troutdale police, created a slush fund for himself.	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/11/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/house-democrats-say-matt-wand-cut-police-voted-slu/	At PolitiFact Oregon, nothing gets our pulse racing quite like the words "slush fund." We know that few things make voters angrier than personal expense accounts on the taxpayer dime. So we had to check it out when we spotted a recent campaign mailer that said this: "Matt Wand cut the police force while creating a slush fund for his own expenses." The line runs with a photo of Wand, a Republican House candidate for District 49, on the side of a police vehicle with the phrase "to protect and serve ... himself." Funny, cutting ... but is it true? According to Future PAC, the House Democrats' campaign committee, while on the Troutdale City Council, Wand voted to "cut the police force as part of the 2010-2011 budget." Separately, he "worked hard to protect his own pocketbook -- by supporting an expense slush fund for himself." Michele Rossolo, executive director of Future PAC, said the mailer was based on a reduction in the number of FTE, or full-time equivalent staff, in the Police Department from 2009-10 to 2010-11. Also, she sent minutes from an April 6, 2010, Troutdale City Council work session as evidence that Wand approved a "slush fund." Erich Mueller, finance director for Troutdale, was calmly apoplectic when reached by phone to explain the city’s budget. First, it's true that the number of budgeted police officers decreased, from 29.5 FTE positions to 28.5. But that's because one position had been double-filled to account for an employee on long-term deployment with the Oregon National Guard. And when that person returned from overseas, he retired. "The money was the same," said Troutdale Police Sgt. Marc Shrake. "There were two bodies on payroll for visual purposes." Second, the police budget was not cut in terms of money. In fact, the total amount of money budgeted for police operations and management went up -- from $3,710,552 in 2009-10 to $3,826,510 in 2010-11. That's about a $116,000 increase. "Since the police budget was increased," Mueller said, "I don't know how he could have cut it." And third, City Council members, as part of the 15-member city budget committee, did approve a new $50 monthly stipend for each of the six city councilors. The stipend, which replaced a reimbursement system for council members, would be used to pay for meals with other elected officials or individuals, to attend retirement events, or to pay for fax lines, cell phone bills and office supplies. None of those items would be reimbursed by the city. Wand was a member of the budget subcommittee that suggested the stipend. But the idea was proposed by Tanney Staffenson, chairman of the Troutdale budget committee, according to the minutes provided by Future PAC (Page 10). And get this: Wand signed a form declining the stipend on June 8, 2010. That’s right. He didn't even take the opportunity to "protect his own pocketbook." So, it’s inaccurate to say that Wand cut the police force when he didn’t. It’s inaccurate to say that he selfishly created a "slush fund" for his own expenses, when he didn’t. This attack on Wand’s character -- remember, he is pictured next to a slogan that reads "to protect and serve ... himself" -- shows a reckless disregard for the truth. Even in political advertising.

pomt-09328	Marco Rubio was "subpoenaed."	/florida/statements/2010/apr/13/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-marco-rubio-ray-sansom/	Gov. Charlie Crist, facing an exceedingly difficult Republican U.S. Senate primary, has launched a second blistering television attack against former House Speaker Marco Rubio. In his first ad, Crist portrayed Rubio as a greedy politician who helped fund his personal lifestyle with Republican Party donations. (You can see our analysis of one of the ad's claims here.) Crist's new ad, which the campaign released April 12, 2010, seeks to link Rubio with indicted former House Speaker Ray Sansom. "Both steered millions of taxpayer money into two colleges," a female narrator says, followed by a male voice that adds, "Then, received cushy jobs from the colleges." The ad then flashes to a booking mug shot of Sansom and a picture of Rubio. Under Sansom's picture is the word "indicted." Under Rubio's picture is the word "subpoenaed." This item will explore whether Rubio was indeed "subpoenaed," and examine links between Sansom and Rubio. First, about Sansom. Sansom was Rubio's budget chief in 2007 and 2008 and succeeded Rubio as speaker in November 2008. On the day Sansom took over from Rubio, he also took a $110,000 job at Northwest Florida State College in the Florida Panhandle. A subsequent St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald investigation showed how Sansom had steered $35 million to the school. Included was $6 million for an airport building that one of Sansom's friends wanted to use for his corporate jet business. The airport building deal led a grand jury to indict Sansom. That case is ongoing. The Florida House also sought to investigate the deal, but Sansom abruptly resigned before a scheduled ethics trial was to start. What links Rubio to all this? Nothing, really, has been established. Yes, Sansom was Rubio's budget chief and the two were close, but Rubio contends that he knew nothing about the $6 million for the airport, saying the project was directed "solely" by Sansom, and that the specific language of the budget request was misleading. Ironically, it's the same answer offered by Crist -- who could've vetoed the project, but didn't. The 35-second TV ad builds its case by first linking Rubio and Sansom as close colleagues in the Florida House (they were). Next the ad says both Rubio and Sansom helped colleges get money from the Legislature and then took jobs from those institutions (We already discussed Sansom; Rubio did help Florida International University get $21 million for a hurricane center and medical school, records kept by the governor's office show, and then took a $69,000 part-time teaching job with FIU after leaving office). The next frames of the ad are where the paths diverge. But you wouldn't know it by watching. Sansom was indicted for his part in the airport hangar deal. And Rubio was subpoenaed, as the ad says, but not as part of his dealings with FIU. The subpoena was part of Sansom's House ethics trial in February 2010. Sansom's attorney Gloria Fletcher included Rubio among 35 potential witnesses that included current and former state legislators. (See the list here). The subpoena was formally issued Feb. 12, 2010. (See it here). We should note that Rubio never received the subpoena, his campaign says. And a subpoena doesn't suggest in any way Rubio did something wrong. Sansom, meanwhile, resigned on Feb. 21, 2010, the day before the ethics trial was to start. The House canceled the trial as a result, and Rubio never testified. To recap, while the ad tries to draw similarities between Sansom's history and Rubio's, Rubio has not been accused of wrongdoing in his association with Florida International University. In fact, Rubio took his job with FIU only as he was leaving the state House -- when his power was fading -- while Sansom took his higher-paying job as he was becoming one of the state's most powerful legislators. The differences are stark enough that overall impression caused by the ad can be quite misleading. The ad rightly says that Rubio was subpoenaed, but the overall connection between Rubio and Sansom is flimsy at best. First, a subpoena was issued, but apparently never delivered. Additionally, a subpoena isn't an indication Rubio did something wrong. It just means he could have been called to testify. As such we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-06681	"This year, the Blackstone Valley Mayoral Academy became the first public school in Rhode Island history to have 100 percent of its elementary-age students proficient in reading on state assessments."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/08/daniel-mckee/mayors-claim-students-blackstone-valley-charter-sc/	As part of the ongoing debate about mayoral academy charter schools, mayors and town administrators from several Rhode Island communities released a newspaper commentary last month touting their benefits. The commentary, published Aug. 21 in The Journal and credited to Warwick Mayor Scott Avedisian, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung and Cumberland Mayor Daniel McKee, highlighted test scores at the state’s first mayoral academy, in Cumberland. "This year, the Blackstone Valley Mayoral Academy, which serves students from Central Falls, Cumberland, Lincoln and Pawtucket, became the first public school in Rhode Island history to have 100 percent of its elementary-age students proficient in reading on state assessments." That sounds very impressive. A 100-percent proficiency rate? The first time in the state's history? On multiple assessment tests? We're selecting McKee as the person making the claim because he's a driving force in the school, known as Blackstone Valley Prep. He would be in the best position to know what the test scores are at his own academy. (A proposal by Fung to create a mayoral academy for Cranston and Providence was rejected Sept. 1 by the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education.) So we turned to Elliot Krieger, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Education. He delved into the records and here's what he found going back to 2005, when the state inaugurated its current testing system. Last May, all 152 first graders and kindergartners at the school passed the Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA), a test developed in the late 1980s in Ohio to measure reading skills. In fact, 130 of those 152 passed with distinction. Krieger said it was the first instance he could find of any elementary school doing so well on the current state-mandated standardized tests or, as far as he could recall, since the state began doing proficiency testing, in 1998. In May 2010 -- the school’s inaugural year, when all the students were kindergartners -- 97 percent were deemed proficient. "They're doing really well. No one will dispute that," said Krieger. "It's not a test where this is a cakewalk." But the mayors’ statement leaves out an important fact: The DRA is a test that very few students take because it is given only in schools that don't go above second grade. In all other elementary schools, the state uses the New England Common Assessment Program (NECAP), a series of reading, writing, math and science tests used by Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermomt and Maine. Those tests start in grade 3. Last year, only 6 of the state's 168 elementary schools took the DRA, which makes Blackstone Valley Prep a big fish in a very small pond. "There are a lot of schools that are high-performing that don't take this test," said Krieger. (Blackstone Valley Prep did have a class of fifth graders last year and those students took the NECAP test, with less impressive results -- 61 percent were proficient in reading and 48 percent were proficient in math, both below the state average. But Krieger said that doesn't reflect the quality of the school because the test was given in October 2010, before the students had spent much time there. "They didn't teach those kids. It's testing them on what they learned the previous year, wherever they came from," Krieger said.) So when Mayors McKee, Fung and Avedisian say that the Blackstone Valley Mayoral Academy is "the first public school in Rhode Island history to have 100 percent of its elementary-age students proficient" on a state reading assessment, they're right. But that statement might lead readers to assume a comparison with all elementary schools in Rhode Island. Instead, the Blackstone Valley students are taking a test that students in the vast majority of elementary schools don’t take, an important qualifier. In addition, the statement -- and its use of the plural "assessments" -- suggests that the students got 100 percent in more than one test, which is false. Because the statement is mostly accurate but leaves out those important details, we rate the claim Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-14979	"Bernie Sanders admits he is a Democratic Socialist. … Nazis were Democratic Socialists."	/texas/statements/2015/oct/16/jason-villalba/jason-villalba-said-bernie-sanders-democratic-soci/	Bernie Sanders proudly declares himself a democratic socialist. A Texas state representative suggested that Sanders must somehow then be aligned with the Nazis of Adolf Hitler. State Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, posted a tweet during the CNN-hosted Democratic presidential debate Oct. 13, 2015, that opened: "The modern Democrat Party is filled with Democratic Socialists and soft socialists. Is this where we are in America?" To that tweet, Villalba attached an image of what looked like an old document stating: "That awkward moment when … 1) Bernie Sanders admits he is a Democratic Socialist. 2) Nazis were Democratic Socialists 3) America fought an entire World War to stop the advance of Democratic Socialists." The image closed: "Sincerely, Sane Americans." A Democratic activist, Ed Espinoza of Progress Texas, brought it to our attention for a fact check. We didn’t hear back from Villalba about the presented "Democratic Socialist" conclusions. But he told the Dallas Morning News and Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer for the Austin American-Statesman, that the image with its mentions of Sanders and the Nazis was a meme he found online. He also insisted his tweet wasn’t likening Democrats to Nazis. "So is the history accurate in this?" Villalba told Tilove by phone. "Of course not. Look, was I trying to make a connection between Sanders and the Nazi party? Absolutely not. I categorically reject any suggestion that that is what I was intending to do." By the next day, Villalba's tweet was no longer posted by him. Regardless, we checked its accuracy. Sanders a democratic socialist Sanders, the independent Vermont senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination, considers himself a democratic socialist. He’s also Jewish. In the debate, moderator Anderson Cooper delved in: COOPER: "You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?" SANDERS: "Well, we're going to win because first, we're going to explain what democratic socialism is. And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent - almost - own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. "That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing healthcare to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not going to separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have - we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth. "Those are some of the principles that I believe in and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people…" COOPER: …"You don't consider yourself a capitalist, though?" SANDERS: "Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires." Nazis And were the Nazis also Democratic Socialists? We consulted historians and books, finding the Nazi party’s full name was the National Socialist German Workers’ Party. That name was adopted in 1920; before that, the party had been the German Workers’ Party. But there was little socialist about the party’s platform or Hitler’s actions once he acceded to leading Germany in the early 1930s. By phone and email, Rice University historian Peter Caldwell told us the key word in the party’s name was "national" and the party’s focus was on building nationalism — a focus ultimately reflected in Hitler’s twisted vision of cleansing the country of residents, especially Jews, not considered of pure German blood. While socialists on the left celebrate democracy, Caldwell said, the word has a different meaning on the right — in this instance, he said, excluding people who are not part of the nation, hence rejecting Jews and communists and, in pre-World War II Germany, democracy itself. Caldwell said the "misleading" tweet suggesting an alignment between Sanders’ professed democratic socialism and Hitler’s party would "have Hitler turning in his grave, wherever the grave is. The Nazis loudly opposed democracy, the first and foremost thing." Also, he said, "they were opposed to emancipating the workers, giving them the rights to vote and to organize" in unions. Similarly, Barbara Miller Lane, a Bryn Mawr College professor and co-editor of a compilation of Nazi ideology before 1933, said by email: "The Nazis were NOT ‘democratic socialists,’ whatever that means. The Nazis were never democrats and never real socialists either." While there was a longstanding and distinguished Social Democratic Party in Germany from the 1870 to the 1920s, Lane wrote, the Nazis fought against it, and after 1933 imprisoned its leaders. Lane added: "The Nazis opposed all traditional socialism, wanting to substitute something they called ‘German socialism’ or ‘Aryan socialism.’ This meant citizenship and privileges only for ‘Aryans’ (meaning non-Jews), concentration camps for others." According to the "The Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany," Hitler joined the German Workers’ Party in 1919, the year before the party’s decision to add National and Socialist to its name. At the time, according to the book, supporters included "well-placed anti-Semites and extreme nationalists" who hoped to gain influence over members of the working class; Hitler, a spellbinding orator, became the party’s chairman in 1921. Another book, "A Brief History of Germany," says the Nazi’s "appealed to a broad swath of the German population, attracting fervent nationalists and radical conservatives, as well as those who hated the Versailles settlement, feared the communists, or despised the Jews." Our ruling Villalba said Sanders "admits he is a democratic socialist… Nazis were Democratic Socialists." Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. The Nazis were not democratic socialists. Whether or not Villalba intended to link Sanders to the Nazis, his tweet neatly did the job. We find this claim historically inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-02253	"In 2006, Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants."	/florida/statements/2014/apr/11/republican-party-florida/charlie-crist-opposed-state-tuition-dreamers-2006-/	In a statewide election year when both parties are courting Florida’s growing Hispanic vote, the Legislature is debating giving in-state college tuition to young illegal immigrants known as "Dreamers." Similar efforts have failed in the past decade in Tallahassee. But this year the proposal may have the support of Gov. Rick Scott, who has said he will consider the bill if it also contains a provision he wants, one that is unrelated to immigrants: prohibiting universities from raising tuition above the rate set by the Florida Legislature. Democrats have portrayed Scott as anti-Hispanic after supporting an Arizona-style immigration law in 2010 and vetoing a bill that would have given Dreamers driver's licenses in 2013. Scott’s campaign also faced accusations by his former campaign finance chairman, Mike Fernandez, that some campaign staffers made fun of Mexican accents. In an April 9 press release, the Florida Democratic Party said the in-state tuition this year is election-year pandering. The Republican Party of Florida fired back in an email with their own attack against Charlie Crist, the Democratic frontrunner for governor: "Yesterday, Florida Democrats said it was time to ‘do what is right’ for Florida’s Hispanic community, regarding legislation that is moving through the Senate giving in-state college tuition to children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents," April 10 the state party stated. "So where does the Florida Democratic Party’s own candidate stand on the issue? In 2006, Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants." We wanted to check Crist’s position on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006 -- and in the following years. First, a note about Hispanics, who represented about 14 percent of voters in Florida as of 2012. Hispanics lean Democratic but past results show their vote in the governor’s race could be competitive. Though President Barack Obama overwhelmingly won the state’s Hispanic vote in 2012, Hispanics narrowly backed Scott in 2010 according to exit polls, though there was a large margin of error. Dreamers bill in 2006 The state party email cited a 2006 Miami Herald article about Crist when he was attorney general. According to the story, Crist said state lawmakers "did the ‘right thing’ earlier this year when they rejected a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to pay the same tuition rates as Florida residents." That year a proposal to give certain Florida residents who were illegal immigrants in-state tuition divided Republican legislators and drew opposition from Senate President Tom Lee. Ultimately, the proposal failed. (Then-Gov. Jeb Bush said he supported giving in-state tuition to those children if they had lived in Florida at least two years, but he also said it wasn’t the year to deal with it, so the controversial provision was removed from an education bill.) A spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Florida didn’t point to any additional statements by Crist. We went in search of other statements by Crist about giving in-state tuition to children of illegal immigrants and found little else. It did not appear that any bills that would grant in-state tuition to Dreamers reached Crist’s desk while he was governor during sessions between 2007 and 2010. An August 2006 article in the Tampa Bay Times included a one-word "yes" or "no" answer from candidates for governor to several questions, including this one: "Should we allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at our universities?" The answer for Crist: No. Dreamers bill in 2014 Now running as a Democrat, Crist supports in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. "We must immediately pass legislation that allows the children of undocumented parents to attend Florida colleges and universities at in-state tuition levels," Crist says on the immigration page of his campaign website. "It simply isn’t fair to punish children of undocumented parents." This year’s bill has the backing of House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, and passed the House 81-33 in March. In the Senate, a similar measure passed in committees but hasn’t received a vote by the full Senate yet. The bill has the support of many public universities in Florida, and other Republican governors have signed similar measures, including Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. A footnote about Scott and the Dreamers bill this year: Scott has expressed support for the Senate version of the bill which includes getting rid of the tuition differential that allows universities to raise rates beyond what the Legislature sets. The House version doesn’t include that provision. When asked about the House bill April 1, Scott reaffirmed his support for the Senate version. "I'm going to work with the Senate and the House to make sure we have a bill that lowers tuition for all Floridians," he said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said in an email, "In 2006, Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants." The attack doesn’t mention the fact that Crist now supports in-state tuition for immigrants here illegally. But the statement about 2006 is correct: We found two newspaper articles that stated Crist, who was running as a Republican for governor, opposed in-state tuition for Dreamers. We rate the statement True.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2014-04-11T10:49:05	2014-04-10	['Charlie_Crist']
pomt-11967	A flight crew took a knee and stranded the New Orleans Saints on an airport runway.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/03/blog-posting/fake-news-flight-crew-did-not-take-knee-and-strand/	A recent article describing a flight crew taking a knee and leaving the New Orlean Saints stranded on the runway is a fake news story published on another satirical news website. "Flight crew takes a knee and walks off, leave New Orleans Saints stranded on runway," read the headline of the story published on dailyfeed.news on Oct. 2, 2017. The article claimed that the pilot and co-pilot of the plane were combat vets who did not take kindly to Saints players partaking in the "Take A Knee" protest and decided to take a knee of their own and exit the plane. "Looks like the group of thugs should have just considered themselves lucky they’re allowed to make millions for playing a game and stood with respect like they’re told to do in the league rulebook." said the post. Although the "Take a Knee" protest has been a point of controversy in the past few weeks, there is no evidence that this incident ever took place. (There is also no mention of the national anthem in the 2017 NFL rule book, though a spokesman did confirm the "game operations manual" requires players to stand for the song.) The Saints, who played the Dolphins in London on Oct.2, made a team decision to take a knee during the coin toss then stand during the anthem as "a way to show respect to all," tweeted quarterback Drew Brees. The article was first published on Oct. 1 to Freedumjunkshun.com, a satirical news site with a format that resembles Christopher Blair’s, TheLastLineOfDefense.org. Blair, a self-proclaimed liberal troll, is known to run a number of joke news sites responsible for publishing stories meant to "mess with conservatives," he told PolitiFact in an email last spring. The owner of Freedumjunkshun.com is listed as a private registrant, so there is not any definitive proof that Blair is behind this site.

pomt-02450	Barry Smitherman "doesn’t have enough legal experience to apply for most of the jobs at the attorney general’s office."	/texas/statements/2014/feb/26/ken-paxton/most-lawyer-jobs-ags-office-require-three-years-ex/	Interviewed Jan. 24, 2014, on KFYO-AM in Lubbock, state Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney claimed Barry Smitherman, an opponent in the race for Texas attorney general, "doesn’t have enough legal experience to apply for most of the jobs at the attorney general’s office." Smitherman, who chairs the state Railroad Commission, "has only 15 months of total legal experience," said Paxton, vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee and a former House member, who said he has 22 years’ experience practicing law. That 15-month figure didn’t hold up, though Smitherman separately acknowledged that he has spent less than three years practicing law. The others bidding for attorney general in the March 4, 2014, primary elections are also lawyers. Republican state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas, who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, is a senior attorney and shareholder in corporate law firm Winstead PC; campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez told us by email Branch has practiced law for 30 years. The lone Democrat is Sam Houston, a Houston lawyer unrelated to the historical figure of the same name, who is nearing 27 years of private legal practice, as we noted in a 2013 fact-check. Traditionally, the state attorney general has been a lawyer, though according to the Secretary of State’s office, the Texas Constitution doesn’t require a law license or legal experience for the job, which was created in 1845, when legal qualifications were less formal. The attorney general does act as the state’s lawyer, often filing lawsuits at the request of a department or branch of state government, as well as litigating cases, defending state laws and providing legal advice; another duty is approving public bond issues. Asked for his response to Paxton’s claim, Smitherman told us by phone, "Well, first of all, most of the jobs over there are non-judicial; they’re non-lawyer jobs. So that’s patently false." Paxton spokeswoman Ashley Sewell told us via email that Paxton’s comment "was obviously given in the context of legal qualifications and legal jobs which require a licensed attorney. … (T)he lack of Barry Smitherman’s legal experience keeps him from being qualified for more than half of those jobs." Sewell emailed us information on employees in the attorney general’s office pulled from the Texas Tribune’s online data portal. She said that of 718 "legal personnel," 515 were classed as assistant attorney general employment grade IV or above. That, she said, meant the 515 positions required three or more years’ legal experience; as backup, she sent two 2014 job postings -- one requiring three years for a level IV assistant attorney general opening and another requiring four years for a level V assistant attorney general job. On behalf of the AG’s office, spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us by email that the agency has 4,073 employees, of whom 734 are lawyers, with 717 of those being categorized as assistant attorney general classifications I through VII. She said that the agency requires three years or more experience for classes IV and up; those categories account for 509 lawyer positions. Most of the remaining "lawyer" jobs are director positions and the post of first assistant attorney general; these don’t have a specific legal experience requirement attached. Rather, the job descriptions call for "experience relevant to the assignment" and possibly a law license in a specialty area. So 509 AAG positions at the agency require three or more years’ legal experience. That’s 70 percent of the total "lawyer" jobs on staff and 13 percent of all the agency’s jobs. Smitherman told us he practiced as a briefing attorney and municipal bond attorney from 1984 to 1985, earned a master’s degree in public administration and spent 16 years in investment banking, then began a second career as a prosecutor in the Harris County district attorney’s office and was there 15 months before Gov. Rick Perry appointed him to the Public Utilities Commission in 2004. He was promoted to PUC chairman in 2007, then appointed in 2011 to the Railroad Commission, which he has chaired since 2012. "If you’re going to do a just-math exercise on how long I was in a law firm and how long I was in the Harris County DA’s office, that’s about two years and three months," he said. But, he said, "I think I probably could have come out of the Harris County DA’s office as a baby prosecutor and gotten a job in the AG’s office" because the Harris County office is so large and so busy. A year there, where his typical morning could start with a hundred or more cases to plead out or pursue, is like "dog years," Smitherman said. Our ruling Paxton said Smitherman "doesn’t have enough legal experience to apply for most of the jobs at the attorney general’s office." Most of the jobs at the attorney general’s office -- 87 percent -- don’t require any legal experience at all. Of the 734 jobs that do, 70 percent have a minimum qualification of three years or more, which Smitherman would not meet. We rate Paxton’s statement, which could have used clarification that he was focusing on lawyer jobs, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-01753	Israel in the last three weeks has "killed more Palestinian children, more than 200, than the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in military operations since 2006."	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/31/jake-tapper/tapper-more-palestinian-children-killed-3-weeks-is/	Gaza’s casualties have piled up much faster than Israel’s since bombs began flying three weeks ago, and on July 29’s The Lead, CNN host Jake Tapper put the disparity in context during an interview with Israeli spokesperson Mark Regev. "If my calculations are right," Tapper said, "Israel has, in the last three weeks, killed more Palestinian children, more than 200, than the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in military operations since 2006, which includes the Second Lebanon War, Operation Cast Lead, Operation Pillar of Defense, and now Operation Protective Edge." "At what point does the Israeli government say, enough, we’re killing too many innocent children?" Regev gave an example of the grief the deaths are causing Israeli officials, but reiterated what Israel has been saying for weeks: Hamas is responsible for using civilians as human shields. Tapper’s tough line of questioning made some waves online, so we wanted to break down his claim about the casualties out of Israel and Gaza. Gazan child deaths Looking at the number of Palestinian children killed in the last three weeks is relatively simple -- virtually every major news organization has been referring to the United Nation’s figures, which we have little reason to doubt. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs issues a daily report on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which includes a tally of total deaths, civilian deaths and child deaths, gathered by combining reports from Palestinian authorities -- not Hamas -- and the bodies their own agents have seen in Gaza. The UN’s July 31 report puts the total Palestinian death toll at 1,263, including at least 852 civilians and 249 children. On July 29, when Tapper made his claim, the UN reported 229 child deaths. So Tapper’s estimate that "more than 200" Palestinian children are dead is accurate. Whether you can attribute all the deaths directly to Israel, however, is more of an open debate. Palestinian and Israeli officials have blamed each other’s bombs for some of the civilian deaths -- for example, the 15 Palestinians killed at a UN school in Jabalia on July 24. When Tapper went on air, the UN had not yet been able to definitively resolve their conflicting claims, although they’ve since traced the mortal shell to Israel. Other children have died during gunfights between the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and Hamas, and it’s impossible to say definitively whose bullets killed them. Israeli military deaths Tracing deaths in the IDF back eight years takes a little more work. Tapper told us he looked at the Israeli government’s figures on casualties for their four major military operations since 2006: Conflict Dates Summary Israeli military deaths The Second Lebanon War July 12 – Aug. 14, 2006 Militants from Hezbollah -- a Shiite Muslim group considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and EU -- took Israeli soldiers hostage at the Israel-Lebanon border. After negotiations and a rescue attempt failed, Israel bombed Lebanon, sent ground troops, and imposed air and naval blockades. Hezbollah responded with rockets and guerilla warfare. 119 Operation Cast Lead Dec. 27, 2008 – Jan. 18, 2009 Israel bombed and subsequently launched a campaign into Gaza, ostensibly to stop rocket fire and weapon smuggling by Palestinian militants, including Hamas. 9 Operation Pillar of Defense Nov. 14 – 21, 2012 Israel unleashed a series of airstrikes on Gaza, ostensibly to stop rocket fire by Palestinian militants, including Hamas. 1 Operation Protective Edge July 8, 2014 – present After the collapse of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the kidnapping and murder of both Israeli and Palestinian teenagers, increased rocket fire from Hamas, and skirmishes in the West Bank, Israel bombed and subsequently launched a military operation into Gaza. 43 (56 as of July 31) That adds up to 172 deaths, and Tapper correctly accounted for the major Israeli military operations since 2006. These figures, Tapper told us, "provide an important sense of just how large these Gaza children death numbers are -- more than all the IDF troops killed in action the Israeli government deemed necessary to protect its country in the last eight years combined." Besides the four operations above, three confrontations between Gaza and Israel have caused Israeli military casualties: Operations Summer Rain and Autumn Clouds in 2006, and Operation Hot Winter in 2008, which in total resulted in the deaths of eight Israeli soldiers. That takes us up to 180 deaths in what the IDF has publicly named "operations." We found a few other Israeli military deaths that likely should be added to any tally. In 2008, two Israeli soldiers were returned dead after being kidnapped during the Second Lebanon War, and an IDF soldier was killed by a Hamas bomb during Operation Cast Lead. An additional 34 on-duty soldiers and four off-duty soldiers also have died in terrorist attacks since 2006 (all the attacks were from Palestinians). Including them takes the total to 221 Israeli soldier deaths, compared to the deaths of 229 Palestinian children. Our ruling Tapper, while grilling an Israeli spokesman, said, "Israel has, in the last three weeks, killed more Palestinian children, more than 200, than the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in military operations since 2006." His figure for Palestinian child deaths comes from the United Nations. According to humanitarian workers on the ground, more than 200 Palestinian children have died in the last three weeks from the Israel-Hamas conflict, though it’s not clear in every case whether the Israeli bullets and bombs are directly responsible. That is indeed more than the number of Israeli soldiers killed since 2006 while engaged in military operations, our review found. Tapper’s numbers are accurate, but there remains some question about who bears responsibility for the deaths of every Palestinian child. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11361	Says Mary Taylor has a work schedule that is "almost untraceable."	/ohio/statements/2018/apr/03/mike-dewine/mike-dewines-tv-ad-says-gop-opponent-mary-taylors-/	Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor is a slacker who isn’t ready for a promotion to the governor’s mansion, says her Republican primary opponent, Attorney General Mike DeWine. On the website marydoesnotwork.com, the DeWine campaign posted a statewide TV ad that makes a series of attacks about her work record, including that she was a no-show. Part of the ad states: "Taylor is dogged by rumors that she skips out on work. A slacker whose work schedule is almost untraceable." We found that the ad cherrypicks a couple of sentences from one newspaper article about Taylor’s work schedule while ignoring her explanation. Also, the attack pertains to her former job as state auditor (2007-11) and not her current job as lieutenant governor. DeWine and Taylor are competing in the May 8 Republican primary. Taylor’s work as state auditor The ad draws on a March 2010 article by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which reported that since Taylor took office as state auditor in 2007, she had been dogged by rumors about skipping work. The state auditor, an elected position, is responsible for auditing all public offices in Ohio including cities, schools, state universities and state agencies. "The fact that she admittedly spends as much time working away from her main Columbus office as she is there has only fueled speculation that Ohioans had elected a slacker," the Plain Dealer wrote. "She doesn't document her work hours. She doesn't ask for mileage reimbursement from the state. And she can't tell you how much time she spends working here or there. Her work schedule is almost untraceable, and that's how Taylor seems to like it." The ad omits Taylor’s explanation to the Plain Dealer: Taylor said that she preferred to use one of her seven regional offices, including one close to her home in Canton, rather than travel to Columbus. The Columbus Dispatch wrote in February 2010 that Taylor was "the first statewide executive officeholder in memory to work most of the week from an office outside the state capital." Taylor worked several days a week out of the Canton office, allowing her to work close to home where she was raising two teenage boys with her husband, the Dispatch reported. She said she worked in Columbus one or two days a week. "I'm elected state auditor, I'm not just the auditor of Columbus," Taylor told the Dispatch. "From my perspective, it is manageable, and I think it's more efficient at times." The Dispatch’s editorial board concluded that critics of Taylor were ignoring both the prevalence of telecommuting and the nature of the state auditor's work. The editorial board wrote that 653 of Taylor's 833 employees worked in regional offices away from Columbus. "As long as the auditor's office is effectively managed, Taylor's location isn't of primary importance," the board wrote. We asked her campaign spokesman to cite some of her key accomplishments as auditor. Michael Duchesne said her office did "rigorous financial audits of more than 5,600 public entities" and identified millions of dollars in public funds that were handled improperly, spent illegally or stolen, leading to convictions. The auditor’s office also uncovered Medicaid fraud and tracked federal stimulus dollars. The ad said that Taylor’s work schedule was "almost untraceable," so we went in search of any record of her calendar while auditor and could not find one. The Ohio State Auditor’s office said her executive correspondence was transferred to the state archives. A reference archivist told us that a catalog record showed boxes of correspondence, but didn’t show her schedule. Taylor’s work as lieutenant governor Taylor became the lieutenant governor in January 2011 and was re-elected along with Gov. John Kasich in 2014. Kasich is term limited. In 2015, Taylor told the Plain Dealer that she "usually" worked in Columbus. "It’s no secret, and I make no apologies for this," she replied when asked about the time she spends close to home. "My family comes first. And you know what? I tell my staff the same thing." We asked her spokesman in the lieutenant governor’s office for a sample of her calendar. David Hopcraft sent PolitiFact her schedule between July and December 2016. The calendar showed the dates and times of policy briefings, staff meetings, public events, media interviews, phone calls and travel time. Hopcraft told PolitiFact that in 2018 she has taken personal time to campaign, but she has also come into the official office about once every 10 days to two weeks. We asked Hopcraft for a list of her accomplishments while lieutenant governor. Taylor was also the director of the Ohio Department of Insurance for most of her tenure, which meant she guided state policy related to health insurance coverage and other types of insurance, he said. She has also worked to cut business regulations and recruit business to Ohio and was the signatory on an agreement with Michigan and Indiana to reduce the load of nutrients and phosphorus runoff into Lake Erie by 40 percent by 2025. Neverthless, news reports during Taylor’s tenure as lieutenant governor have raised questions about her oversight of workers. In 2014, Taylor’s then-chief of staff Laura Johnson and her administrative aide, Heather Brandt, both quit after a public records request revealed they were working less than they had reported. They had hundreds of questionable hours claimed for work, including for hair and salon appointments, an Inspector General report showed. The Inspector General concluded that employees "operated with inadequate oversight, absence of supervision." The Columbus Dispatch also found that Johnson worked on state time on the 2014 re-election campaign of Taylor and John Kasich. Our ruling A TV ad by DeWine said that Taylor has a work schedule that "is almost untraceable." This attack refers to Taylor’s time as auditor, which ended when she became lieutenant governor in 2011. We were unable to find detailed records of her work schedule as auditor. By stating that her work schedule was "almost untraceable," the ad creates the impression that she was hardly ever at work, but the ad and the 2010 Plain Dealer article it draws from don’t prove that occurred. The ad omits Taylor’s explanation: that she worked out of a regional office close to her home. The ad also omits any information about where Taylor has worked in her current role. We were able to find her calendar while lieutenant governor by requesting it from her office. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-15358	"We've cut the deficit by two-thirds."	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/08/barack-obama/wisconsin-visit-barack-obama-brags-he-reduced-fede/	Making an economic speech at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse on July 2, 2015, Barack Obama ticked off a list of his accomplishments as president -- and made a bolder version of a claim we have heard before about slashing the federal budget deficit. "So, we’ve got a record streak of private-sector job growth," Obama said in his remarks, which included veiled criticisms of Gov. Scott Walker on the day Walker filed federal papers as a precursor to announcing his run for president. "We’ve cut the deficit by two-thirds. Our stock market has more than doubled, restoring 401(k)s for millions of families. This is progress. Step by step, America is moving forward. Middle-class economics works. It works. Yes!" Here's why the deficit claim caught our attention: In September 2014 in Milwaukee, Obama said he had cut the deficit in half. We rated that statement True, and it has become one of our most-clicked fact checks. Could it be that, less than a year later, the deficit is down by two-thirds? Deficit vs debt Let’s be clear at the top that Obama is talking about the deficit, which has been getting smaller -- not the debt, which is getting bigger. The deficit is an annual number. It’s the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The United States hasn’t seen budget surpluses since the days of President Bill Clinton. The debt, meanwhile, is a running tally -- it’s the total of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. The nation's debt currently exceeds $18 trillion, and it has risen by more than $7 trillion under Obama. (Here’s a good primer from PolitiFact National on the difference between the two.) Tracking the deficit numbers In reviewing the cut-the-deficit-in-half claim, our baseline was fiscal 2009. That period started on Oct. 1, 2008, when George W. Bush was still president, and ended on Sept. 30, 2009, eight months after Obama took office. We found the deficit was $1.41 trillion in 2009 and $679.5 billion in 2013 -- a drop of more than half. Measured another way, the deficit made up 9.8 percent of the economy (gross domestic product) in 2009 and dropped to less than half of that -- 4.1 percent -- by the end of fiscal 2013. But now we have figures for fiscal 2014. PolitiFact National examined those figures in January 2015, after Obama said in his State of the Union speech that we've seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds." Our colleagues rated his statement Mostly True. The 2014 deficit was $486 billion -- a drop of two-thirds from the $1.41 trillion in 2009. And it was 2.8 percent of GDP, a reduction of more than two-thirds from the 9.8 percent in 2009. (In June 2015, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that 2015 will end with a deficit that, as a percentage of GDP, will be the lowest since 2007.) So, math wise, Obama’s two-thirds claim is solid. But there are a few caveats. "Yes, we reduced the deficit two-thirds from its peak in 2009, but that was after deficits had just increased by nearly 800 percent to their highest level outside of World War II," Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told us. Indeed, Obama helped grow the 2009 deficit with his stimulus spending, although he can take some credit for the economy, which has improved since the Great Recession ended in June 2009 and helped bring down the deficits. And although the Congressional Budget Office projects that deficits relative to GDP will decline slightly over the next few years, they will then rise and add more to the debt. Largely as a result of the aging population and rising health care costs, CBO projects the deficit to grow from less than 3 percent of GDP in 2015 to more than 6 percent in 2040. Our rating Obama said: "We've cut the deficit by two-thirds." In raw dollars and as a percentage of the overall economy, the annual federal deficit in 2014 was two-thirds smaller than in 2009, the year Obama took office. But there are several caveats, including the fact that his stimulus spending helped raise the 2009 deficit and the economy, for which he can take some credit, has improved since the end of the Great Recession the same year. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-07-08T05:00:00	2015-07-02	['None']

pomt-10198	McCain economic adviser Phil Gramm is "the architect of some of the deregulation in Washington that helped cause the mess on Wall Street."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/17/barack-obama/former-adviser-supported-deregulation/	With a plummeting stock market grabbing headlines, Barack Obama attacked John McCain's economic philosophy in a speech in Elko, Nev. Obama mocked McCain for saying that he would shake up Washington and get rid of the "old boys network." "I mean, where is he getting these lines? The lobbyists running his campaign?" Obama asked. "Maybe it's Phil Gramm – the man who was the architect of some of the deregulation in Washington that helped cause the mess on Wall Street, who also happens to be the architect of John McCain's economic plan and one of his chief advisers. You remember Phil Gramm – he's the guy who said that we were just going through a 'mental recession' and who called the United States of America a 'nation of whiners.'" We should stipulate from the start that Phil Gramm might view the title "architect of deregulation" as a compliment, though he might prefer the title "architect of regulatory efficiency." Gramm gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, published on June 28, 2008. His biggest worry about Wall Street in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown was that it would be regulated more heavily, according to the story. "Every American should worry a lot about this," Gramm said. "We have benefited enormously from New York being the financial capital of the world because we had a more efficient regulatory structure than other nations did." As a U.S. senator, Gramm promoted two bills that curtailed regulation: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. Gramm had a prominent role as sponsor and co-sponsor of these bills, respectively. But as we've said in other rulings, it takes more than one person to change a law. These bills had other supporters, and President Bill Clinton signed both into law. It's also worth noting that the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have frowned on increased regulation in the years since those laws were passed. So don't give Gramm all the credit. Did deregulation "help cause" the disaster on Wall Street? The carnage is still being autopsied, but most Wall Street watchers agree that light regulation allowed irresponsible lending and mortgage fraud to go unchecked. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act in particular has been singled out for spurring the growth of poorly understood, unregulated securities such as credit default swaps, which have been getting a good portion of the blame for the financial crisis of September 2008. Finally, Gramm is no longer a chief adviser to the McCain campaign. He resigned in July 2008 after the "nation of whiners" remark that Obama mentions. So let's go over the elements of this statement: "Architect of some of the deregulation": Not the architect, but fairly described as a key supporter. "That helped cause the mess on Wall Street": Not the root cause, but a contributing factor. "Helped" seems a fair characterization. "One of McCain's chief advisers": He used to be, but isn't anymore. There's some truth here, but it also seems like Obama is exaggerating to make a point. When you add up all the elements, we rate Obama's statement Half True.

pomt-07385	"China now owns $1.1 trillion of our debt, our trade deficit last year with them was a quarter of a trillion dollars."	/virginia/statements/2011/may/03/terry-mcauliffe/terry-mcauliffe-says-china-owns-11-trillion-us-deb/	At the height of Donald Trump-fueled birther fever, potential Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe stopped by MSNBC’s Hardball with Chris Matthews to chime in on "The Donald." McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, received a $25,000 campaign contribution from Trump, a Republican, during his unsuccessful 2009 gubernatorial bid. But on TV, McAuliffe was dismissive of his one-time benefactor’s claims that President Obama was born in Kenya. He said the birther sideshow -- which was discredited a few days later when Obama released his long-form U.S. birth certificate -- was hurting Republicans by scaring away undecided voters, and distracting people from important issues. "This is so offensive to independents and to people in this country today ... who worry that China now owns $1.1 trillion of our debt, our trade deficit last year with them was a quarter of a trillion dollars. They’re worried about their job. They’re worried about their children’s job. And this gibberish that they talk about on television is doing nothing and other countries are moving at warp speed ahead of us on renewable energy, wind, electric cars..." OK, before McAuliffe starts plugging his electric car company, as he is wont, let’s take a look at those digits and dollar signs he’s throwing around. The $1.1 trillion sounded familiar, so we’ll examine that one first. For a source, McAuliffe provided a March 1 article from Reuters. The second paragraph of that story supports his claim: "Treasury Department data released on Monday showed that China held $1.16 trillion in U.S. government debt in December, the most recent month for which figures are available, up from prior estimates of $892 billion," the story says. Well, that’s true. The latest figures from the U.S. Treasury Department show China held $1.154 trillion in U.S. debt in February -- down $600 million from January. Japan was the second-largest holder, at $890.3 billion, with Great Britain third at $295.5 billion. Here’s a little background: The total federal debt, as of May 2, was $14.29 trillion. Of that amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government. That includes China and other foreign nations. The remaining debt -- about $4.64 trillion -- is held by the Federal Financing Bank, U.S. government trust funds, and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that endows Social Security. McAuliffe, for his second claim, used a report from the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution that reports: "In 2010, the U.S.-China trade deficit increased to over $273 billion, the highest bilateral trade deficit on record. It represents almost 55 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit." We checked it out, and that’s true, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If you’re curious, this year’s trade deficit through February was $42.1 billion. That’s almost 36 percent of the United States’ $117.8 billion trade deficit for the first two months of the year. Looking back, this is an open-and-shut case. We cannot confirm McAuliffe’s claim that independent voters are offended by The Donald. But he’s right on his numbers: China owns $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt; our trade deficit with China was about $275 billion last year. Both scary, both True.

pomt-12312	"Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/22/antinews/its-fake-news-chinese-lunar-rover-found-no-evidenc/	An Internet post claiming that high-ranking Chinese officials had called the American moon landing a "complete hoax" is a fake news story that has been in circulation for years: A new scandal has happened after high ranking officials from the Chinese space program called the American moon landing "a complete hoax", the Beijing Daily Express reports. The claims came after the Chinese moon rover allegedly couldn’t find any proof of American landings on the Moon. The rover took thousands of photos and after analyzing them the Chinese discovered that there’s no trace of these moon landings. The post attributes the quote to the Beijing Daily Express, a publication we found no record of. It also points to thousands of photos taken by the Chinese Yutu moon rover, which launched in December 2013 and ceased to operate in July 2016, stating these "showed no trace" of the Apollo moon landing. While the rover did take many photos, Andrew Jones, a journalist following China’s space program, points out that Yutu landed far from the Apollo landing site, so there wouldn’t be evidence one way or another. "It had traveled tens of meters in total, when it would have needed to travel thousands of kilometers over varying and hazardous terrain to visit all the Apollo landing sites," Jones said. "Yutu, with designed minimum lifetime of three (Earth) months and a range of up to 10 kilometers, lasted 31 months on the Moon, but was stationary for the vast majority of this." The Lunar Reconnaissance Spacecraft has captured ample evidence of the Apollo landing, though, which can be seen in this database. This is the same spacecraft that the Chinese space agency used to determine Yutu’s landing site. In addition to photographs, the Apollo mission brought back rock samples that have fueled decades of scientific research, and are available upon request from NASA. "So far, no one has seen those samples and declared them to be fake," director of space policy at Planetary Society Casey Dreier said. The story also claims the Chinese space program launched a petition demanding the United States declassify NASA information regarding the U.S. moon landing, signed by 200 of its highest-ranking officials. But the petition is nowhere to be found and alleged signee and "world renowned nuclear engineer" Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin is actually renowned in fake news circles as a Russian conspiracy theorist denying all moon landings. The only information available about him online, though, has been produced by Mukhin himself, leading Wikipedia to cast serious doubt on his profile. The story can be traced back to a 2014 post on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a known peddler of fake news that assumes "all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content."

pomt-01525	Michelle Nunn "spent most of her childhood" in Perry, Ga.	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/19/michelle-nunn/nunn-invitation-exaggerates-her-youth-georgia/	Readers of a certain age will remember Bill Clinton accepting the Democratic nomination for president in 1992 by invoking the name of the small southern town where he lived as a young boy. The two-time president spent seven years in Hope, Ark., first while his mother finished nursing school and then briefly after she returned. "I still believe in a place called Hope," Clinton famously said, explaining the small town’s lessons of equality and aspiration. Clinton was in Atlanta last week, at the home of R&B singer Usher, to raise money for Democrat Michelle Nunn’s U.S. Senate bid. Both Nunn and her Republican opponent, David Perdue, are trying to burnish their Georgia credentials, no easy task since both have spent major portions of their lives out of state. The invitation to the Usher event invoked a small middle Georgia town to tell Nunn’s story. "Daughter of Sam and Colleen Nunn," the bio section read, "Michelle was born in 1966 in Macon, near her grandparents’ farm in Perry, Ga., where she spent most of her childhood." An alert reader pointed out the "most of her childhood" claim, certain Nunn herself had acknowledged her family moved away when her father was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972. She was 6 at the time. Nunn declined to talk to PolitiFact Georgia about the claim. But she has talked with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and national media about her childhood plenty, even before announcing her candidacy. In several AJC stories, including a 1992 Father’s Day piece, Nunn says she grew up in the Washington, D.C. area. A January, 2014 New York Times story describes her as quipping that she moved "against my will," when she was 6 and her family relocated to Maryland. The same article notes Nunn lived in the Capital region during high school, when she played basketball at the all-girls National Cathedral School. Those reports are accurate, said Nunn spokesman Nathan Click. So is the biography listed on her official campaign website, which notes only that she was born near the family’s Perry farm, he said. "While the bio that appears on the campaign's website and is widely utilized by the campaign correctly characterizes Michelle's biographical facts, a separate document that appeared on some event invitations failed to properly do so," Click said in a statement. Even though the fundraiser was the most high-profile to date in Nunn’s race against Republican businessman Perdue, that might be the end of it: a bio not properly vetted before publication. But another Nunn misstep, the leak of confidential campaign strategy memos this summer, brings up another point. The memos point out that Nunn should anticipate certain attacks, among them that she is "not a ‘real’ Georgian." Candidates, and voters, move in and out of the state all the time, so it’s unclear how much of a negative that would really be, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Perdue, for instance, has a television ad airing outside of metro Atlanta, that says he "grew up working his family’s farm in middle Georgia. " The spot doesn’t mention that the 64-year-old spent much of his working life outside the state, in places such as Massachusetts, Tennessee and Hong Kong. But the leaked memos could open up Nunn to attack for being disingenuous, Swint said. "Newt Gingrich is from Pennsylvania for heaven’s sake," he said. "Ordinarily it wouldn’t be that big of a story, but it is because of the intense publicity from the leak." Leslie Shedd, spokeswoman for the division of the Georgia GOP known as Georgia Victory, said the issue is not where Nunn grew up but why any biography would counter already-published facts. "To me, it’s not an issue that she didn’t spend her entire life in Georgia," Shedd said. "Why does she feel the need to essentially lie about it?" Based on the explanation from the Nunn camp, and the ease to find biographical information on her, Swint said it appears the bio was an inadvertent, not intentional mistake. Click described Nunn as a ninth-generation Georgian, who kept ties to Perry by spending holidays and summers at the family farm. Nunn herself, in the New York Times piece, said her father constantly reminded her that she was "from Georgia." Nunn has lived in Atlanta since 1989, after graduating from the University of Virginia at 23. Childhood, by any reasonable definition, ends at least at age 18. And the facts are clear: Nunn spent 12 of those years living outside of Georgia. Even accounting for summer vacations and holidays, any claim that she spent "most" of her childhood here is inconsistent with the facts. Nunn’s campaign admits it made a mistake with its statement, and there are multiple instances of her acknowledging her move from Georgia. Nunn did spend part of her childhood in Georgia, but certainly not most of it. We rate the invitation claim Mostly False.	None	Michelle Nunn	None	None	None	2014-09-19T00:00:00	2014-09-13	['None']

pomt-04679	When Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were created, "Republicans stood on the sidelines"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/james-clyburn/james-clyburn-says-republicans-sat-sidelines-passa/	During his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., James Clyburn -- a South Carolinian who is the third-highest-ranking Democrat in the House -- offered an extended metaphor about how Democrats have protected Americans over the years. "When too many of our senior citizens who were living their golden years in the darkness of economic security, Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt and a Democratic congress created Social Security, lighting a candle, while the Republicans cursed the darkness," Clyburn said. "When too many of our elderly found their lives darkened by unaffordable and inaccessible health care, Lyndon Johnson and a Democratic Congress lit the candles of Medicare and Medicaid, while Republicans stood on the sidelines and cursed the darkness," he added. Clyburn used some strong metaphors in that passage, but his point was clear -- that Republicans were not involved when Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were passed. We have looked at similar claims in the past, which we’ll recap here. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Social Security Act, was controversial for a number of reasons, including its perceived effects on the labor market and whether its benefits favored working white men. But some opponents, including some Republicans, spoke out forcefully against it. As Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times recalled in a 2009 column, Daniel Reed, a Republican House member from New York, predicted that Americans would feel "the lash of the dictator." Sen. Daniel Hastings, a Delaware Republican, declared that the proposal would "end the progress of a great country." And John Taber, a GOP House member representative from New York, said, "Never in the history of the world has any measure been brought here so insidiously designed as to prevent business recovery, to enslave workers." Nevertheless, on Aug. 8, 1935, the conference report — the final version of the bill that melds together changes made in the House and in the Senate — passed in the House, 372-33, with 81 Republicans voting in favor compared to just 15 against. The next day, the bill was passed in the Senate, 77-6, with 16 Republicans supporting the legislation and only 5 voting against it. So Social Security did pass with Republican support. Decades later, the idea of federally sponsored health care was unpopular in certain segments of the Republican Party. In 1961, Ronald Reagan, the future president, released an LP with a speech in which he demonized "socialized medicine," citing proposals that sound a lot like the one passed four years later. "Write those letters now; call your friends and then tell them to write them," Reagan said. "If you don't, this program, I promise you, will pass just as surely as the sun will come up tomorrow, and behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country. ... And if you don't do this and if I don't do it, one of these days we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free." Other high-profile Republicans who opposed Medicare and Medicaid included Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, the party's 1964 presidential nominee. And by 1965, as the bill that Johnson would eventually sign worked its way through the House, Republican support was scant. No Republicans voted for the bill until it reached the floor. It passed the Ways and Means Committee by a party-line vote of 17-8. And all four Republicans on the House Rules Committee — the panel that sets the boundaries of debate on all bills that come to the House floor — voted against the bill. However, as time went on, Republican support grew. As the bill worked its way through the Senate, Republican support was somewhat stronger. In the final Finance Committee vote, the measure passed 12-5, with four of the committee's eight Republicans supporting it. And when the House adopted a conference report, on July 27, 1965, it passed it by a 307-116 margin. That included 70 Republican "yes" votes, against 68 "no" votes. Then, on July 28, 1965, the Senate adopted the bill by a vote of 70-24, with 13 Republicans in favor and 17 against. President Johnson signed it two days later. So in the House, a slight majority of the Republican caucus voted for the bill, and in the Senate, a significant minority voted in favor. In neither case did Republicans as a whole "stand on the sidelines." "The political parties were very different in 1965 than they are today," said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the U.S. Senate. "Both had strong conservative and liberal wings, so most votes were bipartisan because the conservatives in the two parties voted against the liberals in each party. You had Republicans like Jacob Javits (N.Y.) who were more liberal than most Democrats, and Democrats like James Eastland (Miss.) who were more conservative than most Republicans. So there were Republicans who supported Medicare and Democrats who opposed it." Our ruling Although some of the biggest and most vocal opponents of the bills were Republicans, it’s wrong to say that "Republicans stood on the sidelines" when the bills were being considered. On the final vote on Social Security, Republicans overwhelmingly supported the bill. On Medicare and Medicaid, a majority of Republicans voted for the bill in the House, as did a significant minority in the Senate. We rate Clyburn’s claim False.

pomt-05059	If the U.S. didn't borrow $1.2 trillion every year "to fund government operations," that money would be available "for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/08/mark-neumann/uncle-sams-borrowing-leaves-less-businesses-gop-wi/	Americans have heard many times that Uncle Sam’s borrowing puts a terrible burden on their children and grandchildren, because they’re the ones who will have to pay the money back someday. But former congressman Mark Neumann, a Wisconsin Republican running for U.S. Senate, contends the borrowing has a pernicious present-day effect as well. In a June 13, 2012 radio interview, Neumann said that if the federal government didn't borrow $1.2 trillion every year "to fund government operations," that money would be available "for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses." Really? There’s essentially one pot of money out there and every time the federal government sticks it beak in, there’s less for private businesses -- even with interest rates at near-record lows? Neumann’s case Here’s the relevant exchange between Neumann and talk show host Mitch Henck of WIBA-AM (1310) in Madison: Henck: "We need something bold, don't you, to get this economy going?" Neumann: "Well, I think balancing the federal budget so that the federal government stops borrowing $1.2 trillion out of the private sector is going to help our economy immensely. When you think about the federal government taking $1.2 trillion out of the private sector to fund government operations, you can see what's wrong with our economy." Henck: "Aren't they taking that from the Chinese? They're borrowing that money, aren't they, Congressman?" Neumann: "They are borrowing that money and that's the point exactly. If they did not borrow that money, that money would be available out here in the private sector for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses. "As it is -- and listen, I'm a business owner myself, I've been in business for 35 years here in Wisconsin creating Wisconsin jobs -- and the reality is, I understand that I'm now competing against the federal government to borrow money to expand our businesses. We just expanded into the Madison market to the Dane County area with our business and it was a monumental task to arrange the financing to do that because the federal government is taking $1.2 trillion first, before any of us entrepreneurs get to compete to borrow money." We called Neumann to ask him to elaborate on the relation between borrowing done by the federal government and borrowing done by an individual or business on Main Street. He repeatedly said that if the U.S. government didn’t run annual deficits of about $1.2 trillion, necessitating the borrowing, that money would be available to businesses and individuals. Other views We asked five experts about Neumann’s argument. "This is a fairly straightforward, almost master of the obvious-type statement," said J.D. Foster, senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C. Money is loaned first to the U.S. government because it is considered "the riskless borrower," and the money the U.S. borrows isn’t available to others, he said. OK, the same dollar can only be loaned one time. But does U.S. borrowing, as Neumann claims, leave less money for businesses? Not according to the other experts. "The U.S. government and American entrepreneurs are not running after the same pool of money," said Abdur Chowdhury, chairman of the economics department at Marquette University in Milwaukee. The U.S. borrows largely from overseas -- by selling securities -- while domestic businesses borrow mostly from domestic banks, he said. The notion that the amount of federal borrowing limits money available to be loaned to businesses "is absurd on its face," said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "Every single measure of the interest rate (Aaa bonds, Baa bonds, mortgage loans, car loans etc.) is lower today than at any point in the (George W.) Bush administration," he said by email. "If government borrowing were pulling money away from businesses, it would be by pushing up interest rates." Barry Bosworth, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, agreed. Neumann’s statement "makes little sense right now because the basic problem is the opposite -- no one wants to borrow, and hence interest rates are near zero. If we could get more people to borrow and invest, the economy would quickly recover," he said. Bosworth, a former adviser to Democratic President Jimmy Carter, said Neumann’s claim might have been true prior to 1970, when "capital markets were closed at the borders." But since the 1990s capital markets are global and U.S. government borrowing doesn’t "crowd out" businesses seeking capital, he said. Andrew Reschovsky, professor of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that among other reasons, Neumann is proven wrong by "basic economics." Increased federal borrowing should increase demand for money and raise interest rates, which would discourage businesses from borrowing, but interest rates have been at or near historic lows, he said. Our rating Neumann said that if the federal government didn't borrow $1.2 trillion every year "to fund government operations," that money would be available "for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses." While it’s true you can only lend the same dollar once, the consensus among experts we consulted is that the level of federal government borrowing does not leave less money available for businesses to borrow -- or as Marquette’s Chowdhury put it: "It’s not a zero-sum game." We rate Neumann’s statement False.	None	Mark Neumann	None	None	None	2012-07-08T09:00:00	2012-06-13	['United_States']

pomt-13705	On whether the federal government should set a minimum wage	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-gets-full-flop-stance-minimum-wage/	During a press conference in Florida while Democrats were preparing for the third night of their national convention in Philadelphia, Donald Trump was asked a question about his stance on whether to raise the minimum wage. Here’s what he said: "The minimum wage has to go up. People are -- at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states -- federal -- I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage -- but it has to go up.. .. So I would like to raise it to at least $10." A journalist then followed up, "You said we need to raise it to $10. … Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?" Trump confirmed, "Federal." Some saw the Florida remarks as a change to Trump’s previous position on whether there should be a federal minimum wage floor for the entire country. Were they? Before we go any further, let’s recap how the minimum wage works in the United States. There is a federal minimum wage -- currently $7.25 -- that serves as a floor beneath which no state’s minimum wage can fall. Any states, however, can set their minimum wage level higher than $7.25. (There are exceptions to the $7.25 minimum wage level for some workers, such as those who survive heavily on tips.) The clearest counterpoint to Trump’s Florida comments came from an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press on May 8. We cited this exchange in our July 8 fact check, in which we gave a True rating to an assertion by Hillary Clinton that Trump "wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage." In the fact-check, we noted that Trump told NBC’s Chuck Todd that he preferred that states -- not the federal government -- act on their own to raise the minimum wage. "I would like to see an increase of some magnitude," Trump told Todd. "But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other." When Todd asked specifically, "Should the federal government set a floor" for the minimum wage?" Trump replied, "No. I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do." Now, fast-forward nearly three months to Trump’s Florida news conference. His comments at the news conference seemed to embrace a national rise in the minimum wage -- specifically, he said, "The minimum wage has to go up. ... at least $10, but it has to go up." And he clarified that that meant, "federal." That’s a clearer commitment to hiking the minimum wage for every American than Trump had made in his comments to Todd. At the same time, though, Trump also said, "I think that states should really call the shot." This essentially kept Trump’s focus on the states acting on their own. Trump’s apparent advocacy for a national $10 minimum wage in his Florida comments does go further than some of his other prior statements on the issue. • In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, "Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country." • During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are "too high" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, "I would not do it." • On ABC’s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, "Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?" Trump responded, "Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more." When Stephanopoulos asked whether that’s a change, Trump answered, "Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility." A final note: Trump’s most recent comments on the issue were a brief exchange in a longer press conference. It’s possible he may adjust his views again in the future. Trump’s press office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling On the question of whether the federal government should set a minimum wage, Trump seems to have made a shift between his Meet the Press comments and his Florida news conference. In the Meet the Press interview, Trump explicitly said he doesn’t want the federal government raising, or even setting, the minimum wage floor. By contrast, in the Florida news conference, he said the "federal" minimum wage "has to go up." Trump emphasized in both instances that he prefers the states to raise their minimum wages on their own, so it’s fair to say that Trump is sending conflicting messages. Still, his contrast on the question of a federal minimum wage hike is pretty stark.

pomt-03253	Says there are half as many students in one Georgia technical college than there were two years ago.	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/12/dubose-porter/hope-changes-hurt-enrollment-porter-says/	The four people vying to become the next chairman of Georgia’s Democratic Party spent most of their time at a recent forum discussing ways to help get candidates elected, but one of them said something about education that made us quite curious. "Look at our technical schools now. We had the best in the world. And (Republicans) ruined that by what they did with the HOPE Grant to try to fix it a little bit the last time. There are half as many students in the Heart of Georgia in technical colleges than there were two years ago," said DuBose Porter, a former state representative who ran for governor in 2010. PolitiFact Georgia was a little confused. Porter, the chief executive officer of The Courier-Herald newspaper in Dublin, explained. In July 2011, two Middle Georgia colleges, Sandersville Technical College and Heart of Georgia Technical College, merged to create Oconee Fall Line Technical College. The Heart of Georgia is located in Dublin and is now called Oconee’s South campus. Sandersville is called Oconee’s North campus. Porter told us that he was referring to the drop in enrollment at the new college after the changes to the HOPE program. With that clarity, we wanted to find out whether Porter was correct about the drop in enrollment. In 2011, state lawmakers raised the academic requirements for the Georgia Lottery-funded HOPE Grant program, which helps students attend state colleges. Students needed to have a 3.0 grade-point average instead of the previous requirement of a 2.0. The change was made in response to concerns that the HOPE Grant and Scholarship programs were in financial peril. In response to blistering criticism that enrollment at technical colleges declined greatly after the change, the Georgia Legislature passed bills earlier this year to go back to the 2.0 grade-point average requirement. Nearly 9,000 students lost the grant in 2012 because they couldn't meet the higher standard, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Porter sent us a September 2011 article reported by his newspaper that Oconee’s enrollment had fallen by 1,000 students, from about 2,800 students to about 1,800 students. That’s a decrease of about 36 percent. The Technical College System of Georgia sent us figures for the enrollment drop after the merger. They show a 37 percent decrease for the two campuses after the HOPE Grant requirement was changed. It’s a 41 percent decrease if you calculate the changes before the HOPE change and two years afterward. Here’s their breakdown: Year Students 2008-2009 4,231 2009-2010 4,749 2010-2011 4,472 2011-2012 2,806 2012-2013 2,824 The state broke down the numbers for each campus before and after the merger. The state’s data for the Dublin campus were similar to the information Porter sent us. Regardless, neither set of numbers shows a 50 percent decrease. The state’s data suggest the HOPE changes may have had an impact on enrollment. In fiscal year 2011, nearly 82 percent of Oconee students had received a HOPE grant. In fiscal year 2012, it was 71 percent. Preliminary figures for fiscal year 2013 show 61 percent of Oconee students received a HOPE grant. "They lost a lot of students who could no longer go to college," said Mike Light, a spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia. To sum up, Porter said at a forum that enrollment at the Oconee Fall Line Technical College had dropped in half. The enrollment declines were severe, but not a 50 percent drop. The data show a decline in the percentage of Oconee students who received a HOPE Grant, which seems to support Porter’s argument. Porter’s overall point has merit, but his claim was somewhat overstated. Our rating: Mostly True.	None	DuBose Porter	None	None	None	2013-08-12T00:00:00	2013-08-12	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']

pomt-09570	"The amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10. The federal debt is now over $100,000 per household."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/bob-mcdonnell/national-debt-pace-triple-10-years-now-more-100k-h/	Recently elected Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell took up the flag for Republicans in response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010. That meant talking about spending, deficits and debt. "In the past year, more than 3 million people have lost their jobs, and yet the Democratic Congress continues deficit spending, adding to the bureaucracy, and increasing the national debt on our children and our grandchildren," McDonnell said in a speech from the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates. "The amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10. The federal debt is now over $100,000 per household. This is simply unsustainable." We wanted to check two things: Whether the debt is growing as fast as McDonnell says, and whether it now constitutes $100,000 per household. First things first -- a quick but critical lesson on the federal debt. The debt clock you're use to seeing, the one that's ticking past $12.3 trillion these days, actually is the summation of two types of debt. The first part is the money the government borrowed to pay for things -- wars, roads, whatever. The second is debt held by government trust funds and government accounts that are internal transactions (government passing money from one fund to another). In these cases, there is no effect on the credit markets. (Read the Treasury Department's Q&A on debt here.) The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, says the first form of debt is a more meaningful measure. It's the combination of both types of debt, however, that gets most noticed, surely because it's bigger but also because it's what the debt ceiling is based on. McDonnell's claim that the debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10 is not a new talking point for Republicans. Judd Gregg (the Republican senator from New Hampshire who was almost Obama's commerce secretary) said the same thing about Obama's proposed 2010 budget last March. To check Gregg, we relied on a Congressional Budget Office analysis from March 20, 2009. The CBO projected that the debt held by the public (the first part of the total debt) would rise from $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2008 -- which is Sept. 30, 2008 -- to $11.8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2013; and to $17.3 trillion in 2019 under Obama's proposed FY 2010 budget. By that count, Gregg's claim of doubling the debt in five years, tripling it in 10 years, is correct. But in Gregg's case we found it a little unfair to tie some of the debt to Obama and not President George W. Bush. We rated Gregg's claim Mostly True. Now on to McDonnell. Just hours ahead of McDonnell's response, the CBO released updated baseline debt projections that shrink the amount of debt predicted over the next 10 years. The CBO put the debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2008 at $5.8 trillion, $7.5 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2009, and estimates the debt will increase to $11.6 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2014 and to $14.3 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2019. Again, this is just the first part of the debt calculation. That's a decrease from the projections the CBO put out in response to Obama's 2010 budget. In checking this claim, like when considering Gregg's claim, the truth depends on where you start counting the debt. If you set your baseline as Sept. 30, 2008, the national debt is on pace to nearly triple by Sept. 30, 2019, as McDonnell suggests. If you recalculate for Sept. 30, 2009, the national debt doubles, not triples in 10 years. Now, for argument's sake, we wanted to run the same calculation for the entire gross federal debt. (You will see why this matters in a second.) According to the CBO, the gross federal debt ended 2009 at $11.9 trillion, will hit $16.7 trillion by the end of 2014 and $20.6 trillion by the end of 2019. That's short of McDonnell's marks as well. The percentages don't improve much even if you roll back to 2008 -- we're talking again about doubling the debt after 10 years, not tripling. So unlike comparing the debt held by the public, McDonnell's numbers are off whether you start counting Sept. 30, 2008, or Sept. 30, 2009. White House debt projections from August 2009 are a slightly worse, but not enough to make a change when considering McDonnell's claim. As we try to digest all of that, let's turn to the second part of McDonnell's claim: "The federal debt is already over $100,000 per household." The Census Bureau estimated in 2007 that there were nearly 116 million U.S. households. The current debt held by the public -- the money the government has borrowed -- is $7.8 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The current gross debt is $12.3 trillion. Presto, chango, carry the one, move the decimal point ... and you get two different debt per household figures. The household share of the debt owed by the public is about $67,000. The household share of the gross federal debt is slightly more than $106,000. McDonnell's press secretary, Stacey Johnson, did not return two phone calls or an e-mail asking for clarification on what debt figures the governor was using to make his calculations. Why does it matter? If he's using the gross debt figure -- the big one -- McDonnell is right about the per household number and wrong about the doubling and tripling. If he's using the smaller debt held by the public number, he has a case to make about growth of the debt, but is wrong when it comes to the per household share. Or he's mixing one form of debt to make one point, and another to make a second. In his State of the Union response, McDonnell tried using both the macro and the micro to drive home a point that spending led by the Democrats in the White House and Congress is out of control. His claim that national debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10 isn't wildly off, but it ignores the fact that some of the responsibility falls on Bush's shoulders. On his second claim, that the per household share of the national debt is more than $100,000, that's true if you measure the gross federal debt and false if you only count the money the government actually borrowed from somebody else. On the whole, we rate McDonnell's statement Half True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2010-01-28T12:04:46	2010-01-27	['None']
pomt-06203	Says IBM leader told Obama that using IBM technology to cut fraud could "pay for" health care reform.	/texas/statements/2011/dec/09/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-ibm-made-obama-offer/	During a discussion of health care costs at a Nov. 5, 2011, two-person GOP presidential debate outside Houston, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich made a dramatic claim about a White House visit. Gingrich, who was debating then-candidate Herman Cain, said: "The CEO of IBM went to the White House and said to (President) Barack Obama, you can pay for virtually all of Obamacare by simply taking existing IBM technology and applying it to stop paying crooks." By "Obamacare," a term that some view as polarizing shorthand, Gingrich meant the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Democrat-led 2010 overhaul of health care laws. Obama affixed a price tag of $900 billion to the plan when he rolled out his version in September 2009. Subsequent cost estimates varied. So, Gingrich is suggesting a lot of fraud. But was he right that IBM presented the president with such a scheme? By way of background, we note that Gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut health-care costs. Until recently he led a for-profit consultancy called the Center for Health Transformations, which counted IBM among its clients. We asked Gingrich’s campaign for the former House speaker’s basis in making the statement. Spokesman Joe DeSantis told us: "All I can say is that he heard it from someone he trusts. Sorry." But DeSantis directed us to video of a Sept. 14, 2010, Wall Street Journal interview of Sam Palmisano, IBM’s then-CEO and chairman. Separately, IBM spokesman Ed Barbini also referred us to the Journal interview. He declined further comment. The video opens with the Journal’s Alan Murray saying: "When President Obama was elected, you started spending a fair amount of time at the White House." Palmisano: "Yes, I did." Murray: "What was that all about?" "Well," Palmisano replied, "part of it was the administration was reaching out to the business community. I mean, I was one of many, obviously ... around economic (issues)... So we were having lots of input, lots of exchange. That’s what we all were working on at the time." Asked how he thought the White House visits had turned out, Palmisano replied: "We haven’t made any progress. It doesn’t mean there hasn’t been a lot of interaction." Murray: "Well, what’s the point of interaction if it doesn’t lead to progress?" Palmisano: "You’d have to ask the people who aren’t progressing." He added, "We’ve done tons of work, and for whatever sets of reasons, we haven’t been able to establish, be in sync with, the priorities." Palmisano offered an example: "We -- and I’m fairly confident about this one because it required no legislative change -- we could have improved quality and reduced the costs of the health-care system by $900 billion... It was self-funding. You could have insured anybody you wanted to, illegal aliens, dogs, cats, ponies, whatever, right? And the stuff was simple. Did not require any big legislative change." About $400 billion of the reduced costs could be realized through negotiating discounts with drug companies, just as IBM negotiates its own discounts, he said. "Buy a nationwide discount," he said. "Just like pharmaceutical companies sell to us on a nationwide discount. It’s no different. I said, ‘Take the IBM discount! Take the IBM discount.’ " Another example of savings: "Two hundred billion in fraud. That was a 3 percent improvement, by the way. This wasn’t transformational. ... There’s so much fraud in the system -- 3 percent and then Year 7 was 8 percent, Year 5 was 5 percent. It’s 200 billion." Murray: "And why didn’t they do that? Is there a fraud --" Palmisano: "I said we would do it for free to prove that it works. They turned us down. You’ll have to ask them… Free. Free wasn’t good enough." Murray asks again: Why? Palmisano replies, "I think what it is, not to be judgmental about these things, I really do think what it is is that we weren't aligning with the priorities. ... the priority at the time, if I stay on my example of health care, was not to reduce costs and improve quality. It was to provide insurance and coverage for more people. That was our priority in the line. All we said, if you did this you could fund the priority without increasing the deficit, taking taxes up. And we couldn't sell the case." Let’s take a breath here. In the Journal interview, Palmisano insisted he gave the White House an offer to cover the $900 billion estimated cost of the health care plan -- with $200 billion coming from reduced fraud. We were unable to find independent confirmation of such an offer -- and our search of news archives indicates the CEO’s comments to the Journal touched off only one follow-up news account. Nearly a month after the interview, on the Oct. 8, 2010, episode of a Fox News program, guest host Stuart Varney said that an IBM spokesman stood by Palmisano’s claims. That program aired shortly after a more widely publicized event: On Oct. 6, 2010, Palmisano led a group of high-tech CEOs to the White House to present Obama with a proposal they said could save the government $1 trillion by 2020. Among the plan’s seven initiatives: saving $500 billion by streamlining supply chains and pushing suppliers to reduce costs; and saving $200 billion by using technology to better detect "improper payments" -- payments that prove to be unnecessary or fraudulent. The proposal cites an Office of Management and Budget estimate that Medicare accounted for $54 billion of the government’s $98 billion in improper payments in 2009. By email, White House spokesman Brandon Lepow did not provide information confirming or denying Palmisano’s claims to the Journal about presenting savings ideas. Lepow initially said companies including IBM had offered the administration help fighting fraud. He later told us he had learned his first statement was inaccurate. His follow-up statement said the administration and IBM had worked on "possible projects" but agreed not to "move forward," although IBM is a partner in "our work to fight fraud." Our ruling Gingrich did not reveal the source of his claim or provide backup beyond the Journal interview. Meantime, the White House did not confirm or deny Palmisano’s claims. Contrary to Gingrich’s debate claim, though, the then-CEO said $200 billion in funding would come from cutting fraud -- not nearly enough to pay for the health-care overhaul. We rate Gingrich’s statement Half True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-09T06:00:00	2011-11-05	['Barack_Obama', 'IBM']
pomt-11038	Says Ron DeSantis "voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants."	/florida/statements/2018/jun/29/adam-putnam/putnam-parrots-previous-absurd-claim-food-stamps-i/	The top two Republicans running for governor in Florida, Adam Putnam and Ron DeSantis, tried to paint a picture that the other was weak on immigration issues during a nationally televised debate on Fox News June 28, 2018. Moderator Bret Baier of Fox News asked Putnam, the state’s agriculture commissioner, to respond to a DeSantis’ attack ad calling him "Amnesty Adam." Putnam shot back, "That’s rich for somebody who voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants." Off-screen, DeSantis, a Florida congressman who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, responded, "That’s not true, you know that, come on." So, is that true? No, it’s not. The bill in question is a 2014 agricultural bill, H.R. 2642. Farm bills are passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food assistance benefits, known as SNAP for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The bill mentioned illegal immigrants briefly, in Section 4015, to mandate that states would be "required to use an immigration status verification system" when distributing food assistance benefits. DeSantis voted against the bill, which passed 251-166. He also voted against a predecessor of the bill which failed to pass through the House, but had a similar provision against immigrants in the country illegally obtaining food assistance benefits. Putnam and his supporters frequently cite these votes as evidence that DeSantis was in favor of extending SNAP to people in the country illegally. The thinking goes that by voting against the farm bill in total, DeSantis voted against a provision that sought to verify that food assistance benefits only went to U.S. citizens. As a result, Putnam and his supporters claim, DeSantis supported distributing food assistance benefits without a citizenship test. And therefore, he supported distributing food assistance benefits to people in the country illegally. In April, seven radio stations have pulled a radio ad from the National Liberty Federation making the same claim as Putnam made during the Fox News debate, according to the DeSantis campaign. Even if H.R. 2642 had been voted down, SNAP regulations already in place prohibited people living in the United States illegally from receiving benefits. Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, told PolitiFact in March 2018, "Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens." After the vote in 2014, DeSantis wrote a Facebook post clarifying his reasoning: he voted against the bill because of the high cost and low return. The bill, he wrote, is a "bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms." Specifically, he was concerned that the bill did not do enough to cut back the rising cost of food stamp program—a far cry from wanting to expand it to include illegal immigrants. When asked about the claim, Putnam campaign spokesperson Meredith Beatrice directed us toward DeSantis’s voting record on the 2014 bill and its predecessor, as well as a link to this similarly misleading Central Florida Post article. Our ruling Putnam claimed DeSantis "voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants." DeSantis actually voted against the bill, and explained later it had nothing to do with provisions related to immigration. Putnam has cast the vote against the farm bill as somehow allowing people living in the country illegally to receive food assistance benefits. But the practice was prohibited before the 2014 vote, and it remained prohibited after the 2014 vote. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-08210	On his "half pay" pledge.	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/19/jeff-scrima/looking-waukesha-mayor-jeff-scrima-and-his-half-pa/	When 32-year-old political novice Jeff Scrima joined the April 2010 race for Waukesha mayor, he felt the city leaders were "out of touch," pointing to the decision to give raises to the mayor during the worst recession in 70 years. So, this tag line went on his campaign literature: "Will serve as full-time mayor on half pay." Promising to hold the line on taxes, Scrima’s lean government message carried him into office in Waukesha, Wisconsin’s ninth largest city and a suburb of Milwaukee. "Being an elected official should not be about the money," Scrima said in an interview. He added the "will work for half pay" slogan drew attention and seemed catchy. Since taking office, the simple pledge has gotten a whole lot more complicated, from a new charitable fund to complaints from aldermen that his approach isn’t helping taxpayers at all. In the latest twist, Scrima told aldermen he’d give half of his future pay back to the city -- if they all returned to the city an equal share of their pay. Boy, the Flip-O-Meter was built for situations like this. Its purpose is to sort out if elected officials have changed their positions -- whether the switch is good or bad or in between is up to the voters. Let’s start at the beginning: The pledge During the campaign, Scrima routinely repeated the "work for half" pledge in literature, interviews and debates. It was an echo of sorts to the pledges made by Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker and other elected officials to return some of their pay to taxpayers. The salary for the mayor of Waukesha is $70,100 a year and in April will increase to $73,100. Scrima did not specify how he would handle the half of the salary that he would decline. But voters were clearly left with the impression that his pledge would reduce the cost to taxpayers. Most politicians simply return their unwanted pay to the municipal coffers. Under state law, Scrima had 30 days after the election to tell the city if he didn’t want to accept full pay. "The mayor did not do that," said Donna Whalen, human resources manager and assistant city attorney. Such givebacks may make only a small difference in the bottom line -- Waukesha’s general operations budget for 2011 is about $58 million, with $51.4 million to come from property taxes. But they can be popular with voters. "Most people never look at the benefits of how you give money back," said Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel for the state Government Accountability Board, adding: "For most people it’s a gesture." In any case, Scrima did not take the most direct route to accomplish his goal. The alternative path On June 16, 2010, Scrima announced the creation of the "New Day in Waukesha Fund" and said half of his net pay (after taxes and health and dental insurance deductions) would be directly deposited to the fund with each pay day. He launched the fund with a check for $2,787.34 - the amount that equaled half of his net pay for his first weeks in office. At the time, he said state law prohibited him from taking a half-sized paycheck. But that was only true because he missed the 30-day deadline to self-change the pay scale. He could have written a check to the city with each paycheck, but did not. The nonprofit fund, which echoes his campaign theme, is administered by a five-member board -- Scrima and four others he selected. The fund’s stated purpose is to "provide vitality" to the city through creation of gateways, memorials, beautification and arts, and collaborative efforts that benefit young people. So far, no grants have been awarded. Contributions to the fund are tax deductible. Scrima said he hoped the community fund would "leverage" other contributions once projects were identified. And at the time of the announcement he declared he had secured "additional commitments already totaling $26,700 from the community." But so far, Scrima’s checks are the only ones that have gone into the fund, said David Schultz, president of the Waukesha County Community Foundation Inc. which handles the money at the direction of the "New Day" board. So, let’s update the scorecard: Taxpayers are still paying Scrima’s full salary. Instead of returning the money directly to city coffers, the giveback is being put -- after taxes -- into a fund that gives Scrima more control over how it is spent. During a recent meeting about the city budget, Ald. Chris Hernandez needled the mayor, saying it would help the tax levy if Scrima gave the money back to the city rather than his fund. The alternate alternative path On Nov. 10, 2010, Scrima changed course. He offered in a budget amendment to give half of his future pay back to the city as a way of preventing a tax levy increase. The catch: He would only do so if all 15 aldermen also agreed to pay cuts and return the money to the city. That idea was dead on arrival, but it gives even more life to our analysis. If anything, the mayor’s proposed amendment underlines that the money is not going to the city now. "I believe I’m living up to my campaign promise," Scrima told PolitiFact Wisconsin, arguing the city could enjoy greater benefits from his approach -- especially once others contribute to the fund. "This is what I signed up for and I don’t regret it." The Flip-O-Meter came to a different conclusion. The new mayor said he’d work for half pay. But under his approach, he’s taking the full salary and then putting money in a charitable fund, which carries tax advantages and control advantages. He has more say over how it is spent than if it went back to the city to hold down taxes. Creating the fund may be noble -- and clever, after all it is named after his campaign slogan. But it is not what voters could have expected based on his slogan. Scrima’s latest effort, to leverage aldermen into his pledge, underlines the half-pay is doing nothing to help the city’s bottom line. All Scrima’s bouncing on the half-pay pledge earns him a Half-Flip.	None	Jeff Scrima	None	None	None	2010-11-19T09:00:00	2010-11-10	['None']

pomt-02639	"For the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/17/barack-obama/obama-says-us-produces-more-oil-it-imports-first-t/	President Barack Obama this week touted the progress his administration has made in recovering from the economic recession, focusing on developments in engineering and manufacturing. "Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, the good news is the economy is growing stronger," he said in a speech on Jan. 15, 2014, at North Carolina State University. "Our businesses have now created more than 8 million new jobs since we hit bottom. Because of an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world." PolitiFact wanted to know if Obama’s claim gives us an accurate picture of U.S. oil numbers. A spokesman offered up this White House blog post that touches on Obama’s point in more detail. Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report, the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obama’s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. "Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,"Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It’s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there’s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn’t need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we can’t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, it’s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration’s fuel efficiency standards. Our ruling Obama said the United States is producing more oil domestically than it’s importing from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obama’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-03504	Says Americans "invented ‘Pong,’ ‘Space Invaders’ and the iPhone."	/texas/statements/2013/jun/06/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-americans-invented-pong-space-invade/	The junior Republican senator from Texas celebrated American ingenuity in a spring commencement address. On May 11, 2013, Ted Cruz told the Hillsdale College (Mich.) Class of 2013 that the American dollar is the world’s international reserve currency and English is the planet’s language of commerce. Also, Cruz said, most movies are made in the U.S., where the telephone, automobile and airplane also were invented. "Americans were the first to walk on the moon," Cruz continued. "We invented ‘Pong,’ ‘Space Invaders’ and the iPhone." Wait; Americans invented the iPhone plus "Pong" and "Space Invaders," the dominant (trust us, dominant) 1970s-era arcade games? Let's recap iPhone-age, then check on those games. Apple rolled out the iPhone in 2007 with its invention credited to Steve Jobs, though it also was clear that the spinoff from the popular iPod MP3 player built on multiple creations. Journalist Mary Bellis has written that more than 200 patents were part of the design of the iPhone, "so pinpointing one inventor would be unfair." Still, her undated online post credits Apple employee John Casey with conceiving an iPhone-type device in 2000 by emailing colleagues about combining a phone and iPod. Jobs directed the teams that hatched the iPhone, she wrote, while Apple's British-born head of design, Jonathan Ive, is "heavily credited with the aesthetic design and look of the iPhone." In an Oct. 22, 2010, news article, PC Magazine said Jobs and his team "clearly reinvented the smartphone with the iPhone, which then gave him a platform for creating mobile apps and new forms of mobile commerce." Similarly, the California-based Computer History Museum notes in its Jobs’ biography, which appeared Dec. 2, 2011 (about two months after Jobs’ death), that when Jobs unveiled the iPhone, he "described it as nothing less than the reinvention of the telephone: a combination ‘widescreen iPod with touch controls,’ a ‘revolutionary mobile phone,’ and a ‘breakthrough Internet communicator.’" Most recently, Slate magazine, citing newly revealed documents, said in a Sept. 10, 2012, news article that Apple "reinvented" the smartphone with the iPhone, which was honed by Apple employees only; the story quotes a company executive testifying that Jobs "didn’t let the iPhone team recruit anyone from outside the company to work on the device." And the arcade games? "Pong" was mass-produced by an American company, Atari, according to web posts and news stories, and individuals credited with developing the game appear to have American roots. The Associated Press summed up "Pong" this way in an April 19, 2013, news article: "The black-and-white arcade game introduced in 1972 had no complicated graphics, just geometric shapes. Players controlled digital paddles and tried to hit the ball so their opponents could not return it." Accounts agree that Nolan Bushnell, a 1968 electrical engineering graduate of the University of Utah, steered the game’s creation after founding Atari with another engineer, Ted Dabney, in 1972. Bushnell had seen a Magnavox Odyssey version of ping-pong that spring and sought an easier-to-play version, enlisting Atari engineer Al Alcorn to perfect it. Bushnell, who grew up in Utah, and Alcorn, born in San Francisco, according to news stories, both appear to be Americans. Next, we looked into who invented "Space Invaders," in which a player fires at space aliens steadily advancing from the top of the game screen; try it here, though keep in mind we’re not responsible for associated time sucks. Accounts credit a resident of Japan, not an American, with inventing the game. An Aug. 20, 2003, feature story in the Derby Evening Telegraph, a British newspaper, said a Japanese computer programmer "wrote the game for Taito in Japan in 1978." The story said the game heralded the introduction of arcade machines in restaurants and other places before Atari bought the rights to the game in 1980 and "launched it on hundreds of thousands of black boxes plugged into TVs across the Western world." The Tokyo-based Taito Corp., which says in a company timeline that it released the game in 1978, told us by email that Tomohiro Nishikado was the inventor. In a 2008 interview from his Yokohama home, Nishikado told an Australian newspaper that Taito sales people initially resisted the game, saying it was too hard to play. Nishikado also recalled concern that people would not play a game where the enemy shot back at them. "It was never seen before," Nishikado said. Nishikado told the West Australian newspaper he was inspired to create the game by a magazine story previewing the Star Wars movie. "Instantly I felt that something that takes place in outer space would be popular," Nishikado said. We alerted Cruz’s office to the Japanese engineer widely described as the Father of "Space Invaders." Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton replied by referring to the senator’s childhood, saying by email: "Perhaps he was mistaken about ‘Space Invaders’ origins, but to an eight-year-old playing the game it certainly seemed American." Our ruling Cruz said "Pong," "Space Invaders" and the iPhone were invented by Americans. This appears so for "Pong" and the iPhone. But a Japanese programmer is credited with developing "Space Invaders." We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True. UPDATE, 3 p.m. June 6, 2013: This story was updated shortly after its publication to provide more information on the iPhone's development. The paragraphs drawing on Mary Bellis and an article in Slate were added. These changes did not affect the rating.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2013-06-06T13:00:00	2013-05-11	['None']

pomt-06519	Say the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in the U.S. is 475 to 1.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/10/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-post-ceo-worker-pay-ratio-has-obscu/	If you've got liberal friends and logged into Facebook lately, chances are pretty good that you've seen this chart. As people express their support with the Occupy Wall Street protests, they are citing this chart and similar statistics to show income inequality in the United States. The chart -- here’s another version posted on the liberal website Daily Kos -- lists the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in the U.S. and nine other countries. The smallest ratio is Japan’s at 11 to 1. The United States is highest at 475 to 1. We've gotten many reader requests to check the numbers, in part because the chart lacks any sourcing or additional explanatory information. But despite the lack of backup information, the chart has gone viral. It's not only been posted and re-posted many times on Facebook, it's also appeared in countless blogs and been tweeted and re-tweeted on Twitter. The chart is the latest reminder that factual claims can spread at lightning speed on the Internet -- even when the facts to back them up are scarce. Before we check the accuracy of the numbers, it's worth exploring where the chart began and how it went viral. It's been repeatedly cited in blogs and reports, including one paper presented at a conference of a United Nations affiliate. The paper, written by Thomas Prosser of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, included the same chart that’s now circulating, which it sourced to a 2005 paper by an M. Kroll titled, "CEO Pay Rates: U.S. vs Foreign Nations." We located a scanned version of the paper on the Internet, and it did appear to be written by Prof. Mark Kroll. His institution wasn’t listed, but after some additional searching, we found that Kroll had been teaching at the Louisiana Tech College of Business in 2005 and that he is now the business dean at the University of Texas at Brownsville. But it turns out he didn’t write the paper after all. "Actually, I am the ‘recipient’ of the paper you refer to," Kroll told us in an e-mail. "The paper was done as a class project by three of my students in a graduate class back in 2005. The 475-to-1 ratio that you reference is listed in a table in the paper the students wrote. They do not give a specific citation for the data in the table." The paper’s cover sheet fooled us -- as it fooled others -- because the professor’s name appears in the middle of the page, and the three students’ names appear together at the bottom in a less prominent spot. We tried to reach the co-authors -- Adam Choate, Dana Rowzee and Jerrod Tinsley, all of whom were working on their Master of Business Administration in 2005 -- but we did not hear back. So how about the substance of the chart? From previous fact-checks, we knew that American CEOs are generously paid, and we had confirmed that for ordinary Americans, incomes are stagnating. But on the specific comparison of CEO pay and average-worker pay, we found two liberal groups -- the Economic Policy Institute and the Institute for Policy Studies -- that have produced long-running studies of this question. The most recent chart from the Economic Policy Institute shows a ratio of 185 to 1 for 2009. According to the group’s calculations, the peak since the mid 1960s was almost 299 to 1. But it was never as high as high as 475 to 1. Meanwhile, the most recent ratio from the Institute for Policy Studies is also smaller -- for 2010, it was 325 to 1. In previous years the ratio on two occasions has exceeded 475 to 1 -- to be specific, 516 to 1 in 1999 and 525 to 1 in 2000. The Institute for Policy Studies’ ratios are higher than the Economic Policy Institute’s due to methodological differences. Sarah Anderson, who has co-authored the Institute for Policy Studies reports, said the figures can vary depending on several factors, including which CEOs are sampled and what types of compensation for both the CEO and the worker are used in the calculation. Still, both of the years where the CEO pay ratio in the IPS study was at least 475 to 1 came more than a decade ago, so data from those years would be of questionable use to policy debates today. In addition, neither of the two groups that compiled these figures made comparisons of CEO-to-worker pay across different countries, as the chart circulating on Facebook does. So what we’re left with is an unsourced, undated chart with numbers that, at best, were only correct (approximately) in 1999 and 2000 according to one measure, and wrong according to a different measure. Anderson of the Institute for Policy Studies said that for a paper written in 2005, a 475 to 1 ratio was not "crazy high," since the figure for 2004 in her group’s study was 431 to 1. Kroll, the professor who graded the paper, added that "it would not surprise me if (the students’) number was ‘in the ball park.'" Still, that argument doesn’t help today’s social-media posters. The data they’re circulating is at best six years old, and the ratios have fallen since then. Our ruling This is a textbook example of how claims can spiral out of control on the Internet. Just as conservatives have circulated unfounded claims about President Barack Obama's birth certificate, liberals are spreading this questionable chart. We don’t doubt the chart’s underlying point that the ratio of CEO pay to worker pay is high in the United States, and is likely higher in our free-wheeling economy than it is in the historically more egalitarian nations of Europe. But in its claim that the U.S. ratio is 475 to 1, the chart conveys a sense of certitude and statistical precision that simply isn't warranted -- and which is contradicted by the facts. The latest number for the U.S. is 185 to 1 in one study and 325 to 1 in another -- and those numbers were not generated by groups that might have an ideological interest in downplaying the gaps between rich and poor. We rate the claim on the U.S. ratio False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2011-10-10T16:14:19	2011-10-10	['United_States']

pomt-04217	Says that in the 1985 election former Gov. Tom Kean had "the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/29/raymond-bateman/raymond-bateman-says-tom-kean-won-1985-gubernatori/	If Newark Mayor Cory Booker declines to run for the state’s highest office, a former state legislator predicts a decisive -- possibly even historic -- re-election victory for Gov. Chris Christie Raymond Bateman, a former Republican state senator and assemblyman who lost a bid for governor in 1977, said in a recent column that Booker seems like the only Democrat capable of foiling Christie’s prospects for a second term. "Unless Booker gets into the race, 2013 reminds me of 1985. That was the year Tom Kean made history with the largest-ever New Jersey gubernatorial victory," Bateman wrote in a Nov. 23 column published in The Asbury Park Press. "Kean, who barely won (by 1,797 votes) in 1981, destroyed his 1985 opponent, Peter Shapiro, winning by a majority of more than 750,000 votes, the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history." "In any case," Bateman wrote later in his column, "2013 should see a political barn-burning election in New Jersey that I believe will produce a Kean-like victory for Christie if, in fact, he runs." This week Christie announced he will seek a second term. Potential Democratic rivals -- including Booker -- have not formally declared their intentions. The outcome of any matchup wouldn’t be determined until next year, but until then PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether Bateman’s comparison was rooted in fact. Did Kean, a Republican, rebound from a close election to a historically decisive re-election bid? The data -- whether it’s broken down by total votes or percentages -- shows that’s true. More than 1.37 million New Jerseyans cast their vote for Kean that year, while Shapiro, the Democratic candidate and a former Essex County executive, won about 578,000 votes. So Kean won by more than 790,000 votes, according to election data published in the state’s legislative manual. No other governor in New Jersey’s history has won election by a larger margin. In all, Kean won more than 69 percent of the vote, carrying every one of New Jersey’s 21 counties and all but three municipalities. It’s worth noting that Kean’s sweeping victory came four years after he narrowly won office. In 1981 Kean defeated Democrat Jim Florio by fewer than 1,800 votes, which represented less than one twelfth of one percent of the total vote. No other gubernatorial race was closer as a percentage of the total vote, though in 1880 the Democratic candidate won by only 651 votes. That accounted for about one-quarter of one percent of the total vote. Our ruling Bateman said that in the 1985 general election Kean had "the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history." Kean trounced his opponent that year. The former Republican governor won more than 1.37 million votes, compared with the roughly 578,000 ballots cast for his Democratic rival. That means Kean won by more than 790,000 votes. That’s the largest margin of victory for a gubernatorial election in New Jersey’s history. We rate this statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05618	Says when he was governor, Wisconsin cut unemployment to 2.1 percent and the state’s unemployment rate was "the lowest in the country for 40 consecutive months."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/26/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-wisconsins-unemployment-rate-w/	Former Gov. Tommy Thompson loves talking about about the good old days of Wisconsin’s economy as he runs in the GOP primary for an open U.S. Senate seat. Amid continuing high unemployment in the Badger State and across the nation, Thompson often redirects voters to the mid- to late-1990s. "We created 740,000 jobs – can you imagine that? – a record for the state!" Thompson proclaimed in a March 3, 2012 speech at a party caucus meeting in Sauk County. "The state was in bad shape, and we turned it completely around. Our unemployment dropped down to 2.1 percent … (and was) the lowest in the country for 40 consecutive months. The lowest in the country!" In his familiar cheerleading style, he added: "Then, we were so good, people were so excited, we went to the Rose Bowl and we won three times!" Wisconsin’ economic success in Thompson’s time -- as well as gridiron glory in Pasadena -- is well-established. The Badgers won all three Rose Bowl trips during Thompson’s era, and not once during his governor’s tenure (1987 to 2001) did unemployment rise to the February 2012 mark of 6.9 percent. But did the state really lead the nation in shrinking unemployment -- and for more than three years? We turned to the official scorekeeper of labor market performance, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The numbers showed some things for Thompson to crow about. But on the specific claim, it is more along the lines of eating crow. When Thompson won the job, the small-town lawyer and legislator inherited a tough -- but dramatically improving -- unemployment picture. Four years before his election, unemployment peaked at 11.5 percent in January 1983, but it had fallen to 6.6 percent as he took office. Under Thompson, the rate dropped for three more years, jumped around for a couple, then dropped slowly for seven years before heading back up in his last full year, 2000. This trend line mirrored the national one. The Wisconsin unemployment rate was 3.9 percent as Thompson left in February 2001 for a cabinet post in President George W. Bush’s administration -- an improvement over that 6.6 mark in his first month as chief executive. (Historical footnote: it would climb to 5.3 percent within 10 months after he departed.) In his Sauk County speech, Thompson said unemployment dropped all the way down to 2.1 percent. But the most commonly used official figures show Wisconsin’s low was 3.0 percent, achieved in six different months during that time. That’s according to seasonally adjusted figures, which BLS officials told us are preferred for month-to-month comparisons. In addition, Wisconsin governors have long relied on and emphasized the seasonally adjusted figures when announcing unemployment figures. In short, they are treated as the official numbers. Even Thompson, as he left office, used the seasonal numbers, saying the low point in his tenure was around 3 percent, according to media coverage at the time. When asked about the claim, Thompson’s campaign pointed to data that is not seasonally adjusted. The rate was 2.0 percent in September 1999, according to a Thompson administration press release from December of 1999. However, the federal data shows a 2.4 percent unadjusted rate for that month, likely because figures are preliminary when announced, and later get updated. So the 2.1 percent figure doesn’t hold up. Now let’s examine Thompson’s national comparison. Was Wisconsin No. 1? We couldn’t find a single month -- much less 40 straight months -- in which Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was lowest among the states. To be sure, its rate was in the very bottom tier for most of the 1990s -- bottom five or 10, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. But Nebraska and the Dakotas consistently beat Wisconsin’s numbers throughout the decade. And Minnesota, Iowa and Indiana -- other Midwestern states -- put up lower figures when Wisconsin was its best in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Indeed, this held true even when the data was not seasonally adjusted. Reacting to our findings, a campaign official said Thompson actually was referring to the city of Madison when he said "lowest in the nation." The campaign also noted the state’s unemployment rate was below the national average for well over 40 months. But Thompson cited a statewide number in his claim. And he didn’t say below the average. He said lowest. Our rating In a speech in Sauk County, Thompson contended Wisconsin’s unemployment rate dipped to 2.1 percent and was lowest in the nation for more than three years running when he sat in the governor’s chair. Federal statistics clearly refute the "lowest in the nation" claim, and the 2.1 percent is on target only if you cite preliminary numbers from a less-preferred statistical method. We rate this statement False.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-03-26T09:00:00	2012-03-03	['Wisconsin']

pomt-02156	The Cathedral of Christ the King is one of the Archdiocese of Atlanta’s largest and fastest-growing parishes.	/georgia/statements/2014/may/02/wilton-gregory/mansion-moved-sparked-church-growth/	Atlanta Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory has promised to find a new place to live since getting an earful from some Catholics -- and unwelcome national attention -- about his new 6,186-square-foot, $2.2 million residence on Habersham Road in Buckhead. In a statement he issued March 31, the archbishop said he had no desire to move to the Tudor-style mansion in the first place. "However, the Cathedral parish has a problem, albeit a happy one," he said. "The Cathedral of Christ the King is one of our largest, most vibrant and fastest-growing parishes — but it is landlocked." PolitiFact deemed the archbishop’s statement worthy of a fact check, given all the hoopla. A review of some numbers, as well as some number crunching, should settle the questions: Is it one of the largest of the 99 Catholic churches that are part of the Archdiocese of Atlanta? And is it one of the fastest-growing? We requested membership data for at least five years. But the bulk of what we received was from 2012 and 2013. And looking at that data and limited information that was provided from 1997, the answer to each question is yes. According to the Official Catholic Directory, the Cathedral of Christ the King was the second-largest church in the archdiocese in 1997, based on the number of families, or households. It had 3,505 at the time. Fast-forward to 2013, and the cathedral on Peachtree Road in Buckhead was the archdiocese’s third-largest parish, with 4,842 families. Only St. Michael’s in Gainesville and St. Thomas the Apostle in Smyrna were larger, with 7,054 and 6,844 families, respectively. The cathedral’s congregation grew 9.6 percent between summer 2012 and summer 2013, adding 426 families, according to the archdiocese’s data. By our calculations, that made it the archdiocese’s 15th-fastest-growing of all the churches that year and, among the bigger churches, the second-fastest-growing. St. Joseph’s in Dalton grew the most, 23.2 percent or 509 families, while more than 30 parishes in the archdiocese had virtually no growth or lost families in that same time, the data show. The cathedral was built in French Gothic architectural style and named "the most beautiful building in Atlanta" by Architectural Record in 1939, two years after its completion. Some would say it remains a contender today. Members of the parish come from more than 150 ZIP codes in metro Atlanta. Priests at the cathedral presided over more than 1,200 daily Masses, 624 weekend Masses, more than 500 Baptisms, 128 weddings and 49 funerals in 2013. Seven adult choirs and four children’s choirs chimed in at many of these events. The cathedral became part of the recent controversy after Joseph Mitchell, a parishioner at Christ the King and the nephew of "Gone With the Wind" author Margaret Mitchell, left $15 million and his home on tony Habersham Road to the archdiocese. Mitchell requested that the archdiocese use the inheritance for "general religious and charitable purposes." He also asked that Christ the King get primary consideration. The cathedral was given $7.5 million for its building program and spent $1.9 million of that to buy the archbishop’s longtime residence nearby on West Wesley Road. The goal was to convert the archbishop’s old home into a rectory, or residence, for the cathedral’s six priests. That would allow the rectory that’s on the cathedral’s campus to eventually be replaced with worship and meeting space. (The cathedral is effectively landlocked. It’s surrounded by streets on three sides, and it is restricted from developing on its east side for 20 years. That was part of a deal negotiated with the neighborhood that allowed the church to develop a youth recreation area.) Meanwhile, Mitchell’s home on Habersham Road was torn down. In its place and with part of the proceeds from the sale of the West Wesley residence, the archbishop’s new $2.2 million mansion was built, equipped with two dining rooms, an elevator and a second-floor safe, or panic room. Gregory, long-rumored to be a candidate on the short list to succeed soon-to-be-retiring Chicago Bishop Francis George, moved to the new residence on Habersham in January. He initially defended the move, which critics said went against Pope Francis’ call for modest living. He later apologized. "I am disappointed that, while my advisers and I were able to justify this project fiscally, logistically and practically, I personally failed to project the cost in terms of my own integrity and pastoral credibility with the people of God of north and central Georgia," Gregory wrote. The archbishop promised to sell the house and move elsewhere. We’re told that’s still the plan today. In summary: We decided to fact-check the archbishop’s statement largely on two points: Is the Cathedral of Christ the King one of the archdiocese’s largest churches? And is it one of the diocese’s fastest-growing churches. The data we were provided say yes. But they allowed only a limited comparison, and the information could not be independently verified.

pomt-12071	"My grandparents were proud immigrants to the United States of America, here to Illinois in the late 1800s. My grandparents did not speak English when they were young."	/illinois/statements/2017/sep/05/bruce-rauner/rauner-trims-twists-branches-his-family-tree-immig/	Bruce Rauner clearly idolized his maternal grandparents, Clarence and Viola Erickson. From his earliest days in politics, he has repeatedly invoked their memory as role models for the kind of selfless, rugged and generous person that he hoped voters would find him to be. It was of little surprise then that, as he appeared with immigrant activists to sign a controversial law putting limits on policing of the undocumented, Rauner retold his own favorite story of immigrants -- the Ericksons from Sweden. "My grandparents were proud immigrants to the United States of America, here to Illinois in the late 1800s," Rauner said. "My grandparents did not speak English when they were young." Variations of the Erickson story have been staples of Rauner appearances for years. But the key word here is "variations," because the governor has not always been consistent in the telling. So what is the real immigrant story of those grandparents Rauner is always talking about? We decided to check. Immigrant cred First, a little context. Bruce Rauner grew up in the upscale North Shore suburbs of Deerfield and Lake Forest as well as Scottsdale, Ariz., and his father was a high-ranking executive at electronics giant Motorola. Rauner went to Ivy League colleges, became enormously wealthy as a private equity investor and was the owner of nine luxury homes and ranches when he launched his campaign. His campaign was clearly sensitive to how that might play with voters as it sought from the first to portray him as a regular guy. Early campaign ads featured Rauner with his $18 Timex watch and a two-decade old family van that he said his children dubbed the "rolling trash can." The Chicago Tribune asked in 2014 about comparisons to wealthy private equity investor turned politician Mitt Romney, and Rauner bristled: "He came across as a blue blood, I'm a regular guy. I drink beer. I don't drink Courvoisier or whatever the hell that stuff is. I drink beer and I smoke a cigar and I ride a Harley and I love to fish." Cue the Ericksons as a key component of Rauner’s down-to-earth cred. Here’s the story as highlighted on Rauner’s campaign website: "Bruce’s grandfather was a Swedish-speaking, small-town dairyman who taught Bruce about fishing and hunting, the value of hard work and the importance of giving back." And here is how Rauner described his grandfather during a campaign stop in Wauconda in October 2013: "My best friend growing up was my grandfather on my mom’s side. Swedish immigrant. Didn’t speak much English. Lived in a double wide trailer in a cornfield outside Whitewater, Wisconsin. Dairy farmer. Taught me to milk cows. Taught me about huntin’ and fishin.’ Taught me about hard work and giving back." A year later, he was quoted in the Pekin Daily Times this way: "America's built on immigration, my grandparents were immigrants, and I would like to see us a welcoming state for immigrants from all over the world." More recently, when Rauner was interviewed in June 2017 by the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, he again talked of his grandfather. "He was my best buddy growing up. He was an immigrant, didn't speak much English. He spoke Swedish," Rauner said. And he also said this on Aug. 11, 2017, in an interview with Bret Baier on the Fox News Channel: "Illinois is a state built by immigrants. My grandparents were immigrants." A few weeks later, as he addressed the crowd at the high-profile signing event for the Illinois Trust Act on Aug. 28, he expanded on his grandparents’ narrative, adding that they came to this country "in the late 1800s" and "did not speak English when they were young." Notice the difference? When Rauner talks off the cuff about his grandparents, they are immigrants challenged by English. But when Rauner’s official website describes Grandpa Erickson, there’s no mention of him being an immigrant. He spoke Swedish, the website stressed, but that hardly means he didn’t also speak English. And there may be a good reason for the parsing. Records from U.S. Censuses taken between 1910 and 1940, the latest year publicly available, clearly show that both of Rauner’s maternal grandparents were born in Wisconsin — Clarence Erickson in 1901 and Viola Erickson (nee Wedin) in 1900. In other words, neither of them were immigrants. What’s more, the census shows that Viola’s mother — Rauner’s great-grandmother — was also born in Wisconsin. Viola’s father, while born in Sweden, emigrated to the U.S. at age 6 in 1868. As for Clarence, the census describes him as speaking English and having a seventh grade education. In the 1940 count, his profession was listed as "buttermaker." Slack suspended In Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain called them stretchers -- engaging stories that don’t meet the smell test. Politicians who spin engaging personal narratives can be artful practitioners of the stretcher. Here in Illinois, former U. S. Sen. Mark Kirk often inflated his resume, exaggerating the importance of jobs he held, his educational background and military service. Most famously, Kirk overly dramatized details of a Lake Michigan boating accident and rescue that he claimed altered his life and led him to commit to public service. Former Gov. Rod Blagojevich used to place himself at the center of an "ah shucks" story about being mistaken for former Mayor Richard Daley. Depending on Blagojevich’s audience, the mix-up occurred on a busy Loop street, or at a memorial service for a prominent businessman, or on his way to the airport. The only thing clear about the story was that it always got a laugh. Rauner’s grandparents’ story has elements of that genre. No one expects children to have more than a hazy grasp of details about what came before them in the family, and Rauner was just a boy when those close bonds with his grandparents were formed. So it’s tempting to cut his memories some slack. Except for this: Rauner the adult knows that his grandparents weren’t immigrants and admitted as much in a 2014 interview with reporters from the Tribune. "My great grandparents came to this country, it was my great-grandparents, and my grandparents grew up with them in Wisconsin speaking Swedish," Rauner said. "They were born to immigrants." Our ruling Bruce Rauner said his grandparents were immigrants from Sweden who came to the U.S. "in the late 1800s." We have no reason to doubt that Rauner’s grandparents meant the world to him. But the Census plainly refutes his claim that they were immigrants. What’s more, both couldn’t have come to the U.S. in the late 1800s because they weren’t even born until the early 1900s — in Wisconsin, not Sweden. Rauner’s assertion in August that his grandparents immigrated to Illinois is yet another inaccuracy. Since we don’t have a time machine, we can’t say for certain what language was spoken in the Erickson and Wedin childhood homes. But to the extent that Rauner implies the Ericksons' facility with English was limited, Census reports refute that notion as well. Topping all that is the acknowledgement by Rauner himself in his 2014 Tribune interview that his grandparents were not immigrants. Still, he continued to repeat the claim on many occasions. Census records and Rauner’s own admission show that this statement has no credibility. That is why it earns our lowest possible rating, Pants On Fire.
