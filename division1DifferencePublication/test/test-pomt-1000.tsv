pomt-14054	"The only two (Donald Trump tax returns) we have show that he hasn't paid a penny in taxes."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/24/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claim-about-donald-trump-paying-no/	Releasing federal tax returns has become a rite of passage for presidential candidates. Donald Trump, who has marched to his own drummer in many ways this campaign season, has been the exception, refusing to release them. During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton chided Trump for keeping his returns secret. When Todd asked Clinton if Trump had done anything that should be praised, Clinton offered a non sequitur, saying Trump "needs to release his tax returns. The only two we have show that he hasn't paid a penny in taxes. "And yet he goes around talking about 'make America great.' You know, that means paying for our military. That means paying for our roads. That means paying for the V.A. That means a lot of things. And if you've got someone running for president who's afraid to release his tax returns because it will expose the fact that he pays no federal income tax, I think that's a big problem," Clinton said. We decided to see whether the only two tax returns made public show that Trump didn't pay a penny. Clinton has one thing correct here -- public records do indicate that there were two years in the 1970s when Trump paid nothing in federal taxes. But she got a few key points wrong. Namely, the same public records show three other years in which Trump did pay federal income taxes. Also, the public records Clinton referred to are not Trump's actual tax returns. When we checked with the Clinton campaign, they referred us to a Washington Post story headlined, "Trump once revealed his income tax returns. They showed he didn’t pay a cent." The source for the story is a document uncovered and posted online by the Washington Post's Fact Checker Glenn Kessler. He used it to show that, contrary to Trump's claim that "there's nothing to learn" from his tax returns, the returns can reveal a great deal about a presidential candidate. Kessler gave Trump's statement that there was "nothing to learn" four Pinocchios. The key document relevant to Clinton’s statement is a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzing Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. Page 33 reports on Trump's income and federal tax payments for 1975 through 1979. The report says that Trump did, in fact, pay federal taxes for three of those five years, a fact omitted in the Washington Post headline and story. It does not include the actual returns. The report says Trump paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 because, according to the tax rules, he lost money. Here's the rundown. For perspective, we've also listed the amounts in 2016 dollars. Year Income Federal tax Income (in current dollars) Federal tax (in current dollars) 1975 $76,210 $18,714 $338,923 $83,225 1976 $24,594 $10,832 $103,416 $45,548 1977 $118,530 $42,386 $467,980 $167,348 1978 $406,379 loss $0 $1,491,268 loss $0 1979 $3,443,560 loss $0 $11,348,617 loss $0 New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement, which verified his income, losses and deductions, said Trump's losses came from the operation of his various properties. But the report reveals no specifics, so the details of his tax returns for those years remain a mystery. Trump has made it clear in interviews and debates that he works aggressively to pay as little in taxes as possible. We also contacted Trump's campaign. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Clinton said, "The only two (Donald Trump tax returns) we have show that he hasn't paid a penny in taxes." We don't know a lot about Trump's tax situation, a fact exacerbated by his unwillingness to release his full tax returns. Public records show that Trump did not pay federal income taxes in two years -- 1978 and 1979 -- which is what Clinton was referencing. But the same records include information from three other years -- 1975, 1976, and 1977 -- when Trump did pay federal income taxes. The records we have are not full tax returns, which makes learning more about those years (or any others) difficult. Clinton’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57f065ce-c900-41c3-890a-b356b3dbd8a8	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-24T13:00:00	2016-05-22	['None']
pomt-14883	"We’re losing now over $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/donald-trump/trump-says-trade-imbalance-between-us-and-china-to/	Donald Trump turned a question about the Trans-Pacific Partnership into an opportunity to discuss the United States’ trade deficit with China during the Nov. 10, 2015, Fox Business debate. For the record, the TPP involves Asian nations, but not China. Still, Trump said that "We’re losing now over $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China." Last month at a campaign rally in Sioux Falls, Iowa, Trump said "we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China." A jump of more than $100 billion in less than a month? Really? No. We reached out to Trump’s campaign for more information on the figure, but did not hear back. However, according to data from the Census Bureau, the U.S. trade deficit with China clocked in at $343 billion in 2014. That makes Trump off by more than 31 percent. For comparison, a $343 billion trade gap is roughly the entire Gross Domestic Product of Denmark. So far, the trade deficit for 2015 has been calculated through September 2015, totalling almost $274 billion. Over the last 12 months of available data, the trade deficit has totaled $364 billion. That’s a big deficit but not more than $500 billion as Trump said. Since 1986, the yearly U.S. trade deficit with China has grown from year to year except in 2001 and 2009. See our chart for more information. Our ruling Trump said that "we’re losing now over $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China." Last month, Trump said almost $400 billion during a speech in Iowa. He should have stuck to that figure. The 2014 trade deficit totaled $343 billion, and it’s expected to be larger in 2015 but not more than $500 billion. Trump’s claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-12335	A national paid leave program "would potentially put into the economy $21 billion dollars annually."	/new-york/statements/2017/jun/15/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrand-claim-ignores-cost-paid-leave-program/	Here’s something worth noting: President Donald Trump agrees with Democrats in the U.S. Senate on at least one issue. Trump and the Democrats want a national paid leave program. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York says such a program would boost the economy. "If we had a national paid leave plan, it would potentially put into the economy $21 billion annually," Gillibrand said at a conference hosted by the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy and advocacy organization. Gillibrand has sponsored a bill that would provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave annually through a weekly payroll deduction. Trump’s plan provides six weeks of paid leave by expanding unemployment insurance funds. Both plans would allow paid time off work after the birth of a child. Gillibrand’s plan would also allow paid leave for a temporary disability or to care for a relative. Both proposals face an uphill climb in Congress because many Republicans oppose a national paid leave program. Gillibrand hopes her claim of an economic benefit persuades other senators to support her bill. But is she right? Where the number came from Gillibrand cites a 2016 report from the Center for American Progress. The report found people who take unpaid or partially paid leave lose $20.6 billion in wages each year. Researchers used federal data on the number of people who take unpaid or partially paid leave and their median wage to come up with the number. "I was trying to figure out how much these people are losing … because they have to take unpaid and partially paid leave while they’re out either because of caregiving responsibilities or temporary disability," said Sarah Jane Glynn, former director of women's economic policy at the Center for American Progress and a co-author of the report. The cost of a national paid leave program is not included in the report. Glynn said that was intentional. "Until we come to a consensus on what this program should look like it’s kind of difficult to say what it’s going to cost to taxpayers," Glynn said. Gillibrand touts a $21 billion boost to the economy, but that’s not what the report says. "That paper did not say including paid family leave would increase the economy by $21 billion. It said it would give workers $21 billion more and that’s a key distinction," said Ben Gitis, director of labor market policy from American Action Forum, a center-right policy research organization. "It sounds like they kind of looked at one side of the coin," said Vanessa Brown Calder, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research foundation. "There’s also some consequences and costs to instituting paid parental leave policies." Any plan would be paid for with tax dollars or a payroll deduction. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a nonpartisan research group focused on women’s issues, released a report earlier this year that said close to $33 billion would need to be raised each year to fund Gillibrand’s plan. "There was some flippage in the language," said Jeff Hayes, program director for job quality and income security at the institute, of Gillibrand’s claim. "An economist might tell you that just the uncompensated wages don’t actually grow the economy." Hayes did not dispute the Center for American Progress report’s estimate of lost wages. The number may even be higher, he said. Our ruling Gllibrand said a national paid leave program "would potentially put into the economy $21 billion dollars annually." Researchers say workers would receive at least $20.6 billion in paid leave. But Gillibrand’s claim ignores the money that would be taken out of the economy to pay for it. The program would be adding money to the same pot it’s being taken from. Her claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-01408	"At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas" and there are "dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."	/texas/statements/2014/oct/10/duncan-hunter-2/duncan-hunter-makes-unconfirmed-claim-border-patro/	U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande. The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. "ISIS is coming across the southern border," Hunter said, adding a moment later: "I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas." Border Patrol agents "caught them," Hunter also said, but "you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol." Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail. No federal or state confirmation No state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources. Fox News, in its original Oct. 8, 2014, online news report on Hunter’s declaration, quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account. Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred. An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: "The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border." And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it "does not have any information to confirm" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity. In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr. In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: "An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press." On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that "we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez," which neighbors El Paso. Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim, making the declaration that "we know" with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch. For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense. "It’s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of "no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case." Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said. Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught. "Problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game," Kasper wrote. "We make the point. Official channels deny. Then, maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post," much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Kasper said. Our ruling Hunter said "at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas" and there are "dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol." No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are "dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol" is missing a factual basis. All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-02020	Says when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die.	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/jun/06/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-says-when-armed-civilians-stop-mass-sho/	As a longtime gun owner, New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens made his support for Second Amendment rights one of the early themes of his campaign for U.S. Senate. Rubens launched a "2nd Amendment Protection Tour" earlier this year, traveling to gun shops around the state to pledge his support for firearms owners. It was a move that invited comparisons between himself and the man he views as his strongest challenger in the GOP primary, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. Brown has voiced support for increased gun control after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and has since faced blowback from gun owners in New Hampshire. During a stop at Lee’s Gun Shop in Hudson, Rubens said he would oppose a ban on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines if voters send him to Washington to replace Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Rubens also provided recommendations to address gun violence and mass shootings, such as encouraging schools to hire armed security personnel. The presence of armed civilians would send the message that shooters won’t achieve their aims, he said. "In mass shooting incidents where you had a person inside the premises during the incident, you have an average of 2.5 people killed if there is someone with a firearm able to stop the crime in progress," he said. "In similar instances where there’s no such person with a firearm, you have an average of 18 people killed and dead as a result of it." This seemed like a sharp contrast, so we asked Rubens to back up his claim about shooting deaths. His campaign pointed us to an article by Davi Barker, who runs a website called Daily Anarchist. In July 2012, Barker wrote that he studied several mass shootings and determined the average number of people killed in mass shootings when the shooter is stopped by police is 18.25. "I based it on 10 shootings I found listed on some timeline somewhere," he wrote. "I honestly don’t even remember where." Barker was challenged when he posted these statistics on Facebook, leading him to conduct a more thorough study, according to his website. After reviewing 100 "rampage shooting" incidents, Barker revised his calculations, claiming that the number of people killed when the shooter is stopped by police is really closer to 14.29. He pegged the average for incidents in which civilians stop the shooter at 2.33. The Rubens campaign acknowledged that the figures he provided were incorrect, saying that Rubens now stands behind Barker’s latest figures. "Bottom line remains: an on-premises armed citizen saves lives in a shooting rampage in a public place," communications director Brian Tilton wrote in an email. We looked for a separate analysis of shooting incidents to determine whether those casualty figures are accurate. One of the best sources we found is an academic study published in January in an FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin by Dr. Pete Blair, director of research for the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center (ALERRT) and an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas State University. Blair and two other researchers examined more than 100 shootings between 2000 and 2012, investigating factors such as the average response time of law enforcement and the outcomes based on the actions taken by civilians at the scene. Looking at "active shooter" incidents, the study found the median number of people shot is five (excluding the perpetrator). Blair said shooting incidents that lead to deaths in the range of 18 people -- the number Rubens initially offered -- are rare. "Eighteen would be really out there," he said. The study documented only nine incidents in which the number of people killed or wounded was 14 or higher. Blair also pointed out problems with the terminology Rubens used in his statement. The term "mass shooting" is widely understood to mean an incident in which four or more people are shot, he said. Therefore, incidents in which only two or three people are shot -- the average Rubens offered when civilians take action -- would generally be excluded from the category of mass shootings. Blair said it’s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Roughly half of all active shooter events Blair studied ended before law enforcement officers arrived. The most common occurrence was that the shooter stopped the attack spontaneously on their own. The decision was often made after an initial burst of violence, in which the shooter attacked everyone who was in the immediate area, Blair said. When those who remained either ran away or barricaded themselves in secure areas, shooters often made the decision to leave the attack site or commit suicide, he said. Blair said he also documented cases in which civilians took direct action. Civilians stopped about one out of every six active shooter events, but their actions rarely involved the use of firearms, he said. The most common method was tackling the attacker, as was the case during a campus shooting in Seattle this week. Blair said he found only three cases in which an armed civilian shot the attacker, and in two of those incidents, the civilian who took action was an off-duty police officer. Blair said it would be difficult to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of armed civilians in stopping active shooter events based on the limited data that exists. In general though, Blair said, fewer people were killed or injured in the events that ended before police showed up at the scene -- either because civilians took action, or because the shooter spontaneously stopped or committed suicide. Data suggests the best course of action for civilians is first to avoid the attacker, and if that’s not possible, to deny access by barricading themselves in locked rooms or other secure areas. Blair teaches training courses for law enforcement and civilians on how to respond to active shooter events through ALERRT, which receives funding from the Bureau of Justice Administration at the U.S. Department of Justice and from the Texas governor’s office. Blair said he encourages civilians to take physical action to defend themselves only when it’s impossible to escape. "We see the firearm as being an adjunct to that part," he said. Blair said there are pros and cons to having armed civilians at the scene of a shooting. Confronting the shooter with a gun would likely provide the fastest resolution, he said. But if multiple civilians are wielding guns at the scene, it could also create confusion about who the shooter is -- particularly for police who are arriving to render aid. Our ruling Rubens said when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die. One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees it’s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Finally, both Rubens and the internet blogger who first offered the statistics that Rubens cited have acknowledged the figures were incorrect. Rubens has since revised his estimate to be in the range of 2.33 and 14. Overall, this statement is not accurate. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07957	Texas leads "the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance."	/texas/statements/2011/jan/24/paul-krugman/new-york-times-paul-krugman-says-texas-leads-natio/	In a Jan. 6 New York Times op-ed column, liberal economist Paul Krugman warns that Texas is the future, and it isn’t pretty: "What we’re seeing right now is a future that doesn’t work." Among his charges is that Texas is "leading the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance," the column says. Texas has so long been cited as the state with the highest percentage of uninsured residents that factual corroboration seldom follows. When we asked Krugman for backup, he pointed us to 2007-2009 data from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing the percentage of uninsured residents between states. According to to the bureau’s estimates, Texas ranked first at that time, with 25.5 percent uninsured. New Mexico followed, with 22.6 percent, and then Florida, 20.9. Nationally, 15.8 percent were uninsured, according to the data, with Massachusetts having the fewest uninsured, 5.1 percent. An October 2008 policy paper by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation notes that "Texas has the unfortunate distinction of leading the nation in the number of uninsured citizens," but takes issue with the Census Bureau’s methodology, which "includes anyone uninsured at the time the survey is taken." Separately, we found a national poll indicating Texas ranked No. 1 in uninsured residents the first half of 2010. According to the Gallup poll, an average of 26.8 percent of Texas residents were uninsured. Mississippi trailed in second (25.8 percent), followed by Louisiana (24 percent). California landed fifth, with 21.9 percent. And Massachusetts, which requires residents older than 18 to have health coverage, ranked again as the state with the smallest percentage of uninsured residents: 4.9 percent. Gallup said it interviewed 176,193 adults from Jan. 2-June 30, 2010. By available indicators, Texas has the nation’s highest percentage of uninsured residents. We rate Krugman’s statement as True.

pomt-03168	About 40 percent of U.S. illegal immigrants "came in on an airplane, with a legal visa, and just overstayed their visa and have never gone home."	/texas/statements/2013/sep/06/john-carter/john-carter-claim-40-percent-nations-illegal-resid/	A Texas congressman who took a three-day tour of the Rio Grande Valley near the Mexico border stressed afterward that many U.S. residents lacking legal permission to be here do not enter by tromping across the Rio Grande. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, said: "The reality is that about 40 percent of the people came in on an airplane, with a legal visa, and just overstayed their visa and have never gone home." His comment appeared in a news story posted online by the Round Rock Leader on Aug. 31, 2013. Carter, who did not respond to our requests for elaboration, was referring to a well-known facet of illegal immigration. A July 2013 General Accountability Office report said: "Each year, millions of visitors come to the United States legally on a temporary basis either with or without a visa. Overstays are individuals who were admitted legally on a temporary basis but then overstayed their authorized periods of admission." PolitiFact researchers previously found substance to similar claims. In 2012, PolitiFact New Jersey said that according to most studies, visitors who overstayed visas ranged from about one-third to roughly half of all the country’s illegal immigrants. And relying largely on a 2006 study, PolitiFact in July 2010 rated as Mostly True a claim that 40 percent of the "undocumented workers in this country" entered the U.S. legally and "overstayed their visa." This is obviously an iffy topic and not just because quantifying the total number of illegal immigrants is tricky--they are, after all, evading detection. Of late, it’s widely estimated that 11 million U.S. residents are unauthorized to be here. According to the GAO, federal law requires the Department of Homeland Security to estimate the number of individuals overstaying their visas, though that has not occurred in recent years. In April 2011, the report said, Homeland Security officials said that they have not reported overstay rates because DHS has not had sufficient confidence in the quality of its overstay data. Also, the report says, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testified in early 2013 that the agency planned to report overstay rates by December 2013. If such a tally were available, it might reflect those individuals who checked in with immigration officials as they entered the country for whom authorities have no record of their checking out on departure. As of April 2013, Homeland Security had more than 1 million "unmatched" arrival records, the GAO report said, meaning those records were not accompanied by indications the individuals had left the country. The report said that some of the records reflected people overstaying their visas. The 40 percent statistic was floated as authoritative by several House members in a May 21, 2013, House subcommittee hearing, according to a transcript by CQ Transcriptions. Among them, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, asked James Dinkins, executive associate director for Immigration Customs Enforcement, to estimate how many of these "millions of individuals" likely pose security threats. Few, Dinkins replied, adding that the government had checked on about 480,000 names of potential new visa overstays that year. "And of that 480,000 names, about 3,000 of them actually hit a potential national security or public safety threat," Dinkins said, with criminal cases opened on each one of the 3,000. On March 14, 2013, Edward Alden, a senior fellow on the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank, told a Senate committee: "The commonly accepted estimate is that more than 40 percent of the unauthorized migrants currently resident in the United States did not cross the borders illegally. Instead, they arrived in the United States on a lawful tourist, student, business, or other visa and then violated the terms of that visa by remaining in the United States." In a footnote, Alden pointed out that the Pew Hispanic Center issued a "fact sheet" in 2006 spelling out "overstay" estimates that have been deemed credible, a source also previously cited by PolitiFact. On the sheet, the center estimated that "nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials." Specifically, the estimate ranged from 38 percent to 50 percent. The center split the difference by proposing a figure of up to 45 percent. Specifically, the center estimated, some 4.5 million to 6 million of the 11.5 million to 12 million unauthorized residents as of 2006 entered legally through ports of entry. The bulk of these entrants came in as tourists or as business visitors, the center said. According to the government, the center said, there were 179 million nonimmigrant admissions in 2004, meaning individual entries by foreigners authorized for temporary stays. The center said its estimate came from modifying a methodology devised by a government demographer who analyzed internal files in the 1990s to estimate the size and key characteristics of individuals who overstayed their visas. In 1997, the demographer, Robert Warren, concluded that the unauthorized migrant population totaled 5 million and that 2.1 million, or 41 percent, consisted of visa overstayers, according to the center, while Homeland Security later estimated that about one third of unauthorized residents in 2000 were visa overstayers and the GAO, drawing on alternate data sources, put the percentage of such overstayers at 27 percent, 31 percent and 57 percent. Of course, the data in the report, in addition to being estimates, are several years old, causing us to wonder what has changed. By email, Jeffrey Passel, the center’s senior demographer, told us the information has not been updated, though he also has seen "no evidence of a significant change in the makeup of the resident unauthorized population in terms of method of arrival." Of Carter’s focus on airplanes, Passel said: "Not all of them ‘fly here,’ although most do. Some come through border ports of entry and some come by ship." Alden noted in his testimony that while the government has fingerprinted each legal visitor since 2004, it has not taken an electronic approach to checking people heading home. (The Senate-approved immigration overhaul stipulates that electronic exit systems be implemented at all air and sea ports where immigration officers are present, according to a summary by the Immigration Policy Center, an arm of the American Immigration Council, which says its mission is to shape a rational conversation on immigration.) Yet Alden also said the "scale of the problem may be exaggerated. In May 2011," he said, Napolitano "ordered an investigation into nearly 1.7 million records of individuals that the department believed had overstayed" since fingerprinting on entry started. The "review determined," Alden said, "that more than half of those had actually left the country or had adjusted status and were living in the United States legally." On April 25, 2012, Napolitano testified to a Senate committee that people overstaying their visas may have been accounting for fewer than 40 percent of illegal immigrants. "That may be a high number, because what we have found is a lot of people who were marked as visa overstays had, in fact, left," Napolitano said, according to a transcript. We did not draw any elaboration on her comment from Homeland Security. Next, we asked academic experts about Carter’s cited statistic. Gary Freeman, a University of Texas government professor, said by phone the 40 percent figure is "widely used and rarely studied in any detail. You can’t say" Carter is "wrong," Freeman said, "but we don’t know the right answer." By email, Frank Bean, director of the Center for Research on Immigration, Population and Public Policy at the University of California-Irvine, suggested that because the cited percentage is rooted in data for the 1990s, it may well be low. "Since then," Bean said, "the pool of persons" who are "candidates to overstay their visas has grown immensely. Even if the rate at which persons on visas overstay them has remained constant, the raw numbers of those doing so could have increased, and done so disproportionately enough to make the 40 percent figure rise. Unfortunately, we have no way of estimating this with accuracy." Our ruling Carter said about 40 percent of U.S. illegal immigrants "came in on an airplane, with a legal visa, and just overstayed their visa and have never gone home." That percentage aligns with an oft-repeated estimate, supported by a 2006 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, of the share of unauthorized residents who have overstayed visas. Many presumably arrived by plane, though we found no such breakdown. And the percentage could be off--too high or even too low. Homeland Security’s chief testified that 40 percent might be too high, while another expert told us there may now be more visitors who overstay. A precise up-to-date calculation doesn't seem to exist. We rate this claim, which relies on a seven-year-old estimate and could have used clarification about not all visitors coming by airplane, as Mostly True.

pomt-03542	The proposed raises for the Norcross City Council would put it in line with other liked-sized communities.	/georgia/statements/2013/may/28/norcross-city-council/do-raises-line-other-cities/	A few lucky souls in a Gwinnett County city could see their paychecks rise by 50 percent. So how did they become so fortunate, and do they have any openings? Well, they voted themselves the potential raises. Norcross City Council members recently voted 4-1 to increase the pay for their positions from $5,400 a year to $8,100. The mayor’s pay will rise from $6,900 a year to $10,350. The increases will take effect in January, two months after the next municipal election. WXIA-TV recently did a story about the raises and criticism of the idea. The station reported that Mayor Bucky Johnson said the raises would bring Norcross in line with other liked-sized communities. Johnson told us a councilman made the initial claim. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the officials are right. A Norcross official sent us a salary survey of elected officials in 43 cities in metro Atlanta. The annual pay for top elected officials ranged from $147,500 for Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed to Buford City Commission Chairman Phillip Beard, who doesn’t receive a salary. Atlanta, which has a population of more than 400,000 residents, isn’t necessarily the most appropriate city for such a comparison with Norcross, which had 9,116 residents in the 2010 U.S. census. The city's population rose to an estimated 15,000 residents in 2012 after Norcross an annexation, Johnson said. We looked at cities with similar populations. Since serving on the Norcross City Council is considered a part-time position, our second criteria was finding elected officials who are also part-time. Lilburn, the closest municipality to Norcross, has a part-time City Council and pays its elected officials slightly less than what Norcross approved. The population is slightly higher, nearly 12,000 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census. That city’s mayor makes $5,000 a year and council members are paid an annual salary of $3,500, a Lilburn official told us. Another part-time City Council further east in Gwinnett County, Loganville, offers compensation to its elected officials that’s pretty close to Norcross. Loganville’s mayor is paid $12,000 a year while its council members make $6,000 a year. Loganville officials are part-time. The city’s population in 2010 was 10,458. We also looked at Doraville, which had 8,330 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census. The mayor and council members receive annual salaries of $70,000 and $8,400, respectively, city officials say. The council voted in 2011 to cut their annual pay by $6,000 as City Hall grappled with across-the-board budget cuts, The Champion Newspaper reported. For three decades, Doraville’s mayor handled the city’s daily operations. Residents voted to put a city manager in charge of running Doraville on a daily basis and hired one in February 2012. In all, we looked at 10 cities in the region with populations that seemed reasonably close to Norcross’. The average annual mayoral salary was $19,418. The average yearly city council salary was $8,437. The salaries are higher than what Norcross adopted. But only six of those cities have mayoral salaries that are higher than what Norcross passed. Just four of those cities have city council salaries that are more than what Norcross approved. To sum up, Norcross officials claimed the salary increases for its mayor and City Council would put them in line with other liked-sized communities. If you consider the average salaries for 10 similarly sized cities, Norcross officials would still make less than their counterparts. If you examine each of those cities separately, the Norcross officials would make more in some cases and less in other instances. From what we’ve reviewed, Norcross has a pretty good argument here. The council will be in the middle of other liked-sized communities concerning pay. We rate the claim True.	None	Norcross City Council	None	None	None	2013-05-28T06:00:00	2013-05-09	['None']
pomt-00977	"When I came into office, our vaccination rate in Texas was 65 percent. When I left two weeks ago, it was 95 percent."	/texas/statements/2015/feb/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-texas-vaccination-rates-rose-65-per/	Rick Perry, saying parents should get their children vaccinated, went on to say his home state greatly stepped up vaccinations in his 14 years as Texas governor. In a Feb. 5, 2015, interview with The Washington Post and Texas Tribune, Perry said national and state leaders should use their power to encourage the childhood shots. "I think governors, elected officials, people in positions of authority and power and influence, should use those positions to make sure that the people they either represent or have the opportunity to work for are as healthy as they can be," Perry said. "Obviously vaccines are a very important part of that." In the interview, Perry also said that when he came into office, "our vaccination rate in Texas was 65 percent. When I left two weeks ago, it was 95 percent." He continued, according to video placed online by the Tribune: "We know that vaccines — science backs it up every day — that vaccines are a very very important tool to keep our citizens safe." The next morning, the Post’s Fact Checker gave Perry three Pinnochios for those declared percentages, saying that according to federal data, nearly 64 percent of preschool children in Texas obtained all recommended vaccinations in 2000, the year Perry became governor, and about 73 percent of such children did so in 2013, his second-to-last year in office. Also, the story said, the latter rate was a decrease from 2007. (A Perry spokesman later told the Tribune Perry had used "incomplete numbers.") State-provided charts For our own review, we asked Perry how he reached his figures and we turned to the Texas Department of State Health Services, whose spokeswoman, Carrie Williams, emailed us a couple charts indicating the state’s vaccination rates over the years. In 2000, one chart says, 69.5 percent of Texas children aged 19 months through 35 months had received recommended shots against diptheria/tetanus/pertussis, polio and measles, mumps and rubella, in accordance with state law. In 2013, the latest year on the chart, 80.1 percent of children in the age range had received those shots. On Perry’s watch, according to the chart, year-by-year shot rates for preschoolers ranged from a low of 71.3 percent in 2002 to a high of 81.7 percent in 2010. One takeaway: The share of Texas preschool toddlers getting basic shots was up about 10 percentage points toward the end of Perry’s time as governor. Perry's '95 percent' backup So, how did Perry arrive at his statement that 95 percent of Texas children were immunized? Perry spokesman Travis Considine offered as backup for this part of Perry’s statement an October 2014 CDC press release stating that in the 2013-14 school year, 97 percent or more of Texas children enrolled in kindergarten had gotten required-for-enrollment shots for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR); diptheria and tetanus toxoids as well as acellular pertussis (DTaP); and varicella. Another chart in the release indicates 7,803 children were exempted from getting all the shots, amounting to 2 percent of all the kindergartners. Then again, the statistic for kindergartners getting shots is a different measure than the statistic for toddler immunizations. Indeed, the second State Health Services chart shows that nearly all the state’s kindergartners got fully vaccinated in all the years Perry was governor--and nearly all students had done so for years before. In 2000, Texas children in kindergarten had vaccination rates for different shots ranging from 95 percent to 99 percent, according to the chart. In 2013, the last year on the chart, kindergartners had vaccination rates of 97.2 percent to 98.1 percent depending on the shot being gauged. Shot rates for kindergartners were in the high 90s since the earliest year on the chart, 1993. We figure those particular rates have remained high because the shots are required by law before a student enters public school, as a state handout makes clear. A wrinkle: Parents may seek to exempt their children from the required shots for "medical contraindications" and "reasons of conscience, including a religious belief," according to state regulations. To claim an exemption due to reasons of conscience, a student's parent or legal guardian must submit a State Health Services affidavit to the child's school; it’s valid for two years, the agency says. In 2013-14, 0.76 percent of children received conscientious exemptions, according to an agency chart. We forwarded what State Health Services gave us to Considine and didn’t hear back. Finally, for scientific perspective we reached Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. By phone, Troisi looked over CDC figures and the charts we fielded from the state. She said the contrast between young preschoolers' vaccination rates in 2013 to rates in 2000 reflected a "statistically significant" improvement. As governor, Troisi said, Perry had some oversight of State Health Services. But she said she also credits the federal government, through the CDC, for improved immunization rates; federal aid helps low-income residents get shots, she said. Our ruling Perry said: "When I came into office, our vaccination rate in Texas was 65 percent. When I left two weeks ago, it was 95 percent." These percentages trace to reported immunization rates for different populations of youngsters. And by inappropriately pairing the figures, Perry left the incorrect impression of great progress on his watch when there actually was less dramatic improvement--with kindergartners almost uniformly getting all their shots, as required by law, as they did before his reign. With all this in mind, we rate the statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 3:48 p.m., Feb. 12, 2015: After this story published, a reader prompted us to notice that a Perry spokesman had told the Texas Tribune the ex-governor used "incomplete numbers." We amended our fact check to note that. This did not affect our rating of what he said.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2015-02-12T14:37:28	2014-02-05	['Texas']
pomt-13205	Says electric utilities "are trying to fool you into amending your state Constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering."	/florida/statements/2016/oct/21/al-gore/utilities-behind-amendment-1-are-trying-trick-vote/	In the Miami area to stump for Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore wanted to enlighten a crowd of supporters about a controversial ballot measure on solar energy. Gore said the utility companies that back Amendment 1 make it sound like it fosters solar, but the true aim is darker than that. He called it a "phony baloney" initiative propped up by utilities. "The things they claim protect solar are protections you already have," Gore said at Miami Dade College’s Kendall campus on Oct. 11, 2016. "But they are trying to fool you into amending your state Constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering and do in Florida what they did in Nevada and just kill the solar industry." Does Amendment 1 allow utility companies to stop net metering? And what is net metering, anyway? We wanted to shine some light on a very contentious energy proposal. Solar squabble Amendment 1, called "Rights of Electricity Consumers Regarding Solar Energy Choice," has drawn fire for crowding out a more grassroots solar power amendment that failed to make this year’s ballot because it didn’t garner enough signatures — in part because utility companies contributed millions to Amendment 1’s war chest. The Florida Supreme Court determined the language of the amendment was not misleading and approved it 4-3. It is widely considered a deliberate attempt by utilities to erect barriers to competition and prevent third-party leasing of solar. Utility companies have given most of the almost $22 million being poured into the amendment campaign. Florida is one of five states that do not allow a property owner to have a third-party installer put solar panels on their roof and sell the power back to them. The amendment will leave that ban in place, but, if the ban on solar leasing and sales were removed, the language in the amendment could discourage third-party sales. It gives utility companies the right to impose new fees on all solar customers to compensate for the loss of revenue when solar customers don't buy their power, making solar sales and leasing less economical. Audio surfaced this month of Sal Nuzzo, a vice president at the utilities-backed James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, at an energy summit calling the amendment "an incredibly savvy maneuver" that "would completely negate anything they (pro-solar interests) would try to do either legislatively or constitutionally down the road," according to the Miami Herald. He also said that because solar power is a popular idea among customers, "we can use a little bit of political jiu-jitsu" to get voters to approve protections for non-solar customers. Before that story, environmentalists and solar advocates said they were tipped off by the very wording in the amendment: "State and local governments shall retain their abilities to protect consumer rights and public health, safety and welfare, and to ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do." The first clause protects a person’s ability to put solar panels on their house. That’s really not a big deal at the moment, since current law already allows that. The second half is the controversial part, because critics like Gore say it will allow utility companies to end a process called net metering. What’s that, you ask? Say you have solar panels on your roof. When the sun is out, the panels are generating power. They may even generate more than your house needs. Meanwhile, most homes still need traditional electric service from utility companies so that they can have power at night. Net metering allows someone to sell excess solar-generated power to the utilities. Those people would also enjoy a lower bill because they draw less electricity from the traditional, power plant-supplied grid. Utility companies nationwide have argued that this is unfair, because homes with solar panels are getting all the benefit of being connected to the grid without having to pay as much for the upkeep of generators and transmission lines as other customers. Traditional customers, they say, are subsidizing solar customers. "The concern is that if you get all your power for free, you’re not paying your fair share," Stetson University law professor Lance Long said. Solar promoters disagree with those claims. They argue that instead of costing non-solar customers more, solar energy brings more value to the electricity distribution system than it takes away. A Brookings Institution study in May looked at net metering in several states and concluded that when solar customers sell their power back to the electric utility through net metering, it actually helps non-solar customers in a few ways. The study said adding solar power reduces the need to build new power plants to meet peak demand, curtails costly grid maintenance, lowers reliance on oil and gas power generation, lowers utility rates, increases energy security and saves customers money. Amendment 1 opponents therefore fear that utilities will lobby the state to allow a surcharge on solar customers or, as Gore said, change the policy for net metering. If Amendment 1 is approved, state officials could define what it means to "subsidize" solar power and lessen the economic benefits of third-party solar power for homes and businesses. It’s a reasonable concern, since Florida utility providers have already grumbled about ending net metering. Florida Power & Light told the state Public Service Commission in June 2015 that it didn’t see the practice as sustainable, repeatedly referring to "subsidies required to support rooftop solar." Ending net metering would strangle a vital revenue source for those third-party solar companies. Those businesses often install solar panels on houses for free or reduced cost, then make money by leasing the equipment and selling excess power to utilities. The chance to cripple competitors would give utilities a big incentive to kill net metering. As Gore mentioned, that’s what happened in Nevada, which reduced net metering payments so much that major third-party companies left the state, dropping new panel installations by 92 percent in the first quarter of 2016. That follows a national trend of utility companies being hostile to some types of solar arrangements. But no one, not even Oscar-winning environmentalist Gore, knows for certain what Florida’s utility companies would do about net metering, or potential extra fees. Both are possible, or even likely, depending on your point of view. But neither are definite if Amendment 1 passes. Changes wouldn’t be automatic, either. A spokeswoman for Consumers for Smart Solar, the utility-backed group behind the initiative, pointed out "Amendment 1 gives utilities no authority whatsoever." Legal experts we contacted said that’s accurate; Florida’s Public Service Commission, which sets rates and handles utility regulations, would have to approve utilities’ requests. And since net metering is a part of state statute, the matter would likely end up before the state Supreme Court. That’s when Amendment 1 would really kick in: It would give utilities a much stronger argument that one way or another, solar customers should be paying a higher electric bill. "It (the amendment) would create a constitutional right for utilities, and not just a regulation," Florida State University law professor Hannah Wiseman said. "It raises the stakes." Our ruling Gore said electric utilities "are trying to fool you into amending your state Constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering." Amendment 1 doesn’t immediately give utilities authority to do anything, on its face. But it would potentially give them a constitutional argument to eventually charge solar customers more, or change net metering policies. There’s no certain proof that Florida regulators would approve either, but experts told us it’s a very reasonable suspicion. The amendment is widely considered to be deceptively worded and erects barriers to solar power that would favor traditional utilities. Gore is right to warn solar proponents it would work against their broader efforts. Nonetheless, he went a bit too far to say the amendment would automatically grant utilities unchecked "authority" to kill net metering. We rate his statement Half True. Clarification, Oct. 24, 2016: This fact-check was updated to clarify that third-party sales of electricity from solar power are banned in Florida. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b5fa6588-4ecc-454f-9a48-028843014ede	None	Al Gore	None	None	None	2016-10-21T12:16:04	2016-10-11	['None']
pomt-13507	Says "Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-strays-key-facts-hillary-clinton-amne/	Donald Trump is claiming that Hillary Clinton wants to give immigrants who are in the United States illegally access to federal benefits that they haven’t earned and that the country can’t afford. "Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days," he told a crowd in Phoenix on Aug. 31, "and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget." We'll deal with the amnesty issue first. The 100-day pledge Clinton's website page on immigration doesn't mention amnesty at all. It does, however, promise to "introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within her first 100 days in office." That would require a series of steps before an immigrant who is here illegally would be eligible for citizenship. That's not bestowing amnesty within 100 days. Clinton is, however, in favor of allowing many of those immigrants the chance to stay in the United States and be temporarily free from the threat of deportation. She supports two programs that give them a "deferred action" designation by the Department of Homeland Security. The first is known as DACA (for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). It's been in effect since 2012 and protects nearly 730,000 people who came to the United States as children. The second, called DAPA (for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents), was proposed for the 4 million or so people whose children are already U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. It's an attempt to keep families together. But the U.S. Supreme Court had blocked its implementation. The programs are designed to provide temporary relief; the immigrants who qualify must renew their designation every few years. They are still considered to be in the country illegally. Again, that's not amnesty. In the past, Clinton supported "Gang of Eight" legislation calling for enhanced border security, using E-Verify to check a person's eligibility for employment and a system to prevent people from overstaying their visa. It also required illegal immigrants to learn English, pay a fine and pay back taxes, and it gave higher preference to the applications of immigrants already seeking citizenship. During the process, those immigrants would not have been eligible for federal public benefits. Some critics characterized the measure, which didn't pass, as amnesty. Supporters said it’s not amnesty, a claim we’ve generally rated Half True. One legal dictionary defines amnesty as "a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out. ... The basis for amnesty is generally because the war or other conditions that made the acts criminal no longer exist or have faded in importance." In modern American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program, both then and now. And its failure to stem the flow of illegal immigration is partly why "amnesty" is such a poisonous word today. When we asked the Trump campaign about that part of the claim, immigration adviser Julie Kirchner said Clinton has promised to propose it during the first 100 days. Social programs Clinton does support proposals that would make some illegal immigrants eligible for Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare. But it wouldn't be all illegal immigrants for all programs, as Trump says. On Obamacare, Trump is correct. Clinton's website says, "We should let families — regardless of immigration status — buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Families who want to purchase health insurance should be able to do so." Also, note that Trump doesn't mention welfare, food stamps or Medicaid health care for the poor. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for those programs now, and they wouldn't be eligible for the first two, even if they were granted amnesty for coming to the United States illegally. They would have to become citizens or lawful permanent residents. (If Clinton got them covered by Obamacare, Medicaid might be in play.) But on the issue of Social Security and Medicare, if Clinton manages to get a DAPA-like program implemented, nearly 4 million to 5 million illegal immigrants (out of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants) would get a "deferred action" designation and, as a result, become eligible to work here. That, in turn, would require them to pay into the Social Security and Medicare programs and — if they grew old enough and had a work history of at least 10 years — they would be eligible for those benefits under a system set up in the President Ronald Reagan years. So on this point, Trump is mostly correct, although he's giving the false impression that illegal immigrants would be entitled to all social programs under Clinton. Which brings us to . . . Breaking the federal budget? Is this going to cripple the federal budget, as Trump claims? As we noted in an earlier fact-check when Trump was making similar claims, undocumented workers have been a boon to Social Security. They added about $12 billion to the Social Security trust funds in 2010. The reason: They're paying into the system, but they are not — and may never be — eligible to take benefits out. In fact, a 2015 report by the Social Security Administration estimated that if both DACA and DAPA had been implemented, it would have initially increased the short-term solvency of Social Security. The payments of those working immigrants would have generated a small overall increase in revenue through 2045, a smaller overall decline from 2046 through 2082, and be neutral after 2082. They're not going to break the federal budget that way — or break it anymore than it's already broken. As for Obamacare, that's not free health care. It's an insurance program that people have to purchase. The more young people it enrolls, the healthier the program is. Normally if someone is poor and enrolls in Obamacare, they are then added to Medicaid or the federal Children's Health Insurance Program instead. It would be costly to enroll illegal immigrants in Medicaid or CHIP, although whether it would "break" the federal budget is a matter for debate. We received varying ballpark estimates from experts on how much it could potentially cost if all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants were put on Medicaid or CHIP, which would be highly unlikely. Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, said the maximum cost would be about $11 billion on a $4 trillion federal budget. But Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego, said a more reasonable estimate was $33 billion, or up to "$66 billion if there is a large number of disabled or otherwise high-cost individuals. "These numbers would still overstate the expenditures that would actually unfold," he said, "because only some difficult-to-estimate fraction of the relevant population would actually obtain ACA-financed coverage." In fact, as the Clinton campaign later told us, Clinton is on the record as saying that there should be no significant extra cost with her plan because undocumented immigrants won't be eligible for a subsidy for private insurance or Medicaid. Whether that changed would depend on how the laws are revised. Clinton told Anderson Cooper on March 21, 2016: "If they can afford it, they should be able to go into the marketplace and buy it. But it is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that because the subsidies in question have to be worked out in comprehensive immigration reform." Our ruling Trump said, "Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget." She has not pledged to grant amnesty in her first 100 days. She's promised to submit immigration legislation. Her plan doesn't "provide" Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare to immigrants. They'll have to pay into the system to get those benefits just like everybody else. In the case of Social Security and Medicare, it would be at least a decade — perhaps several — before they get any benefits. In the case of Obamacare, even if all 11 million undocumented immigrants were so poor they qualified for Medicaid, it would not "break" the $4 trillion federal budget. But Clinton has said they would not automatically be eligible for Medicaid or subsidies. Trump has gotten so much wrong here, we rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3878d3cf-2365-43a5-895f-219cac443911	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-02T17:07:18	2016-08-31	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
pomt-07248	Says the Obama administration approved a major disaster declaration for Oklahoma in 2009, when nine of the state’s 77 counties burned for "about three days," while Texas wildfires have been burning for longer without such a declaration.	/texas/statements/2011/may/30/todd-staples/agriculture-commissioner-todd-staples-says-obama-a/	Todd Staples, the Texas agriculture commissioner, takes issue with the Obama administration’s refusal to declare a major disaster in response to wildfires scorching parts of Texas. During a May 12 Texas Tribune interview, Staples, a Republican eyeing a run for lieutenant governor, said: "It’s just unconscionable that FEMA and this administration is denying our request for a general disaster declaration. And to put it in context, just in June of 2009, the same administration approved the type of declaration request that we’re asking, when nine counties out of the 77 in Oklahoma burned for about three days. We’ve had wildfires that have been out of control for two weeks." Asked whether the Obama administration had explained the denial, Staples said: "Well, it is what it is. It’s indifference, or it’s political posturing, who knows what the real issue is." We wondered whether the feds really responded to fires in the Sooner State with a "major disaster declaration," while spurning the Texas request for wildfires that lasted longer. A governor can trigger federal aid is by asking the president to declare a major disaster in the state. That request must show the disaster "is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the local governments and that federal assistance is necessary," according to information on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s website. An April 10, 2009, "situation update" from the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said that 10 counties had been affected by the wildfires, which had injured at least 62 people and destroyed more than 100 homes. According to an Associated Press article from the same day, Oklahoma's Democratic governor declared a state of emergency for 31 counties hit by wildfires and severe weather. On April 22, the governor requested the major disaster declaration that would "deliver individual assistance to residents and business owners" in nine counties, according to a press release from the governor’s office. Nearly 270 homes and businesses — including 228 homes — were damaged from the fires that started April 9, burning more than 100,000 acres. On June 19, 2009, President Barack Obama declared a major disaster for Oklahoma, infusing federal aid into the state’s "recovery efforts in an area struck by wildfires during the period of April 9-12, 2009," according to a FEMA press release, which Staples spokesman Bryan Black pointed us to. "Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster," according to the press release. According to a July 28, 2009, FEMA press release, disaster assistance for Oklahomans affected by wildfires exceeded $2.9 million, including $1,590,000 in housing assistance grants. A total of 260 individuals from nine counties registered for federal assistance, the press release says. What about Texas? As of May 16, according to the Texas Forest Service, 10,123 Texas fires had burned nearly 2.6 million acres in 237 counties. Since the fire season began in November, 435 homes and 1,302 additional structures have been lost. Two volunteer firefighters have died. In an April 16 letter to Obama, Gov. Rick Perry requested a "major disaster declaration" as a result of wildfires that have burned through the state. Perry’s request covered all but two of the state’s counties, including Travis. Perry sought Category B aid through FEMA’s public assistance program, making the state eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of firefighting costs already expended and to help the state fight burning fires. His request didn’t include federal aid for individuals, though some affected residents are eligible for other federal help, including low-interest loans and assistance to ranchers and farmers who lost livestock in the fires. The federal government denied Perry’s request after FEMA concluded recovery needs from wildfires did not exceed what the state and local governments could handle, according to a May 4 Fort Worth Star-Telegram article. On May 26, Perry appealed the Obama administration's decision to deny the declaration. FEMA spokeswoman Rachel Racusen told us that the administration has provided Texas with 27 fire management grants to fund many of the same emergency response activities Perry sought assistance for. The grants covered 75 percent of the firefighting costs associated with the 27 fires, which burned about 1 million acres in 31 counties, and the state expects to be reimbursed about $23 million as a result, Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor told us. From Sept. 1 through May 15, local fire departments and the state spent about $97.5 million on wildfires, she said. Of that, the state has pitched in $90.8 million. Where does that leave us? Staples correctly says that the Obama administration denied Texas’ request for a disaster declaration due to long-burning wildfires: The same administration approved a similar disaster declaration request from Oklahoma in 2009, in response to wildfires that burned for only a few days. But the statement leaves out a crucial relevant fact. FEMA has not denied federal aid for the Texas wildfires; it’s approved fire-fighting grants adding up to $23 million — far more than Oklahoma’s approximate $3 million in disaster aid. We rate Staples statement Mostly True.	None	Todd Staples	None	None	None	2011-05-30T06:00:00	2011-05-12	['Texas', 'Oklahoma', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-12095	Says Foxconn didn't keep a promise to build a plant in Pennsylvania because "Pennsylvania changed governors."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/25/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-pennsylvania-lost-foxconn-plant-/	Critics of Wisconsin’s $3 billion-for-13,000 jobs deal with Foxconn keep bringing up Pennsylvania. In 2013, the Taiwanese manufacturer promised a $30 million factory in the Harrisburg area that would employ 500 people. There were big headlines, but the factory was never built. Asked by a reporter on July 28, 2017 why Foxconn wouldn't do the same to Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker responded by saying the difference is simple: "Pennsylvania changed governors." The Republican governor has since repeated that explanation in at least three other interviews -- with Wisconsin reporters, on conservative talk radio in Milwaukee and on the Fox Business Network. "Our understanding from the company is that Pennsylvania wanted to change the deal" with Foxconn" after a new governor was elected," Walker spokesman Tom Evenson told us when we asked for information to back Walker’s statement. Pennsylvania did replace a Republican governor with a Democrat. But that election occurred a year after the factory announcement -- and in that time, virtually no progress on the factory had been reported under the GOP governor. After Foxconn made its announcement, "it was very, very quiet, then it just kind of faded away," recalled Jay Pagni, who was a spokesman for then-Republican Gov. Tom Corbett. We heard the same from Nathan Benefield, chief operating officer at the Commonwealth Foundation in Pennsylvania, which monitors government incentive packages to businesses. And we heard it from local news reporters and others. Steven Kratz, who was spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development under Corbett, told us that when Corbett left office in January 2015, the state and Foxconn were continuing to have talks about the proposed plant. But no site had been chosen and no agreement had been made on any incentives the state might offer, he said. And for its part, Foxconn has given different explanations for not building the Pennsylvania plant. In short, the explanation isn’t as simple as Walker makes it, as the following review shows. Foxconn-Pennsylvania timeline Nov. 2013 Announcement: Foxconn and Corbett announce Foxconn plans to invest $30 million in a factory that would employ up to 500. Jan. 2014 Initial plans: Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development spokesman says he expects Foxconn to do aggressive site search, starting in January 2014. Feb. 2014 Questions arise: Weeks later, news reports say only that Foxconn might invest in Pennsylvania; and that there was intense competition among states for a Foxconn plant. Nov. 2014 Change in governors: Businessman Tom Wolf, a Democrat, defeats Corbett to win election as governor. Wolf takes office in January 2015. Jan. 2017 Sites had been scouted: Reflecting on the 2013 announcement, a Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development spokeswoman in the Wolf administration says department officials had met with Foxconn representatives on various occasions after the 2013 announcement and showed them potential locations for the planned site, but the project didn’t materialize. (The department confirmed to us it worked with Foxconn under both the Corbett and Wolf administrations.) Mar. 2017 Foxconn takes responsibility: The Washington Post reports that, according to a Harrisburg-area official, the project "just seemed to fade to black" after it was announced. "It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out," according to the Post. Foxconn attributes the failure to build the factory to "material changes to the business and operating climate at that time." Aug. 2017 Foxconn blames Pennsylvania: The China Post reports that Foxconn chairman Terry Gou has said the plant wasn’t built because, in the Post’s words, Pennsylvania "elected a new governor who refused to honor the deal." Foxconn did not single out either administration in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The company said it didn’t build the factory because the Pennsylvania "state government, unlike the state government in Wisconsin, was not able to present a joint investment program that would make the project economically viable." Our rating Walker says Foxconn didn't keep a promise to build a plant in Pennsylvania because "Pennsylvania changed governors." But the record indicates that by the time the Democratic administration took over, little progress had been made more than a year after Foxconn and the GOP governor announced Foxconn’s plans. It's not as though there was a deal in place that fell apart after the election. Foxconn, meanwhile, has given explanations ranging from "material changes to the business and operating climate at that time," to Pennsylvania not making an economically viable to proposal to, reportedly, blaming Pennsylvania’s change in governors. In short, Walker’s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False. 5 fact checks on Foxconn and Wisconsin's $3 billion deal See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2017-08-25T11:48:52	2017-07-28	['Pennsylvania']
pomt-00901	Says "President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control on the nation, targeting the top-selling rifle in the country ... with a ban on one of the most-used" assault rifle bullets.	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/04/paul-bedard/columnist-obama-presses-gun-control-t/	Segments of the gun-rights community are trying to block a proposed ban on certain kinds of bullets by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Paul Bedard, a columnist with the conservative Washington Examiner, recently took up the cry. "President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control on the nation," Bedard wrote Feb. 27, 2015. "Targeting the top-selling rifle in the country, the AR-15 style semi-automatic, with a ban on one of the most-used AR bullets by sportsmen and target shooters." We left phone messages and sent emails several times to Bedard and did not hear back. Our focus is whether Obama is using executive action to impose gun control through a bullet ban. There’s some information to unpack here. Where the claim comes from Though we didn’t hear back from Bedard, he’s talking about the ATF’s plan for one particular type of bullet -- a 5.56 mm "green tip." It is found in SS109 and M855 cartridges, and it’s one of the more popular types of ammunition in America, experts told us. But this February, the ATF announced a proposal to remove an exemption that allowed gun owners to use this particular kind of ammunition. The agency’s reasoning? It can pierce the sort of body armor often worn by police, and it can be fired from a handgun. The ammunition isn’t new, nor is its ability to pierce body armor. What is new is that gun manufacturers are making handguns that use a 5.56 mm "green tip." That, ATF says, violates the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1985 that aimed to ban armor piercing bullets. "The AR-based handguns and rifles utilize the same magazines and share identical receivers," the ATF wrote in an explanatory brief. "These AR-type handguns were not commercially available when the armor piercing ammunition exemption was granted in 1986. To ensure consistency, upon final implementation of the sporting purpose framework outlined above, ATF must withdraw the exemptions for 5.56 mm "green tip" ammunition, including both the SS109 and M855 cartridges." The public has until March 16 to comment on the proposal. ATF will assess those comments and then issue a final ruling. It has not said when it will decide. Nearly 240 members of Congress signed a letter to ATF opposing the change. ‘Using executive actions’ That’s the background. Now how does that jibe with Bedard’s claim? Bedard called this an executive action by the president. That is a stretch of the common reading of the phrase. Yes, ATF is part of the executive branch, but there’s no evidence this was a decision made by Obama (compared to, say, Obama’s executive action on immigration.) ATF said the proposal came after it received 30 requests for exemptions to permit this sort of bullet in handguns between 2011 and today. Until then, the agency said it had received few such requests. ATF spokeswoman Janice Kemp told PunditFact "this started with us." When this issue came up in a daily White House press briefing, press secretary Josh Earnest said this was an ATF process that was open to public comment. (The comment period ends on March 16.) However, he said the administration supports the proposal as a "common sense" step. "This seems to be an area where everyone should agree that if there are armor-piercing bullets available that can fit into easily concealed weapons, that it puts our law enforcement at considerably more risk," Earnest said. ‘Impose gun control on the nation’ Bedard also said Obama’s actions "impose gun control on the nation." That claim is also a stretch of the common meaning of the phrase. The ATF says that banning this particular kind of bullet would leave gunowners with 168 other varieties of bullets to use in the same weapons. Bullets made with copper or lead remain legal under the 1986 law. Steven Howard, a Michigan attorney and firearms specialist, agrees with ATF’s basic point. "Instead of shooting this particular cartridge with the forbidden bullet, you’d still have a whole bunch of different ones that you could run through," he said. "A lot of this is fear mongering more than anything else. People are afraid that the list of banned ammo will grow." (Howard among them, he told us.) Another important point: People who already have these bullets could still use them, but they wouldn’t be able to get any more in the future. That said, removing the exemption for this type of bullet would have consequences. Sam Raheb owns Close Focus Research, a ballistics testing lab in California. Raheb said the main impact on shooters is that their ammunition might cost more. "Before this, you could get a green-point for about 40 cents a round," Raheb said. "If you had to buy a commercial hunting grade cartridge, it could cost you $1 a round." Kyle Weaver, the National Rifle Association’s executive director of operations also cited cost during a recent interview. Weaver was asked about the effect on shooter training. "This is the inexpensive ammo they train with and shoot with," Weaver said. "This is not the high-end stuff. This is what they shoot every day." And Wes Mason, manager of technical operations at another testing center, HP White Laboratory, said the proposal wouldn’t address other types of handgun ammunition that could pierce armor and would still be legal under the proposed change. "Its counterparts have the same characteristics when you’re talking about piercing body armor," Mason said. That would make the proposal ineffective in protecting police. Lastly, Bedard said the administration was targeting the rifle version of the AR-15. That is his interpretation. It is the pistol version that drew the ATF’s attention. The agency’s proposal would leave both the pistol and rifle versions untouched, although the ammunition for both would be affected if the "green tip" is banned. Our ruling Bedard said Obama was using executive action to impose gun control through a ban on certain bullets. An executive agency, the ATF, has proposed removing an exemption for a specific type of ammunition because gun manufacturers have started selling handguns that fire the rounds. That violates a 1986 federal law, the ATF says, aimed at protecting police from armor piercing bullets. Bedard’s shorthanding this as "executive action" is misleading, though Obama does support the proposal. Also, it’s worth noting that the ban would not amount to gun control per se; the ATF notes that 168 other varieties of bullets will work in the same weapons. The primary impact would be a higher price for ammunition. And while Bedard says the move targets the rifle version, it is the pistol version and the cartridges it uses that lie at the center of the ATF proposal. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give another impression. We rate it Mostly False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.

pomt-13134	Says Russ Feingold "got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/02/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-opponent-russ-feingold-got-paid-8000-l/	An Oct. 6, 2016 campaign ad from U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson delves into former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold’s finances. Feingold "got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University," the ad claims. We decided to check it out. Johnson’s campaign sent us three links as backup: -- Feingold’s 2015 personal financial disclosure form, in which he reports that he was paid $150,000 by Stanford in 2015. -- The description of the cross-listed class he taught at Stanford in the spring of 2015, "Implications of Post-1994 Conflicts in Great Lakes Region of Africa: an American Perspective." -- The description of the class he taught at Stanford in the fall of 2015, "The United States Senate as a Legal Institution." Feingold was a visiting professor at the School of Law and a distinguished lecturer at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, according to Stanford University. By our math, based on the course descriptions on Stanford’s website, there were 10 lectures in the first class and nine in the second, for a total of 19 lectures in those classes over the two terms. If you take $150,000 and divide it by 19, you get approximately $7,895 per lecture. That’s pretty close to the $8,000 mentioned. But that math ignores the work Feingold did outside of class. According to the campaign, Feingold graded term papers, prepared for each lecture and held office hours for two hours a week for both classes. He also gave lectures for the campus and was a guest lecturer in other courses, according to the campaign. Larry Kramer was the Law School’s dean at the time and said he recruited Feingold for the expertise Feingold could offer the university and its students. Feingold was a U.S. senator from 1993 to 2011, after losing the 2010 election to Johnson. He soon became the United States Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo at the State Department. Kramer said Feingold’s duties included teaching but also many other responsibilities. (Kramer gave $2,000 last year to Feingold’s campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.) He said that the university does not pay per lecture. "Of course we don't pay that way," he said. "Nobody gets paid that way at the university. We don’t even think about it that way." Stanford wouldn’t comment on its compensation programs, including whether pay is at all tied to the number of classes or lectures taught. However, Brad Hayward, senior director of strategic communications at the university, confirmed that Feingold had responsibilities outside of the lectures. "The responsibilities of teaching at Stanford do involve significant work outside of in-class time," Hayward wrote in an email. "In addition to those teaching responsibilities, Mr. Feingold guest-lectured in other classes, delivered a public lecture, and was available to students and colleagues as a member of our academic community." Our rating Johnson claims Feingold "got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University." While the math may be right, or close to it, the claim implies that the number of lectures is somehow tied to pay grade and ignores the other work required outside of class. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ad0a1329-e0f2-4d66-a1df-a5b93e6ca2c4	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-11-02T09:00:00	2016-10-06	['Russ_Feingold', 'Stanford_University']
pomt-14630	"A third of the budget for the city of Ferguson (Missouri) was being reaped by civil fines."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/28/rand-paul/budgets-ferguson-mo-dont-support-rand-pauls-claim-/	How to relieve the tension between police officers and the communities they serve was a topic during the Jan. 28, 2016, Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa. The question specifically focused on Ferguson, Mo., the site of protests and riots after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown in August 2014. When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was asked to address the issue, he said, "I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem. One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death." "Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job," Paul said. We wondered whether fines actually represented a third of Ferguson's budget. The short answer: No. Ferguson's annual operating budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, lists actual revenue and expenditures for 2012, forecasted revenues and expenditures for 2013, and budgeted estimates for 2014. In 2012, revenue from "fines and public safety" was $2.2 million out of a budget of $19.5 million. That's 11 percent. That revenue was expected to go up to $2.6 million on a $25.9 million budget, or 10 percent. And for the 2014 fiscal year, Ferguson was expecting fines and public safety revenue to jump even higher, to $2.7 million in a budget of $26.4 million. That means that that line item would be bringing in, once again, 10 percent of the revenue needed to run the city. Even if you look at income from the "fines and public safety" line item and only compare it to revenue -- and not the total budget -- you don't come close to the 33 percent or so Rand is talking about. It's 13 percent for 2012, 13 percent for 2013 and 14 percent for 2014. When Paul's spokesman got back to us, she directed us to the probe of the Ferguson Police Department by the U.S. Justice Department. Released in March 2015, it reports on efforts by the city to use Municipal Court fees and fines to increase revenue, particularly on missed court appearances and missed payments. The report notes, "The court’s practices also impose unnecessary harm, overwhelmingly on African-American individuals." The Justice Department report says that for the 2015 fiscal year, the city was expecting to collect $3.09 million in fees, fines and costs, with all revenues expected to total $13.26 million. That's 23 percent of revenue from fees and fines. However, that didn't happen. The city's latest budget, submitted June 24, 2015, specifically declares, "It is not the city's policy to maximize its government finances through the use of the judicial process. Therefore, court fines are not considered a targeted revenue source that the City strives to achieve." That's reflected in the numbers. While the city said it actually collected $2.1 million for its $13.2 million budget in 2014, it was expecting to get just $1 million in fines and public safety revenue in 2015 on a $14.4 million budget. That's 16 percent and 7 percent respectively. Our ruling Paul asserted during the Republican debate that, "A third of the budget for the city of Ferguson (Mo.) was being reaped by civil fines." The evidence is clear that the city was heavily dependent on fines and fees for its revenue, and Paul's comments about the effect on residents is noted. But we found that Paul seriously overstated that reliance. It went as high as 16 percent in 2014 and was expected to drop to 7 percent the following year in reaction to public outrage. Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00731	"Rosalyn Dance voted against President Obama’s Medicaid expansion."	/virginia/statements/2015/apr/23/joe-morrissey/joe-morrissey-says-rosalyn-dance-opposed-medicaid-/	Former Del. Joe Morrissey is raising Virginia’s refusal to expand Medicaid as a key issue in his bid to unseat state Sen. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg. At the announcement of his candidacy last month, Morrissey distributed a flier that accused Dance of apostasy in representing her heavily Democratic district. At the top of Morrissey's complaint list was this: "Rosalyn Dance voted against President Obama’s Medicaid expansion." We wondered whether Morrissey was right. When he made the claim, Morrissey was planning to oppose Dance in a June 9 primary. But the district’s Democratic committee blocked him from the primary ballot, ruling that he had not gathered enough valid signatures on petitions to qualify. Morrissey, who lost a legal bid to get on the ballot, now plans to run as an independent. Dance still faces competition in the primary from state Del. Joseph Preston, D-Petersburg. She won the Senate seat in a November special election after serving nine years a state delegate. Medicaid expansion has cleaved a deep partisan rift into Virginia in recent years. Under Obamacare, the state could opt to expand eligibility for its program to about 400,000 additional low-income and disabled citizens. Uncle Sam would pay all of the expansion costs through 2016 and phase down to 90 percent after that. Democrats have strongly backed expansion and Republicans have vehemently resisted, saying Medicaid is already inefficient and predicting that the debt-burdened federal government will renege on its promised payments. The GOP has prevailed because it has controlled either both legislative chambers in recent years or the House of Delegates and the governorship. Morrissey, in his campaign flier, sought to back up his claim that Dance opposed Medicaid expansion by citing votes she cast in favor of entire state budget bills in 2013, 2014 and this year that did not include the enlargement. Let’s look at Dance’s votes in each of those years. 2013 Morrissey points to Dance’s vote on Feb. 7, 2013, backing a House budget bill that that made any expansion contingent on first reforming the state Medicaid program to weed out inefficiency. Twenty-two House Democrats voted against the proposed budget; Dance was among nine who supported it. Passing a budget is a complicated process, however. The bill -- hundreds of pages long and containing funding for all state programs -- takes different shapes and requires a number of votes as it moves through the House and Senate. When the final version of the measure passed the House all Democrats, Morrissey included, voted for it even though it didn’t expand Medicaid. Ed Reed, a spokesman for Dance’s campaign, emailed us a statement that said she voted for the 2013 budget thinking, as many Democrats did, that it put the state on a path to Medicaid expansion, because it included a provision that said expansion could take effect after a state panel signed off on reforms. 2014 There was a long battle over Medicaid expansion last year, and there’s a lot that Morrissey is leaving out. The bottom line is that in the regular session Dance voted for an initial version of the 2014-2016 budget that did not include Medicaid expansion. But she did so only after backing a failed amendment that called for the state to enact Marketplace Virginia, an alternative to traditional Medicaid expansion where low income residents would still get coverage through a private insurance network. But most importantly, Dance sponsored a McAuliffe budget alternative that called for expanding Medicaid under a two-year pilot program. She told the House in a March 25, 2014, floor speech that under the measure "400,000 Virginians could benefit from Medicaid expansion. By taking no action at all, we are doing a huge disservice to our citizens, some of the most vulnerable." Dance’s bill was defeated and she voted against the final version of the budget, which did not include Medicaid expansion. Dance also backed an unsuccessful bill by Del. Tom Rust, R-Fairfax, that would have provided another alternative to traditional Medicaid expansion that would use federal funds from Obamacare to extend coverage to the uninsured. 2015 Morrissey points to Dance’s Feb. 26 vote for an updated 2014-2016 budget without Medicaid expansion. It’s true Dance backed a budget without Medicaid expansion. But before that final vote, Dance opposed a successful Republican amendment that blocked Medicaid expansion from the budget. The day Morrissey made his charge, Dance’s campaign fired an email to reporters saying she wanted the spending plan to expand Medicaid. Even though that didn’t happen, she said she still voted for the budget because contained "well-deserved and needed pay raises for teachers and other state workers." "Budgets are overall documents that fund the government and ensure that other priorities are funded," Dance’s statement said. "Voting against a budget simply because it leaves out one priority (however significant that priority may be) also puts at risk all of those other priorities." We should note that the final budget bill passed the Senate by a 38-1 vote and sailed through the House, 95-5. Morrissey was among the handful of delegates who opposed it. Our ruling Morrissey says Dance "voted against President Obama’s Medicaid expansion." Dance, as Morrissey points out, has voted for state budgets that didn’t expand Medicaid. But that doesn’t mean she was voting against the Medicaid growth specifically. Budgets are huge documents that fund more than $44 billion in state programs a year and go through many votes. Sometimes Dance shunned protest votes against the budgets that did not expand Medicaid because, she says, she supported many other priorities in the spending plan. In 2014, however, she joined all fellow Democrats in voting against the a final budget. It’s important to note that Dance always voted in favor of expanding Medicaid when faced with specific floor votes on the issue. So Morrissey’s statement is highly misleading and we rate it Mostly False.	None	Joe Morrissey	None	None	None	2015-04-23T12:00:00	2015-03-25	['None']
pomt-04081	Virginia "spends less per student today than we did in 2008."	/virginia/statements/2013/jan/21/david-toscano/toscano-says-state-spending-student-down-2008/	House Minority Leader David Toscano called on the state government to increase funding for public schools during his Democratic response to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s State of the Commonwealth address. "We spend less per student today than we did in 2008," Toscano, D-Charlottesville, said in his Jan. 9 speech. We wondered if Toscano is right. Carmen Bingham, Toscano’s chief of staff, told us the claim was based on a Senate Finance Committee report from November that contained a graph breaking down the state’s general fund spending on schools over 10 years. The general fund is largely supported by sales and income tax dollars and mostly used to pay for education, public safety and health programs. Many Democrats in recent years have opposed Republican efforts to expand a small portion of the general fund used for transportation, saying that would strip money from public schools. The graph shows that in fiscal 2008, which ended June 30 of that year, Virginia spent $4,451 per student. During this fiscal year, the state will spend $4,286 per student from the general fund. The $165 per pupil decrease is about 3.7 percent. Adjusted for inflation, the drop is about 11.4 percent. The drop corresponds with Virginia’s fall into the national recession midway through fiscal 2008. Revenues from the sales tax and income tax plunged and have been slow to recover. The general fund fell from $17 billion in 2008 to $14.8 billion in 2010. It has climbed back and this year is expected to hit $17.1 billion. Some of the losses in revenue were temporarily patched with stimulus money from the federal government. The general funds going to education have followed a similar arc, although they have not returned to their level of five years ago. In 2008, $5.3 billion went to education. That dropped to $4.7 billion in 2011 and this year is budgeted at $5.2 billion. Meanwhile, the number of students in Virginia public schools has grown by 30,000 -- from 1.19 million in 2008 to 1.22 million this school year. The education cuts were made in state budgets that were backed by majorities of Democrats and Republicans. The cuts largely came in the way of reduced funding for support positions -- such as guidance counselors, nurses, secretaries -- and by easing some education standards that the state had taken responsibility for funding, according to the Senate Finance Committee report. We should note that the graph Toscano sent us does not give a complete picture of state funding for public education. It omits about $630 million each year of non-general state funds that are spent on schools each year, about three-quarters of which come from lottery profits. We wondered whether per-student spending is still lower than the 2008 level when the total amount of state aid for schools is considered. The answer is yes. In the 2008 school year, the state put a total $5.96 billion into education and spent an average of $5,003 per student. This school year, Virginia has budgeted $5.83 billion for schools, or an average of $4,774 per student. All told, state funding has dropped by $229 per student since -- or 4.6 percent -- since 2008. Adjusted for inflation, the decrease is about 12.2 percent.. We should note that the state pays an total about 44 percent of public education costs. Local governments pay about 49 percent, the remaining 7 percent comes from the federal government. Our ruling By any measure, the state is spending less per public school student this year than it did in 2008. We rate Toscano’s statement True.

pomt-08762	"There is already a mosque four blocks away."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/26/michael-bloomberg/mayor-michael-bloomberg-argues-against-no-mosque-z/	In the debate over the inaccurately named "Ground Zero Mosque," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been one of the strongest and most consistent political voices in favor of it. In what the AP described as an "impassioned speech" at an event on Aug. 24, 2010, marking the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Bloomberg said not allowing the proposal for a mosque two blocks from Ground Zero would be "compromising our commitment to fighting terror with freedom." And Bloomberg dismissed those who have called for a compromise solution, moving it to another location. "The question will then become how big should the no-mosque zone around the World Trade Center be," Bloomberg said. "There is already a mosque four blocks away. Should it, too, be moved?" With all the hand-wringing over the proposal for an Islamic cultural center with a mosque just two blocks away from Ground Zero, we wondered whether Bloomberg was right that there is already a mosque just four blocks away from the World Trade Center site. In short, yes. The mosque Bloomberg is referring to is Masjid Manhattan, which is located in the basement floor of a building at 20 Warren Street. And it's four blocks from the World Trade Center. Masjid Manhattan has been a fixture of the Lower Manhattan neighborhood since 1970. According to its website, hundreds gather there daily for five "Congregational Salahs" and more than 1,000 regularly attend Congregational Friday Sermons. The home page of the mosque's website currently carries the following "disclaimer": "Please be advised that we are by no means affiliated with any other organization trying to build anything new in the area of downtown Manhattan. "Since 1970, Masjid Manhattan has been a peaceful, not-for-profit organization located in the area of downtown Manhattan. Our members are City, State and Federal employees, as well as professional employees of the Financial area who come to our Masjid to perform their daily prayers. "Masjid Manhattan and its members condemn any type of terrorist acts. In particular, the attacks of 9/11 where non-Muslims as well as Muslims lost their lives. Islam always invites for peace; therefore Islam is not responsible for the actions of some ill individuals who, independently from what Islam advocates, have hatred against humanity. As Muslims and as Americans, we will never forget the beloved ones who perished that terrible day of September 11, 2001." For some perspective on the relative distances between Ground Zero, the proposed mosque and the existing Masjid Manhattan, we direct you to the Washington Post's interactive online map showing the location of all three sites. There's also a mosque 12 blocks from Ground Zero, Masjid al-Farah, where Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf has been a longtime prayer leader. Rauf is one of the principals behind the plan for the cultural center and mosque proposal at 45-51 and 49-51 Park Place, two blocks north of the northern edge of the World Trade Center site. While Masjid Manhattan is conservative and Masjid al-Farah more progressive, a New York Times profile of the two mosques notes that both are essentially one-room operations. And they share another similarity, the story notes: both "routinely turn people away for lack of space." In fact, due to the spillover from Masjid al-Farah, Rauf has been leading prayer services since 2009 in one of the buildings at the heart of the controversy. Plans for the new property are much more ambitious than the settings of the existing mosques, calling for a $100 million, 15-story community center with a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios, childcare services and a September 11 memorial. The plans also include a mosque that the site's organizers estimated could attract as many as 2,000 worshippers on Fridays, according to the Washington Post. Again, in making his argument against a "no-mosque zone around the World Trade Center," Bloomberg said there's already a mosque four blocks away from Ground Zero. He's right. We rate his statement True.	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2010-08-26T13:49:37	2010-08-24	['None']
pomt-14867	"When Chuck Schumer and Marco Rubio tried to push amnesty, it was Ted Cruz who stopped them."	/florida/statements/2015/nov/13/courageous-conservatives-pac/pac-supporting-ted-cruz-says-when-marco-rubio-trie/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s leadership role on a 2013 bill to change immigration laws continues to draw fire for him in the GOP presidential primary. The Courageous Conservatives PAC, which supports U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, has attacked Rubio’s position in a radio ad in Iowa: "We all loved how Marco Rubio took apart Jeb Bush in the debate. Wasn’t it great? But what’s Rubio ever done? Anything? Other than his Gang of Eight Amnesty bill, can anyone think of anything Marco Rubio’s ever done? Anything at all besides amnesty?" says the narrator who then switches to praise Cruz. "When Chuck Schumer and Marco Rubio tried to push amnesty, it was Ted Cruz who stopped them." We decided to research Cruz’s role in the death of Rubio’s bill, and we’ll explain the problems with labeling it as "amnesty." Both Rubio, of Florida, and Cruz, of Texas, are freshmen senators with Cuban roots who represent states with large Hispanic populations. (Rubio was elected in 2010, while Cruz was elected in 2012.) But the two disagreed over the 2013 immigration bill, and now both are running for president. We found that while Cruz was a vocal opponent of the bill, he can’t take credit for its death in the House. Immigration bills and amnesty So was the 2013 bill amnesty? As we have noted before, "amnesty" is tricky to define. When Rubio characterized the bill as "not amnesty" in 2013, we rated that claim Half True. One standard for defining amnesty in recent decades has been the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 signed by President Ronald Reagan. That law said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by 1982, and met other minimal requirements such as paying a $185 fine and back taxes and demonstrating "good moral character." The law was widely described as amnesty, both at the time and later. But the 2013 bill had far tougher requirements than the 1986 bill, which is why it’s not a convincing case that it is amnesty, although it has elements of it. In 2013, Rubio and seven other senators dubbed the Gang of Eight crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The bill required more border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status -- and that path had significant hurdles, including paying fines, undergoing background checks and waiting periods. If they met that criteria, they could seek "registered provisional immigrant status," and after 10 years, they could seek a green card. House leadership refused to bring the bill to a vote, and it died. (Rubio still supports changing immigration laws but now calls for a piecemeal approach.) What was Cruz’s role in the immigration bill? We reached out to the pro-Cruz PAC to ask for the back-up to their ad. The super PAC was formed in September and over two weeks that month raised $5,000 from a single donor -- Christopher Ekstrom, a self-employed investor in Dallas. The PAC has now raised a total of around $30,000, said Rick Shaftan, a consultant to the PAC told PolitiFact. (He also bashed another pro-Cruz super PAC for ads he described as "boring crap.") In a Facebook message Shaftan said the ad was based on Cruz's comments in an Oct. 29, 2015, interview with Bret Baier, chief political anchor for Fox News. "I led the fight against Obama’s amnesty, against the Gang of Eight bill, which was championed by Barack Obama, by Chuck Schumer, and Marco Rubio," Cruz said, referring to the New York Democratic Senator who was part of the Gang of Eight along with Rubio. "And I led the fight, standing side by side with (Alabama Sen.) Jeff Sessions, and we defeated it in Congress. Amnesty did not pass." (Obama’s amnesty refers to the plan Obama unveiled at the end of 2014 to prevent deportations for millions of people.) We also reached out to spokespersons for Cruz’s Senate office and presidential campaign office, as well as for Rubio’s campaign, and did not get a response. We found that Cruz spoke out against the bill often in press releases, on the Senate floor, before the Senate judiciary committee on which he serves and in media interviews. He proposed amendments to triple border security, among other changes. The bill passed the Senate 68-32 on June 27, 2013, with 52 Democratic votes, 14 Republican votes and two independents. Cruz voted against it. Cruz continued to criticize the bill after the Senate vote -- but so did other lawmakers, including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. In November 2013, Speaker of the House John Boehner said that the House would not hold talks with the Senate on the bill and preferred a piecemeal approach signaling the death of the bill for the year -- and as it turned out, beyond that, too. In 2014, Politico wrote a post-mortem explaining why immigration reform died, noting that House and Senate staffers for lawmakers opposed to the bill met together to strategize. "Sessions and Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) were the most active senators, while Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) played supporting roles," the article stated. But even without the Senate agitators, there were conservatives in the House who were also vocal about opposing the bill. Because of that opposition, the bill never came up for a vote. Our ruling A super PAC supporting Cruz said in a radio ad, "When Chuck Schumer and Marco Rubio tried to push amnesty, it was Ted Cruz who stopped them." Whether you consider the bill "amnesty" or not -- and there are arguments that it is not -- Cruz was one of 32 senators who voted against the bill. The bill actually passed in the Senate. Cruz did speak against the bill leading up to the Senate vote and after, but we found no evidence that he should get credit for stopping the bill from reaching a vote in the House. During the summer of 2013, Cruz was one of many voices in the Senate opposed to the bill. It was House Republicans who blocked the bill, and they were already calling for its defeat. So Cruz was one voice against the bill out of many, and it's not at all clear that his voice was a decisive one. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-15354	Says Jeb Bush "doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does."	/florida/statements/2015/jul/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-jeb-bush-no-longer-supports-p/	In a rare national interview with CNN, Hillary Clinton took aim at Donald Trump’s comments bashing illegal Mexican immigrants and former Gov. Jeb Bush’s stance on pathway to citizenship. "I feel very bad and very disappointed with (Trump) and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying, 'Enough. Stop it,' " Clinton said July 7. "But they are all in the same general area on immigration: They don't want to provide a path to citizenship. They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants." CNN’s Brianna Keilar then asked: "But what about Jeb Bush's approach to that?" Clinton replied: "He doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does. As I said, they're on a spectrum of hostility, which I think is really regrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours." Does Bush no longer believe in a path to citizenship? Jeb’s long history on immigration reform Bush has flip-flopped extensively on the question of a path for citizenship during his long political career. In his 2013 book Immigration Wars, Bush and co-author Clint Bolick wrote that permanent residency "should not lead to citizenship. It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences — in this case, that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship." But in the wake of the book’s release, Bush backtracked. He supported the Senate bill that included a path to citizenship, telling ABC that people entering the country legally "should be easier with less cost than coming to the country illegally. And if you can create a system like that — as is being discussed in the Senate and in the House — through a path to citizenship, that’s fine." When we contacted the Bush campaign, the staff referred us to his statement in March in New Hampshire: "The book I wrote is a pathway to legal status. And we created a conservative alternative to the dead end conversation as to what was going on in Washington, D.C. Now if you could get a consensus done, where you could have a bill done, and it was 15 years as the Senate ‘Gang of Eight’ did, I’d be supportive of that. But the position I have, the view that I have, the one I’ve expressed and the one I continue to express is the one that a path to legal status is more than enough to allow people to come out from the shadows and that’s what they want." That statement suggests Bush would support a path to citizenship if it were politically viable, but since it’s not, he’s in favor of a path to legal status. On the campaign trail, Bush has said he’s not suggesting a path to citizenship. While "citizenship" and "legal status" may sound similar, they are not identical. Immigrants who have green cards are allowed to legally stay in the country, while citizenship brings it with it certain extra rights, including the right to vote. Under current immigration laws, once greencard holders wait five years, they can apply for citizenship. A path to only legal status would have to be created, immigration experts told us. "You could have a program for legal status -- permanent status -- without a path to citizenship," said Marc Rosenblum, a deputy director at the Migration Policy Institute, noting that such a proposal in 2006 for a blue card failed. "It doesn’t exist in current law." In a May 11 interview, Fox News’ Megyn Kelly asked Bush directly if he supported a path to citizenship. Bush replied: "No, I’ve said as long as there — if that was the way to get to a deal where we turned immigration into a catalyst for high-sustained economic growth, where we did all the things we need to do in border security, where we narrow the number of people coming through family petition and dramatically expanded a like-kind number for economic purposes, which will help us grow and help the median rise up, in return for that as a compromise, sure. But the plan in the book, and the plan that I’ve suggested when I go out and speak, which is almost every day on this subject, I’m talking about a path to legalized status." He repeated those comments in a June 16 interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. One final note: In a June 17 interview with David Muir of ABC News, Bush said he would support a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States as children, often called Dreamers, because proposed legislation that would give them legal status followed by a path to citizenship is known as the DREAM Act. "DREAM Act kids (are) kids that are here because their parents came, they had no control over it," Bush said."There ought to be some recognition that we're not going to send them back to a country they know nothing about." Our ruling Clinton said that Bush "doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does." At times, Bush has supported a path to citizenship, and at other times he hasn’t. He has said he might support a path to citizenship if it could make it through the political process. But in recent interviews Bush has emphasized a path to legalized status instead of citizenship. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09565	The president's health care proposals will cause "most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/nancy-pfotenhauer/health-care-reform-does-not-increase-premiums-and-/	In an interesting display of chutzpah from a television pundit, Republican strategist Nancy Pfotenhauer claimed on CNN that she understood perfectly the president's health care proposals, then proceeded to distort them. "You've got an extremely talented man here who's a great orator," she said after President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. "I don't think anybody could challenge that. But if there's a sin, it's hubris, and at one point, when he was talking about health care, he literally said, you know, hey, you're not with me, but that's okay. I understand. I just didn't speak clearly enough to you. Like if I slow down and talk in smaller words, maybe you'll get it." "And so the response is, no, no, you explained it, I heard it and I disagreed with you," she added. "You're talking about a proposal that increases taxes by half a trillion dollars, that cuts Medicare by half a trillion dollars, that causes most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people to lose their current insurance coverage. This is not something that's good." (That didn't get challenged by host Larry King, who then went to a commercial.) Pfotenhauer boiled down some complicated issues we've been reporting on for quite a while into a zinger of a soundbite. A bit of what she said was true, but most of this is a significant distortion of Obama's reforms. Here, we're going to rule on the most dramatic part of her claim, that the plans cause "most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage." We contacted Pfotenhauer, who served as an adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, and asked what the basis of her claims were. But we didn't hear back. We've written before about the Democratic proposals to increase taxes to pay for expanded health care coverage. The House bill increases income taxes on the wealthy, and the Senate bill has an excise tax for high-cost health care plans, or "Cadillac" plans. Add up those taxes, plus other revenue provisions in the form of fees, and those revenues do approach $500 billion over 10 years. On Medicare spending, both bills seek to curb spending on Medicare by trimming excess payments to private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program, as well as other freezes on payments intended to reduce waste. (Check out this comparison on the details on Medicare created by the independent Kaiser Family Foundation. You'll find details on Medicare changes on Page 14.) Those provisions too approach $500 billion over 10 years. But the measure also includes more funding for Medicare's prescription drug plan. Then Pfotenhauer said most Americans would "have their premiums increased, not decreased," and that "hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage." On Nov. 30, 2009, the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, released a detailed analysis on how health insurance premiums might be affected by the Senate Democrats' health care bill. The CBO is an independent agency whose estimates for pending legislation are considered nonpartisan and rigorous. The CBO reported that, for most people, premiums would stay about the same, or slightly decrease. This was especially true for people who get their insurance through work. (Health policy wonks call these the large group and small group markets.) People who have to go out and buy insurance on their own (the individual market) would see rates increase by 10 to 13 percent. But more than half of those people -- 57 percent, in fact -- would be eligible for subsidies to help them pay for the insurance. People who get subsidies would see their premiums drop by more than half, according to the CBO. So most people would see their premiums stay the same or potentially drop. As for "hundreds of millions of people" losing their coverage, there is little evidence to support this. Republicans have been making the claim based on a study by the Lewin Group, which stated that 123 million people would choose a public option for health insurance if it were cheaper than their current coverage. (The Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, whose primary business is private health insurance.) There were other problems with how Republicans have used the Lewin study to claim that people would be pushed out of their coverage, and you can read more about those problems in another item we reported back in October. But it's not necessary to go into those details because the Senate has since rejected a public option. So it's not clear where Pfotenhauer is getting her numbers now. Certainly there will be some churn among plans, just as there is now, when companies change insurance plans. (For this reason, we gave Obama a Half True for saying that people could keep their current coverage. Under the plan, employers would still be able to choose new plans.) But the CBO has found that the numbers of uninsured will be lower under the Democratic plans. The Senate Democrats plan would increase the percentage of the insured from 83 percent to 94 percent. So we don't see how millions of people would lose their current coverage. It's true that there is a lot of confusion among the public about the health care proposals. The independent Kaiser Family Foundation recently conducted a poll and found that "even after a year of substantial media coverage of the health reform debate, many Americans remain unfamiliar with key elements of the major bills passed by the House and Senate." The poll also found tremendous differences based on political affiliations: Democrats supported the proposals, Republicans opposed them, and independents were roughly split. In Pfotenhauer's appearance on CNN, though, she said she understood the proposals but disagreed with them. Then she said -- and this was not phrased as an opinion -- that the plans will cause "most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people to lose their current insurance coverage." There's not an independent, nonpartisan analysis out there on the current Democratic proposals that shows that. These are Republican talking points that have repeatedly been proven false, but they keep coming back. Pfotenhauer's statement is not just false, it's ridiculously so. Pants on Fire!

pomt-05702	A socially conservative group sponsored a "prayer vigil" to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies because it thinks the Girl Scouts are affiliated with Planned Parenthood.	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/09/hank-johnson/congressman-conservative-group-prayed-against-girl/	Mom and apple pie, move over. Nowadays, U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson is fighting for Brownies and Girl Scout cookies. Johnson serves on the House Judiciary Committee, which held a hearing Feb. 28 on whether insurance companies should be required to cover contraception as parts of the health care overhaul go into effect. Johnson appeared with a box of Thin Mints and a passel of questions for Jeanne Monahan, an official with the socially conservative Family Research Council. She was testifying against the requirement. "Your organization, ma'am, sponsored a ‘prayer in’ -- a prayer vigil -- to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies because you allege Girl Scout cookies is affiliated with Planned Parenthood. Isn’t that correct?" Johnson asked. "Sir, I am not aware of any prayer vigil that my organization has organized for to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies," Monahan replied. A prayer vigil against buying Girl Scout cookies? We had to find out more. We contacted Johnson spokesman Andrew Phelan, who sent us links to stories from left-leaning websites about the Family Research Council. He also sent us a link to a posting on the FRC’s website that displayed the text of an email sent out by the organization’s Prayer Team. Every week, this email asks readers to say prayers on public policy issues. The FRC Prayer Team’s email Feb. 8 asked that they pray against the health care overhaul’s contraception coverage requirements, the U.S. military’s treatment of religion and Planned Parenthood. It mentioned Girl Scout cookie sales. "Girl Scouts, whose leadership has been collaborating with Planned Parenthood for years, have found out that their cookie sales are suffering. This is very sensitive for the Scouts," it said. "The Scouts had better confess their errors and make a clean break while they can." (This item does not address whether the Girl Scouts have been "collaborating" with Planned Parenthood.) The email suggested a prayer: "May Congress expose and defund Planned Parenthood and may private organizations refuse to submit to shakedowns by Planned Parenthood and others in the abortion advocacy industry. May the Pro-life Majority grow in America until abortion has been abolished." This prayer does not target the Girl Scouts by name -- just "private organizations." But the email does single out the Scouts and mentions no other private organizations. The Family Research Council’s leaders have repeatedly warned the group’s supporters that Girl Scout cookie profits go to an organization that they think is on the wrong side of the family values debate. In op-eds "Say no to Girl Scout Cookies" and "Planned Parenthood, Girl Scout cookie monster," Cathy Cleaver Ruse, a senior fellow with the Family Research Council, blasted the Scouts for what she described as working in partnership with Planned Parenthood and deciding to admit a transgendered boy into a Colorado troop. FRC President Tony Perkins said that "when they’re not partnering with Planned Parenthood, they’re promoting sexual diversity." But FRC spokesman J.P. Duffy told PolitiFact Georgia that the group has "neither held nor called for a ‘prayer vigil’." We found no evidence that one took place. And the FRC knows how to call for a prayer vigil. Last year, it held one against Planned Parenthood and sex trafficking, which it said are connected. (We’re not going to address that claim in this item, either.) Our ruling: Johnson said the Family Research Council sponsored a "prayer vigil" to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies because the group’s members think that Girl Scouts are affiliated with Planned Parenthood. We can say that an op-ed on the FRC website asks consumers to say no to Do-Si-Dos. It’s also fair to say that the FRC prayer team singled out the Girl Scouts in one of its prayers. But the FRC did not call for an actual prayer vigil. And while the FRC came close to asking people to pray that consumers stop buying Thin Mints, it stopped just shy of doing so. We give Johnson a Mostly False.	None	Hank Johnson	None	None	None	2012-03-09T06:00:00	2012-02-28	['Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA', 'Planned_Parenthood']
pomt-14340	"Bernie Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-was-roll-call-amendment-king-1995-2/	Bernie Sanders is often criticized for "pie-in-the-sky" proposals and impractical ideals, but his campaign argues the Vermont senator actually gets things done. "Bernie Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member," according to a TV ad paid for by the Sanders campaign. A version of this ad appears on Sanders’ YouTube channel, and Sanders has made this claim on Twitter and Facebook as well so we wondered if it was true. The Sanders campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found that this carefully worded statement is accurate for his earlier years in Congress. The ‘amendment king’ Sanders served in the House of Representatives from 1991 to 2006 and has been in the Senate since then. Republicans were in control of the House from 1995 to 2007 and of the Senate from 2015 to present. In 2005, Rolling Stone named Sanders the "amendment king" of the House. At the time, the title held true with a specific qualification: amendments agreed to by record votes. (Amendments can also be passed with voice votes, in which the volume of yeas and nays dictates passage, or by unanimous consent, in which no one raises an objection.) Out of 419 amendments Sanders sponsored over his 25 years in Congress, 90 passed, 21 of them by roll call votes. Here’s a breakdown (bold indicates Republican Congresses): Total amendments passed Passed by roll call vote 2015 to present 4 1 2007 to 2015 37 3 1995 to 2007 49 17 1991 to 1995 0 0 Total 90 21 From 1995 to 2007, Sanders passed 17 amendments by a recorded roll call vote — more than any other member in the House. Ohio Democrat James Traficant came in second with 16 roll call amendments, but he served five less years than Sanders after being indicted on several corruption charges in 2002 and then expelled from Congress. If we look at all amendments, not just those passed by roll call votes, Traficant passed 72 more than Sanders. New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, who served in the same time period as Sanders, finished third with 14 roll call amendments (and 32 overall amendments). Craig Volden, an expert on the legislative process at the University of Virginia, told PolitiFact that records like these are rather unusual in the House. "There are so few members with large numbers of substantive and successful amendments," he said. "Sanders and Traficant were exceptions to that rule." In comparison, Hillary Clinton passed zero roll call amendments during her tenure as a senator from New York from 2001-09. Overall effectiveness In the current Congress, Sanders ranks fourth when it comes to the number of career roll call amendments passed, according GovTrack founder, Josh Tauberer. The three lawmakers who top him are Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., with 27 in 15 years in Congress; Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., with 24 in 33 years; and Rep Steve King, R-Iowa, with 22 in 13 years. Roll call amendments aside, Sanders isn’t shattering any legislative records, though he’s not doing poorly either. Tauberer’s research places Sanders at No. 14 in Congress with 90 amendments. The other senator from Vermont, Democrat Patrick Leahy, on the other hand, has passed 226. Of course, amendments are just one of the ways lawmakers press their agendas. Sanders has had much less luck with passing bills. During his 25 years in Congress, Sanders introduced 324 bills, three of which became law. This includes a bill in a Republican Congress naming a post office in Vermont and two more while Democrats had control (one naming another Vermont post office and another increasing veterans’ disability compensation). Clinton, for the record, also passed three bills in eight years. But the sparse number of bills isn’t surprising. Volden and Vanderbilt University’s Alan Wiseman assess the legislative effectiveness of House members by comparing their records to a benchmark. According to this analysis, Sanders has either met or exceeded expectations during his tenure in the House (bold indicates Republican Congresses): Congress Grade Benchmark score Effectiveness score 1991-1992 Meets expectations 0.422 0.335 1993-1994 Meets expectations 0.411 0.219 1995-1996 Exceeds expectations 0.199 0.463 1997-1998 Exceeds expectations 0.258 0.347 1999-2000 Meets expectations 0.397 0.231 2001-2002 Meets expectations 0.439 0.343 2003-2004 Meets expectations 0.493 0.266 2005-2006 Meets expectations 0.514 0.379 Lawmakers who belong to the party in control are five times more likely to have their bills go anywhere than minority party members, according to Volden. So Sanders’ legislative approach may seem like fixating on small potatoes, but for an independent who caucuses with the minority party, it’s a smart strategy. "He could have either resigned himself to that fate, changed the nature of his legislation and coalition-building strategy, or offered amendments on the floor," Volden said. "He chose the third of these paths, making him more influential in shaping policy than if he had taken the first path. Why he did not take the second path is an open question — likely linked to his ideological views." Our ruling A campaign ad for Sander said, "Bernie Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member." That’s a very specific way of slicing and dicing Sanders’ effectiveness as a lawmaker, but it’s accurate.

pomt-14835	While Americans pray for Paris, the government has acted on mandatory national vaccinations.	/georgia/statements/2015/nov/20/viral-image/paris-vaccination-meme-base-fact/	Shots for everyone! Now that’s the kind of sentiment PolitiFact Georgia could get behind. Then we opened the email with that subject line and saw our alert reader meant vaccinations, not Fireball. The question was about a meme that appeared on Facebook and other social media sites in the wake of the terrorist attack in Paris. The wording, over the image of a syringe with a skull inside and the words National Mandatory Vaccinations stamped on top, was awkwardly clear: "While Americans pray for Paris, France, their government sent HR (House Resolution) 2232 to Congress," it read. The implication, of course, is that politicians took advantage of an international tragedy to quickly enact controversial legislation (all with a complicit press). Thank goodness for Internet memes, right? The facts Wrong. To be clear, HR 2232 exists. U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, introduced the Vaccinate All Children Act of 2015 on May 1. Her proposal would restrict the federal government from awarding preventive health service grants to state-level entities unless that state required all public schoolchildren be vaccinated. Exemptions are in place, only for medical reasons. While in theory that means it would remain a state decision to enact vaccination rules for public schools, the federal government’s deep pockets have historically brought states in line. The most famous example was the Reagan administration’s decision in 1984 to use of the Highway Trust Fund to get states to raise the drinking age to 21. States that didn’t comply with the new national standard would see 10 percent of their federal highway funds cut. Eventually, every state agreed – and ensured that what amounted to several million dollars in some places would continue to flow. So while the proposal does not officially make vaccinations mandatory, that would likely be the end result if it were passed into law. Except for one major flaw with the meme. There was no movement on the bill since the massacre in Paris. In fact, there hasn’t been any action on the proposal since the GOP-controlled House assigned it to a subcommittee a week after Wilson introduced it. And there likely won’t be. "It’s a Democratic bill, and it doesn’t look like a coordinated move by the Democrats," said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. "This looks like a lone wolf type bill. It hasn’t moved because it’s not going to." The conspiracy So then why the meme? Several discredited claims about vaccines – most notably the thoroughly debunked link between the shots and autism – reared up again after a measles outbreak traced to Disneyland in California sickened 147 people in the United States. The theme park outbreak – and the first reported American death from measles in 12 years – led to a new law in California that revoked "personal belief" exemptions and required all children in public schools without medical reasons to be immunized. "While I absolutely understand the freedom to say no to healthcare, I don’t think it’s a freedom to extend when it’s to protect your child or to you put others at risk with your choice," said Arthur Caplan, the director of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. "It’s not a bad idea to consider this on a national level." Pushback and skepticism, though, has been fierce, from everyone from Hollywood celebrities who long objected to immunizations to the two physicians running for the Republican presidential nomination. The anti-vaccination movement is one place where the left and right converge and from that, can move onto greater conspiracies, said Mark Fenster, University of Florida law professor who studies conspiracy theories. The Paris attacks, then, are a "false flag," an operation designed by conspiring forces – this time the media, government and pharmaceutical companies – to distract Americans from the goal of dangerous immunizations. A similar "false flag" theory is touted by some in connection with the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. There, the conspiracy goes, the government staged a horrible massacre in a bid to take citizens’ guns. "The anti-vaccine movement is obsessed with their fear of vaccines, and they view any government effort to require their use as a threat," Fenster said. "Vaccines may have nothing to do with Paris, but the movement views it as a way to ram through this law while no one is watching," he added. Our ruling A meme making the rounds on social media takes a different tack on the Paris terrorist attacks. It claims the tragedy has been a distraction to government efforts to mandate vaccinations for all public schoolchildren. There is a proposal for a similar law, but there has been no movement on the proposal since a week after it was introduced last spring. That’s the last bit of truth to the meme. The rest of the message and implication border on the ludicrous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2015-11-20T00:00:00	2015-11-17	['United_States', 'Paris']
pomt-09366	On oil drilling	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/31/barack-obama/once-wobbly-obama-not-inconsistent-latest-oil-dril/	President Barack Obama is back to doing his shake and shimmy on the offshore drilling issue. On March 31, 2010, he announced that he'd be opening up new coastal areas to oil production. "And in the short term, as we transition to cleaner energy sources, we’ll have to make tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development in ways that protect communities and coastlines," he said in his announcement at Andrews Air Force Base. "This is not a decision that I’ve made lightly... But the bottom line is this: given our energy needs, in order to sustain economic growth, produce jobs, and keep our businesses competitive, we’re going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable, homegrown energy." In 2008, we gave him a Half Flip because early in his campaign he said he intended to maintain the long-standing moratorium barring drilling off the Florida coast, telling oil companies to drill on the land they already had leased. Then, amid soaring gas prices in the summer of 2008, he shifted and announced he was receptive to a plan for opening new areas for drilling. On Aug. 1, 2008, Obama said he would compromise and support the New Energy Reform Act of 2008, a bipartisan bill that, in addition to spending $84 billion on the development of better batteries and energy-and-fuel saving technologies, would have allowed for drilling for oil and natural gas as close as 50 miles from Florida's west coast. "Like all compromises, it also includes steps that I haven't always supported," Obama said in his announcement. "I remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short-term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long-term, though I do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact. But I've always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis, and today's package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning." By the time he won the race for the White House, Obama was squarely behind some new efforts to produce more oil domestically. Before Obama took office, former President George W. Bush lifted that ban on new oil and gas leases and ordered a five-year plan for awarding new leases. After Obama took office, Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar extended the public comment period on those proposals. And that brings us to Obama's most recent announcement, which would open even more areas for drilling -- including some originally proposed under the Bush administration. We wondered whether Obama had shifted even further since he took office. His strategy calls for developing oil and gas resources in new areas, including in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and increasing exploration in parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. Other areas, such as the environmentally vulnerable Bristol Bay in Alaska, would remain protected. At the same time, Obama also announced new efforts to green the federal fleet of vehicles and the upcoming finalization of a new rule establishing greenhouse gas emission reductions for some vehicles. Defenders of Wildlife, a national environmental group, pointed out that Obama's plan may reverse a 2006 effort to protect waters near Florida through 2022 that Obama had voted for as a senator. But again, our benchmark for this analysis is where Obama stood on the issue back in the summer of 2008, when we last visited the issue. We asked a number of environmental groups if they thought the announcement represented a dramatic shift for the Obama administration, and the resounding response is that they oppose the plan, but it's also no surprise given where Obama was on the issue the day he was elected to office. Josh Dorner, a spokesman for Sierra Club, said that it "doesn't seem to be a huge step away from where he ended up at the end of the campaign. We're disappointed, but we're not surprised." Adam Rivera, an advocate for Environment Florida, said it's a dramatic change from where Obama started out when he was first running for office, but "it isn't necessarily that surprising given the rhetoric on the campaign." And Enid Sisskin, a representative for Gulf Coast Environmental Defense, agreed that she was not surprised, although she thought it was a "terrible, stupid idea." So, has Obama gone from a Half Flip to a Full Flop on the issue of offshore drilling? Not if you're basing the ruling on his position on Election Day. Back in August 2008, he did clearly change his stance on the issue. This time, according to all the environmental advocates and experts we spoke with, his latest announcement isn't much of a departure from his rhetoric during the last part of the campaign and during his first year in the White House. As a result, we say there's been No Flip in Obama's latest stance on offshore drilling.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-03-31T15:17:38	2010-03-31	['None']
pomt-04130	There is "over 20 times more energy" in a proposed Southside uranium mining site than "there is in all the oil that’s estimated to be off Virginia’s coast"	/virginia/statements/2013/jan/07/patrick-wales/wales-says-virginias-uranium-deposits-far-exceed-i/	The General Assembly will consider a bill this winter that would end the state’s 31-year ban on uranium mining. If approved, the state will begin drafting regulations that will allow Virginia Uranium Inc. to develop a mining and milling operation on a 3,000-acre site in Pittsylvania County. Opponents say the operation poses long-term threats to the environment and the sources of drinking water for many, including those in Virginia Beach, the state’s largest city. Patrick Wales, project manager for Virginia Uranium, expressed confidence during a Dec. 6 symposium that the operation would be safe. He spoke enthusiastically about the project’s potential to provide jobs. And he said the abundance of uranium would produce a domestic energy source that far outstrips the oil reserves Virginia hopes to tap off its Atlantic coast. There’s "over 20 times more energy in this property than there is in all the oil that’s estimated to be off Virginia’s coast," Wales said. That’s a big claim, so we decided to check Wales’ math. Wales said the mining and milling would result in 119 million pounds of U308, or uranium oxide, which is the product his company will sell to electric utilities. The estimate comes from a 2008 study of the project that was commissioned by Virginia Uranium and conducted by Behre Dolbear Group Inc., Chicago, a mining engineering company.. No independent assessment of the uranium oxide yield exists. The 119 million pound estimate was cited and not questioned in a study of the risks of the mining enterprise conducted last year by the National Academy of Science. As for oil reserves, Wales turned to estimates made by the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy when a section off the coast of Virginia was considered for a lease sale in 2008 and 2009. It was estimated that 165 million barrels of oil could be pumped from the beds. President Barack Obama eventually canceled the lease sale. The federal government, the governor and Sen. Mark Warner and Sen. Jim Webb used a slightly smaller figure in 2009 and 2010 -- 130 million barrels. Estimates of the oil resources are wide-ranging. As we reported in an earlier offshore drilling claim, the surveys of the seabed off the coast are 40 to 50 years old, so all estimates are speculative. Let’s look at the conversion from uranium and oil to the common measure for energy, the British thermal unit or Btu. A pound of uranium oxide contains the energy equivalent of 31 barrels of fuel oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Under those conversions, the 119 million pounds of uranium oxide would produce as much energy as 3.7 billion barrels of oil. That dwarfs the 130 million to 165 million barrels expected to come from offshore drilling. When we divide 3.7 billion by 165 million, we get 22.4 -- or the factor of how much more energy would come from the uranium than the estimated offshore oil. Wales said his company has received a more recent, and higher, estimate of the project’s output from engineering firms Lyntek Inc., Lakewood, Colo., and BRS Engineering, Riverton, Wyo., at about 133 million pounds, but like the oil reserves, this wouldn’t greatly affect Wales’ statement. Our ruling Wales, in advocating the need and potential of a uranium mine in Southwest Virginia, called attention to its energy-production possibilities. He said the mine will yield enough uranium oxide to produce more than 20 times the power that would come from oil the state hopes to tap off Virginia’s shore. The math works out for Wales with room to spare. We caution that the claim is dependent both on an estimate from the uranium project developer’s consultant and the wide-ranging, unproven estimates of oil off Virginia’s coast. Wales’ statement is based on the best available information and, as such, we rate it True.	None	Patrick Wales	None	None	None	2013-01-07T06:00:00	2012-12-06	['None']
pomt-04053	A Republican-sponsored Wisconsin mining bill "will take at least seven years to create jobs."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/27/chris-larson/wisconsin-bill-speed-mine-approval-wont-create-job/	Thousands of jobs are the promise of a four-mile-long iron ore mine proposed for far northern Wisconsin, which would be the first such operation in the Badger State in more than 15 years. But how quickly would the mother lode of jobs come? State Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, sees a lengthy wait, even if the Legislature adopts a Republican bill to speed part of the process of approving the mine. On Jan. 15, 2013, Larson gave a Democratic response to GOP Gov. Scott Walker’s state of the state address, which also dangled the prospect of several thousand jobs connected to the mine. "Tonight, we should be honest with the people of Wisconsin," Larson said. "You just heard calls for bipartisanship from our governor. But the policies he proposed were not bipartisan. Funding an unproven, unaccountable gamble with our children’s future is not bipartisan. "Forcing through an extreme mining bill that will take at least seven years to create jobs is not bipartisan." Is Larson right about how long it would take? Digging into history Mining in northern Wisconsin dates to 4,000 B.C., when Native Americans extracted copper along the shores of Lake Superior. By the 19th century, iron in Iron County, where part of the new mine would be located, had created prodigious prosperity. "Hundreds of people are arriving daily from all parts of the country and millionaires are being made by the score," gushed an 1886 article in the Chicago Tribune. Over time, the industry fell off. The state’s last operating mine, which held gold and copper near Ladysmith in northwestern Wisconsin, shut down in 1997. But talk of new boom times returned in November 2010. That was when Gogebic Taconite said it wanted to invest $1.5 billion to develop an open-pit iron ore mine in Iron and Ashland counties, some 300 miles northwest of Milwaukee. (Gogebic refers to the iron-bearing region of northern Wisconsin and northwestern Michigan; taconite is low-grade iron ore.) The company is a subsidiary of the Cline Group, a privately owned coal-mining company headed by college dropout and Florida billionaire Christopher Cline, whose yacht is named Mine Games. The economic impact of such an investment could be big -- once the mine is up and running. An April 2011 study by an economic consultant hired by Gogebic Taconite estimated that once operating, the mine would create 2,834 long-term jobs, including 700 direct mining jobs -- with the direct jobs averaging nearly $83,000 per year in salary and benefits. Two months later, we rated Mostly True a statement from Wisconsin’s largest business organization that the mine could operate for 100 years and generate billions of dollars of economic activity. There was a big hitch, however: Gogebic Taconite said it needed new regulations to provide more certainty in seeking a state permit. Republicans controlled the Legislature. But a GOP-sponsored bill to ease the state part of the state-federal permit process failed on a 17-16 vote in the Senate in March 2012. Gogebic said it was abandoning its plans. On the day after the Walker and Larson speeches, Republicans introduced a new bill, similar to the previous one. It reignited job creation claims and warnings, including some made by Native Americans near the site, about threats to water and land. Hundreds of people and extra security were on hand at the state Capitol for a Jan. 23, 2013, hearing on the bill. How long for jobs? We asked Larson spokeswoman Gillian Morris for evidence that it would take at least seven years under the bill for jobs to be created. She cited three things: -- A January 2013 letter from the the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which says the GOP bill might require the corps to do an environmental analysis separate from one done by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. That could add time to the corps’ review process, which "generally takes from two to four years or more," according to a corps timeline. -- Comments by Tim Sullivan, then-chairman of the Wisconsin Mining Association, who told state lawmakers in November 2012 it would take years to construct a mine. "We're not talking a year or two years. You're talking five, six years out, potentially even further, depending on how the permit process goes," he said. -- Likely delays caused by litigation. Indeed, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, called a lawsuit "inevitable," but Larson didn’t cite any time frame on litigation delays. We’ll also note that Gogebic Taconite itself, when first announcing its plans, said the regulatory process alone could span five to seven years. So, there are indications the permitting process could take up to seven years, but not evidence that it would take at least that long. And jobs would be created along the way. For his part, Assembly Majority Leader Scott Suder, R-Abbottsford, a sponsor of the new GOP mining bill, envisions a shorter timeline. He told us the environmental review and permitting process would take about two years and that the mine could be up and running in less than two years after that. Suder also emphasized that some number of jobs would be created long before the mine opens. He said preliminary tasks would include groundwater well drilling, water and soil testing, metallurgical, hydrological and other engineering, and design for a water supply and a railroad line. DNR mining expert Ann Coakley concurred. Gogebic Taconite would need people to do environmental studies and to drill at least several hundred wells, she told us. Surface and groundwater testing would need to be done for up to two years. That and other work would need to be done in order for the company to write an environmental impact statement, which is needed to obtain permits. "That’s a large-scale undertaking," costing probably $10 million and likely requiring at least dozens of jobs, Coakley said. Coakley also noted that while the process for obtaining permission from the Corps of Engineers could take several years, the DNR, under the GOP bill, would have to finish its review of Gogebic Taconite’s application within 420 days. If the DNR gave its permission, the company could start construction on facilities such as a wastewater treatment plant, creating more jobs. After permission from the Army Corps is granted, construction of the mine itself -- which Gogebic Taconite says would take two years and create 3,175 jobs -- could begin. Coakley said she didn’t expect it would take seven years to get to that point. Our rating Larson said a Republican-sponsored mining bill "will take at least seven years to create jobs." The evidence Larson cited referred to how long it would take to open the mine, which is the when the largest number of jobs will be in play. But there’s not hard evidence that it would take at least seven years to open the mine and it’s clear that a significant number of jobs would be created before the opening. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Larson a Mostly False.

pomt-02404	On delaying a health care mandate on business.	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/mar/07/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-kuster/	When Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster, D-N.H., sat down recently for an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, the conversation quickly turned to President Barack Obama’s health care law. Kuster said she’s dead set against repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but she agreed that it should be revised -- particularly in areas that affect small businesses. Kuster said she wants to reexamine guidelines that define a "full-time" work week as being as little as 30 hours, and also supports Obama’s decision to further delay the so-called "employer mandate." The employer mandate is a provision in the health reform law that requires businesses with 50 or more employees to offer affordable insurance coverage for workers or face penalties. The federal government was set to begin enforcing that aspect of the law in 2014, but the Obama administration has pushed back the deadline twice, moving it to 2016. Kuster said delaying the employer mandate will provide an opportunity for New Hampshire’s insurance exchange to get more competition that could drive down costs. "That’s one reason that I support the president in the delay of the small business mandate for another year," she said. "Get more competition into the New Hampshire marketplace and then we’ll find that there will be insurers that will compete on convenience as compared to cost." Kuster’s remarks on NHPR drew fire from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which said Kuster’s statement was at odds with her voting record. That’s because in July 2013, Kuster voted against a House bill that called for delaying the employer mandate. In a blog post, NRCC spokesman Ian Prior wrote that Kuster either lied or has "absolutely no idea what she is voting for." Kuster did vote against the bill. But does that mean that Kuster has reversed her position on the employer mandate, as NRCC claims? Shifting dates The politics surrounding any vote on the House floor is complex. In this case, by the time last year’s vote was held, the Obama administration had already announced it would postpone enforcing the employer mandate for one year. So the vote was essentially symbolic. The White House’s preemptive move left some House Republicans peeved, since Obama made the change through his executive authority, rather than by going through Congress. In response, House Republican leaders devised a series of showdown votes aimed at driving a wedge between Democrats and the White House. For instance, Republicans called a vote on delaying the employer mandate, even though the change had already taken place. They also introduced a second bill to delay the health care law’s mandate on individuals to secure health insurance. Democratic leaders called these measures further attempts to dismantle Obamacare. Obama threatened to veto the bills, specifically calling H.R. 2667 -- the bill delaying the employer mandate -- "unnecessary." Despite such calls from the Democratic leadership, House Republicans picked up some Democratic support for the measure. It passed, 264-161, with 35 Democrats voting for it. (The bill delaying the individual mandate also passed the House, though with less Democratic support.) Kuster’s stand Kuster voted against both bills, saying they undermined implementation of the health care law. But at the time, Kuster didn’t specifically address the merits of delaying the employer mandate. By contrast, U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter -- another New Hampshire Democrat who voted against both bills -- spelled out her opposition in greater detail. "H.R. 2667 is unnecessary and redundant because President Obama already delayed the employer responsibility provision for one year; a provision that affects only 4 percent of all businesses in America," Shea-Porter said. We asked Kuster’s office for the congresswoman’s views on the employer mandate. Spokeswoman Rosie Hilmer said Kuster supported the president’s decision to delay the mandate in 2013, but voted against the Republican bill because it was a "symbolic bill that would not have helped a single business." "Congresswoman Kuster takes her votes very seriously and addresses bills on their value, so she voted against this unnecessary bill because it was a redundant, meaningless stunt by House Republicans, not a serious attempt to address and fix problems with the law," Hilmer wrote. Our ruling Kuster recently said she supports the president’s move to delay the small business mandate for another year, saying the delay would provide more time for the New Hampshire marketplace to develop competition among health plans. Critics say that’s a contrast with her vote against a House bill to delay the employer mandate. We agree that there is a contrast between those two positions, but there’s also some nuance. Kuster didn’t say she opposed the bill because she thought that delaying the employer mandate was a bad idea -- a position that would have been a clear contrast with her more recent position. Rather, she voted against it because the bill was symbolic and tantamount to a stunt, since the White House had already delayed that provision of the law. We rate Kuster’s position on the employer mandate a Half Flip.	None	Ann McLane Kuster	None	None	None	2014-03-07T17:27:34	2014-02-20	['None']
pomt-09492	"Congresswoman Bachmann actually said we should be 'weaned' off our Social Security and Medicare. She wants to privatize Social Security and replace Medicare with some kind of voucher system."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/24/americans-united-change/ad-says-bachmann-wants-wean-nation-entitlements-pr/	Americans United for Change is after Minnesota's most outspoken lawmaker, Rep. Michele Bachmann. Comments made by the two-term Republican are the subject of a recent radio spot by the liberal group, which was founded in 2005 in opposition to former President George W. Bush's effort to privatize Social Security. The ad features a husband and wife discussing Bachmann and a proposal to "wean" people off Medicare and Social Security. Wife: "Did you hear what that Michele Bachmann said this time?" Husband: "No, what was it?" Wife: "Congresswoman Bachmann actually said we should be 'weaned' off our Social Security and Medicare. She wants to privatize Social Security and replace Medicare with some kind of voucher system that won’t even cover the full cost of medical care or prescriptions." We wondered if the ad by Americans United for Change accurately portrays Bachmann's positions. The first part of the statement -- that Bachmann said she wanted to wean people off the two entitlement programs -- is easy to find. At the Constitutional Coalition conference in St. Louis the weekend of Feb. 5, 2010, Bachmann told a group of attendees, including a reporter from the liberal blog Think Progress, that serious cost-cutting measures to Social Security and Medicare would be necessary to reduce the deficit. Those already collecting benefits should remain in the program, she suggested. To lower the deficit, Bachmann said that the government must reorganize Social Security and Medicare. "What you have to do, is keep faith with the people that are already in the system, that don’t have any other options, we have to keep faith with them. But basically what we have to do is wean everybody else off. And wean everybody off because we have to take those unfunded net liabilities off our bank sheet." So the Americans United for Change ad is correct that Bachmann said that people should be weaned off the entitlement programs. But in her comments, Bachmann did not say anything about trying to privatize Social Security or replacing Medicare with a voucher system. Via e-mail, Bachmann's spokesman Dave Dziok told us that he has "no clue where they got the voucher comment from and she’s never once used the word privatize -- not in her initial comments in St. Louis, and not in subsequent interviews or statements. Furthermore, she never stated that she wants to eliminate these programs all together, but that younger generations should have other options in the way these programs are administered. While her critics are certainly doing their best to put words in her mouth, I don’t see how they can factually back it up." Dziok said that Bachmann has not offered specific legislation on Social Security and Medicare reform. So we asked Jeremy Funk, communications director for Americans United for Change, for sourcing on the second part of the group's claim. He sent us a list of links to stories about Bachmann's comments, including one to an interview with the congresswoman in the St. Cloud Times, a Minnesota newspaper. Bachmann was asked what she thinks should be done about the rising cost of Social Security and Medicare, and here's what she said: "What we know right now (is) that going forward, Social Security and Medicare will be bankrupt and they will be broke. ... We have to take up the issue and we need to address it. There are a number of proposals on the table. One, my colleague from Wisconsin Paul Ryan has a proposal. I have taken a look at that. I am open to a number of different ideas. The one thing we do know, the current system isn’t sustainable. The system is going to be dead broke by 2017." So, Bachmann didn't endorse any specific plan or idea, but indicated that she's open to proposals, perhaps including Ryan's. Ryan, who is the top Republican on the House Budget committee, has been touting his "Roadmap for America's Future," a budget proposal meant to reduce the deficit by changing Social Security, Medicare and tax policy, among other things. Specifically, it would reduce federal Social Security benefits for those who are 55 or younger in 2011, and supplement the reduction with private accounts. Under Medicare, the elderly would be given vouchers to buy private insurance. His proposal (H.R. 4529) has made waves, mostly for two reasons. First, in its analysis, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that Ryan's proposal would eventually balance the budget. By 2080, it would generate a surplus equal to about 5 percent of GDP, according to the CBO. But that prediction has come under fire from tax experts because the CBO assumes that the revenue portion of Ryan’s plan will generate the equivalent of 19 percent of the GDP in taxes -- an optimistic assumption. And importantly for this analysis, the CBO predicts that the value of Ryan's Medicare vouchers would not keep pace with the cost of health care. Although the program would begin in 2021, the value of those vouchers would be pegged to 2010 dollars. "According to CBO’s estimates, that average growth rate would be 2.7 percent over the long term," the CBO report says. "In comparison, CBO projects, nominal per capita GDP will grow at an average rate of 3.4 percent annually over the next 75 years, implying that the value of the Medicare voucher would grow 0.7 percentage points more slowly." In plain English, that means medical expenses will grow faster than the vouchers. So the vouchers will buy less medical care as time goes by, say opponents. Ryan responded to the criticism, saying that, "Yes, Medicare costs will grow more slowly under the Roadmap than they would otherwise. ... That’s the point. Even the president acknowledges that, absent reform, Medicare will go bankrupt. ... After the program goes bankrupt, it will drag down the entire federal budget and U.S. economy." But back to the claim made by Americans United for Change. The group said that Bachmann wants to wean people off Medicare and Social Security, which is true. But the group is exaggerating in the second part of its claim that Bachmann wants to "privatize Social Security and replace Medicare with some kind of voucher system that won’t even cover the full cost of medical care or prescriptions." To date, Bachmann has no specific proposal for how she would like to overhaul the two entitlement programs. Rather, she mentioned a separate proposal made by fellow Republican Paul Ryan, though she's made no commitments to his -- or anyone else's -- plan.

pomt-08136	Republicans "created a trillion dollar prescription drug entitlement program without paying for it."	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/07/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-republicans-created-1-trillion-pr/	As Congress approaches a deal to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, Rep. Bobby Scott has taken the unpopular position of not only opposing the extensions for the wealthy, but for everyone. Scott says allowing all cuts to expire would pare the deficit -- something he says the Republicans have been unwilling to do. "Fiscal responsibility in the federal budget requires making tough choices," Scott wrote in a recent release. "For the six years that the Republican Party held both chambers in Congress and the White House, they failed time and time again to make these tough choices. They enacted $1.3 trillion in tax cuts in 2001 and another $300 billion in 2003 without offsets. They created a trillion dollar prescription drug entitlement program without paying for it." That’s a smorgasbord of claims ripe for the checking, but we thought we’d look into the latter claim. Scott’s office did not respond to a request for the source of the claim. First, a definition: The Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 -- better known as the Medicare Modernization Act -- created a new benefit called Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs. Gauging its price is tricky. How do you measure the cost of something that will continue to accumulate over the years and and has no end date? Brian Riedl, a federal budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, gave us a hint. "Most people talk about costs in a 10-year period," he said. "When the Congressional Budget Office scores a bill, they often will score the 10-year costs." OK, so we’ll look at the CBO’s Nov. 20, 2003 cost analysis of the program over its first decade, 2004 through 2013. It’s just shy of $400 billion. That’s a long way from Scott’s $1 trillion. What about a more recent estimate? According to a fiscal 2011 analysis from the Office of Management and Budget, the cost of the program from 2011 to 2020 would be more than $950 billion, close enough to $1 trillion. Is that a fair measure? Well, better than the $400 billion from 2004-2013, says Riedl, noting that the program wasn’t fully implemented until 2006. But he added that Scott could have been more clear in what period of time he measuring. "I know as a budget geek what people mean, but I think a regular layman may think he means a trillion dollars a year," he said. But here’s the other thing Scott leaves out -- Democrats, led by Ted Kennedy, had pitched an even more expensive Medicare Part D plan scored by the CBO to cost $800 billion in its first 10 years, double the cost of the Republican plan. (Scott voted against the Republican plan when it came to the House floor.) With a big budget surplus in 2000, then Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore pledged on the campaign trail to add prescription drugs to Medicare coverage. "No one ever talked about how to pay for it," Riedl said. "There was never any serious discussion on any side of offsets because at the time, that’s when we were supposed to have a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years." He added: "Then the budget collapsed and now we’re in deep doo doo." To review: Scott says Republicans created a trillion dollar prescription drug entitlement program without paying for it. The true cost of the program is unknown since it will continue to grow. In fact, the Government Accountability Office shows that the cost could exceed $7 trillion in 75 years. If we use a 10-year cost measure, Scott would be wrong looking over the first decade of the program, which is estimated to cost shy of $500 billion. But if we look at the cost over the next 10 years, Scott is close to correct based on current projections. So we find the claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-00166	Says Rick Scott’s "hospital company stole millions, defrauding the military’s health care program."	/florida/statements/2018/oct/23/votevetsorg/rick-scotts-companys-fraud-focus-attack-veterans-g/	When disaster strikes in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott dons his Navy cap. Scott served in the Navy back in the 1970s. A left-leaning veterans group used the cap as a jumping-off point in a new attack ad against Scott, saying he cheated veterans when his former health care company defrauded government health care programs. VoteVets endorsed U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson over Scott in the Nov. 6 matchup. "I see Rick Scott wearing that Navy hat everywhere he goes. But let me tell you what he did to veterans," Navy veteran Alan Madison of Vero Beach says in the ad. "His hospital company stole millions, defrauding the military’s health care program. Scott pled the Fifth and walked away with a fortune. And today he’s worth over 200 million bucks. But veterans like me, we got cheated. A few days later, Scott fired back with a TV ad featuring images of himself wearing, yep, that Navy hat as he toured damage from Hurricane Michael. (Scott joined the Navy in 1979 and served 29 months, ending as a radar technician, according to the Tampa Bay Times.) After touting his hurricane relief efforts, Scott’s ad pivots to Democratic opponent and Sen. Bill Nelson: "And Sen. Nelson? Running false attack ads mocking Gov. Scott's service in the Navy." The VoteVets ad is tough, but it isn’t inaccurate. Scott’s former health care company defrauded government health care programs, including Tricare, which serves the military and their families. Scott is wrong to refer to it as an ad by Nelson. "We have nothing to do with it," said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. Company fined for defrauding Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare The Medicare fraud case is well documented. Its connection to the military health care program is also real but has been less discussed in Scott’s political campaigns. Scott started what was first Columbia in 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he added hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. In 1997, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed fraud of government programs. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. During his 2010 race, the Miami Herald reported that Scott had said he would have immediately stopped his company from committing fraud — if only "somebody told me something was wrong." But there were such warnings in the company’s annual public reports to stockholders, which Scott had to sign as president and CEO. Scott wanted to fight the accusations, but the corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle. (Scott did give a deposition in 2000 in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment multiple times.) In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties. Assistant Attorney General David Ogden spoke about the claims related to government health care programs, including Tricare. "We will make sure that crime against the federal government does not pay," Ogden said. "Under today's agreement, HCA is resolving civil claims that the company, generally during the 1990s, engaged in fraudulent billing practices affecting Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Defense Tricare program and the Federal Employees Health Benefits program." The Justice Department’s announcement in 2000 stated that Columbia billed government programs for lab tests that were not medically necessary, not ordered by physicians, as well as other violations. The government settled a second series of claims with Columbia/HCA for $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion, setting a record at the time. When the government announced the conclusion of the case in 2003, it again mentioned Tricare as one of the government programs defrauded by the company. (The Justice Department’s 2003 press release is shown during the VoteVets ad.) A Pentagon spokeswoman, Major Carla M. Gleason, told us that as a result of the federal government's settlements with Columbia/HCA, Tricare received two recovery payments — one for about $4.7 million and the other for $6.9 million. Gleason said she no longer had direct access to the case files and therefore wasn’t certain if that was the total amount of the fraud against Tricare. We asked the Scott campaign for any evidence to refute the allegations and why his campaign said the VoteVets ad was Nelson mocking Scott’s Navy service. Scott spokeswoman Lauren Schenone didn’t respond directly to those questions. "Scott took accountability for mistakes his company made," Schenone said, "and made certain every penny that was owed was paid." But Scott resigned years before the fines were settled. Our ruling VoteVets said Scott’s "hospital company stole millions, defrauding the military’s health care program." Scott stepped down as CEO of Columbia/HCA in 1997 as the federal government was investigating his company. A few years later, the company reached a $1.7 billion settlement with the government for defrauding Medicare and other government programs including Tricare which serves the military. A Pentagon spokeswoman said that Tricare received recovery payments in the millions. We rate this claim True.	None	VoteVets.org	None	None	None	2018-10-23T13:02:38	2018-10-12	['None']
pomt-03031	"Many don’t know that Bill Young was once the minority leader in the Florida Senate...because he was the only Republican senator."	/florida/statements/2013/oct/09/chris-latvala/did-cw-bill-young-serve-only-republican-florida-se/	U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young announced he will not seek re-election in 2014, setting off tributes from Florida politicos to the Pinellas County Republican’s 53-year career in public office. One tweet about Young’s early years caught our eye. "Many don’t know that Bill Young was once the minority leader in the Florida Senate," tweeted Chris Latvala, a Republican running for the Florida House and son of Sen. Jack Latvala, "because he was the only Republican senator." It’s an interesting claim, if for no other reason than the Senate for the past decade has been dominated by Republicans. We did not have to go far to confirm Latvala’s tweet. All it took was a trip to the Tampa Bay Times library, which keeps records on local candidates and officials and state handbooks from way back in the day. Young identified himself as the minority leader of the Florida Senate in an undated questionnaire that includes this key line: "In 1960, at age 29, elected as the youngest Senator and the only Republican Senator in Florida." Young was elected to the Democrat-controlled Senate in 1960 and was the sole Republican member. He was re-elected in subsequent years, serving through 1970 when he won his first congressional election. Senate records from the time don’t list party affiliation -- a sign of how powerful Democrats were -- but we confirmed the party affiliation of senators by combing through the State Library and Archives of Florida. It’s also not clear Young had the official title of minority leader -- the records we found were silent on the point -- but as the only GOP senator until 1963, he offered the lone voice of party dissent. Young’s 1960 election to the Senate set into motion a GOP resurgence in that chamber, said Curt Kiser, a lawyer-lobbyist who represented Pinellas County in the state House in 1972 and the Senate in 1984. "He was the minority leader because he was the only one," Kiser said. "That was the beginning of the modern history of the Republican Party." Young gained more GOP company as the ‘60s rolled on, starting with Warren Henderson of Venice in 1963. By 1967, 20 Republicans served in the Senate. (The Senate back then had 48 members; today it has 40.) The increase reflected Florida’s evolving demographics, with conservative Democrats in the northern part of the state switching parties and new residents moving from conservative states casting votes for GOP candidates and running for office themselves. Democrats remained in control of the Senate until Republicans took over in 1994. Latvala’s tweet is accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-08978	The Obama administration will give Pennsylvania $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover "any legal abortion."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/16/national-right-life-committee/abortions-pennsylvania-paid-federal-dollars-not-so/	Anti-abortion groups have long been warning that Democrats would sneak federal abortion funding through the back door into the health reform law passed earlier this year. Now they say in blogs and news reports around the Web that they're being proved right. A typical statement: "The Obama Administration will give Pennsylvania $160 million in federal tax funds, which we've discovered will pay for insurance plans that cover any legal abortion," said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee in a statement on the group's website. We fact-checked abortion many times during the health care debate. It's a complicated subject due to the many different parts of the health care law. So yes, this latest controversy takes some time to explain. As you may recall, the major provisions of the new health care plan -- health insurance for everyone and exchanges for buying health plans -- don't kick in for several years. To help people who are uninsured right now, the federal law is encouraging states to create temporary health plans for people who have trouble finding affordable insurance. The government is calling the plans Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plans, or PCIPs, though sometimes they're referred to as high risk insurance pools. The plans would typically be for people who can't get insurance through work but have pre-existing conditions that make it impossible to buy insurance on their own. Policy makers say they're particularly concerned with older people who aren't yet eligible for Medicare. Pennsylvania was among the first states to put together a plan, submitting it to the federal government on June 2. It was approved a few weeks later on June 28. Pennsylvania quickly issued guidelines asking insurance companies to submit bids to run the state plan. On July 12, the National Right to Life Committee sounded the alarm, saying those guidelines for insurance companies revealed the plan to fund abortion. The 60-page proposal from Pennsylvania outlines what looks like a pretty standard health care plan: It says the plan should include preventive care, physician services, diagnostic testing, hospitalization, mental health services, and prescription medications. It will charge people $283.20 a month for coverage and accept people without access to other coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions. On abortion, the proposal says this: "Includes only abortions and contraceptives that satisfy the requirements of 18 Pa.C.S. § 3204-3206 and 35 P.S. §§10101, 10103-10105. ... Elective abortions are not covered." Those statute numbers refer to Pennsylvania's abortion laws, where abortion is, for the most part, legal. We looked up the code and it says that abortions may be performed if a doctor determines that "in his best clinical judgment, the abortion is necessary." The only mention the statute makes of forbidding an abortion is when it is "sought solely because of the sex of the unborn child." Those statute numbers mean that the proposal intended to include any legal abortion, said Johnson, the legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. "We know how this stuff works," Johnson told us. "He'll say 'It's not elective, it's necessary.'" After the anti-abortion groups made the charge, the Obama administration was quick to say that it had not yet put forward formal regulations for the state plans, and that it would include restrictions so that abortion would only be covered if it met the tests of a well-known restriction known as the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment, which traditionally applies to federal dollars used in the Medicaid health plan for the poor, forbids abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. Pennsylvania officials said their plan never intended to cover elective abortion -- hence the "elective abortions are not covered" language. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department released a sharp statement after getting questions from PolitiFact and other news outlets: "This program will provide much-needed assistance for the sickest of the sick. The likelihood that any of those covered will seek abortion services is remote, but if they do need such services, they will have to pay for them out their own pocket. ... Pennsylvania's position is not a statement about the broader abortion debate. It simply recognizes that health care reform, particularly extending health coverage to those with preexisting conditions, is too important a priority to be hijacked by those who seek to turn common-sense health reforms into a rancorous debate about whether the federal ban on abortion funding is too broad or too narrow. These efforts failed to derail health reform this spring and they will fail to stop much-needed coverage for thousands of Pennsylvanians now." The controversy over the Pre-existing Condition Health Insurance Plan has kicked off a larger debate about how abortion is handled for in lower-profile parts of the health care bill that did not get a full airing during the health care debate. President Obama signed an executive order on abortion, which he had promised to do soon after the law passed, to secure support from anti-abortion Democrats. The executive order says that it should be government-wide policy that federal funds "are not used for abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), consistent with a longstanding Federal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the Hyde Amendment." The executive order then goes into specifics about health care exchanges and community health centers, which were the most talked about provisions before the bill was passed. The lesser known provisions of bill are all up for debate now. Johnson said the executive order is essentially meaningless, and is silent on a host of other provisions in the health bill. "Each of these things will have its own timeline and its own administrative trajectory," Johnson said. "We're going to have to watch each and every one of them." We asked Johnson on July 15 if he thought, given the Obama administration's statement, that the Pennsylvania plan would cover any legal abortion. "If the federal (Health and Human Services Department) does what they now say they're going to do, or at least what they said they would do late yesterday, then I think that Pennsylvania will conform to the directive." But, he added, "We will see this episode as part of a pattern where they try to get away with what they can on abortion, and then when a light shines on them they blow smoke and scurry for cover." Meanwhile, those who favor abortion rights are unhappy that the administration is accepting restrictions on abortion. "Based on the Obama administration's statement, we are deeply disappointed that the administration has voluntarily and unnecessarily decided to impose limits on private funds used to purchase health insurance coverage for abortion care in the new high-risk insurance pools," said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards in a statement. "This decision has no basis in the law and flies in the face of the intent of the high-risk pools that were meant to meet the medical needs of some of the most vulnerable women in this country." Finally, we should also point out that the Department of Health and Human Services is indeed still developing regulations for many aspects of health care, and they're trying to do it with some haste. New Mexico, for example, submitted a plan for the Pre-existing Condition Health Insurance Plan that explicitly included abortion services, but then withdrew it quickly when it learned that the federal government would forbid the services, according to July 14 story from the Associated Press. Getting back to our rating: The National Right to Life Committee said the Obama administration will give Pennsylvania $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover "any legal abortion." If we had looked at this case before the Obama administration issued its statements, we might have been a little torn. While the Pennsylvania proposal referred to statutes about legal abortion, it also said that "elective abortions are not covered," and that is potentially contradictory. But it's important to keep in mind that this plan is intended to cover older people who have health problems, not young, healthy women who might seek abortions, and that the regulations are being created quickly. In short, we don't see pre-meditated intent to cover elective abortion. And as soon as the issue of abortion was raised, the Obama administration stated that the plans would not be allowed to cover elective abortions and that forthcoming regulations would reflect that. Given those assurances, we rate the National Right to Life Committee's statement False.

pomt-11008	"Facebook removes, censors Declaration of Independence as ‘hate speech’"	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/10/blog-posting/did-facebook-remove-post-quoting-declaration-indep/	In the lead-up to the Fourth of July holiday, Facebook removed a post containing sections of the Declaration of Independence as hate speech. Stories detailing the incident have been gaining traction ever since, so we decided to examine what happened. "Facebook removes, censors Declaration of Independence as ‘hate speech,’" said a July 5, 2018, headline from Geller Report, a website run by Pamela Geller, an anti-Muslim activist and commentator. "It’s not surprising," the story said. "The left hates our freedoms, and so designating the Declaration of Independence, the most magnificent document in all of human history, as hate speech is in line with their agenda. The left means to criminalize lawfulness. The left means to criminalize freedom of speech. The left means to criminalize individual rights. The left means to criminalize Americanism." What the story does not tell you: Facebook said removing the post was an accident and restored it a day later. Facebook users flagged this story as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Geller Report cited an article from the Guardian, and Geller pointed in an email to multiple other outlets that also reported on the incident, including the Washington Post, USA Today, Fortune and the Independent. Here’s what happened: In anticipation of July 4, the Liberty County Vindicator, a small local newspaper in Texas, posted sections of the Declaration of Independence to Facebook. The Vindicator soon received notice from Facebook indicating that one of the posts was removed because it "goes against our standards on hate speech," according to a July 2 write-up from Casey Stinnett, the paper’s managing editor. Stinnett said the section was likely removed for its reference to "merciless Indian savages." "The removal of the post was an automated action," Stinnett wrote. "If any human being working at Facebook were to review it, no doubt the post would be allowed." Later, Stinnett updated the article and posted to Facebook to announce that the post had been restored. He said the Vindicator received an email from Facebook that said, "It looks like we made a mistake and removed something you posted on Facebook that didn’t go against our Community Standards. We want to apologize and let you know that we’ve restored your content and removed any blocks on your account related to this incorrect action." Geller acknowledged in her email that Facebook apologized and restored the post, but her story did not mention the apology or the fix. "We restored the post and apologized to The Vindicator on July 3 as soon as we saw our error," said Sarah Pollack, a spokesperson for Facebook. "We process millions of reports every week, and sometimes we make mistakes." This is not the first time Facebook’s censors have removed posts of historical significance. In 2016, Facebook suspended one user’s account after he posted an image of The Terror War, a Pulitzer-prize-winning photograph that depicts a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. The photo, removed as nudity and child porn, was eventually restored. Our ruling The Geller Report story had a point that a newspaper’s post of the Declaration of Independence was temporarily removed from Facebook for appearing to violate "hate speech" standards. But the website did not mention that Facebook said it was a mistake and restored the post. It did not censor the entire speech. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-00032	Says Brendan Kelly "allowed half of the criminals he faced to walk free" and "failed to protect women who were violently assaulted," allowing "those guilty of sexual assault to cut inexcusable plea deals."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/05/mike-bost/illinois-mike-bost-attacks-brendan-kellys-record-p/	How do you define "soft on crime?" Mike Bost, a Republican congressman from southern Illinois, says his Democratic challenger, Brendan Kelly, embodies the definition. In a Bost-sponsored ad still running in the congressional campaign’s final days, an announcer says Kelly, a state’s attorney (the county prosecutor) for St. Clair County, "allowed half of the criminals he faced to walk free." "That's 50 percent walk free!" the ad in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District says. "Kelly failed to protect women who were violently assaulted, allowed those guilty of sexual assault to cut inexcusable plea deals. That's a failed record." Fifty percent sounds like a lot of criminals out on the street. So we looked to see if the numbers are accurate, and how they fit in the general scheme of crime and prosecution. We can tell you already that the numbers are correct if "free" means probation -- not only for cases prosecuted by Kelly but for those throughout Illinois. Bost's scary ad fails to note the reality of prosecution. Walking free Kelly became his county’s prosecutor in 2010. The Bost ad says Kelly "allowed half of the criminals he faced to walk free." We asked Bost’s campaign where it got that 50 percent figure, and were told it came from public records in the court system. What was the exact figure? Did Bost’s campaign look at every case Kelly and his office prosecuted, or did it use a sample? Bost’s campaign would not say, repeating in a series of emails with us that the source of the claim was public records. So we looked at a variety of data nationally, getting figures from the The Sentencing Project and the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. It seemed like the 50 percent figure was somewhere in the ballpark of cases everywhere. Then we got specific data for every felony conviction in Illinois, thanks to annual reports from the state courts. The year 2016 is the most recent, so we'll use those figures here: Of the 1,895 felony defendants prosecuted by Kelly's office that year, 1200 were convicted. That's a 63 percent conviction rate. So what happened to those 1,200 convicts? State records show 392 of them, or 33 percent, were sentenced to prison. Far more, 788, got probation. That means 66 percent of the criminals Kelly prosecuted "walked," to use Bost's term, with probation. But how does that compare with the statewide figures? The statewide conviction rate -- for every felony defendant in Illinois in 2016 -- was 65 percent, making Kelly's conviction rate a near match. Of those convicted, 42 percent went to prison. That's higher than in Kelly's county, but Cook Couty, whose seat is Chicago, skews the totals. Looking only at other counties, Bost is 1 point higher than the average. The trend was similar in 2015: 32 percent of convicted felons were sent to prison in Kelly's county, and 43 percent were statewide. Take out Cook County and the statewide average is 33.5 percent. So prosecutors across the state let criminals, in Bost's phraseology, "walk free." Sexual assaults The ad claims that Kelly allowed "those guilty of sexual assault to cut inexcusable plea deals." The commercial also cites St. Clair County Circuit Court records, without specifics, as the source for this. We asked for more information, and Bost’s campaign sent us synopses of four cases -- each involving a separate woman who was violently assaulted. In each case, the punishment for the men involved could have been more than a decade in prison. But in each of these cases, a plea deal from Kelly’s office resulted in probation -- 24 months in three of the cases, 30 months in the fourth. "These plea deals allow predators to go right back on the street and put women and children in our communities at risk," Bost’s campaign said in an email. Kelly’s decisions on how to handle cases has been a theme for attacks from Bost or Bost’s allies throughout the campaign. Some of the discussion stems from stories in the Belleville News-Democrat, including its 2015 series, "Violation of Trust." An online headline said it best: "Sex crime victims in Southern Illinois find that police, prosecutors typically do not charge their attackers. From 2005 to 2013, 70 percent of sex crimes never made it to a courtroom." The newspaper’s investigation covered cases from 2005 through 2013. It found that in St. Clair County, the state’s attorney prosecuted just 18 percent of felony sex crimes reported to police. Part of the problem was that prosecutors didn’t deem all reports of sexual abuse eligible or strong enough for prosecution. The trend in southern Illinois was not unique. The Minneapolis Star Tribune found that in the two-year period of 2015 and 2016, fewer than one in 10 reported sexual assaults produced a conviction. Other studies have shown this, too. Kelly took office in 2010, so his office prosecuted cases covered in only three of the nine years the newspaper investigation covered. But prosecution rates improved under Kelly. In 2012 and 2013, about 30 percent of sex crime reports resulted in charges being filed, the News-Democrat said, and conviction rates for adult defendants in those cases was relatively high. Asked why prosecutors didn’t take on more cases, Kelly told the News-Democrat, "We want to justly convict the guilty, but more importantly seek as much justice as possible for the public and for victims. That’s what drives us. ... There is no cookie-cutter answer." He also said some accused sex crime suspects may wind up being prosecuted for non-sex crimes such as aggravated battery and unlawful restraint that might not show up in the newspaper’s investigation. He cited an example of a defendant tried and convicted of non-sex felonies in a case that also involved rape. Kelly and his campaign have said they cannot disclose all the details that go into a case but the factors can include the best resolution for the victim. Asked about the cases presented to us by Bost’s campaign, Kelly spokeswoman Elana Schrager said, "In each of these four cases, Brendan worked closely with each of the survivors to ensure justice was achieved while respecting her wishes." Our ruling Bost says that Kelly "allowed half of the criminals he faced to walk free" and "failed to protect women who were violently assaulted," allowing "those guilty of sexual assault to cut inexcusable plea deals." Bost’s campaign did not provide precise information when we asked repeatedly, but we found it anyway. If probation is viewed as letting a criminal walk free, Kelly is guilty -- as are prosecutors throughout Illinois. Very few counties had the opposite trend. Similarly, we also found, based on data from the Belleville News-Democrat as well as federal court data, that Bost’s general use of plea bargains is within the norms of state and national plea bargain rates. As for the ad’s claim that Kelly "failed to protect women," Bost’s campaign said it based this on court cases. The information it sent us showed four men getting probation rather than prison. The information does not provide any nuances in the prosecution of each case. With all this in mind, we find Bost’s numbers are fine but shade the truth substantially about prosecution across his state. There are undoubtedly critics of the way Kelly has handled cases, just as there are people who praise him. This is a lot context to consider. Based on what we could measure and on the principles of the Truth-O-Meter --- specifically, the rating for a claim that contains an element of truth but is misleading -- we rate this Mostly False.

Fourteen million more jobs? Since economic estimates are often complicated to evaluate, we talked with Cain economic advisor Richard Lowrie. We also took a look at a Wall Street Journal op-ed written by former Texas U.S. Senator Phil Gramm that Cain referenced in his own column Gramm wrote a piece that appeared April 15 called "The Obama Growth Discount." It argued that under Obama’s economic policies, job growth is uniquely dismal, even among the postwar era’s deepest recessions. "Forty months after the start of the 1953, 1957, 1973 and 1981 recessions, total employment was on average 4.7% higher than the pre-recession peaks, while total employment today is still down 4.7%—that's a total employment gap of 13.9 million jobs." Lowrie told PolitiFact Georgia that he used Gramm’s method to do his own calculations, so we did as well. We compared total employment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics at their pre-recession peak, calculated their percentage difference from employment 40 months later, and averaged the results for what Gramm considered the four worst postwar recessions. Lowrie found employment typically grew at about 4.8 percent, for total jobs gap of 13.6 million. Cain rounded up to 14 million. PolitiFact Georgia came up with figures ranging from some 12.4 million to 13.6 million, depending on how we chose our data. Some downturns, such as those in 1957 and 1981, start less than 40 months after the last recession, so there’s room for debate on how to account for downturns that don’t fit the mold. So Cain cherry picked higher numbers, plus he rounded up a good bit, but his math makes sense. But we wanted to dig a little deeper. His calculation depends heavily on what one considers the nation’s worst postwar recessions. So we asked around. Economists told us that there are a lot of ways to measure the depth of a recession. You can look at its length, how much it shrinks the size of the economy, and how it affects jobs, to name a few metrics. This means that while economists widely consider certain recessions, such as the most recent one, as among the worst in the postwar era, there might be room for debate if you tried to rank some of the others. Still, while you might disagree with some of Gramm’s choices of ‘worst’ recessions, they are reasonable. According to our calculations, the four recessions he cited boasted the postwar’s largest reduction in gross domestic product, a measure that describes the size of the nation’s economy. We also found it’s possible to argue that Gramm’s way of comparing recessions is invalid. Emory economics professor Tom Smith said each recession is so unique that Gramm’s calculation is only useful as political rhetoric against Obama. It conveys little, if any, useful information about the recession or Obama’s record, Smith said. "It’s a trickster move," Smith said. "It’s a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat," Smith said. So Cain’s statement does have weaknesses. The number he used in the Wall Street Journal is on the high side of the calculations. It’s also rounded upwards by about 400,000 jobs. And it’s fair to dispute whether this is a good way to measure Obama’s economic record. Also, Cain could have been more clear. He should have emphasized that he meant that there would be 14 million more jobs if this recession were more typical of the most severe postwar recessions, rather than postwar recessions in general. That said, Cain’s calculation that we would have 14 million jobs was within reason, if a bit high. We therefore rate Cain’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00826	"EPA wants to regulate … the family BBQ."	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/26/allen-west/allen-west-says-obama-epa-wants-regulate-backyard-/	Hands off our backyard barbecues, says former Rep. Allen West, R-Fla. West -- now the president and CEO of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based free-market think tank -- leapt to the defense of home-cooked meat in a signed item posted on his personal website on March 19, 2015. The article was headlined, "Two things the EPA wants to regulate in your life," and referred to alleged interest by the Environmental Protection Agency in backyard barbecues and hotel shower water. Here’s an excerpt of West’s post: "Ladies and gents, I just cannot ascertain when the absurdity of this current administration will cease. The weather is finally warming up and one of the rituals of spring and summer is the family BBQ. Well, it is for now until the Environmental Protection Agency has its way. "As reported by Fox News, ‘the EPA is funding a $15,000 University of California-Riverside study to look at the particulate emissions you breathe when grilling over an open flame. … Why is the EPA concerned about BBQ grill emissions? Who are these people and why are they using one single dime of American taxpayer dollars for this tomfoolery?" A reader saw West’s claim about barbecue and asked us to check it out. So we took a look at whether West was correct that the EPA wants to regulate the family BBQ. According to the Fox News article cited by West, "the EPA is funding a $15,000 University of California-Riverside study to look at the particulate emissions you breathe when grilling over an open flame." The study in question can be found on an EPA webpage for "extramural research" -- that is, research funded by EPA but carried out by external researchers. This particular study was titled, "Technology for the Reduction of Particulate Matter Emissions for Residential Propane BBQs," and was to be undertaken by four researchers at the University of California-Riverside between Aug. 15, 2014, and Aug. 14, 2015. The project amount was $15,000. The objective? "To perform research and develop preventative technology that will reduce fine particulate emissions ... from residential barbecues. This technology is intended to reduce air pollution as well as health hazards in Southern California, with potential for global application," according to the EPA website. So West’s claim hasn’t been made up from whole cloth. But it’s still pretty misleading. Most importantly, there’s a big difference between funding a small scientific grant and actually seeking to regulate an activity. The EPA makes clear that this grant isn’t exactly the camel’s nose under the tent. "EPA does not regulate backyard barbecues and does not plan to in the future," the agency said in a statement to PolitiFact. (The Fox News article did mention this disclaimer toward the end of its story.) The difference between supporting a study and setting national policy is especially wide in this case, because the funding comes from a national student design competition -- the "P3 Awards: A National Student Design Competition for Sustainability Focusing on People, Prosperity and the Planet." The other study mentioned in West’s post, the one about hotel water monitoring, also stemmed from the same student design competition. This project "aims to develop a novel, low-cost, wireless device for monitoring water use from hotel guest room showers," that could eventually be "marketed to the hotel industry to reduce costs by promoting water conservation among hotel guests," according to the EPA’s summary. By West’s standard, would projects hosted by the White House at its science fair on March 23 also constitute a roadmap for future policymaking? Will the high school projects for a wearable breathalyzer wristband, or a system for turning algae into a biofuel -- two real projects hosted at the science fair -- automatically become guideposts for future federal rulemaking? We don’t think so. (West’s press office didn’t reply to two emails for this article.) Our ruling West said the "EPA wants to regulate … the family BBQ." Reasonable people can disagree over whether the research projects in question are worth spending tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayer funds. But it’s wrong to say, as West does, that their existence demonstrates that the EPA "wants to" regulate backyard barbecues. The EPA says it isn’t seeking to do so, and the projects in question are examples of scientific inquiry, not examples of federal rulemaking. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04290	On support for U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s Medicare reform plan	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/01/tommy-thompson/testing-thompsons-position-ryans-medicare-reform-p/	In the homestretch of the U.S. Senate race, Republican Tommy Thompson offered a plan to slow rising Medicare costs that threaten the solvency of the government-run health insurance program for seniors. The "Tommy Thompson plan," as he called it, would give future seniors the option of staying in the program or joining one of the private health plans offered to federal employees. The campaign of his opponent Democrat Tammy Baldwin cried foul, saying Thompson was "trying to run away from" his firm embrace of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s controversial plan to reform Medicare. Another case for the Flip-O-Meter, which tests whether candidates have changed their position. As usual, we’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch, just whether the candidate has been consistent. In the 2012 race, Thompson has ripped Baldwin for failing to propose a solvency plan for Medicare. Baldwin, in turn, has tried at every turn to link the former governor to Ryan’s plan, which critics paint as "ending Medicare as we know it." Ryan’s "Path to Prosperity" budget resolution in 2012 -- the latest in a series of similar fiscal plans he’s released in recent years -- included proposed changes in tax policy and entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Ryan’s plan, which is nearly identical to Mitt Romney’s, allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice. They can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Critics call this a "voucher" plan that could leave seniors dipping deeper into their own pockets, while Ryan says it’s a "premium support" plan that will lower health care costs. Let’s look at Thompson’s statements and actions: October 2011: Thompson, already an unofficial Senate candidate, says an earlier version of Ryan’s budget plan, this one in 2011, was "on the right track". But unlike Ryan in that earlier plan, Thompson makes clear he wanted to give people under 55 a choice of staying on traditional Medicare or not when they reached retirement age. Thompson did not have a formal plan at the time. Thompson says those who chose the traditional system would pay higher-out-of-pocket costs than seniors pay now because the system "is going broke." March 29, 2012: The House approves Ryan’s budget plan on a 228-191 partisan vote. The plan’s Medicare proposal -- modified from Ryan’s earlier plan -- offered the choice of using a government payment for private insurance or for a plan akin to traditional Medicare. May 11-13, 2012: At the Republican Party state convention, Thompson endorses Ryan’s 2013 budget plan as a whole. The plan included the Medicare changes, allowing beneficiaries a choice. "I will pass Paul Ryan’s budget plan in the U.S. Senate," he says. "It is the right plan, at the right time, for America." On the "deficit reduction" section of his campaign website, Thompson says he "fully and wholeheartedly endorses Paul Ryan’s Path to Prosperity and will take all necessary steps to ensure the U.S. Senate takes up the plan. "It makes Social Security solvent, preserves Medicare for our most needy seniors, maintains a safety net for the poor and provides for sufficient defense to protect our security," Thompson says on the site. It adds: the plan "emanates from Wisconsin and the values we hold dear." Thompson, the site says, would have "additional entitlement, tax and budget reforms to add to Paul Ryan’s plan" during the campaign. August 13, 2012: A Thompson radio ad after Ryan’s selection as Romney’ vice presidential nominee says Thompson would be the 51st vote to pass Ryan’s 2013 budget plan. August 14, 2012: Thompson wins a four-way GOP primary election. Sept. 28, 2012: During his first debate with Baldwin, Thompson briefly mentions a new wrinkle: People who opt not to stay in Medicare would be put in the health plan that federal employees, including members of Congress, are in. "If it’s good enough for the Congress, why isn’t it good enough for the seniors," Thompson asked. Oct. 5, 2012: Appearing at the Milwaukee Press Club Newsmaker luncheon, Thompson pointedly says his Medicare plan now is "different than Ryan’s," again noting the federal employee plan option. Thompson says his plan would make the changes for those under 55 in 2020. The timeline in Ryan’s plan is under 55 in 2023. Oct. 19, 2012: Thompson told the Wisconsin State Journal editorial board of his new plan: "This is a plan by Paul Ryan. I’ve modified it. I think my plan is better." Oct. 23, 2012: The Journal Sentinel, in a story entitled, "How Thompson, Baldwin differ on Medicare," writes that Thompson for months touted a plan that would allow people a decade from now to remain in the current program or receive a subsidy from the government to buy health insurance from the private sector. "In recent weeks, he has modified his course by saying he wants to allow people to stay in Medicare or sign up for the private healthcare plans offered to federal employees," the story said. Oct. 26, 2012: In the final Senate debate, Thompson again outlines his plan, changing a detail: those under 50 in the year 2020 would get the choice. Thompson said Democrats’ plan was to "play our harp while Rome burns and see Medicare collapse," while Baldwin said the federal health care law she backed had improved Medicare’s fiscal outlook. Our rating Thompson has praised Ryan’s various Medicare plans since 2011, and for much of the 2012 campaign indicated he fully embraced Ryan’s latest plan. In the last month or so he’s partially changed his approach on Medicare reform, while edging away from Ryan. Really, though, he has only tweaked Ryan’s Medicare plan, and has not renounced Ryan’s budget blueprint -- Thompson still endorses it on his website. That amounts to a Half Flip on our meter.

pomt-07884	"Illegal aliens cost the state of Rhode Island $400 million a year."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/06/terry-gorman/gorman-says-illegal-immigrants-cost-rhode-island-4/	There's been a lot of debate over the cost of illegal immigration, both nationally and to individual states. Terry Gorman, president of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, believes he knows the price tag for Rhode Island. And it’s big. During an appearance on the Jan. 6 Helen Glover Show on WHJJ radio, Gorman stated that "illegal aliens cost the state of Rhode Island $400 million a year." We wondered if Gorman's number was accurate. In an interview with PolitiFact, he broke the costs down into four categories: Incarceration, education, Medicaid and hospital care. We’ll examine each individually. INCARCERATION This is the easiest category to deal with because there’s reliable data. It’s also the only one where Gorman is even close. Gorman used three numbers to conclude that Rhode Island pays $7.2 million a year to keep illegal immigrants in prison. He said there were about 200 illegal immigrants incarcerated, at an annual cost of $43,000 per prisoner. He multiplied those two numbers and then subtracted $1.2 million -- the amount he said the federal government pays the state to help cover the cost of their imprisonment. (The actual total is $7.4 million.) We confirmed that annual cost (now $43,252) and the latest federal payment ($1 million) but discovered that the 200 number was a bit high. In 2010, the average quarterly count was 168, not all of whom turned out to be here illegally. Gorman's total: $7.2 million. Our total: $6.2 million. That’s as close as he got. In the other categories, Gorman's numbers quickly fell apart. EDUCATION Gorman says it costs the state $239 million a year to educate illegal immigrant children and children of illegal immigrants. To determine whether that number is accurate, you have to know how many illegal immigrant children there are and what the per-pupil cost of educating them is. That’s not as easy as it sounds, because finding reliable data is difficult. First, let’s consider the number of children. Gorman says the Census Bureau estimated that in 2004 there were 8,740 illegal immigrant children and children of illegal immigrants in Rhode Island. No it didn't. The Census Bureau told us there was no such count of illegal immigrant children in 2004, or any other year. "That's not something we collect," said spokesman Thomas Edwards. The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey does estimate the number of foreign-born children age 5 to 17. In 2009, that number was about 7,070. Using data from the survey, we calculated that about 4,700 of those were not naturalized U.S. citizens. That’s more than 4,000 fewer than Gorman’s number. And that number includes foreign-born children whose parents are in the country legally, such as youngsters whose parents were granted asylum. So we looked for other ways to determine how many of those 4,700 children were here illegally. The Census Bureau estimated that in 2009 there were 133,458 foreign-born people in Rhode Island in 2009. The bureau doesn’t count how many of those are here illegally. So we contacted the Department of Homeland Security, which offers estimates of the number of "unauthorized immigrants" in the United States. But DHS spokesman Michael Hoefer told us "we only provide estimates for the larger states due to uncertainty in the precision for smaller states." Looking for some way to zero in on Rhode Island, we looked at DHS data for two of those larger states, which, like Rhode Island, are both urban and in the Northeast: New York and New Jersey. The DHS estimated in 2009 that 3.3 percent of the population of those states was in the U.S. illegally. Applying the same rate to Rhode Island's population -- a big assumption -- would give us about 35,000 unauthorized immigrants. Then, just last week, the Pew Hispanic Center issued a report estimating that there were roughly 30,000 illegal immigrants in Rhode Island in 2010. The key question: what percentage of those are school-age children? Let’s go back to the Census Bureau estimate of 133,458 foreign born people in Rhode Island. If 30,000 (the Pew number) or 35,000 (the DHS number) are illegal immigrants, that’s about 22 to 26 percent. Apply those percentages to the total number of foreign-born children in Rhode Island age 5 to 17 years -- which, remember, the Census pegged at 7,070 -- and you get 1,589 to 1,854 school age children. That's about one fifth of Gorman's 8,740 figure. OK. So now that we have a more accurate number of children, how much does it cost to educate them? Gorman says the price is $23,000 per child. Plus, he reasoned, 20 percent of those students would need special education, including English instruction. For those students, he adds another $22,000. But the Rhode Island Department of Education told us the statewide average per-pupil cost for 2009, the latest for which complete data are available, is $14,186 per student -- which includes special education, English instruction and other special programs like career and technical education. So Gorman’s per-pupil cost is off by nearly $9,000. Even if we accept his special education cost estimate and assumed that every child needs extra English language instruction, the total would be no higher than $40 million to $47 million. That’s not even close to $239 million. MEDICAID COSTS Gorman asserts that 35 percent of the money spent on Medicaid and RIteCare -- programs that provide health care to low-income people -- goes to illegal immigrants or the children of illegal immigrants. His estimate of that cost: $125 million. He said he based his claim on a 2005 Providence Journal story that talked about how much of the RIteCare budget goes to "undocumented clients." But we were unable to find any such story in our database. And David Burnett, associate director of the state’s Office of Health and Human Services, said the only undocumented people covered by Medicaid are 350 pregnant women currently covered by the RIteCare program through a special plan funded by the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). That's a tiny fraction -- less than three-tenths of a percent -- of the state's 121,000 RIteCare enrollees. Not even close to 35 percent. According to Burnett, the state’s Medicaid budget is $1.7 billion; RiteCare makes up $602 million of that total. Two thirds of that is federal money, according to Linda Katz, co-founder of The Poverty Institute. So Rhode Island's share of RIteCare is about $201 million. And 0.289 percent of $201 million is $579,926, which brings the state's RIteCare cost for pregnant illegal immigrants down to under $600,000. What about children of illegal immigrants who were born here? Those children are citizens and the state does not track them in a separate category. As a result, those costs are unknown. Gorman's estimate: $125 million. Our estimate: less than $600,000, plus the unknown cost of those U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. FREE HOSPITAL CARE Finally, we looked at Gorman's estimate that half the money the state gives local hospitals to cover the costs of uncompensated care is spent treating illegal immigrants. (Hospitals are required to treat people regardless of their ability to pay.) He says the hospitals get $139 million a year. Half of that would be $69.5 million. The last state payment to the hospitals was actually $127 million, according to Michael Souza, vice president for finance at the Hospital Association of Rhode Island. But the state only paid out $60 million; the rest was federal money. How much of that uncompensated care goes to illegal immigrants? Nobody knows. Gorman says his source is a hospital translator who appeared on a public access cable show in 2010. He declined to name the source but said, "We stand by our figures." The hospital association says hospitals don't even collect that data. "Patients are not required to provide SSN or even green card numbers if they have them," said Gail Leach Carvelli, media relations for Lifespan, a consortium of five Rhode Island hospitals. "It’s entirely optional. So to even try to put a percentage around it would be misleading." So Gorman says uncompensated care for illegal immigrants costs the state $70 million a year. But the state is paying out only $60 million for all uncompensated care. Even if he is correct that half the money goes to illegal immigrants -- and at this point, needless to say, we have our doubts -- that's $30 million, not $70 million. IN SUMMARY . . . We recognize that illegal immigrants impose a cost to the state, and there are costs that Gorman did not include, such as the added burden on law enforcement. At the same time, he ignores mitigating factors, such as the taxes -- particularly sales taxes -- that even illegal immigrants pay to the state. The $400 million figure he repeatedly cites sounds authoritative. But three of his four categories are based on numbers that are outdated, grossly inflated or have no documentation. Thus, the inflammatory assertion that illegal immigrants drain the state of $400 million a year -- $400 for every man, woman and child in Rhode Island -- is ridiculously high. And because inflammatory, ridiculous assertions qualify for our worst rating, we rule Pants On Fire!	None	Terry Gorman	None	None	None	2011-02-06T00:01:00	2011-01-06	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-07233	"Look at the debt that has been accumulated in the last two years. It's more debt under this president than all those other presidents combined."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/01/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-obama-has-accumulated-more-debt-p/	During a family bus trip, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin made a claim about the size of the debt accumulated under President Barack Obama. "Look at the debt that has been accumulated in the last two years," Palin, a Republican, told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren on May 31, 2011, as her bus rolled down the highway. "It's more debt under this president than all those other presidents combined." This claim is similar to ones we’ve checked in the past -- with varying ratings -- so we thought we would check Palin’s as well. A few preliminaries. First, there are two common measures for debt. One, called public debt, tallies up the debt held by the public, while gross federal debt is a larger figure that combines publicly held debt plus debt held by the government itself, such as in the Social Security or Medicare trust funds. Both figures are considered legitimate, and since Palin didn’t specify which one she was referring to, we’ll run the numbers for both categories of debt. Second, we’ll assume that all the debt accumulated under Obama should be attributed to him. In reality, this isn’t a logical allocation, since the first budget he wrote was actually for the 2010 fiscal year, and because he -- like all presidents -- inherited the fiscal legacy of his predecessor. Still, calculating it this way is much simpler -- and as we’ll see, it won’t matter to the outcome. We turned to the Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator, where we found that on Obama’s first day in office, Jan. 20, 2009, the public debt stood at $6.307 trillion; gross federal debt stood at $10.627 trillion. For the most recent date available -- May 27, 2011 -- these two debt figures stood at $9.718 trillion and $14.345 trillion, respectively. That means that under Obama, the public debt rose by $3.411 trillion and the gross federal debt rose by $3.718 trillion. That’s a huge amount of money -- but it’s far less than what was accumulated by Obama’s 43 predecessors. Because debt is cumulative (minus any intervening surpluses) the debt level for the previous 43 presidents is equal to the amount of debt on the day Obama was inaugurated. So even by the standards we used -- which aren’t especially favorable to Obama -- the debt he accumulated amounts to either 54 percent of his predecessors’ combined debt (using the public debt figure) or 35 percent (using gross federal debt). Neither of these figures is "more … than all those other presidents combined," as Palin had said. Palin would have been correct if she had said the same thing that Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., said last fall, that "the budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined." We rated that True. In other words, Cantor didn’t use the two-year timeline that Palin did -- and making that change improves the accuracy of the claim. But Palin didn’t say that. She said, quite specifically, that Obama had accumulated more debt in two years than the previous 43 presidents had collectively. And while Obama (along with Congress) has indeed accumulated a lot of debt for various reasons, his two-year debt total, even if you use the most generous standards for judging Palin’s comment, is still $3 trillion to $7 trillion short of the amount needed to make Palin’s statement accurate. So we rate her claim False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2011-06-01T15:49:33	2011-05-31	['None']
pomt-06127	Says Ron Paul doesn’t believe in marriage licenses.	/texas/statements/2011/dec/27/gail-collins/columnist-gail-collins-says-ron-paul-doesnt-believ/	New York Times op-ed columnist Gail Collins zinged presidential aspirant Ron Paul in a recent piece. Saying everyone agrees the Texas congressman has a great organization in Iowa, where voters caucus in January, Collins said that’s important, "particularly for a Republican candidate who doesn’t believe in marriage licenses, the war on drugs, the war in Afghanistan or prosecuting flag burners." For this article, we evaluated her first claim — that Paul, who wedded his wife, Carol, in 1957, does not believe in marriage licenses. Collins’ aide, Isabella Moschen, told us by email that Collins reached that conclusion based on a 2011 collection of Paul writings, "Liberty Defined." Separately, Paul campaign spokesman Gary Howard advised: "You should read the book." We focused on Paul’s chapter in the book titled "Marriage." In it, Paul writes that most Americans "do not question the requirement to obtain a license to get married." But ideally, he says, each individual could define marriage as he or she pleases, so long as force is not used to impose the definition on others. It’s a matter of free speech, he says, in keeping with the First Amendment. This week, Paul said he favors leaving regulations involving marriage up to the states, according to a Dec. 21, 2011, news article posted by The Boston Globe. According to the newspaper, Paul said at a New Hampshire stop: "Why should the government be telling you what marriage is all about? You might have one definition. I have another definition." Speaking later to reporters, Paul said: "My personal opinion is government shouldn’t be involved. The whole country would be better off if individuals made those decisions and it was a private matter," the Globe reported. In his book, Paul also points out that some states recognize couples as married without requiring that they get a license. A "common law" marriage is generally defined by Black’s Law Dictionary as a non-ceremonial relationship that requires "a positive mutual agreement, permanent and exclusive of all others, to enter into a marriage relationship, cohabitation sufficient to warrant a fulfillment of necessary relationship of man and wife, and an assumption of marital duties and obligations." We spotted this definition in an April 2011 web post by the National Conference of State Legislatures that also says nine states (Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Iowa, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas) recognize all common-law marriages and five states (Georgia, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania) recognize common-law marriages that were established before a certain date. In Texas, according to information posted online by the Texas Department of State Health Services, a couple may register their "informal marriage" by appearing together before a county clerk to file such a declaration. Alternatively, a couple can establish their common-law marriage by showing they agree they are married, that they live together in the state and that they represent themselves to others that they are married to each other, the post says. Paul refers to the licensing mandate in another part of the marriage chapter, saying: "The best approach is to make marriage a private matter. When we no longer believe that civilization is dependent on government expansion, regulating excesses, and a license for everything we do, we will know that civilization and the ideas of liberty are advancing." "Licensing for social reasons reflects the intolerant person’s desire to mold other people’s behavior to their standard," Paul writes. "Both depend on the use of illegitimate government force." We rate Collins’ claim True.	None	Gail Collins	None	None	None	2011-12-27T06:00:00	2011-12-14	['None']
pomt-12271	"Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days."	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/05/stgeorgegazettecom/story-about-ryan-announcing-trumps-resignation-com/	A fake news story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan announced President Donald Trump’s resignation is actually the brainchild of one of the Internet’s most prolific hoax authors. The headline on a June 29, 2017, article on StGeorgeGazette.com read, "Paul Ryan: ‘Donald Trump plans to resign from office within the next 30 days’." Facebook users flagged the story as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. "Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days," the post quoted Ryan. "Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best." Now, it’s obvious that Ryan hasn’t announced Trump is resigning. But other clues also show that the story is bogus. There is no media outlet called the St. George Gazette. The website implies it is based in St. George, Utah, but the newspaper there is called the Spectrum. The story also quoted one Paul Horner, which is the name of a big-time writer of fabricated news stories. One of his trademarks is always putting his own name into his stories. Horner, formerly a writer at fake news site NationalReport.net, is credited with writing stories ranging from Bill Murray running for president to President Barack Obama opening a Muslim museum to Banksy getting arrested. You can read a roundup of some his work at NewsExaminer.net, which also is a fake news site. Among his often-used calling cards in online stories are the use of the byline Jimmy Rustling, numerous references to "Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin" and a plea to donate socks to the homeless. The footer note posted on the bottom of the website lists a "complaint department" phone number that is actually the number for the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan. It’s another Horner staple to use that number: The Ryan article cites the same number as a hotline set up by the White House for people to comment on Trump’s resignation. There’s otherwise no contact information for the website. We reached out to Horner, who responded to us with a cheeky reply on Facebook, but did not address this particular story. The story is made up, in any case. We rate it Pants On Fire! See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	StGeorgeGazette.com	None	None	None	2017-07-05T12:00:00	2017-06-29	['United_States', 'Donald_Trump']
pomt-06305	After losing 750,000 jobs a month before this administration, the U.S. economy under Barack Obama has had 20 straight months of growth, has added 2.8 million jobs in the private sector and added "millions of jobs in manufacturing."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/15/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-obama-has-created-mi/	Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla, and chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee touted President Barack Obama’s record on the economy in an interview on the Nov. 13, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, The host, David Gregory, asked Wasserman Schultz whether she would concede that Americans aren’t any better off after nearly three years of Obama’s policies. "Well, what I concede is that we do have a long way to go," she said. "But we absolutely have begun to turn things around, and we have made steady, but not quick enough, progress. I mean, before President Obama took office, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month, David. And now we've had 20 straight months of growth in the private sector. We've added 2.8 million jobs in the private sector alone. We've begun to add millions of jobs in manufacturing. We're starting to focus on making things in America again." Let’s take her points one by one: "Before President Obama took office, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month." Strictly speaking, in November and December 2008 -- that is, the final full months before Obama took office -- the nation lost 802,000 and 619,000 jobs respectively. If you throw in January 2009, the month Obama took office, the nation lost 820,000 jobs. Rounding that off to 750,000 jobs per month seems in the ballpark. "We've had 20 straight months of growth in the private sector." Given the context from the rest of the quote, we’re assuming that Wasserman Schultz meant job growth. By that metric, she’s right. "We've added 2.8 million jobs in the private sector." If you start counting at the low point of the past few years -- February 2010 -- she’s right. Since that time, the number of private-sector jobs has risen by 2.77 million, or 2.8 million if you round up. (Over the same period, the number of government jobs has shrunk, weakening the overall jobs picture.) But using other date ranges will produce lower -- even negative -- totals. Since the Obama presidency began in January 2009, the number of private-sector jobs has actually decreased by more than 1.4 million. Reasonable people can disagree about where the best starting point is for measuring a new president’s impact on the economy, but Wasserman Schultz’s number is the most positive one you can come up with. We’ve added "millions of jobs in manufacturing." This is the one claim where Wasserman Schultz is far, far off. The lowest point for manufacturing jobs was December 2009, almost a year into the Obama administration. Since then, the number of manufacturing jobs has rebounded, increasing by 303,000. That’s nothing to sneeze at -- but it’s far from even a million, much less the "millions" Wasserman Schultz claims. And if you look at the numbers since the day Obama took office, manufacturing jobs have actually fallen by 800,000. A final point: When we rate statements that seek to assign credit or blame to a politician, we also look at whether the politician in question was really responsible. As we’ve written before, presidents do have a role in job creation, but there are many other factors at play as well, so we don’t think it’s fair for Wasserman Schultz to give Obama all the credit for the gains she cited. (Just as it would be unfair to give him all the blame for losses.) Our ruling On Wasserman Schultz’s first two points, we have no major quibbles. On the third, the number is accurate according to one calculation, but it is cherry picked in a way that sheds the most favorable light on the president. And on the fourth -- manufacturing jobs -- Wasserman is flat-out wrong. We realize that she said "we've begun to add millions of jobs," suggesting more to come. But a rebound of 303,000 jobs is too few to support a claim that big. Meanwhile, we’re downgrading her for overselling Obama’s role in job creation. On balance, we rate her statement Half True.

pomt-07545	When you compare our state pension system "to other systems throughout the country, our benefits are not gold-plated. They are not rich. They are actually average or below average."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/apr/03/james-cenerini/state-union-lobbyist-says-rhode-island-pension-ben/	With Rhode Island facing a financial crisis, the expensive and underfunded state employee pension system is once again in the cross hairs. The conventional wisdom is that state workers who get a pension have a great deal, so it's not surprising that some legislators are looking to scale back benefits, while Governor Chafee wants workers to contribute more. During testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, James Cenerini, a lobbyist for Council 94 of the American Federation of State, Council & Municipal Employees, argued that the state pension system is not as lucrative as most people believe. "When you take a look at, comparatively, our system, to other systems throughout the country, our benefits are not gold-plated," he said. "They are not rich. They are actually average or below average." When we asked Cenerini how he made that comparison, he sent us to the latest report of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, which has been comparing public pension systems every two years since 1982. The latest report, released in December 2009, is based on data from 2008. The 2010 report isn't due out until early next year, said author Daniel Schmidt. Neither Cenerini nor the Wisconsin report addressed health insurance benefits for retirees, so they are not considered in this analysis. Even a cursory look at the 87 public employee retirement systems examined in the report (at least one per state) shows that the systems have their own quirks that make comparisons tricky. In addition, some of the information is outdated. The provisions of Rhode Island's pension system, for example, are now less lucrative for employees than they were in 2008. Thus, the data in the report should be regarded as a snapshot in time. But that's the snapshot Cenerini said he used, so we decided to see how Rhode Island stacked up based on the information in that report. We'll take the easy comparisons first. NORMAL RETIREMENT: For Rhode Island state employees and teachers, it was age 60 with 10 years of service, or at any age with 28 years of service. Of the 86 other plans, 42 had a more liberal standard. For example, in Massachusetts, it was age 55 with 10 years of service or at any age with 20 years of service. Rhode Island was right in the middle of the pack. EARLY RETIREMENT: Ten plans had no early retirement provision. Rhode Island allowed early retirement, with a reduced payout, at age 55 with 20 years of service. Sixty three other plans were more liberal, putting Rhode Island well below average. EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION: Rhode Island state employees contributed -- and continue to contribute -- 8.75 percent of their salary to retirement. Only nine plans required a greater contribution and in every one of those plans, except one, retirees would presumably need to set aside extra money because they were not covered by Social Security. (Rhode Island teachers, some of whom are not eligible for Social Security, pay 9.5 percent.) Among plans where workers were eligible for Social Security, only Arizona made employees pay a greater share -- 9 percent. In Kentucky, for example, teachers were paying 9.86 percent, but they were not covered by Social Security; state workers who were eligible paid just 5 percent. (The Chafee administration wants to increase the contribution rate for teachers and non-teachers alike to 11.75 percent.) VESTING: In nearly every retirement plan, you must work for the state for a certain number of years before you are eligible to receive retirement benefits. For Rhode Island, that "vesting" period is 10 years. Seventy of the 86 other plans had a shorter vesting period. TAXED BENEFITS: Rhode Island is one of only a dozen states where state retirement payments are fully taxed by the state. In 12 states they were exempt, in 2 states they were exempt for some workers, in 18 states some retirement income was exempt and 7 other states have no state income tax. So far, based on 2008 data, Rhode Island's system seemed to rank at or below average. Now, it gets a little more complicated. ANNUAL INCREASES: At the time of the report, Rhode Island retirees were entitled to annual cost of living increases of 3 percent. This was the one area where Rhode Island's system clearly offered more money than most. And it was an expensive feature of the plan. Only nine other states were giving 3-percent annual increases, the highest guaranteed increases among the states. Most states -- 18 -- tied increases to the Consumer Price Index, but 7 of those capped the increase at 3 percent; 5 had a lower cap and 6 had a higher. Thirteen states had no system for guaranteed increases, according to the report. STARTING RETIREMENT SALARY: This is the other element that's really important -- the amount of money you make when you begin your retirement. The Wisconsin report didn't compare starting retirement salaries. It simply catalogued the elements each state used to calculate the amount. To do the calculation, you take a worker's final average salary (usually the average of the last three, four or five years of employment), multiply that by the number of years of service, and multiply that by a percentage that varies widely. We couldn't come up with a calculation for every state. Alaska, for example, had a defined contribution plan without a multiplier. A few had a tiny multiplier combined with an annuity. In a few other cases, the report offered only enough information to make a rough guesstimate. Rhode Island, like the majority of states, based the payment on the last three years of service. But while a typical multiplier nationally was around 2 percent, Rhode Island offered 3 percent for the 21st through 34th years of employment. Only workers in Kentucky, New Mexico and New York could get that amount, or more. To get a rough comparison between states, we took the hypothetical case of an employee who was 65 years old, earned $50,000 per year, received 2-percent raises for each of the last 5 years, and was retiring in 2008 after 25 years of service. When we ran the numbers, the hypothetical Rhode Island retiree in 2008 would have received about $25,000 in his first year. Only 11 other states would have paid out more. Suddenly, we didn't rank average or below average. If we had assumed 30 years or more of state employment, Rhode Island's ranking would have been even higher, because of the benefits structure that particularly rewards those who work for the state for more than 20 years. But if we assumed just 20 years of service, Rhode Island's ranking dropped from 12th to 34th. Cenerini correctly points out that pension benefits for Rhode Island employees have been scaled back in recent years. In 2005, for anyone with less than 10 years of service, the minimum age was raised to 59. In addition, the multipliers used to calculate future retirement checks were cut back. The highest -- 3 percent -- was scaled back to max out at 2.5 percent after 30 years of service. (Those changes would not have applied to our hypothetical Rhode Island retiree.) In 2009, the retirement age was raised again, to 62, and the lower multipliers were applied to more people. In addition, the future retirement pay of many workers would be based on the last five years of service instead of the last three, and cost of living increases were tied to inflation, with a 3-percent cap. And in 2010, benefits for future retirees were further restricted: cost of living increases didn’t kick in for three years or longer and they were restricted to the first $35,000. If those changes had been in place years earlier, retirees from 36 states would have had pension checks higher than our hypothetical Rhode Islander. Cenerini said that when he asserted that Rhode Island's pension benefits were average or below average, he was comparing current features of the retirement system to the 2008 national statistics in the Wisconsin study, which offers the best data available. But because the economic crisis is not restricted to Rhode Island, we're not sure that's the best comparison. Other states have dialed back their retirement packages as well. For example, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in 2010, seven other states scaled back their cost of living increases. In short, the formulas used to determine how much a retiree received in that first check in 2008 made the Rhode Island plan, combined with the 3-percent annual cost of living increase, among the most lucrative in the nation -- if you were employed by the state for more than 20 years. If your tenure was less, the payout was well below average. Other elements of the system would give Cenerini good reason to argue that Rhode Island's state employee retiree benefits are not as good as people think. In 2008: * The amount state workers had to pay for their retirement benefits was second-highest in the country * Employees had to work longer to be eligible for retirement * Most other states let their workers retire at an earlier age or with fewer years of service than Rhode Island * When they retired, Rhode Island was one of a dozen states that fully taxed those retirement checks. But the disadvantages (from the retiree point of view) seem to be more than offset by both the larger initial payouts -- if you worked for the state longer than 20 years -- and the higher cost of living increase that were in place for most who would have retired in 2008. It is true that the benefits have how been scaled back significantly. But retirement packages in other states have been scaled back as well. We do know that in 2008, some retirees got a benefit package that was below the national average while others received above-average retirement pay. The situation may be different today, but we won't know until the 2010 numbers come out next year. So for now, we rate his statement as Half True.

pomt-05832	"We are poised to get rid of over 1,000 more regulations in 2012."	/florida/statements/2012/feb/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-will-repeal-1000-regulations-2012/	Gov. Rick Scott really doesn't like regulations, and he's been pretty clear about that since his first day in office. This year, he says he's got 1,000 regulations in his sights. "My administration eliminated burdensome regulations to make it easier to do business in Florida," he said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C. on Feb. 11, 2012. "And we're poised to get rid of over 1,000 more regulations in 2012," he added. His statement left the audience applauding and us wanting to know more. Is that repeal count right? In his first executive order Jan. 4, 2011, Scott ordered state agencies to freeze all pending administrative rules -- developed with permission from the Legislature by agencies to implement state law -- and examine existing ones that could be ripe for repeal. His campaign against rules also made the first year in office more complicated. In a brush with the Florida Supreme Court, a majority of justices argued Scott overstepped his constitutional authority by requiring a newly created office to sign off on proposed agency rules. The court didn't overturn his order, so Scott's three-person team of reviewers -- known as the Office of Fiscal Accountability and Regulatory Reform -- continued to analyze and issue recommendations on these rules and existing rules. Rules cover a lot of ground, including education, environment, elections, restaurants, barbering, interior design, real estate ... you get the point. One target was a rule related to the illegal act of dwarf-tossing, a September 2011 Tampa Bay Times story reported. A total of more than 20,000 rules are in the Florida Administrative Code. Scott's rule-reviewing office keeps track of these efforts at FloridaHasARightToKnow.com. You can see here how many rules have been identified for repeal. At one point that was above 1,000, but it's now around 800. There's no tally for how many of those have been wiped from the books (unless you look up each rule and cross-check it at www.flrules.org). So we asked Scott's staff to tally how many rules have been repealed and how many were "poised" for repeal. Since June 1, 2011, agencies have repealed 478 rules, said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz, with 173 being repealed in 2011, and 305 so far in 2012. Plus, 351 rules are progressing through the necessary procedure for repeal as set in the Administrative Procedure Act, involving notices, waiting periods and opportunities for public comment. Another 270 rules, relating primarily to water management districts, could be repealed during the 2012 legislative session. For 2012, that's 926 rules (305+350+270) that have been or are slated for repeal. Wait, there's more! Scott's not the only leader with rules on his mind. Florida legislators embarked on their own mission, ordering agencies in 2011 to review the economic impact of their rules and present biennial reports. Combining the efforts of Scott and the House gives you a bigger number: 2,210 rules and rule subsections recommended for repeal, and 1,624 recommended for revisions, according to a Feb. 13, 2012, House staff report. Most of the rules came from the departments of Environmental Protection, Health, and Business and Professional Regulation. We should be clear that we're not passing judgement on the public good of getting rid of these various rules. Frankly, the rules are too diverse to make sweeping judgments about them, and some simply wipe out rules that accompany outdated, and meaningless, statutes. Instead, we wanted to to see if Scott was accurately describing the magnitude of the changes he's pushing through. Scott is proud of his focus on eliminating state rules (even bragging about it on pre-recorded messages to callers of the governor's office placed on hold). We looked at the numbers and saw he's around where he said he would be, at 926 rules set to be repealed. But a good chunk -- 270 -- would come with the help of the Legislature. We rate this Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-02-17T10:27:22	2012-02-11	['None']
pomt-04829	Says President Obama said of the national debt, "If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition."	/florida/statements/2012/aug/16/americans-prosperity/obama-national-debt-held-accountable-one-term/	A new commercial from the conservative group Americans for Prosperity accuses Obama of breaking his promises on the national debt. The ad notes, "In 2009, Barack Obama said," then cuts to Obama: "I’m pledging to cut the deficit by half by the end of my first term in office." The words "Feb. 2009, Debt: $10 trillion" flash onscreen. A giant meter titled "the national debt clock" then appears on screen, reading $10.6 trillion. As talking heads recount the upward spiral of the nation’s debt, the clock frantically spins above $15 trillion. Obama is then heard saying, "I will be held accountable" before appearing in a video and continuing, "If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." The debt clock returns, reading in excess of $15.9 trillion with the tagline, "Let’s make this a one-term proposition on November 6th." In a voice-over, the president is heard repeating, "I will be held accountable." Well, time’s up, Mr. President. Did Obama say he would be held accountable for not halving the deficit in three years? When we went to the tape, we found Americans for Prosperity was pulling together two different interviews, and on two different topics. The deficit debate First off, it should be no secret Obama did, in fact, promise to cut the deficit in half during his first term. We’ve confirmed that before, rating that very claim by Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry quite True. That ruling pointed out the federal budget deficit -- the difference between what the government spends versus what it takes in -- was $1.4 trillion when Obama took office. It decreased each year, projected to reach $901 billion in the fiscal year 2013 budget, but that’s still over the promised amount, which would have been in the neighborhood of $700 billion. With the presence of the debt clock, Americans For Prosperity is confusing the deficit with the national debt, which is the aggregated total of the nation’s public debt, not its annual budget deficits. AFP didn’t return our request for clarification, so we can only guess if they know the difference. Most Americans don’t seem to know the specifics, either. The promise Obama made was from a White House meeting called the "Fiscal Responsibility Summit" on Feb. 23, 2009. "Today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office," Obama said. "Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." Note the phrase "we inherited" was removed from the ad’s version. That alone doesn’t make AFP’s usage of the sentence for the purposes of this attack ad untrue; Despite the president’s reasoning that high unemployment, wartime costs and the Great Recession prevented deeper cuts, budget numbers are still budget numbers. Staying on message The selective editing gets worse in the second half of the ad. Obama’s admission that the voters will likely break out the torches and pitchforks if he doesn’t follow through in three years is from a 2009 interview with Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show. It’s from Feb. 2, however, almost three weeks before his pledge to cut the deficit. And the president is speaking about the Troubled Asset Relief Program, not halving the deficit. During the interview, Lauer asked Obama if the bank bailouts he inherited would be curtailed if spending appeared to be ineffective. (President George W. Bush signed TARP into law October 2008, before Obama was elected.) "Look, I'm at the start of my administration," Obama said. "One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years, and --" "You're going to know quickly how people feel about what's happening," Lauer interjected. "That's exactly right. And, you know, a year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress, but there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." For the record, TARP officially expired in October 2010. The net cost of the program to U.S. taxpayers was reported earlier this year to be in the neighborhood of $34 billion, although questions remain as to exactly how some banks repaid the bulk of some $428 billion in disbursements and whether many banks in the program were going to survive. But no more money is being lent from the TARP fund. We should note there’s been a troubling trend this election season of campaigns splicing together unrelated or out-of-context video of a candidate’s statements. Mitt Romney’s campaign used Obama’s "you didn’t build that" quote out of context, but Democrats have also deceptively quoted Romney’s stance on his Massachusetts ban on assault weapons and dealing with foreclosures. Editing video to make a person say what you want is not a new tactic, nor is it that hard to do -- here’s a video of Obama singing Carly Rae Jepsen’s Call Me Maybe. The ruling Clearly this commercial is edited to remove references to the Bush administration and muddy the context of the president’s comments. Obama irrefutably made the promise in 2009 to slash the deficit in half by the time his first term expired, and that doesn’t look at all possible. But Americans For Prosperity overreaches, splicing together footage from two unrelated interviews to distort the message it wants to convey. Obama wasn’t talking about the deficit or the debt when he said, "If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." In this instance, the piling on is unnecessary to make the group’s point, and it’s intentionally misleading. The ad takes Obama’s comments from an interview about bank bailouts and TARP and makes it look as if he’s talking about the national debt. The use of the debt clock also purposely detracts from the president’s initial statement about the federal deficit. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13617	"Ted Strickland stands in lockstep with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby in their desire to force Americans to pay for abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, with their taxpayer dollars."	/ohio/statements/2016/aug/12/ohio-right-life/ohio-right-lifes-faulty-claims-ted-strickland-abor/	The anti-abortion group Ohio Right to Life circulated a stinging release about Democratic senate candidate (and former Ohio governor) Ted Strickland recently. "Ted Strickland stands in lockstep with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby in their desire to force Americans to pay for abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, with their taxpayer dollars," the Aug. 2 press release reads. Spokeswoman Katherine Franklin of Ohio Right to Life told PolitiFact Ohio that the 2016 Democratic platform inspired their media message. On reproductive rights, the platform reads, "We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment." Clinton’s chosen running mate, Tim Kaine, recently faced scrutiny on the subject of the Hyde amendment, which has barred federal funding for most abortions since being signed into law in 1976. In a weekend interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Kaine said that he is personally in favor of the Hyde restrictions, but would support Clinton and the party’s platform to repeal it, as vice president. Because Kaine was somewhat compromised on the issue, Franklin said, Ohio Right to Life wanted to tease out Strickland’s stance on the Hyde amendment. Ohio Right to Life has endorsed Strickland’s opponent, incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Strickland, on Hyde Congress passed the Hyde amendment three years after U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade, which upholds a woman’s right to abortion. Its sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, a Republican from Illinois, said during a congressional debate, "I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody from having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the (Medicaid) bill." By prohibiting federal funding of abortion, the Hyde restrictions primarily affect low-income women on Medicaid. Hyde acts as a rider on federal appropriations bills. As such, it doesn’t have to be "repealed" to be deactivated. Bills on federal spending could just cease to include it. Some states have Hyde-like restrictions on their Medicaid dollars, and would have to change their guidelines to open an avenue to fund abortions if Hyde disappeared at the federal level. When asked his position on the Hyde amendment, Strickland’s spokeswoman Liz Margolis told the Columbus Dispatch, that he favors getting rid of the Hyde restrictions. "Ted stands with the people of Ohio who believe that women have the right to make their own healthcare decisions, and that includes all women regardless of income," Margolis said. As a congressman in 2003, NARAL Pro-Choice America rated his voting record as in line with "pro-life" legislators. On his website, Strickland says he believes that "a woman’s healthcare choices are between a woman and her doctor," which is an indication that he favors abortion rights. But does he agree with abortions "up until the moment of birth?" Due-date abortions? PolitiFact has heard this claim before, directed at Clinton. In a New Hampshire debate in February, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said that Clinton "believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child." We rated this claim False, because abortions at the nine-month mark just don’t happen. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, told PolitiFact, "If the mother’s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives." Twenty-three states prohibit abortions after "viability," the point at which the fetus can survive outside the womb, or at about 23 weeks.The reproductive health nonprofit Guttmacher Institute reports that just 5 percent of abortions occur after 16 weeks, and 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks. A 2015 documentary followed the practices of the four remaining doctors in the country who will perform a third-trimester abortion. On-demand? Seven states and the District of Columbia have not passed time-frame restrictions on abortions. Franklin, of Ohio Right to Life, uses these as examples of places where a woman could have an "on-demand abortion." But it rarely happens that way, in practice. Even prior to viability, on-demand abortions are impossible in most of the country. Twenty-eight states have legislated waiting periods for an abortion procedure, and 14 states require physician counseling that necessitates two trips to a medical facility prior to an abortion. New Hampshire, Oregon and Vermont have the fewest abortion restrictions. But "on demand" is still a stretch, even in these states. In New Hampshire and Oregon, almost 80 percent of counties have no abortion clinic. In Vermont, there is no abortion provider in 50 percent of the counties. Taxpayer-funded abortions? The Kaiser Family Foundation determined that 13 percent of women of reproductive age are on Medicaid, compared with the 65 percent that had private insurance, as of 2014. Most states have created laws similar to the Hyde amendment and do not fund abortions for low-income women on Medicaid, but fifteen states have mechanisms to use state funds to cover abortions for Medicaid recipients. By the Kaiser Family Foundation’s count, 2.7 million women live in a state where coverage of abortion services under Medicaid, ACA Marketplace plans and/or private policies is limited to cases of rape, incest, and where the mother’s life is in danger. Were the Hyde amendment to be nixed, the number of abortions among Medicaid-eligible women would be expected to increase by approximately 33,000, or an increase of 2.5 percent, according to the Guttmacher institute. Our ruling Ohio Right to Life’s press release said, "Ted Strickland stands in lockstep with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby in their desire to force Americans to pay for abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, with their taxpayer dollars." Strickland supports the Democratic party platform, so although "lockstep" sounds sinister, it simply means Clinton and Strickland hold similar positions when it comes to abortion rights. Those positions are not accurately described by Ohio Right to Life. Abortions "on demand, up until the moment of birth" are a hypothetical non-event, according to health care professionals. As for abortions being paid for with tax dollars, this is a vast oversimplification of rules surrounding Medicaid, which provides health care for poor women. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c664b20-be6e-46f5-93f4-bb96a98299e7	None	Ohio Right to Life	None	None	None	2016-08-12T14:08:01	2016-08-02	['Ted_Strickland', 'United_States', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-06055	"What’s clear is (Romney) likes firing people."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/11/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-accuses-mitt-romney-enjoying-firing-p/	Republican primary front-runner Mitt Romney set off a firestorm on Jan. 9, 2012, when he said, "I like being able to fire people." Or, at least, when he said something along those lines. Romney’s comments, made at the Nashua, N.H., Chamber of Commerce, fed into an existing narrative, boosted by other candidates and the media, focusing on Romney’s record at Bain Capital. Supporters and critics sparred over the question of whether Bain, a private-equity firm, was a job creator or a corporate carnivore. So the notion that Romney not only fired people while at Bain but enjoyed it was catnip for news outlets in full New Hampshire primary mode. But did the critics take into account the quote’s context? Not necessarily. For instance, one of Romney’s primary opponents, Jon Huntsman, took a shot at Romney in Concord later that day. "It’s become abundantly clear over the last couple of days what differentiates Gov. Romney and me," he said, according to the New York Times. "I will always put my country first. It seems that Gov. Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov. Romney enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs. It may be that he’s slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now, and that’s a dangerous place to be." We wondered whether Huntsman was accurately portraying Romney’s remark. Once you look at the full context of Romney’s quote, it becomes clear that he was talking about the ability to get rid of a health insurance provider if its services are inadequate. "I want individuals to have their own insurance," Romney said. "That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy. It also means if you don’t like what they do, you can fire them. I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. You know, if someone doesn’t give me a good service that I need, I want to say I’m going to go get someone else to provide that service to me." So Romney wasn't referring to his work at Bain Capital -- or being a boss who relishes firing employees -- but rather the notion of switching service providers. He might as well have been talking about switching cell phone carriers or cable TV companies. Romney himself said as much later in the day: "Things can always be taken out of context. And I understand that that's what the Obama people will do. But, as you know, I was speaking about insurance companies and the need to be able to make a choice. And my comments entirely reflected that discussion, which is we should be able to choose the insurance company of our choice." Our ruling Romney certainly phrased his comment awkwardly enough to give Huntsman support for his attack. But Huntsman distorted the comment by making it sound like Romney was heartlessly firing employees. Huntsman zeroed in on the "firing people" part of Romney’s quote while ignoring the fact that Romney was talking about switching insurance companies. Worse, Huntsman said it’s "clear" that Romney feels that way. In fact, it’s not clear at all. We rate Huntsman’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-14821	"I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-helped-usher-iran-negotia/	If it weren’t for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, there likely wouldn’t yet be an Iran nuclear deal, according to the former Secretary of State . While her Republican rivals who oppose the Iran deal might use that line against her, Clinton has touted progress with Iran as one of the hallmarks of her tenure at the State Department. "I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table," she said at the MSNBC Democratic forum Nov. 6. She’s said this line a few times throughout her campaign, so we decided to dig into it. According to her campaign, Clinton was referring to her first 18 months as secretary -- from January 2009 to June 2010. During this time, U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, it’s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development. The invitation Upping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton’s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of President Barack Obama’s administration regularly spoke publicly about the topic throughout her first 18 months in office. During this time period, the State Department -- top aides and Clinton herself -- led the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official. In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran -- including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time, Obama called them "the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government." Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union, which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton’s tenure, which ended in early 2013. While the Treasury is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts "to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929." Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program. The RSVP The State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran, said Patrick Clawson, senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He added that her claim doesn’t give enough credit to other players but is essentially correct. Clawson specifically noted that he is "not a fan nor a political supporter of Clinton." The international sanction ramp-up "shocked Iran's leaders," Clawson said. "Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more -- worse -- was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks." There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation, she said. And in the absence of the United Nations resolution -- Clinton’s lobbying success -- it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said. But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted. Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton’s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration’s wishes. "Without Secretary Clinton's good diplomacy -- and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth -- you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting," Nephew said. Congress’ sanctions that affect Iran’s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton. Our ruling Clinton said, "I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table." Clinton’s claim is for the most part accurate, though a little exaggerated. During her first 18 months as secretary, the State Department was at the helm of a global effort to increase sanctions on Iran, culminating in an important U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly. And experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table. However, Clinton wasn’t singularly responsible for the sanctions, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren’t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-11-23T11:26:02	2015-11-06	['Iran']
pomt-09016	Says Rep. Ken Legler "voted against installing fire sprinklers and emergency power generators in nursing homes."	/texas/statements/2010/jul/09/boyd-richie/texas-democratic-party-chairman-says-rep-ken-legle/	In an e-mail soliciting donations to the Texas Democratic Party, Boyd Richie calls three Texas House members "tone-deaf Republicans whose agendas don’t align with Texans’ priorities." "It’s time to throw the bums out," the Democratic Party chairman writes in the June 16 blast. Among the D-designated bums: state Rep. Ken Legler, R-Pasadena, who Richie says "voted against installing fire sprinklers and emergency power generators in nursing homes." For real? That fired us up. Kirsten Gray, the party’s communications director, pointed us to a supplemental appropriations bill the House voted on in April 2009. During floor action, Rep. Kristi Thibaut, D-Houston, introduced an amendment to earmark state funds for the Department of Aging and Disability Services to determine the need for back-up generators in Texas nursing facilities, establish a priority list of facilities in case the need exceeded available state funds and allocate state aid to purchase and install the generators. Rep. Carol Kent, D-Dallas, amended the amendment (everyone still with us?) so the study and subsequent installation would also take into account fire sprinklers. Jennifer Brader, Thibaut’s chief of staff, told us Thibaut’s amendment was motivated by Hurricane Rita, which she said disrupted electric power at nursing homes on the coast. "After Rita, it was a couple weeks before everyone got their electricity back on," Brader said. "A constituent in the district brought it to Kristi’s attention." The revised amendment, penciling in about $46.7 million for the department to focus on emergency generators and sprinklers, passed 75-66. Legler was recorded as voting "no." Legler voted for the overall supplemental appropriation act — including the sprinkler amendment — which passed the House 141-5. However, the amendment was subsequently removed by the Senate Finance Committee and did not pass into law. Legler told us that he voted against the nursing home amendment because it was too vague; there were "no parameters on how to spend $47 million of taxpayers’ money," he said, including no direction on how the department would determine that facilities needed back-up generators. Legler also said he didn’t see the point in appropriating money to make improvements in nursing homes when they would soon have to do so themselves anyway. In August 2008, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services had ruled that all nursing homes had to install automatic sprinkler systems by Aug. 13, 2013. Homes are required to pay for the systems, DADS spokeswoman Allison Lowery told us. According to DADS, there are 1,165 licensed nursing homes in Texas, including 26 that do not have sprinkler systems throughout. In August 2008, 40 homes lacked sprinklers throughout and as of March 2009, shortly before the House voted on the amendment in question, 27 homes didn’t have sprinklers throughout. Lowery said the agency doesn’t have a formal plan in place to bring the 26 facilities up to code, but by 2012 facilities will need to show that they’re working to comply with CMS — getting bids from contractors to install the sprinkler system, for example. While nursing homes aren’t required to have back-up generators, Lowery said, all but a few do, because homes are required by state law to have emergency lighting. Where does this history leave Chairman Richie’s charge? All told, his statement leaves out a lot. Legler voted against an amendment that would have paid for DADS to survey which Texas nursing homes needed emergency generators and fire sprinklers and to purchase and install them. At the time of the vote, nearly all Texas nursing homes already had backup generators, according to the state, and more than 97 percent of Texas nursing homes had installed sprinklers. Remaining facilities without sprinklers were facing a federal mandate to follow suit, at their own expense; the amendment could have enabled them to do so at no cost to themselves. By implying that Legler was an opponent of nursing home safety, Richie’s statement painted the situation as far more dire and widespread than it really was. His statement is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13428	Says Charlie Crist "stood there, over 3 African-American prisoners in chains, on their knees, on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight. Saying we needed to bring it to Florida. And you did this — whether you know or not — on the eve of Juneteenth, the day the African-American community celebrates the end of slavery."	/florida/statements/2016/sep/19/david-jolly/david-jolly-attacks-charlie-crist-saying-alabama-c/	During a congressional debate, Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly attacked his Democratic opponent Charlie Crist for a proposal to bring chain gangs to Florida when Crist served as a Republican state senator. At a televised debate in St. Petersburg Sept. 19, 2016, moderators from the Tampa Bay Times and 10 News WTSP allowed the candidates to ask the other a question. Crist declined, saying he’d rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to paint a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida’s first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation. "You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in chains, on their knees, on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight. Saying we needed to bring it to Florida," Jolly said. "And you did this — whether you know or not — on the eve of Juneteenth, the day the African-American community celebrates the end of slavery." Crist replied that he was in favor of chain gangs because of the state’s high crime rate at the time (we fact-checked Crist’s rebuttal). He called Jolly’s insinuation that race had anything to do with it "appalling." Did Crist loom over black prisoners in chains and call it "a great sight"? Jolly is right about Crist taking a trip to Alabama to view work crews in that state, but his details need to be revisited. Crist in Alabama Crist earned the moniker "Chain Gang Charlie" by being a champion of bringing chained prison work crews back to Florida, a practice not used since 1946. He sponsored a state Senate bill allowing chain gangs during the 1995 legislative session. Despite criticism that making humans work in chains was inhumane and echoed the days of slavery, the idea gained traction in the state Legislature. In May 1995, he tacked his Senate bill onto an omnibus corrections bill as an amendment, and it passed. "The Department of Corrections shall implement a plan by Dec. 1, 1995, to require that selected inmates perform labor wearing leg irons in chain gang work groups," the measure read. The next month, Crist and state Corrections Secretary Harry Singletary, who had reluctantly agreed to the chain gangs provision, visited the state of Alabama, which had earlier revived the practice. Jolly said the visit was on "the eve of Juneteenth," the anniversary of the June 19, 1865, announcement of the abolition of slavery in Texas. At least one newspaper (the New Orleans Times-Picayune) did run a Cox News Service story about the visit on June 18. But Crist and Singletary actually visited Decatur, Ala., on June 8, the same day the Associated Press snapped the photograph to which Jolly is referring (see above). In the photo, Crist and Singletary are shown watching over at least four inmates having their legs chained together prior to starting work. It’s difficult to determine the races of the inmates in the 21-year-old, black and white photograph, but it was clear from coverage that the vast majority of inmates in the work program were African-American. According to the Cox News Service article, which ran in the Palm Beach Post on June 11, 1995, Crist did say he wanted to bring a similar program to Florida, but he did not call it "a great sight," as Jolly alleged. Jolly spokeswoman Sarah Bascom pointed to that article, in which the reporter wrote, "For Crist, it was a mighty fine sight." But that’s the reporter writing, not Crist talking. The story later quotes Crist as saying, "I see justice. I see justice being done." In an Associated Press story that accompanied the photo, Crist said, "I’m very impressed by what I’ve seen so far." Singletary, meanwhile, had agreed to enforce the law, but was cool to the idea of chaining prisoners together. He said during the trip that he favored chaining a prisoner’s ankles, but not linking a group of people, as Crist and other lawmakers had envisioned. (Crist’s 1997 plan to have chained groups of inmates work along state highways was not heard in committee.) Eventually, the state prison system began the program in December 1995 using only leg irons, calling the groups of inmates "restricted labor squads" instead of chain gangs. Our ruling Jolly said, Crist "stood there, over three African-American prisoners in chains, on their knees, on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight. Saying we needed to bring it to Florida. And you did this — whether you know or not — on the eve of Juneteenth, the day the African-American community celebrates the end of slavery." Jolly missed the mark on the finer points of the visit and the photograph. Crist went to Alabama to observe chain gangs in action more than a week prior to Juneteenth. He also didn’t say it was "a great sight," although he expressed his approval of the practice. He also wanted to bring the same style of chain gangs to Florida, which had just passed a law allowing it. The Department of Corrections only implemented individual leg irons later that year. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a70ef2b5-29a4-481c-9367-3307b97d5cbe	None	David Jolly	None	None	None	2016-09-19T21:21:19	2016-09-19	['Charlie_Crist', 'Juneteenth']
pomt-01009	"The reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said, ‘You know what? We should start colleges.’ "	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/03/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-politicians-get-credit-founding-/	President Barack Obama recently went around the mainstream media and offered sit-down interviews to a trio of YouTube celebrities -- Bethany Mota, GloZell Green and Hank Green. The interviews were live-streamed on Jan. 22, 2015. In the interview, Mota -- a California teen who makes "videos about hair, makeup, fashion, DIY projects, and basically anything that I love" -- asked Obama, "Why should the younger generation be interested in politics, and why should it matter to them?" Here’s how Obama answered: "Well, basically, politics is just -- how do we organize ourselves as a society? How do we make decisions about how we're going to live together? So, young people care about how college is paid for. Well, the truth of the matter is, the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said, ‘You know what? We should start colleges.’ Dating back to Abraham Lincoln, who started something called the land-grant colleges. He understood that government should invest in people being able to get an education and the tools to succeed. You guys are going to be the ones who are using these colleges and universities, and if they are not getting enough funding from government, and your tuition goes up, and you've got more debt, you're the ones affected. So you'd better have a voice and know what's going on about who's making decisions about that." A reader asked us to check out the claim that "the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said, ‘You know what? We should start colleges.’ " Initially, we wondered whether checking this claim would amount to an unfair "gotcha" game, but we were persuaded to rate it after hearing from higher-education historians who found Obama’s claim problematic. The White House told PolitiFact that Obama was basing his claim on the federal government’s longstanding role in creating land-grant colleges, which began with enactment of the Morrill Act on July 2, 1862. The purpose of the law "was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies, so members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education," according to the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. The term "land grant" stems from the granting of federal lands to states for the creation of universities. By citing the Morrill Act, the White House has a point. Since 1862, the act has been used to establish more than 100 land-grant colleges in all 50 states, plus additional institutions in U.S. territories. They include such major institutions of higher education as Cornell, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ohio State, Penn State, Texas A&M and the University of Wisconsin. "The fact is, politicians get enormous credit for creating our public universities, and most notably the land-grant colleges," said Barry Toiv, the vice president for public affairs at the Association of American Universities. "It's one of the country's great, democratic, truly American accomplishments." Still, despite the clear achievements of the Morrill Act, Obama outstrips the evidence when he says that "politicians" are "the reason we even have colleges." To start, we looked at the data for public colleges vs. private colleges, as well as the enrollment for each. For institutions, data from the federal Education Department shows that, among four-year institutions, fully 77 percent of them are private. The rate is lower for two-year institutions -- 45 percent are private -- but if you include both categories, it works out to 66 percent private. Since private universities were not typically established by "politicians," this data shows that just one-third of institutions of higher education have a good claim to having been created by "politicians." As it happens, private colleges tend to be smaller than public colleges, so the data for enrollment skews more strongly toward public institutions. But even if you measure by enrollment, private institutions comprise a significant minority, undercutting Obama's sweeping claim. For four-year institutions, 40 percent of enrollment is at private institutions, and for two-year institutions, 6 percent of enrollment is at private institutions. Overall, 28 percent of enrollment is at private universities. It’s also worth noting that many colleges and universities were established in the United States -- and even in colonial America -- before the Morrill Act was passed. More than 70 colleges and universities were founded in what is now the United States prior to 1862, including seven of the eight Ivy League schools (the only exception being Cornell, a land-grant school). More than a dozen universities considered public were established prior to 1862, including the University of North Carolina, the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia. Historians of American higher education told PolitiFact that, in their view, Obama’s description is glib enough to demand a correction. John R. Thelin, a professor at the University of Kentucky and author of A History of American Higher Education, said it’s not even entirely accurate to claim credit for politicians in the founding of "state" schools. "I doubt many of the ‘public (or, ‘state’) colleges and universities were founded by politicians," Thelin said. "Usually some individual or group petitioned and prodded to obtain a charter for the state university. Often, some politicians opposed and obstructed such initiative." More than a century ago in South Carolina, Thelin said, populist lawmaker "Pitchfork Ben" Tillman wanted to close down the elite University of South Carolina, while in the 1920s and 1930s, the University of Georgia continually had to defend itself against a governor who wanted to punish and close down the state university. Meanwhile, in New Hampshire in the early 19th century, a hostile state Legislature wanted to take away Dartmouth College’s charter, he said. Roger L. Geiger, an education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II, went so far as to say that Obama’s comment is "an egregious misstatement" that "reflects supreme ignorance of higher education." "Most American colleges and universities were founded when groups of private individuals decided, ‘We should start a college," Geiger said. Geiger said that many urban universities, such as those in Akron and Youngstown, were privately founded; only later were these schools taken over by their states. Temple and Pitt also fall into this category, he said. The pattern of privately founded colleges later being taken over by state governments is clear in the history of "normal schools," the institutions that are now called teachers’ colleges. While some states, such as Illinois, Michigan and New York did establish public normal schools, many other such schools were established privately, including institutions in Pennsylvania and Indiana. After World War II, many of these private normal schools became regional state universities, Geiger said. "Typically the expansion of state systems occurred through the takeover of existing, privately founded institutions," he said. Our ruling Obama said "the reason we even have colleges is that at some point there were politicians who said, ‘You know what? We should start colleges.’ " Even allowing for some oversimplification in a live interview, Obama is exaggerating. Public colleges and universities are a distinct minority of all such institutions, and while they comprise a majority of enrollment nationally, private schools account for a significant minority of enrollment. Meanwhile, historians of American higher education note that even in the case of "public" universities, "politicians" can’t automatically claim credit. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rated it Mostly False.

pomt-14227	Statistics show "you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver" in Austin than a driver for a ride-hailing service.	/texas/statements/2016/apr/15/ellen-troxclair/ellen-troxclair-lacks-facts-behind-claim-about-sex/	An Austin City Council member made a honk-the-horn statement about passenger assaults as she advocated for voter approval of a proposition that would shrink what the city requires in background checks of drivers who work with ride-hailing services. If approved, the proposal on Austin’s May 7, 2016, ballot would rescind a city ordinance requiring ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft to submit drivers to background checks that include fingerprinting. The revised mandate, preferred by the services, would require background checks but not fingerprinting--unlike what the city requires of taxi drivers and ride-for-hire workers like shuttle, limousine and pedicab drivers. The pro-proposition member, Ellen Troxclair, opened by saying "ride-sharing is safe" during her appearance at an April 10, 2016, forum hosted by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area. Troxclair, who represents District 8 in southwest Austin, elaborated: "The truth is, if you look at the statistics, based on when TNCs came to town and today, you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver." TNC means a Transportation Network Company summoned through a mobile phone app. "Let me say that again," Troxclair said. "When you look at the number of taxi drivers and the number of TNC drivers and the number of complaints that APD," the Austin Police Department, "has received over that time, you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver." Is this so? We ultimately found no one can definitively rule on the relative chances of an assault resulting from riding in an Austin taxi versus a ride-hailed vehicle. Meantime, experts on statistics agreed that Troxclair relied on the wrong indicators to reach her dramatic conclusion. Those analysts included Matthew Hersh, a University of Texas lecturer and proposition opponent who called the calculation fueling Troxclair’s statement one of the worst misrepresentations of statistics he’s seen. Austin Police Department data To our request for Troxclair's backup information, her aide Michael Searle emailed a document he said Troxclair received from the Austin Police Department listing all reported complaints to the police about assaults in taxi cabs or ride-hailed vehicles since 2014. Searle told us Troxclair’s office fielded the APD document in a Jan. 27, 2016, email from Brian Manley, APD’s chief of staff, who wrote: "Please find attached the information you requested on sexual assault allegations against cab drivers and TNC drivers." Manley’s email also included a cautionary note about making safety comparisons based on the raw counts--a note he re-sounded when we asked him about the council member’s "nine times" analysis. His email to Troxclair’s office said: "Keep in mind these are only allegations of a crime, not cases that have been prosecuted," he said. "Also, it is hard to say whether there are more allegations against cab drivers than TNC drivers because we don't know how many rides each provider gave in a given year so we cannot come up with a rate, only the raw number." The document lists 37 reported incidents from Feb. 26, 2014, through Jan. 21, 2016, breaking out to 14 complaints about cabs, 21 complaints tied to vehicles driven for Uber or Lyft and two complaints related to "independent" ride-hailed vehicles. Each date-and-time entry indicates a crime ranging from assault "sexual nature" to sexual assault to rape. Noted: The presented timeframe rolled in a stretch of months before ride-hailing services were city-approved though Searle pointed out that the council approved a resolution in March 2013 stating Austinites had been using phone apps to share rides. Uber has said it routinely offered rides in Austin starting in June 2014. But it wasn’t until October 2014 that the council gave permission to the Uber and Lyft companies to operate, effective a month later. If we limit our focus to the 15 months through January 2016 that taxi cabs and ride-hailing services each rolled with city permission, APD's count of cab-connected assault complaints decreases to six. Shrinking the timeframe leaves unchanged the 23 assault complaints the department lists as related to ride-hailed vehicles. Troxclair’s equation So, how did Troxclair reach her conclusion about the chances of an Austin assault being nine times higher with a cab driver? Searle wrote: "If the estimate is that there are 15,000 TNC drivers, subject to name-based background checks, and there are 913 cab permits, subject to fingerprint background check, then you are 9 times more likely to be assaulted by a cab driver than a TNC driver in Austin." A city spokesman, Bryce Bencivengo, told us by phone the city had issued 915 cab permits at the time Troxclair spoke at the forum though he also said that shouldn’t be read as a count of taxi drivers. Bencivengo said the city also has fielded figures from Uber and Lyft indicating their respective counts of Austin drivers, but each company also says the tallies are proprietary, not to be released to the public. We asked Uber and Lyft for such counts; an Uber spokeswoman, Jaime Moore, said by email it has 15,000 Austin-area drivers, though she later said it’s accurate to say it has over 10,000 drivers in that the count fluctuates. Searle said Troxclair reached her "nine times" conclusion by dividing the 14 cab-connected complaints since June 2014 by the 913 cab permits (getting 0.015) and comparing that to what you get from juxtaposing the 23 ride-hail complaints versus 15,000 ride-hail drivers in Austin (or 0.0015) -- which actually suggests a 10-fold difference. Other analysts We ran Troxclair’s equation and statement past experts on statistics, each of whom flinched. Hersh, who told us he’s donated services to an anti-proposition group, brought up the timeline weakness in considering several months when taxi cabs were legally operating but ride-hailing services were not. He further said it’s not logical to assume driver counts deliver sufficient information to reach relative safety conclusions. Separately, Rachelle Wilkinson, an adjunct professor of statistics at Austin Community College, said the calculations offered by Troxclair aren’t valid ways to gauge the relative incidences of sexual assaults. It’s "comparing apples to oranges (number of sexual assault reports to number of drivers)," Wilkinson said by email. "A much more valid way to look at the data would be to compare the sexual assault reports to the number of rides given---NOT the number of drivers. Taxi drivers tend to drive as their profession or job whereas ride-hailing drivers often do it on the side." That is, the number of rides "given by taxi drivers is likely much higher (per driver) than the number of rides given by ride-hailing drivers (per driver)," Wilkinson wrote, adding that ride counts didn’t appear to be part of Troxclair’s backup. Also, Wilkinson suggested, the probability of such assaults appears to be extremely small whether riding in a taxi or a ride-hailed car, she wrote. Carol Gee, a math professor at Austin’s St. Edward’s University, similarly said by email that from the perspective of a passenger seeking a safe ride, "it is likely more appropriate to measure safety by the number of incidents per trip, rather than the number of incidents per driver." But absent trip data, the experts concurred, there isn’t a fact-backed justification for Troxclair’s statement. Comparisons possible? So, is there a way to compare the chances of assault in the different kinds of rides? Hersh suggested we consult Julio Gonzalez Altamirano, who writes the Keep Austin Wonky blog. By phone and email, Altamirano noted that Austin ride-hailing services lately carry 200,000 "riders" a month, according to a pro-proposition video ad posted April 7, 2016. Meantime, he noted, the Austin Business Journal earlier posted data leading him to estimate there were about 353,000 Austin taxi riders a month in a recent 12-month period. Still, Altamirano said, passenger estimates don’t speak to the types or lengths of trips in taxi cabs versus ride-hailed vehicles. "The more relevant measure for risk assessment is the share of trips or or time spent in vehicle that lead to an incident. We also have to account for potential differences in the underlying populations," Altamirano said. "If almost everybody that takes a taxi is a businessperson going from or to the airport, there might be fewer drunk men and women relative to" passengers in ride-hailed vehicles. "If so, assessing the true risk of each service gets more complicated," he said. "And given that there are millions of trips for both services and a relatively small number of reported incidents, it's very hard to feel confident that there are any clear patterns." We reached out to Uber and Lyft about Troxclair’s statement, also asking for data on trip counts and lengths. By email, Uber’s Moore said Uber trip counts are "not public." A Lyft contact didn’t respond. We also heard back from Troxclair, who stressed by phone that she was clear at the forum that she was qualifying her conclusion by saying it was based on the driver counts for taxi cabs and ride-hailing services. She agreed it would be helpful to have detailed trip-count information. Our ruling Troxclair said statistics show "you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver" in Austin than a driver for a ride-hailing service. This claim shakes out to dividing oranges into apples and getting grapefruits--a ridiculous notion. Vital data, at the least about the number and length of trips by taxi cabs or ride-hailed vehicles, remains to be seen, making it impossible to definitively say which type of driver or ride more likely risks an assault. It's also worth mention that the chances of assault in either seem very low. This leaves the "nine times" statement incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-02715	Says President Barack Obama "came into office very concerned about" wiretappings but "then he became president of the United States, he got all the briefings … (and) he decided … the balance is probably pretty appropriately struck."	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/22/bill-kristol/was-barack-obama-against-wiretapping-he-was-it/	Pundits got their turn Sunday to weigh in on the news of the week regarding the National Security Agency’s once-secret surveillance programs, dissecting recommendations to restrict the program from an advisory panel and a ruling from a federal judge that the phone data collection program is likely unconstitutional. Was the news of the week a validation of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, an obvious affirmation of Americans’ privacy rights? On ABC’s This Week, conservative pundit Bill Kristol seemed to downplay the events of the week, calling the judge’s ruling an outlier. "I don’t agree with all the stuff, ‘Thank God for Edward Snowden, we wouldn’t be having this debate.’ We had a big debate in Congress on this in 2006, 2007, and in fact we passed legislation in 2007. We had a big debate about this, President (Barack) Obama discussed this. President Obama is a constitutional law professor, he came into office very concerned about the terrible ..." ABC political analyst Matthew Dowd jumped in as Kristol spoke to say Obama’s performance in this area is "exceedingly disappointing." "I’m sorry, then he became president of the United States," Kristol replied. "He got all the briefings, he saw seriously what was going on, and basically he decided, I think, correctly, that you know what, the balance is probably pretty appropriately struck. Now he’s shifting ... entirely because of optics." PunditFact wanted to know if Kristol is correct about Obama’s evolution on government spying programs. Obama in the Senate In his early years in the Senate, Obama was a reliable critic of the post-Sept. 11 surveillance efforts launched by President George W. Bush. In 2005, the New York Times exposed a Bush executive order allowing the National Security Agency to tap Americans’ international phone calls and emails in effort to track terrorists without seeking search warrants from the courts. The Times reported the agency was still seeking warrants for monitoring domestic communications. As the Senate voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act that same week, Obama decried the administration’s "fishing expedition" of Americans’ everyday electronic records in a floor speech: "This is just plain wrong. ... Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing – and it’s the right thing – but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for." In a 2006 speech explaining why he would vote against confirming Michael Hayden as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2006, Obama said: "We don’t expect the president to give the American people every detail about a classified surveillance program. But we do expect him to place such a program within the rule of law, and to allow members of the other two co-equal branches of government — Congress and the Judiciary — to have the ability to monitor and oversee such a program." And: "We need to find a way forward to make sure that we can stop terrorists while protecting the privacy, and liberty, of innocent Americans. As a nation we have to find the right balance between privacy and security, between executive authority to face threats and uncontrolled power. What protects us, and what distinguishes us, are the procedures we put in place to protect that balance, namely judicial warrants and congressional review. ... These are concrete safeguards to make sure surveillance hasn’t gone too far." Obama as a candidate for president Fast forward to 2007. Obama is running for president -- and still criticizing Bush for operating without enough oversight. He said the Bush administration "puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we provide." According to the Des Moines Register (via National Review Online), he said, "When I am president, there will be no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war." The next year, however, he faced charges of flip-flopping on warrantless wiretapping by his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain. At issue was legislation in 2008 that rewrote the rules of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that lays out rules for spying in the country and created a secret court of judges to oversee it. Congress amended the law amid backlash. One of the most controversial questions was whether to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that had turned over network data to the government, as the companies were vulnerable to lawsuits following the Times exposé. Obama’s campaign said he would oppose a bill that provided retroactive immunity for the companies. But he ended up joining 68 senators who voted for it, disappointing some on the left as well as advocates of civil liberties. The changes to FISA in 2008 essentially legalized warrantless wiretapping that had been going on, Molly Bishop Shadel, an expert in foreign intelligence law at the University of Virginia School of Law, previously told PunditFact. "Congress expanded the scope of FISA even though it knew or should have known that the NSA had done something questionable," she said. Obama defended his vote to supporters by saying the new law includes checks and balances that weren’t in place before. "Senator Obama has said before that the compromise bill is not perfect," his campaign said in a statement at the time. "Given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill, and losing important surveillance tools, Senator Obama chose to support the FISA compromise." Obama explained the bill "is far better than the Protect America Act that I voted against last year... (because it) makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the FISA court." Still, PolitiFact rated McCain’s claim that Obama flip-flopped after promising to filibuster a bill that provided retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies as True. Obama as president No substantial legislative oversight has been added to the Patriot Act since Obama took over the White House. Obama signed a five-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act in December 2012. The Senate rejected amendments that would have required intelligence agencies to report more information about their work to Congress. Following Snowden’s revelations, Obama defended two surveillance programs using some of the language Kristol mentioned. "You can't have 100 percent security and also have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a government," Obama said. "You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, I think we've struck the right balance." We’ll close by looking at Obama’s performance on campaign promises on this subject, including his promise to update the FISA law so there is greater congressional oversight and his promise to "revisit the Patriot Act to ensure that there is real and robust oversight of tools like National Security letters, sneak-and-peek searches, and the use of the material witness provision." Obama said he would restrict warrantless wiretapping by strengthening intelligence agencies’ accountability to Congress, which is rated Compromise. Obama signed a reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2011 that did not include more oversight, though his Justice Department did voluntarily move to add additional measures included in a bill that failed in the Senate. Obama also promised to "revisit the Patriot Act to ensure that there is real and robust oversight of tools like National Security Letters, sneak-and-peek searches, and the use of the material witness provision," which PolitiFact also rated as a Compromise. Our ruling Kristol said Obama "came into office very concerned about" wiretappings but "then he became president of the United States, he got all the briefings … (and) he decided … the balance is probably pretty appropriately struck." That’s true, to a point. Obama’s concerns for Bush-era surveillance tactics have certainly dwindled since he took office -- and he has defended ongoing, recently exposed confidential surveillance programs. But Obama’s opinions shifted even before he moved into the White House. Most notably, he voted for a bill that essentially approved warrantless wiretapping in July 2008. The shift was so notable that his presidential rival at the time called him a flip-flopper. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-10627	Barack Obama's middle name is Mohammed and he's a "covert" Muslim.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/11/chain-email/not-a-muslim-not-mohammed/	An anonymous chain e-mail claims Barack Obama could be a covert Muslim and his middle name is Mohammed. (For more on this e-mail and its claims, read our story here .) First off, Barack Obama's middle name is not Mohammed; it's Hussein. He was named after his father, a Kenyan who came to the United States from Africa as a student. The e-mail also raises the possibility that Obama is a "covert" Muslim at the same time it attacks his membership in the Trinity United Church of Christ, a Christian denomination. This claim seems contradictory at best. Earlier this year, Obama spokeman Robert Gibbs said, "To be clear, Senator Obama has never been a Muslim, was not raised a Muslim, and is a committed Christian who attends the United Church of Christ in Chicago." We find this claim to be so wrong we give it our Pants on Fire rating. UPDATE: Barack Obama resigned from Trinity United Church of Christ on May 31, 2008, after church pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. made controversial remarks about U.S. foreign policy and other matters. Obama said he intends to join another church after the election.

pomt-13353	On Tim Kaine: "In exchange for campaign contributions, he appointed a radical jihadi to the Virginia Immigration Commission."	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/03/chain-email/chain-email-spreads-bogus-claim-kaine-appointed-ra/	A chain email says of Tim Kaine: "In exchange for campaign contributions, he appointed a radical jihadi to the Virginia Immigration Commission." A reader sent us a copy of the Sept. 21 email and asked if it’s true. No group or individual takes credit for the email, but its content is a verbatim copy of a 20-paragraph blog that was posted July 25 by American Thinker, a conservative website. The blog was headlined "Clinton’s VP pick Kaine: Promoting jihadis in America in exchange for cash." The blog names Esam S. Omeish, a Fairfax County surgeon and Muslim activist, as the jihadi with whom Kaine had a "quid pro quo" relationship. Omeish, born in Libya, has lived in Virginia since 1982 and is a U.S. citizen. He’s been chief of the division of general surgery at Inova Alexandria Hospital since 2006. In August 2007, Kaine, then governor, appointed Omeish and nine others to the Virginia Commission on Immigration, a new panel that was set up to advise Kaine on state immigration policies. A month later, Kaine was on a radio show when a caller complained about Omeish’s appointment, saying the surgeon had made controversial statements about jihad and Israel. Kaine said he was unaware of the statements and would look into them. Later that day, Kaine announced that Omeish had resigned from the commission at his urging. Newspapers reported then that the controversy sprang from internet-posted speeches Omeish had given as president of the Muslim American Society, a nonprofit set up to promote charitable, religious and educational causes. In December 2000, Omeish spoke at a rally across the street from the White House protesting Israel’s occupation of Jerusalem. He told the crowd, "... you have learned the way and you have known that jihad is the way to liberate your land." At an August 2006 rally in Washington, when Israel was fighting a border war with Lebanon, Omeish criticized the "Israeli war machine." He called the Israeli action "criminal" and accused the nation of "massacre and genocide against the Palestinian people." Omeish called on people "not to allow an Israeli agenda that controls our Congress and holds us hostage." The day after Kaine ousted him from the commission in 2007, Omeish held a news conference. He said his call for jihad came before the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center and, in using the term, was referring the concept of Islamic struggle rather than a holy war. Omeish said the word "jihad" can be misunderstood in a post 9/11 environment. The Merriam-Webster dictionary says the full definition of "jihad" is "a holy war based on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; also: a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline." As for Israel, Omeish said he favored a two-state government in the city with Israel and Palestine. "It is not a call for violence. We never condone terrorists," Omeish said of his speeches. Kaine, in a prepared statement announcing Omeish’s resignation, praised him as a "respected physician and community leader." A spokesman for Kaine said then that the governor was concerned Omeish’s controversial comments would "distract" the commission’s work. The spokesmen also said the governor’s office would improve its vetting of potential political appointees. We tried to reach Omeish, but he did not reply to messages we left with personnel at his office. The money The email, based on American Thinker’s blog, says Kaine appointed Omeish "in exchange for campaign contributions." American Thinker, in making that claim, points to a July 23 blog posted by the Clarion Project, a nonprofit that says it’s "dedicated to exposing the dangers of Islamist extremism while providing a platform for the voices of moderation and promoting grassroots activism." Clarion’s effort to establish a quid-pro-quo link starts with the New Dominion PAC - an organization founded by Arab-Virginians that contributes almost exclusively to state and local Democrats. The blog notes that the PAC from 2003 to 2005 contributed $43,050 to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign, a figure we confirmed through records kept by the Virginia Public Access Project. The blog offers no evidence that the money came in exchange for Omeish’s appointment which, again, didn’t occur until 2007. And records show that Omeish never has contributed money to the PAC. Clarion also seeks to link a payback through the International Institute of Islamic Thought, a Fairfax County-based think tank whose stated goal is "to bridge the intellectual divide between Islamic tradition and western civilization." The Washington Post reported in 2006 that a federal grand jury was investigating whether the institute and other Islamic organizations in Northern Virginia were financing terrorist organizations. The blog notes that in May 2011, the institute donated $10,000 to the New Dominion PAC - the organization which years earlier given money to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign. Kaine’s term as governor ended in January 2010 - more than a year before the institute’s contribution to the PAC. The New Dominion PAC did not contribute money to Kaine’s successful 2012 campaign for the U.S. Senate; it was ineligible to give money to a federal candidate, because it never registered with the Federal Election Commission. Records show Omeish never personally contributed money to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign or his Senate campaign. We should note that a small money link can be traced between Omeish and the International Institute for Islamic Thought. In 2009, Omeish ran unsuccessfully in a Democratic primary for a Fairfax seat in the House of Delegates. The institute contributed $3,500 to the campaign - a small fraction of the $143,734 Omeish raised. We found no record, in contrast, of Omeish contributing money to the institute. Our ruling A chain email, based on postings by two conservative blogs, says that Kaine "in exchange for campaign contributions … appointed a radical jihadi to the Virginia Immigration Commission." This refers to a 2007 appointment. The appointee, Esam Omeish, a surgeon and Muslim activist, said in a 2000 speech that the "jihad way is the way to liberate your land." Kaine, when told of the comment seven years later, immediately obtained Omeish’s resignation from the panel. In the aftermath, Omeish said the word jihad has several meanings, and that he was referring to it as an Islamic concept of personal struggle - not a call for holy war. As for the supposed payoff, the email refers to $43,050 in contributions that the New Dominion PAC, representing Arab-Virginians, made to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign years before Kaine created the advisory commission and appointed Omeish to it. It also refers to $10,000 the PAC - not Kaine -- received from an Islamic nonprofit group four years after the appointment. Kaine was out of office at the time, and there’s no evidence he benefitted from the donation. Federal laws, in fact, barred that money from being advanced to Kaine’s U.S. Senate campaign in 2012. So the claim that Kaine appointed Omeish "in exchange" for political money is based on flimsy happenstance, not fact. We rate it False.

pomt-00250	"Dark money is paying for over 80 percent of (Kavanaugh’s) ads."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/05/jon-tester/how-much-dark-money-fueling-kavanaugh-confirmation/	Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., waded into Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination and the millions of dollars that has been spent both for and against the would-be justice. "Dark money is paying for over 80 percent of (Kavanaugh’s) ads," Tester said in Sept. 29 debate. Tester has said he would vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Much of that funding has taken the form of "dark money," which refers to political spending by unknown donors for the purpose of influencing public opinion. We found no one who knows how much money in total has been spent in support of Kavanaugh's nomination. On top of that, the dark money groups aren't required in most cases to report their expenditures. But many of those organizations like the publicitly and announce that they're spending millions to get Kavanaugh on the court. And those amounts are substantial. Amount of 'dark money' unknown Tester’s campaign pointed us to a slew of announcements from eight groups that are funding pro-Kavanaugh ads. Here’s their tally as of Oct. 2: Funding for pro-Kavanaugh ads Group Amount Judicial Crisis Network > $6 million Great America Alliance ~ $4.5 million America First Policies ~ $2 million NRA-ILA > $1 million Americans for Prosperity > $1 million Citizens United > $250,000 45Committee $650,000 Great America PAC $448,000 TOTAL: ~ $15.84 million With the possible exception of Great America PAC, none of these groups needs to disclose their donors or their expenditures. In addition to data flagged by Tester’s campaign, the Brennan Center for Justice compiled data from the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks television ad buys in national markets. Here's their list of pro-Kavanaugh ads as of Oct. 3: Kantar Media data (via Brennan Center for Justice; current as of Oct. 3) Judicial Crisis Network $3,692,730 NRA-ILA $1,243,070 America First Policies $1,109,950 State Government Leadership Foundation $473,230 One Nation $404,440 45Committee $118,490 Citizens United $27,490 Great America PAC $5,550 TOTAL: $7.07 million To be clear, this is an estimate of dark money spending. However, groups like the National Republican Congressional Committee have also spent on advertisements in support of Kavanaugh. Such groups do have to disclose their donors and expenditures, but don't need to do so until the next deadline for the Federal Elections Commission. That means no one can put together a total ad budget favoring Kavanaugh. Without those reports, no one can have a complete accounting of the pro-Kavanaugh ad spending. Nevertheless, this type of spending played a significant role in the Kavanaugh confirmation fight, said Anna Massoglia, an analyst who tracks the flow of dark money at the Center for Responsive Politics. " 'Dark money' does make up a substantial portion of spending on the Supreme Court confirmation fight," she said. "But I would be reluctant to classify all spending on Kavanaugh as 'dark money' due to the structure of some of the entities spending on ads." Our ruling Tester said, "Dark money is paying for over 80 percent of (Kavanaugh’s) ads." We did our best to tally up the outside spending on the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. But it’s difficult if not impossible to conclusively say how much money is involved. Experts said dark money comprises a substantial portion of spending on the Supreme Court confirmation fight. It’s even possible dark money makes up 80 percent or more of the overall share, as Tester said. But we simply can’t be sure. Neither can Tester. And his precise-sounding statement leaves out that important context. We rate this statement Half True.	None	Jon Tester	None	None	None	2018-10-05T15:05:08	2018-10-04	['None']
pomt-11998	"NFL fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million each for skipping national anthem."	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/25/thelastlineofdefenseorg/nfls-goodell-didnt-say-he-would-fine-steelers-play/	A fake news story that said players for Pittsburgh’s NFL team were being fined seven figures for remaining in the locker room during the Star-Spangled Banner is the work of a self-described liberal troll looking to fool conservatives. A story posted Sept. 24, 2017, on TheLastLineOfDefense.org ran with the headline, "Breaking: NFL fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m each for skipping national anthem." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially bogus, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post noted that "everyone fell in line" with President Donald Trump’s Twitter demand that NFL players "stop disrespecting our Flag & Country" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America. The website ran an excerpt from a real ABC News story about the Steelers largely electing to not leave the locker room during the song during their Sept. 24 game against the Chicago Bears. More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism. Then the post said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell "announced shortly after the game began that every player who ‘protested’ the National Anthem and showed ‘immense disrespect to our nation’ would be fined a cool million dollars." That isn’t the case, because the article is fake. The same story was reported in posts on many other websites, many without attribution to TheLastLineOfDefense.org. That’s important to note, because TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs only fabricated stories. A footer note on the bottom of the page said "everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction." The site’s "about us" page included a disclaimer that read, "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." TheLastLineOfDefense.org is the source of dozens upon dozens of fake news stories. The website is the brainchild of a man named Christopher Blair, who has told PolitiFact he writes absurd claims strictly to trick conservative readers into believing wild stories. In this case, the website attempted to trick readers into thinking the NFL was punishing the Steelers for refusing to come onto the field for the Star-Spangled Banner. Former Army Ranger Alejandro Villanueva, who served for three tours in Afghanistan, was the only Steelers player to leave the locker room to stand for the anthem. The Tennessee Titans and Seattle Seahawks, who played each other in Nashville, also refused to come to the sidelines for the song. It’s not clear who wrote the Goodell story, as the author is only identified as "Freedom." The author replied to an email we sent but would not provide their real name. In reality, Goodell didn’t fine any team or player, and told Sports Illustrated he supported the teams and players. "The way we reacted today, and this weekend, made me proud," Goodell said.

pomt-09267	Says Texas General Land Office “has earned the school children of Texas $451,932.89 on wind leases that haven't produced a watt of energy."	/texas/statements/2010/apr/30/jerry-patterson/land-commissioner-jerry-patterson-says-wind-leases/	Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner seeking re-election this year, champions the prospect of gathering electricity from ocean winds in a recent column in the Austin American-Statesman even though no wind turbines have been built in the Gulf of Mexico. “Regardless of any delays,” Patterson says in the column published Tuesday, “the Land Office has earned the school children of Texas $451,932.89 on wind leases that haven’t produced a watt of energy.” Half a mil for school kids without producing electricity? We wondered if Patterson was sparking on extra cylinders. Responding, Patterson said that since the state started leasing the rights to erect wind turbines in about 163,000 acres of Gulf waters in 2005, two companies have paid in the cited money in bonus royalties and delay rentals even though no wind turbines have been built. Land office spokesman Jim Suydam said the total, paid to the state since January 2005, also reflects nomination fees, application fees and interest earned on the collected money. Suydam said nomination fees are what someone pays to nominate a tract of state land for an energy lease. The state then puts the tract up for bid, with the high bidder winning the lease. Rental or bonus payments are the amount someone pays (as determined by their lease with the state) to lease the tract of land for a period of time. Application fees are what they pay to apply for the lease. The agency shared a breakdown showing $44,117 of the total Patterson touts came from leaseholders of acreage on land where turbines have not yet been built. That makes the total income from Gulf leases $407,815. We nudged Patterson about saying he "earned the school children of Texas money” -- does he mean kids are getting checks from the state? “Of course not,” Patterson said. “I don’t think anybody would believe I meant the school children get a check.” (Indeed, land commissioners traditionally mention the "schoolchildren of Texas" in connection with proceeds from state-owned lands; it's hallowed parlance.) Patterson said the described proceeds—like mineral royalties from state lands—went instead to the Permanent School Fund, the state's public education endowment, which had a $22.6 billion balance as of the end of August. The State Board of Education receives a share of earnings from the fund for distribution to school districts on a per-student basis. Also, districts use the fund to back bonds for capital projects, according to the endowment's 2009 annual report. We rate Patterson’s statement as True.

And he doesn't support the human life amendment, which is most amazing because that's been a part of the Republican platform since 1980."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/27/mike-huckabee/the-facts-behind-the-numbers/	Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister and the former governor of Arkansas, has been trying to win over the same social and religious conservatives that Thompson is wooing, and abortion is a big issue for many of them. Huckabee's claim here is technically true: As a U.S. senator from Tennessee from 1994 to 2002, Thompson never earned a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest and most politically powerful antiabortion group. The group grades each member of Congress on their votes on its key issues, and Thompson's grades, at times, appeared downright dismal: During the last session he served in Congress, 2000 to 2002, he earned a grade of just 33 percent from Right to Life. In 2000, the group gave him a 77. In 1998, his grade was 87. In 1996, he scored 86 percent. But Thompson wasn't losing points for his position on so-called life issues. Rather, he was penalized mainly for supporting a series of campaign finance reform bills that limited how much outside interest groups could give to political parties, and when they could advertise during election campaigns. Many advocacy groups, including National Right to Life, opposed these bills on grounds that they would thwart their influence on Capitol Hill. On issues dearest to the antiabortion movement -- abortion rights, fetal tissue research, cloning, euthanasia and the like -- Thompson was solidly with them. In fact, his staunch opposition to those practices helped earn him the endorsement this month from the National Right to Life Committee, which boasts 3,000 chapters in 50 states. His record includes a vote against a resolution supporting Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that requires all states to permit abortion, and he consistently voted for a ban on late-term abortion, called partial-birth abortion, except when the life of the mother -- not her health - is at stake. He voted to ban abortions in U.S. military hospitals and clinics, voted to block federal funding for assisted suicide, and voted to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion. "He's got a very pro-life record, and that was a big part of our endorsement – it's not just talking the talk, but walking the walk," David O'Steen, executive director of National Right to Life, said of Thompson recently. "He was there, and he wasn't one of the members that vacillated and you wondered where he was going to be. He was solid." As for Huckabee's claim that Thompson doesn't support a constitutional amendment banning abortion nationwide, that's true. Thompson has consistently opposed such an amendment. He has said he would like the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, but that each state should then be able to decide whether to allow abortion. Consider this exchange on the Nov. 4 edition of NBC's Meet the Press with Tim Russert: Thompson: I think people ought to be free at state and local levels to make decisions that even Fred Thompson disagrees with. That's what freedom is all about. And I think the diversity we have among the states, the system of federalism we have where power is divided between the state and the federal government is, is, is—serves us very, very well. I think that's true of abortion. I think Roe v. Wade hopefully one day will be overturned, and we can go back to the pre-Roe v. Wade days. But... Russert: Each state would make their own abortion laws? Thompson: Yeah. But ... to have an amendment compelling — going back even further than pre-Roe v. Wade, to have a constitutional amendment to do that, I do not think would be the way to go. We find Huckabee's claim about Thompson's antiabortion bona fides to be Half-True. But Huckabee should be careful about casting stones. Last year, citing the 10th Amendment, Huckabee told Right Wing News that abortion should be left to the states.

pomt-05714	"If you look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders … happiness was not doing what you want to do but doing what you ought to do."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/07/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-happiness-time-our-founders-was/	When Thomas Jefferson wrote, "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," into the Declaration of Independence — just what did he mean by happiness? Probably not what you think he meant, according to Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum. "If you actually go back and look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders ... happiness was not going out and doing whatever you want to do to make yourself feel good," Santorum explained in a campaign speech near Knoxville, Tenn., on Feb. 29, 2012. "Happiness was not doing what you wanted to do but doing what you ought to do, because that's what leads to true happiness." Doing what you ought to do, huh? We had to know: What did dictionaries say about happiness when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence? Was "happiness" about doing your duty, rather than chasing your desires? We tracked down dictionaries Jefferson would have had in his library, consulted historical references in the Oxford English Dictionary, read source documents for the Declaration of Independence and spoke with historians. As it turns out, Santorum was right in some ways — and very wrong in others. The speech Santorum invoked the wisdom of the founding fathers during his hourlong campaign speech. The Constitution of the United States should be "central to the conversation," along with its companion document, the 1776 Declaration of Independence from the British empire, he said. "You really can't have one — and understand the country — without the other," he said. "While the Constitution is the how of America, the declaration is really the soul of America, the why of America." God is mentioned four times in the declaration, he said, starting with the word "creator" in its most famous sentence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Santorum mentioned that "life, liberty and property" was the other phrase used at the time — but that for the founders, the term "property" wasn’t enough. "It was insufficient, because ‘property’ is about stuff," he said. "They put the sights at a higher calling: happiness." He continued: "When we think of the word happiness today, we're thinking, is that a higher calling? To go out and do what makes you happy? To go out and seek enjoyment and pleasure? Because of course, that's what we think of today when we think of happiness — things that make you feel good. "But our founders had a fundamentally different understanding of that word, because they understood what true happiness — what process it took to create true happiness. And if you actually go back and look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders, it was even there. It was something that was discussed and written about. Happiness was not going out and doing whatever you want to do to make yourself feel good. Happiness was not doing what you wanted to do, but doing what you ought to do, because that's what leads to true happiness." For this fact-check, we’re looking at the claim, "If you look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders … happiness was not doing what you want to do, but doing what you ought to do." 'Happiness' We asked Santorum’s campaign for support for his statement but didn’t hear back. Instead, we turned to the Jefferson Library in Charlottesville, Va., down the road from Jefferson’s historic plantation, Monticello. In 1776, a committee of five was assigned the task of writing the Declaration of Independence, but Jefferson wrote the rough draft, including the key phrase, "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." So we figured his understanding of "happiness" would be most relevant to this fact-check. Research librarian Anna Berkes pointed us to two dictionaries among those known to be in Jefferson’s collection, by Samuel Johnson and Nathan Bailey. (Jefferson owned the 1775 edition of Johnson’s dictionary, and we consulted the 1773 version, but bear with us. We consulted the matching version of Bailey’s reference work.) Did their definitions of "happiness" talk about "what you ought to do"? Not so much. Johnson’s Dictionary of the English Language had this to say (we’ve changed some of his F’s to S’s to make it more readable to the modern eye): Happiness 1. Felicity; state in which the desires are satisfied 2. Good luck; good fortune. 3. Fortuitous elegance Bailey’s Universal Etymological English Dictionary defined the word merely as, "Felicity, good Fortune." So, if anything, Johnson’s "state in which the desires are satisfied" would seem to contradict Santorum’s claim that "happiness was not going out and doing whatever you want to do to make yourself feel good." How else would you satisfy your desires? We marched on toward another historical perspective, provided by the Oxford English Dictionary. Jefferson wouldn’t have had the benefit of the authoritative reference — the earlier version wasn’t published until 1898. But the OED catalogs the use of words over time, so it offers a snapshot of "happiness" as Jefferson might have understood it. OED’s basic definition is the "quality or condition of being happy," and includes this citation from Isaac Watts’ book Logick in 1725: "Happiness consists in the attainment of the highest and most lasting natural good." That’s more in line with Santorum’s discussion of "true happiness" but still doesn’t get to the idea of "what you ought to do." Meanwhile, when we looked up definitions of "happy" in the OED, the lengthy entry included the "colloquial, humorous" definition of "slightly drunk: ‘elevated,’" based on two citations, one from the Gentleman’s Mag in 1770. So it seems the understanding of "happiness" in the founder’s era wasn’t entirely divorced from seeking "enjoyment and pleasure." The dictionaries weren't definitive. It was time to move on to other writings. John Locke’s ‘happiness’ We spoke with three historians with expertise in the time period, including one who wrote the entry on "happiness" for the Blackwell Encyclopedia of the American Revolution. They agreed Santorum was right in the sense that " ‘pursuit of happiness’ is the pursuit of fulfillment in a wider sense than immediate gratification," said Jan Lewis, a history professor at Rutgers University at Newark who wrote the encyclopedia entry. That’s relatively consistent with Santorum’s claim that happiness "was not doing what you want to do." But Santorum’s claim that to the founders it instead meant "doing what you ought to do" lands him on the wrong side of history, experts said. That’s a puritanical definition out of line with the world of Jefferson. "It wasn't a sense of obligation. It wasn't a sense of oughtness. Rather, it was a more expansive sense of property," Lewis said. "... I guess the closest we could say is ‘well-being,’ being well-situated, being fulfilled." And Jefferson may not have been referring to individual happiness at all, she said — a point of debate among scholars. He may have been writing about a general sense of social well-being, a good standard of living — not about individual desire or duty. "It wasn't an individualist, libertine happiness or individualist pleasure-seeking," she said. "But it wasn't a sense of duty." The founders were rebels, she pointed out. "Jefferson and the founding fathers were not about duty. Duty would have been your obligation to obey the monarch. Duty would have been your obligation to obey priests, to obey the church hierarchy, to find fulfillment in obeying your hierarchy," she said. "… That was not the way Jefferson and the founding fathers thought." Rather, Jefferson was likely drawing on the "happiness" that John Locke wrote about in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, said Richard Beeman, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania to whom we were referred by the National Constitution Center. Locke, a 17th century English philosopher, provided key inspiration for the Americans’ withdrawal from Great Britain, especially with his Second Treatise on Government written in 1682. "Life, liberty and property." That was derived from a phrase of Locke’s. But he had plenty to say about happiness in his essay. Pursuing true happiness was the foundation of liberty, he wrote. And true happiness may mean being "obliged to suspend the satisfaction of our desires in particular cases." At last! That’s far more in line with Santorum’s speech than early dictionary definitions. Locke’s happiness required some sense of deliberation, rather than knee-jerk pleasure-seeking. "Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real bliss, the same necessity, with the same force, establishes suspense, deliberation and scrutiny of each successive desire, whether the satisfaction of it does not interfere with our true happiness, and mislead us from it," he wrote. And yet, Locke wasn’t opposed to pleasure or feeling good. In his world, the definition of happiness would vary individual to individual. "Men may choose different things and yet all choose right," he wrote. "The mind has a different relish, as well as the palate; and you will as fruitlessly endeavour to delight all men with riches or glory (which yet some men place their happiness in) as you would to satisfy all men's hunger with cheese or lobsters; which though very agreeable and delicious fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous and offensive; and many people would, with reason, prefer the griping of an hungry belly, to those dishes which are a feast to others. Hence it was, I think, that the philosophers of old did in vain inquire, whether summum bonum consisted in riches or bodily delights or virtue or contemplation? And they might have as reasonably disputed whether the best relish were to be found in apples, plums, or nuts; and have divided themselves into sects upon it. For as pleasant tastes depend not on the things themselves, but their agreeableness to this or that particular palate, wherein there is great variety; so the greatest happiness consists in the having those things which produce the greatest pleasure; and in the absence of those which cause any disturbance, any pain. Now these, to different men, are very different things." So to Locke, the pursuit of happiness could mean the pursuit of "doing what you want to do," unlike Santorum what said. Locke just wanted people to be deliberate about their choices and make decisions in their long-term favor. If a man believed there to be no heaven, he might decide, " ‘let us eat and drink’ let us enjoy what we delight in, ‘for tomorrow we shall die,’ " Locke wrote. That example was, to Locke, "why, though all men’s desires tend to happiness, yet they are not moved by the same object." For him, happiness was in the eye of the beholder — and not merely in "doing what you ought to do." In the era, happiness was "a many-definition term, and it's very hard to nail down," said Peter Onuf, a history profesor at the University of Virginia who specializes in the American Revolution. Certainly, "ought" wasn’t part of Jefferson’s definition, according to Lewis and Beeman, also deeply familiar with his writings. "Jefferson would not have said happiness is 'doing what you ought to do,' " Beeman said. Our ruling Santorum said, "If you look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders … happiness was not doing what you want to do, but doing what you ought to do." We took him up on that and checked two dictionaries that would have been in Jefferson’s library and one published after the fact with historical references and found no such mention. Although we did read work by philosopher John Locke that might be read as supporting part of Santorum's assertion, Locke went on to say that happiness means different things to different individuals. And historians told us that the notion that happiness means doing your duty or "doing what you ought to do" ran counter to Jefferson's nature and to the nature of other founders. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-07T11:37:28	2012-02-29	['None']
pomt-14448	"President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-barack-obama-set-new-wall-street-f/	Just because you've taken money from Wall Street doesn't mean you can't regulate Wall Street. That was the message Hillary Clinton tried to promote during the March 6 debate with fellow Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Flint, Mich. Sanders has attacked Clinton for accepting a lot of contributions from the financial industry, an industry both Sanders and Clinton say they want to tighten the screws on. Sanders argued that you can't do it when you've accepted as much money from Wall Street as Clinton has. Clinton countered Sunday night that the case of President Barack Obama shows you can. "President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had," she said. "And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulations since the Great Depression, with the Dodd-Frank regulations." For this fact-check, we're looking at whether Obama set a record for campaign donations from Wall Street in 2008. Given the context, we're only looking at direct contributions made to candidates, not super PACs or other organizations that can accept unlimited contributions. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin cited a 2012 analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign donations. It found that Obama received $44.3 million in 2008 from the "finance, insurance and real estate" sector. Four years earlier, George W. Bush had received $36 million. Adjusted for inflation, Bush received $41.1 million in 2008 dollars, making Bush and Obama close, but still putting Obama ahead. But the "finance, insurance and real estate" sector includes industries that go beyond what people traditionally think of as Wall Street. The Center for Responsive Politics has told PolitiFact that the best way to determine what Wall Street is donating is to look at donations from the "securities and investment" category. By that measure, Obama received $17.3 million in 2008 (with Republican Sen. John McCain a distant second at $9.7 million and Clinton in that cycle at third, at $7.5 million). Four years earlier, George W. Bush received $10 million, which is $11.4 million in 2008 dollars. So when it comes to Wall Street contributions, Obama broke the record in 2008. But Obama's support of financial reform may have cost him. When he ran for reelection in 2012, Wall Street sent him $10 million less. He received $7 million for that election cycle. It was Republican Mitt Romney who set the new record — $23.7 million, which would be $22.2 in 2008 dollars. And, for the record, in the current race, the most recent data supplied by the center's website, OpenSecrets.org, shows Clinton with $3.4 million from the securities and investment industry, Marco Rubio with $1.6 million, Ted Cruz with $754,583, John Kasich with $274,317 and Sanders with $108,761. Our ruling Clinton said, "President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had." Adjusting for inflation, Obama garnered about $3 million more than George W. Bush if you look at the broad "finance, insurance and real estate" sector. But using the "securities and investment" category, a tighter measure of Wall Street contributions, Obama clearly set a new record in 2008. Yet that record only lasted four years. Romney upped that ante by $5 million in 2012. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05878	"President Obama is shrinking our military."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-shrinking-our-milita/	Is President Barack Obama weakening America’s military? As part of our analysis of a typical Mitt Romney presidential campaign speech, we’ll look at a line he has used about spending on the U.S. military. "President Obama is shrinking our military and hollowing out our national defense," Romney said in a speech after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 4, 2012. First, the president’s official proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 is scheduled to be released later this month. After that happens, Congress will have to pass spending bills and present them to the president for his signature. So there’s a long way to go before the future course of military spending becomes official. In addition, we’re at an unusual period in federal budgeting. On Aug. 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 became law (P.L. 112-25). That was the bill that was passed to head off a looming crisis over the federal debt ceiling. The bill -- which cleared the House, 269-161, and the Senate, 74-26 -- established limits on discretionary spending between fiscal years 2012 and 2021. Some of the budgetary caps mandated by the law were to become effective right away. Other reductions were to be worked out later by a handpicked "supercommittee" made up of House members and senators from both parties. However, the supercommittee failed to reach an agreement on how to make the additional cuts, meaning that -- barring some intervening development -- the required budget reductions will be automatic, across-the board cuts. Though some items such as Social Security benefits were exempted from the automatic cuts, the military budget is not exempt. In other words, a reduction in the military budget was all but destined once the Budget Control Act passed and the supercommittee failed to prevent across-the-board cuts. It’s important to remember that -- despite Romney’s explicit criticism of Obama -- these actions were carried out by both parties. When the House voted on the Budget Control Act, Republicans voted for it by a 174-66 margin, and when it came up in the Senate, Republicans voted for it by a 28-19 margin. And seats on the supercommittee were equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. "The administration’s hands are essentially tied," said Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "Plenty of Republicans voted for this bill, so they are equally culpable." Finally, this is a notable moment for the military budget because the Obama Administration has wound down the U.S. combat presence in Iraq and is aiming to do the same in Afghanistan. This means that money required to fund these operations is poised to decline significantly over the next few years. Iraq cost about $600,000 per troop per year, Harrison said, and Afghanistan costs twice that, once you consider factors including fuel, ammunition, food and support services. Since war funding isn’t subject to Budget Control Act caps, the distinction between war funding and the regular Pentagon budget needs to be noted. Even so, reductions in overseas operations has historically had an impact on the U.S. military budget. "Throughout American history, defense spending has risen and fallen in irregular cycles driven in part by changes in the security environment," Harrison wrote in a new paper. "Since the end of World War II, the defense budget has experienced three such cycles following the end of the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Cold War." (We took a closer look at this phenomenon last year, in a fact check here.) Now let’s look at the numbers. The Budget Control Act requires $487 billion in defense cuts over 10 years relative to the level of spending the Pentagon was anticipating a year ago. "This means that the Obama administration must for the first time propose a real decrease in defense spending from the previous year’s enacted budget," Harrison wrote. By contrast, he wrote, the administration proposed real increases for defense in each of its previous budgets. On top of this initial round of cuts come the automatic cuts required because of the supercommittee's failure. These amount to $472 billion in the defense budget, to be evenly spread across nine years, from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2021. (That works out to an additional annual reduction of $52 billion a year.) The cuts are to take effect Jan. 2, 2013. The administration has not yet developed a blueprint for living under the across-the-board cuts set in motion by the supercommittee’s failure, but it has discussed some details of its proposal for living under the Budget Control Act’s initial round of spending caps. Here’s a summary table reproduced from Harrison’s report, showing the "base discretionary Defense Department budget" in non-inflation-adjusted dollars. (This chart excludes funding for overseas military operations such as Afghanistan.) Fiscal year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Budget request made in fiscal 2012 $553 billion $571 billion $587 billion $598 billion $611 billion NA Budget request made in 2013 (initial Budget Control Act caps only) $531 billion $525 billion $534 billion $546 billion $556 billion $567 billion Budget under additional across-the-board cuts NA $472 billion $482 billion $491 billion $502 billion $515 billion So even before factoring in across-the-board cuts, the administration is requesting $46 billion less for fiscal 2013 than it had projected would be needed when it released its 2012 budget proposal and $6 billion less than Congress enacted for fiscal 2012. Factoring in the across-the-board cuts only makes these declines steeper. The fiscal 2013 request for overseas military operations -- which is not included in this chart -- amounts to $88.4 billion, mostly in Afghanistan. That’s down from $115 billion for overseas military operations in 2012. How do these reductions translate into boots on the ground and planes in the sky? On Jan. 26, 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta unveiled highlights of the administration’s budget proposal. Harrison summarizes it this way: "Army and Marine Corps end strength will decline by 72,000 and 20,000 respectively, bringing them back to roughly the level they were in 2005. The Army will lose at least eight brigades, two of which will come from Europe. … The Navy will lose some 17 ships ... and the Air Force will cut 10 percent of its 60 fighter squadrons. Overall, $60 billion of the proposed reductions are projected to come from unspecified ‘efficiencies,’ on top of $178 billion in ‘efficiency’ savings projected in last year’s budget. DOD also announced it will propose another round of base closures. Such a move is likely to cost money in the near term and thus does not help the Department achieve the savings it needs" in the short term. It’s worth noting that despite the cuts, the size of the base defense budget -- that is, the budget outside of overseas operational costs -- is poised to increase eventually from its low in 2013, at least in non-inflation-adjusted dollars. Still, if the across-the-board cuts are adhered to, the base defense budget in fiscal 2017 would still be $16 billion lower than it was in fiscal 2012. Our ruling Romney is right that the military is "shrinking," partly due to a winding down of overseas wars and partly due to congressionally enacted budget limits. But to say, as Romney did, that this is being done by Obama -- without acknowledging Republican actions -- ignores what really happened. A majority of House and Senate Republicans voted for the initial caps in the Budget Control Act, and the supercommittee was evenly divided between the parties, meaning that its failure was bipartisan. So we rate Romney’s statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-02-08T18:21:33	2012-02-04	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-04877	Says Mitt Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/08/barack-obama/obama-slams-romney-on-contraception-and-planned-pa/	Barack Obama's campaign must see an opportunity to peel support among women voters away from Mitt Romney because it is running its second ad in two weeks attacking Romney for his stand on reproductive issues. The latest television commercial features two women, Dawn and Alex, talking about Romney. Dawn: "I think Mitt Romney’s really out of touch on women’s health issues." Alex: "This is not the 1950s. Contraception is so important. It’s about a woman being able to make decisions." (As she speaks, a picture of Romney appears beside the words "Opposes requiring employers to cover contraception.") Dawn: "I don’t remember anyone as extreme as Romney." Romney event video: "I’ll cut off funding for Planned Parenthood." Alex: "I don’t think Mitt Romney can understand the mindset of someone who has to go to Planned Parenthood." Romney interview video: "Planned Parenthood. We’re going to get rid of that." Dawn: "I think Mitt Romney would definitely drag us back." The ad is airing in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Given that PolitiFact recently found the Obama campaign exaggerated other claims about Romney on abortion, we thought it would be worthwhile to check the claim that Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. The contraceptive mandate Romney’s stance on contraceptive coverage became clear during the Republican primaries. Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision of the health care law that requires all employers except religious ones to provide birth-control services without any out-of-pocket costs. In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their "beliefs or moral convictions." At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like. A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer "Of course I support the Blunt amendment." CNSNews.com, a conservative news service, seeking clarity, wrote about putting the question directly to the Romney campaign. "Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a ‘moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization’ will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?" Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: "Yes--Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety." In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the current rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, "As president, I will abolish it." We conclude from those comments that Romney would not just abolish the requirements for religious organizations, but for any employer that had a moral or religious objection. When the new Obama ad first ran, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul called it a "false ad," but her statement did not provide specifics and the Romney campaign did not respond to our inquiries. Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood, a national network of clinics that provide a range of health services including abortion, has been in the crosshairs of social conservatives for a long time. The federal government pays Planned Parenthood about $75 million a year to offer cancer screenings, breast exams and other care to lower income women. That money cannot be spent on abortion services. But conservatives argue that the federal dollars free up money which the organization uses to underwrite the cost of doing abortions. Mitt Romney has linked that concern to his effort to reduce the deficit. Asked by a Missouri interviewer what he would cut, Romney gave some examples. "Of course you get rid of Obamacare," Romney said. "That’s the easy one. But there are others. Planned Parenthood. We’re going to get rid of that. The subsidy for Amtrak. We would eliminate that." We should note that the latest Obama ad edits Romney’s words down to "Planned Parenthood. We’re going to get rid of that." This might give the impression that Romney plans to do away with Planned Parenthood, an interpretation that forced the Romney campaign to clarify what he meant when he first made the statement in mid-March. Campaign officials said he would eliminate the federal payments to Planned Parenthood but would not be getting rid of the organization. Planned Parenthood is a private entity with a total budget of about $1.1 billion, an amount much larger than the direct federal payment. Romney has repeated his plan to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood many times. He said it in a letter to voters that was published in Life News, a self-described pro-life news service. On his website, he goes further and says he will eliminate all family planning funds under the Public Health Service Act. That program, Title X, costs about $300 million and was created in 1970 under the Nixon administration.

pomt-03540	An 11-year-old girl was investigated by the FBI and had to pay a $500 federal criminal fine "because she found an injured woodpecker and put it in a cage to make sure that the bird was OK."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/28/jim-sensenbrenner/girl-had-pay-500-federal-criminal-fine-rescuing-wo/	U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner went on national TV on May 9, 2013, to talk up the Over-Criminalization Task Force, a new venture praised by groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Heritage Foundation. Supporters say the work of the panel, created by the House Judiciary Committee, could lead to a reduction in federal regulations and a reduced federal prison population. Sensenbrenner, one of the two co-chairmen of the task force, told the Rev. Pat Robertson on "The 700 Club" that some of the roughly 4,500 federal crimes now on the books need to be eliminated. Then the Wisconsin Republican illustrated his point with this claim: "I think the FBI has got much better things to do, for example, than investigate an 11-year-old girl that ended up having to pay a $500 criminal fine because she found an injured woodpecker and put it in a cage to make sure that the bird was OK and that violated the Migratory Bird Treaty Act." That got high marks on our curiosity meter. But how does Sensenbrenner’s claim fare on the Truth-O-Meter? Woodpecker case We found news accounts and a news release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service describing the following incident: On June 13, 2011, Skylar Capo, 11, rescued a baby woodpecker that she believed was about to be eaten by the family cat at her dad’s home near Fredricksburg, Va. Skylar’s mom, Alison Capo, agreed to let Skylar take the bird to their home for a day or two to make sure it was OK. On the way home, the family stopped at a Lowe's store, bringing the bird with them in a cage to spare it from the heat in the car. So, part of Sensenbrenner's claim is accurate: The girl took a woodpecker she thought might be injured and put it in a cage. Back to the story. Inside the store, a woman confronted the Capos, saying she was from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and that it was against the law to take or transport a woodpecker. Capo said that as soon as she and her daughter returned home, they released the bird and reported the release to the Fish and Wildlife Service. But two weeks later, on June 27, 2011, the same woman from the Lowe's store, accompanied by a state trooper, arrived at the Capos’ home. She had already drafted a citation for violation of the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which protects woodpeckers and numerous other birds. Violation of the act is a misdemeanor and carries a fine, up six months in jail, or both. After the visit, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, the agent determined no further action was necessary; and the next day, she canceled the citation she had drafted. Several weeks later, however, Capo received a letter of violation, notifying her of a $535 fine, the possible jail time and a date to appear in federal court. But no fine was ever paid. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued an apology, saying the citation had been processed "unintentionally" and should never have been issued. Our rating Arguing that the federal criminal code should be downsized, Sensenbrenner said an 11-year-old girl was investigated by the FBI and had to pay a $500 federal criminal fine "because she found an injured woodpecker and put it in a cage to make sure that the bird was OK." The FBI didn’t investigate the girl, the citation issued was withdrawn and no fine was paid. We rate Sensenbrenner's statement Mostly False.

pomt-04738	In Massachusetts under Mitt Romney, "unemployment went down, household incomes went up," and the state "saw its credit rating upgraded."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/29/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-touts-mitt-romneys-record-massachusetts/	As part of the Republican Party’s continuing effort to celebrate business success and private-sector ingenuity, Paul Ryan offered Mitt Romney as Exhibit A during his convention speech in Tampa. "Mitt has not only succeeded, but succeeded where others could not," the Wisconsin congressman and vice presidential nominee said. "He turned around the Olympics at a time when a great institution was collapsing under the weight of bad management, overspending, and corruption – sounds familiar, doesn’t it?" Ryan then turned to Romney’s four years as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007 "He was the Republican governor of a state where almost nine in ten legislators are Democrats, and yet he balanced the budget without raising taxes. Unemployment went down, household incomes went up, and Massachusetts, under Mitt Romney, saw its credit rating upgraded." Let’s look at the last three claims. PolitiFact fact-checked the household income trends and found an increase of $5,500 under Romney without considering inflation -- but a decrease in real dollars after adjusting for inflation. That earned a Romney surrogate a Half True for noting only the positive side of the equation. On unemployment, PolitiFact tested a Romney claim that he reduced Massachusetts unemployment to 4.7 percent. We rated that claim Half True; the number was correct, but we ruled that Romney did not deserve as much credit as he was giving himself. The employment situation in Massachusetts was subject to many factors, not just the governor’s policy. Finally, the credit rating. Multiple media accounts, including stories in the Tampa Bay Times and The Hill, have noted that Romney was among the governors who achieved a credit rating upgrade while in office. This was how the Tampa Bay Times put it in a July 15, 2012, story: Romney had an advantage of entering office as the economy was improving — though the state budget did not yet reflect it. He also had the benefit of a 2002 tax increase without having to shoulder any responsibility. In 2004, Romney's administration lobbied Standard & Poor's to improve Massachusetts' credit rating based in part on the extra money generated by that tax hike — which raised capital gains tax rates, eliminated charitable deductions, delayed a planned cut to the state income tax and raised the state cigarette tax 75 cents. A presentation to Standard & Poor's, which was first obtained by POLITICO, included the tax increases on a computer slide that said Massachusetts "acted decisively to address the fiscal crisis. The state's credit rating was upgraded four months later, from AA- to AA." Our ruling Ryan said in his convention speech that when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, unemployment went down, household income went up, and the state’s credit rating was upgraded. Ryan’s claim was well grounded mathematically on the unemployment and credit-rating claims. The income claim comes with a significant footnote: That increase turned to a decrease when the numbers are adjusted for inflation. We also have noted that no governor can take major credit for economic trends in his or her state. Many other facts are at work than just a governor’s actions. On balance, we rate this triple-header a Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-08-29T23:53:02	2012-08-29	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-04280	Says Connie Mack "wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation in order to get $29 million in stimulus for his congressional district."	/florida/statements/2012/nov/02/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-said-connie-mack-asked-stimulus-money-/	Make no mistake, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fort Myers, opposes the federal stimulus. He’s decried President Barack Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which poured $787 billion into the economy, a "waste of money" and a move "to ignore the will of the American people." He’s released media statements and ads accusing Obama and Sen. Bill Nelson, whom he wants to unseat from the U.S. Senate, of pushing a stimulus that wasted "millions in taxpayer dollars" on things like cocaine-addicted monkeys. (PolitiFact pegged that ad as Mostly False.) "I’ve said time and time again, we cannot spend our way to prosperity," Mack said in a 2010 media release about the stimulus. That’s why, on the night of the Oct. 17 Senate debate, Nelson was prepared to use Mack’s own political weight against him. "(Mack) rails against the stimulus bill, he didn’t tell you he wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation in order to get $29 million in stimulus for his congressional district," Nelson said. Mack, perhaps prepared for the comment, absorbed Nelson’s punch unruffled. But he also didn’t refute it. That’s why we decided to fact-check for ourselves. We started by asking Nelson’s campaign for evidence. Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin gave us a copy of a letter Mack wrote to Secretary Ray LaHood at the U.S. Transportation Department asking for the money on behalf of Charlotte County. Mack’s letter, dated September of 2009, asked the federal government for $29 million to build the Southwest Florida Intermodal and Logistics Center, a project to introduce high-speed rail transportation to Southwest Florida. To read the letter, you’d think Mack not only approves of the stimulus, but believes it’s a potential boon to Southwest Florida’s economy. "This project will establish a connection between Southwest Florida economic centers and the seaports of Tampa and Manatee counties, advancing the region’s economic competitiveness," Mack wrote. The letter continued: "This project is shovel-ready and will facilitate the transportation of goods and people throughout Southwest Florida, spurring economic development in a region crucial to the economic health of the state. These aspects make Charlotte County’s project an excellent candidate for funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was designed in part to encourage economic growth through investments and infrastructure." The Transportation Department denied the grant, and the project never got off the ground, said Charlotte County administrator Jason Stotzfus. But Mack also sent at least two other letters to help the county apply for different stimulus grants. "Chances are better if we have the support of our legislators," Stotzfus said. Pietro Nivola, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Mack’s approach to the stimulus is common. "Constituent services is all about responding to appeals and requests," Nivola said. " If people in (Mack’s) neighborhood were thinking here's some money, here's an opportunity...it's incumbent upon him to follow up." In fact, Vice President Joe Biden used a similar gotcha against Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., during the Oct. 11 vice presidential debate. Ryan, looking flustered, replied that all representatives ask for stimulus money for their constituents. Mack political consultant Gary Maloney had a similar analysis, and he offered this analogy. In 2001 and again in 2003, Nelson voted against tax cuts. But when Floridians wrote him for help on tax issues, Nelson didn’t tell those constituents to take a hike because he opposed those bills, Maloney said. "In 2009, Mack voted against the stimulus on principle. Nelson voted with Obama, and the Democrat majority prevailed," Maloney said. "Once the stimulus bill was the law of the land, Mack still represented his constituents. And when Charlotte County applied for funds, Connie naturally helped the taxpayers of his district." Our ruling During the U.S. Senate debate, Nelson accused Mack of denouncing the stimulus but asking for money. It’s no secret: Mack frequently bashes the stimulus as an impediment to economic growth. Yet, his letters suggest he thinks the stimulus money would boost his area’s economy. We rate Nelson’s claim True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2012-11-02T16:36:19	2012-10-17	['None']
pomt-07956	More people die from "medical misadventures" than firearm accidents nationally and in Florida.	/florida/statements/2011/jan/24/national-rifle-association/nra-claims-more-die-accident-medical-misadventures/	Are you more likely to die as a result of an accident involving medical care or an accident involving a gun? The National Rifle Association claims that in Florida and nationally, you are far more likely to die at the hands of a medical professional or procedure -- by accident -- than you are as a result of an accidental firearm incident. We found a reference to that claim in a Jan. 16, 2011, Miami Herald article about Florida lawmakers filing bills related to firearms. The bills are attracting much interest after the Jan. 8 shooting in Arizona that killed six and injured Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. One of the bills, Senate Bill 432 sponsored by state Sen. Greg Evers, R-Crestview, aims to prevent doctors from asking patients questions about their access to firearms and makes violations a felony punishable by up to a $5 million fine. Doctors argue against the proposed law. It also would prohibit physicians from refusing to see patients who won't answer questions about guns and bans the medical staff from writing down information about patients and their guns. This bill, then, is a battle between the gun lobby and the doctors' lobby, two powerful groups in Tallahassee. This Truth-O-Meter isn't going to weigh in on the argument about gun control. Our question: Are the fatality comparisons between medical mishaps and firearms correct? NRA's accident facts The Miami Herald article said NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer cited "statistics showing that medical mishaps kill more people than guns," but did not cite the actual statistics. Hammer said she gave the Herald a one-page document called "Firearms Accidents Facts" compiled by the Unified Sportsmen of Florida in June 2010. The document compares accidental death by firearms to other types of accidents -- from choking to tricycles -- both nationally and in Florida. The Unified Sportsmen of Florida is the state's affiliate of the NRA. The fact-sheet includes comparisons to accidental deaths by "medical misadventures" -- both in raw numbers and in rates per capita -- but doesn't specify the year. Medical misadventures, the handout says, "is a term used by some statisticians to cover 'accidents' by doctors and other medical personnel." Note that this claim covers only gun accidents -- it doesn't include firearm deaths due to murder or suicide. According to the sheet: • Nationally, "4 times more die from 'medical misadventures' " than firearms. • In Florida, "6 times more die from 'medical misadventures' " than firearms. Hammer on Jan. 17 directed us to Mark Overstreet, NRA Institute for Legislative Action research coordinator. He told us that the figures -- compiled by the NRA for Hammer -- were from 2007. He pointed us to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WISQARS (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System) -- an interactive database that provides customized reports. The death data is compiled by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. This information comes from death certificates filed in state vital-statistics offices and includes causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners and coroners, according to the CDC. All of the states comply with providing this data. Firearm accident data On the WISQARS website, we searched Fatal Injury Reports 1999-2007 for "unintentional," "firearms," "2007" and "United States." That produced a chart that showed 613 deaths in the U.S. for 2007. Then we queried the same data for Florida and found 16 deaths. CDC's adverse effects data The death data about medical care was far more complex. We'll walk you through the numbers and explain why it doesn't provide a complete picture. We'll also discuss the "medical misadventures" label. On WISQARS, we marked "all intents" and "medical care, adverse effects" for 2007 and saw 2,248 deaths nationwide. For Florida, the number was 108 deaths. We thought those figures sounded awfully low for deaths as a result of medical errors. A 1999 study by the Institute of Medicine, "To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System," concluded that medical error deaths range from about 44,000 to 98,000 a year. Let's summarize what we found before we delve into why the government's data is so low on such deaths: Accidental deaths 2007 Nationwide Florida Firearms 613 16 Medical care adverse effects 2,248 108 What the stats mean We interviewed Robert N. Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, to explain what the numbers mean. The deaths are coded by categories, and one category is indeed labeled "misadventures to patients during surgical and medical care." Some examples are an unintentional cut, a foreign object accidentally left in the body during surgery, and contaminated medical substances. Other categories included in "adverse effects:" • Breakdown or malfunctioning of a medical device. • "Surgical and other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure." Anderson told us that refers to procedures such as a patient reacting badly to an organ transplant. • Complication of medical care, which was a significant factor even though the care (such as surgery) occurred more than one year prior to death. This is also often referred to as "late effects," Anderson said. So overall, "medical care, adverse effects" includes both errors and complications. How many errors? We asked Anderson: Are the majority medical errors? "I’m not sure," he wrote in an e-mail. "Only a very few in adverse effects category are explicitly medical misadventures." He added, "Just because a misadventure is not specified, doesn’t mean that it didn’t occur. My guess is that many ... (in some categories) are indeed medical errors, but have been characterized as complications." Anderson also explained a key limitation of the data: It is only as accurate as the information provided on the death certificates by doctors. The WISQARS system tabulates types of deaths based on the "underlying cause of death." Suppose a man had heart disease and needed a heart procedure, a doctor punctured his artery during surgery and the patient bled to death. If the doctor reports the underlying cause of death as heart disease, then it won't be counted in the "medical care, adverse effects" category. The CDC offers another source of online data called the WONDER system, which tabulates if a cause of death was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, even if it wasn't listed as the "underlying cause." The most recent year we could look up for WONDER was 2006. The WONDER database showed 22,116 deaths from "medical care, adverse effects" nationwide in 2006 and about 1,319 for Florida. Anderson acknowledges that even that figure is low. The reason, according to Anderson: "The physician who makes the error doesn't have any incentive to report it. Actually they have a disincentive to report it even though it's in the interests of medical care in general to have that information reported. ... We are at the mercy of the cause of death certifier and how thorough they are in their reporting of cause of death." Anderson said he personally finds some studies more believable than others -- for example he disagrees with counting all hospital infections as errors. But he says he agrees with the Institute of Medicine study that put the figure between 44,000 and 98,000 -- and says even though that study is from 1999, he believes little has changed since then. Firearm data is also uncertain Anderson also raised a concern with the firearm data, that self-inflicted gun deaths could be accidental or a suicide, and some could be mis-classified or labeled as "intent undetermined." It's worth repeating that the vast majority of firearm deaths are by suicide and murder -- only a small slice of firearm deaths are accidental. According to the WISQARS data, in 2007 there were 31,224 firearm deaths nationwide -- the largest category was suicide followed by murder. That total number of firearm deaths is many multiples higher than the CDC's count for "medical care, adverse effects" deaths. We asked Hammer, why make the comparison solely on accidents? "When doctors claim that they have a right to question children and the parents of children because they want to prevent deaths by accidents with firearms, the facts speak for themselves," Hammer said. "There are a number of areas dealing with medical care over which they have some control that (doctors) should focus attention on." And Overstreet, the NRA researcher, defends the use of WISQARS data, even knowing its limitations. "We are not looking to jack the numbers up," he said. "We are saying this is what the federal government is reporting." Anderson doesn't disagree. "With the data issues surrounding medical errors, it's a fairly difficult comparison," he said. However, "I don't think they are off base. I don't think they are doing something making an invalid comparison. ... What they are basically doing is looking at the government's underlying cause data. They are not even saying it's a gross underestimate. They are being very conservative here." Our ruling So, is the NRA right to state that, nationwide, people are four times more likely to die from medical misadventures than firearm accidents and that figure drops to six times more likely for Florida? The government's 2007 data shows 613 accidental firearm deaths nationwide compared to 2,248 deaths from medical care adverse effect. That's close to four times, as the NRA handout says. In Florida, there were 16 accidental firearm deaths compared to 108 medical care adverse effect. That's almost seven times, even worse than the six times cited by the NRA. We have two concerns: The WISQARS data comes with a lot of caveats when examining medical errors, and even the gun data may not be perfect. And the NRA's fact-sheet ignores gun deaths from murders and suicides, which take a significantly higher toll than accidents and can't be ignored in the gun debate. For the point the NRA is making -- accidents only, guns v. medical misadventures -- the numbers back up their claims but need clarification and context. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-07857	Says his tax and fee cuts will save households "$540 over two years."	/florida/statements/2011/feb/10/rick-scott/rick-scotts-budget-includes-some-big-tax-cuts-not-/	One of the best ways to show voters the impact of tax cuts is to break them down in a way people can appreciate. Take Gov. Rick Scott's budget roll-out the week of Feb. 7, 2011. Scott says his spending plan includes $4.1 billion in tax and fee relief over two years. That sounds good, but it means little to someone unfamiliar with the inner workings of the state budget. So Scott's budget team decided to boil that figure down to show the impact on Florida households. In a graphic showing the proposed tax relief for 2011-2013, Scott's budget gurus added this simple-to-digest sound bite: "Total Savings Per Household, $540 Over Two Years." The figure got repeated by various media outlets. So we wondered, is it right? No doubt about it, Scott's budget proposal includes a variety of tax and fee reductions. Among them: • Reduce the corporate income tax from 5.5 percent to 3 percent in 2011-2012 and from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in 2012-2013. The rate cut will save those who pay the tax $459 million this year and a little more than $1 billion in 2012-2013. • Reduce the required local effort, a property tax to fund schools, saving taxpayers around $600 million in 2011-2012. The tax cut would carry forward in 2012-2013. • Reduce the property tax collected by state water management districts 25 percent for two years, saving taxpayers $180 million annually. • Reduce unemployment compensation taxes by shortening how long Floridians can collect benefits and making it more difficult for them to be eligible. Scott's office says that will save $630.8 million over two years. • Roll back 2009 Legislature-approved fee increases for driver licenses, vehicle registrations and other motor vehicle fees. Scott says the rollback would save drivers $492 million over two years. • Repeal or alter other small taxes on ammonia, pesticides, fertilizer, solvents, dry cleaning, tires and lead acid batteries, among other things. The changes would save $77 million over two years, Scott's office says. Taken together, Scott's says the savings for taxpayers is $4.1 billion over two years. (For the record, we question that overall figure because most cuts in the second year of Scott's budget aren't additional cuts; they are just the same cuts rolled over.) But what's critical in determining a per-household savings is remembering just who will get the tax breaks. And, who won't. Two of the three biggest tax cuts -- the reduction of the corporate income tax and the changes to the unemployment compensation tax -- apply only to corporations. So unless your household is like Rick Scott's and you own a corporation, you'll see no direct savings under Scott's plans. Supporters of the cuts argue that the benefits could trickle down to average Floridians through additional jobs or cheaper prices for goods and services. But there's no guarantee either will happen. The cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax make up $2.1 billion of Scott's overall $4.1 billion impact. In comments to the Senate Budget Committee on Feb. 9, 2011, Scott budget chief Jerry McDaniel said Scott's top tax priority was to remove taxes that he says inhibit job creation. McDaniel said Scott particularly wanted to reduce and eventually eliminate the state's corporate income tax. We asked McDaniel after the Feb. 9 meeting if he knew whether the per-household figure accounted for the corporate tax cuts. McDaniel said he did not know and suggested we e-mail the governor's press office seeking clarification. We did, but did not hear back. So we did the math ourselves. According to the U.S. Census, Florida had 6,337,929 households in 2000 (the last year that precise data is available). However, the state's Demographic Estimating Conference meets annually to project the number of Florida households, among other things. At their most recent meeting on Oct. 25, 2010, the group estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2011, Florida would have roughly 7.5 million households. The group's estimates are based on the active number of residential electric customers and residential building permits. Using the most recent household estimate, it's easy to see the error in Scott's tax cut math. Not counting the cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax, the average household would see in the neighborhood of $267 in tax savings over two years, not $540. ($2 billion / 7.5 million = $267 per household). That's an annual savings of around $134, or less than half of what Scott suggested. The $540-per-household figure Scott used to sell his budget plan is intended to appeal to voters who would relish a hefty tax cut, even over two years. But he failed to factor in that more than half of those tax cuts would apply only to employers, not regular Floridians. In calculating the savings, it appears clear that Scott and his office simply divided the entire tax cut as projected by Scott -- $4.1 billion -- by the entire number of Florida households -- 7.5 million -- to reach their average savings of $540. That's easy math. But it's deceptive. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-02-10T16:05:30	2011-02-07	['None']
pomt-10472	"Hillary Clinton has taken over $800,000 from lobbyists."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/17/barack-obama/clinton-accepts-lobbyist-money/	If you were wondering how Washington works, an ad from the Barack Obama campaign ostensibly offers a primer – "A Guide to Understanding Washington Lobbyists" — while it attacks Hillary Clinton. The Web-only ad outlines the following steps with on-screen text: Step 1: "Lobbyists donate to politicians." Step 2: "Politicians defend lobbyists." Step 3: "Americans pay the price." As part of the first step, the ad states: "Senator Hillary Clinton has taken over $800,000 from lobbyists, more money than any other candidate — Republican or Democrat: * Over $130,000 from energy lobbyists * Over $130,000 from drug company lobbyists * Over $125,000 from health care and insurance lobbyists." We asked the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which categorizes and analyzes political contributions, whether this text was accurate. The $800,000 number is correct. A recent analysis by the center showed Clinton has accepted $865,290 from lobbyists, based on data released on March 20, 2008. The threshold of contributions by industry the ad lists for Clinton is probably too low, said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the center. The center's analysis found the following amounts that lobbyists gave to Clinton: * Energy: $442,800 * Pharmaceuticals/health products: $450,450 * Hospitals, health services/HMOs and insurance companies: $552,050 * Health professionals: $114,755. Based on these numbers, we find Obama's statement that Clinton has taken more than $800,000 from lobbyists to be True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-04-17T00:00:00	2008-04-17	['None']
pomt-02068	Since 2000, Texas has reduced "harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent--a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average."	/texas/statements/2014/may/26/rick-perry/perry-correct-reductions-ozone-industrial-nox-emis/	Gov. Rick Perry visited a familiar boast about the clearing skies of Texas in a May 19, 2014, letter to President Barack Obama that may have tested possible themes of another gubernatorial run for president. Saying Texas employs an "all-of-the-above energy strategy" tapping fossil fuels plus solar, biofuel and wind resources, Perry wrote: "Even as our population has grown by more than 5 million since 2000, we've led the U.S. energy revolution while protecting our environment and reducing harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average." 62, 23, 12 — sounds like a quarterback’s call before the snap. We were curious about his numbers. Is Perry right about the pollution reductions as well as the cuts outpacing decreases nationally? A 2010 fact check Perry made a similar claim in June 2010, saying in a press release the "Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions." He’d earlier cited the same statistic in a letter to Obama. Half True, we found then. Perry accurately recapped improvements in ozone levels. But as for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic included only one NOx source — industrial — which he did not note. Notably, nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Also, whether state government merited credit for the improvements struck us as worthy of pause. Even if the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts — in particular, vehicle emission regulations — were a key factor. Significantly, too, the state's ozone-related programs existed to help Texas comply with federal expectations. As noted then, a goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what the Environmental Protection Agency calls "commonly found air pollutants." Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozone, the primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in "nonattainment." Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Figures hold up As in 2010, we asked David T. Allen, a University of Texas professor of chemical engineering, about Perry’s statement. By email, Allen noted that per figures posted online by the TCEQ, Perry’s analysis holds up. Allen also pointed out an EPA web page indicating that nationally ozone levels in 2012 were down 9 percent compared to 2000 with NOx levels down 29 to 50 percent, depending on the measurement applied. Separately by email, commission spokesman Terry Clawson sent us a spreadsheet he described as the basis of the charts. Clawson said the data came from the EPA. Let’s recap the charted changes in ozone, then NOx. Ozone down 23 percent According to a commission chart on a web page last updated April 17, 2014, ozone in Texas decreased 23 percent from 2000 through 2012, as Perry said. (The comparisons reflect what officials call "fourth-high" ozone readings. Clawson emailed us this technical explanation.) A headline on the chart says the ozone decrease for the other 49 states averaged 11 percent. Texas ran 12 percentage points ahead of that. The chart shows ozone decreasing in all but a few states--Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Hawaii and Alaska--with the drop in Texas bested only by Tennessee, California and Georgia. Source: Web page, "Air Quality Successes - Criteria Pollutants," Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) NOx from industrial sources down 62.5 percent In the period, Allen emailed, industrial emissions of NOx (not including motor vehicles) in Texas dropped 62.5 percent. He pointed out a commission chart indicating that industrial NOx emissions of more than 300,000 xx tons in 2011 compared to a shade less than 800,000 xx tons per year in 2000, which works out to a 62.5 percent reduction, as Perry said. Source: Web page, "Air Quality Successes - Emissions Inventory," Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) Sierra Club stresses federal role For another perspective, we turned to Neil Carman of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. By phone, Carman called Perry’s figures accurate though he suggested the cited reductions occurred mainly thanks to federal laws and enforcement. Carman, director of the club’s Clean Air program, said the federal government still considers the multi-county Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas as not attaining minimum ozone standards. He pointed out a Sierra Club press release stating the club on May 20, 2014, filed suit against the EPA for failing to classify Dallas-Fort Worth as having a "severe" ozone problem, an action that would have required polluters to clean the air, the press release says. By email, Carman said the governor's claim misleads by "lumping together Texas' ozone woes in Houston and" Dallas-Fort Worth "with all the other ozone areas in the nation, including areas that have minimal or no problems." A "comparison to other states with few ozone problems is roughly analogous to comparing a driver who gets 30 speeding tickets a year and reduces it by 50% over ten years to 15 per year," Carman said, "while a second driver only had 3 tickets and reduces it by 33% to 2 tickets per year. The first driver had the greatest (percentage) reduction at 50% and the greatest volume reduction but also had the worst speeding record." Earlier, Clawson indicated the gains noted by Perry weren’t entirely due to federal oversight. By email, he noted a 1999 Texas law that required power plants to reduce NOx emissions, also saying other state laws enacted since 2000 stressed energy efficiency, reductions in pollution and renewable energy sources like wind power. Clawson, asked about the bulk of NOx pollution coming from vehicles and non-industrial sources, which Perry’s statement did not take up, said NOx emissions from non-industrial sources in Texas in 2011 were 42 percent less than what such sources emitted in 1999. Our ruling Perry said that since 2000, Texas has reduced "harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average." Those figures are accurate, but the claim (like Perry’s 2010 statement) takes into account only one NOx source — industrial — which it failed to note. Nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Perry’s declaration also didn't reflect on federal laws and oversight that figure into pollution reductions. Texas didn’t make the gains in isolation. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-08957	"We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation. I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT."	/texas/statements/2010/jul/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-high-percentage-students/	As CNBC pronounced Texas the nation's best state for doing business, Gov. Rick Perry offered reasons why Texas is "still on top" during an interview with the business-news network. One of them: the number of Texas students participating in a national college-admissions' exam. "We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation," Perry said on the July 13 CNBC broadcast. "I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT." Which is it? Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor who has stressed education as an important issue, thinks it's neither. "Rick Perry proved again yesterday that he simply can't tell the truth when it comes to education," a July 14 press release from White chided, saying that Perry gave "blatantly false information about SATs." Later that day, the governor's office issued a press release pointing reporters to a July 14 Fortune magazine article that offered four reasons why "Texas beats California in a recession." However, the article also notes that "SAT scores in the state have declined over the last few years, and the state ranked 34th among the 52 states and jurisdictions graded on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) last year." Confused? When we checked with Perry's campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier tweaked the first of Perry's CNBC statements by saying Texas has more students taking the SAT than "nearly" any other state. According to the College Board, which manages the SAT exams, Texas ranked third in 2009 in the number of SAT takers — 141,733 public and private school students. Of course, Texas was also the second-most populous state. California, the most populous state, had the most SAT participants (207,301), followed by New York (159,886). We turned next to Perry's second statement, that a high percentage of "our kids" take the SAT — arguably a powerful talking point because a state's percentage of SAT takers signifies its share of potential college students. According to the College Board in 2009, Texas had the 22nd highest SAT participation rate (21st if you don't count the District of Columbia): 51 percent of Texas students in the class of 2009. The national average was 46 percent. Maine had the highest participation rate (90 percent), followed by New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and D.C. In recent years, neither the percentage of SAT-takers in Texas nor the state's place in the College Board rankings has changed much. In 2008, Texas again came in 22nd, with 50 percent of students taking the test. In fact, as long as Perry has been governor, Texas has ranked 20th, 21st or 22nd. Its share of students taking the test has ranged from a high of 57 percent (2003) to, most recently, a low of 51 percent. So how does the governor's two-part statement score? We'll cut him slack for saying Texas has the most students taking the SAT, since he immediately backed off when questioned. And Texas did have the third-highest number of high-school students who took the SAT in 2009. Perry's statement that Texas has a high percentage of students taking the SAT begs the question: High compared to what? While the share of Texas students who took the test in 2009 exceeded the national average, 20 other states had greater shares of students taking the test including similarly high-population states such as Florida, Pennsylvania and New York. California had a smaller share: 49 percent. We figure "high" means better than barely above average. To stick with the school metaphor, 51 percent is a failing grade. We rate Perry's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12420	"President Obama became the first president since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/18/charles-schumer/did-federal-inmate-population-drop-under-obama-fir/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently charged federal prosecutors with taking a more aggressive approach to charging defendants, including seeking mandatory minimum sentences. The guidelines, signed on May 10, 2017, moved in a very different direction from what the Department of Justice had been doing under President Barack Obama. Under Obama, the department focused on prosecuting the most serious criminals and finding ways to keep minor or low-level offenders from serving long, mandatory sentences. During a May 18 floor speech, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., made clear that he thought Sessions’ new guidelines were ill-advised. "Thanks in part to this initiative, President Obama became the first president since (Jimmy) Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office," Schumer said. We wondered if that comparison was correct. When we checked with Schumer’s office, a spokesman pointed us to research by the Pew Research Center, a widely trusted independent source. Pew looked at federal Bureau of Prisons data going back to the 1920s and produced this graph showing a sharply increasing federal prison population between about 1980 and 2010. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The graph shows that not only was Obama the first president to see a drop in the federal prison population since Carter, but that only four other presidents (Johnson, Kennedy, Truman and Hoover) oversaw a decline on their watch. Most of the presidents studied -- nine, starting with Coolidge and ending with George W. Bush -- oversaw inmate increases on their watch. We wondered whether Schumer was cherry-picking data from the much smaller pool of federal inmates. In 2015, the number of inmates in state-run prisons was almost seven times larger than the number of federal inmates, and the total number of inmates in state and local facilities was more than than 10 times larger than the number in federal custody. However, we found that the same trends held for state and local inmate populations -- the number declined under Obama for the first time since at least the Carter years. Here are the trend lines for state inmates (dark blue) and local inmates (lighter blue), which we compiled from federal prison statistics: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Meanwhile, a credible argument can be made that Obama’s policies made a difference in driving the decline. As we’ve reported, Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 into law. It dramatically reduced a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine. And his administration advocated for, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission approved, the retroactive application of some of the new sentencing guidelines. Ironically, Sessions was among a number of Senate Republicans who spoke in favor of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. "I will not favor alterations that massively undercut the sentencing we have in place, but I definitely believe that the current system is not fair and that we are not able to defend the sentences that are required to be imposed under the law today," he said in a 2009 Senate speech about the bill. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he sees no significant omissions from Schumer’s statement. "The assertion is correct," Fox said. "The reasons are partly strategic and partly being in the right office at the right time. "During Obama's administration, prosecutors were discouraged from seeking unnecessarily long prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders, a practice that the Trump administration wants to change. In addition, the cumulative impact of a declining crime rate had an impact on prison populations." Our ruling Schumer said, "President Obama became the first president since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office." The statistics bear out Schumer’s assertion, so we rate it True.

pomt-12917	"By funding the authorization that’s already happened a decade ago (in the Secure Fence Act of 2006), we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to secure the border."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/17/luke-messer/rep-luke-messer-correct-2006-act-allows-border-wal/	With Donald Trump days away from taking the presidential oath, Republicans have been examining ways to help him meet his campaign promise of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Critics have called out the proposed wall as a tremendous expense. But Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., has said the Secure Fence Act of 2006 already supports construction of the border wall. "By funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border," Messer said in a CNN story published Jan. 6. We wondered if the 2006 law gives Trump the green light to get started on his immigration promise. Experts told us Messer’s claim is on point. A 2006 law The Secure Fence Act of 2006 was signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush. The act allowed the Department of Homeland Security to "take all actions the secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States." Those actions include the use of personnel, technology and physical infrastructure enhancements, the law says. That authorization of physical infrastructure enhancements could include a fence, wall, barrier, et cetera, said Molly Gillaspie, a spokeswoman for Messer. The 2006 law defined "operational control" as the prevention of all unlawful entries into the country, "including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband." It also directed the department to build two-layered fencing along five stretches of the border, amounting to about 850 miles, according to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report. That double layer requirement was revised by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, the report said. The modification directed the Homeland Security secretary to construct reinforced fencing "along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective and provide for the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to gain operational control of the southwest border." Currently, there are 702 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That includes 652 miles of primary fencing, 36 miles of double-layered fencing and 14 miles of tertiary fencing, according to the agency. In a post-election interview Nov. 13, Trump told CBS's Lesley Stahl he would accept fencing "for certain areas … but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate." In a press conference Jan. 11, Trump told reporters, "It’s not a fence. It’s a wall. You just misreported it. We’re going to build a wall." The Secure Fence Act of 2006 gives the Department of Homeland Security some discretion on how they choose to secure the border and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 gave the department greater flexibility, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank researching global issues. "It is our belief that U.S. Customs and Border Protection can build additional barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border — whether you call these ‘walls,’ fences or other sorts of barriers — in the regular course of its work and without requiring additional authorization from Congress," said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications and public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank studying migration policies and trends. A limitation for the construction of the southwest border wall would rise from Congress’ willingness to pay for it, not from needed authorization, said Edward Alden, an expert on border security and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank. The REAL ID Act of 2005, passed by Congress, even gave the Homeland Security secretary the authority to "waive all legal requirements" that may get in the way of constructing border barriers, Alden noted. That authority was used in 2008 by then Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff to waive environmental reviews. Our ruling Messer said, "By funding the authorization that’s already happened a decade ago (in the Secure Fence Act of 2006), we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to secure the border." The 2006 law authorized the Department of Homeland Security to "take all actions the Secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States." Those actions include the use of personnel, technology and physical infrastructure enhancements. Experts told us that what’s now needed from Congress to build a wall are funds, not additional permission. Messer’s claim is accurate, we rate it True.

pomt-11258	"We have spent $7 trillion, trillion with a T, $7 trillion in the Middle East."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-and-7-trillion-dollar-cost-war/	At a campaign-style event in Washington, Mich., President Donald Trump upped the ante on the costs of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. When running for president in 2016, Trump said America had spent $6 trillion on its response to the Sept. 11 terror attacks. In Michigan, he added another trillion. "We have spent $7 trillion — trillion with a T — $7 trillion in the Middle East," he told the crowd April 28, 2018. "You know what we have for it? Nothing. Nothing." We found that Trump inaccurately treated money that university researchers have predicted will be spent decades in the future as if it were already spent. The White House pointed to a couple of studies to back up Trump’s number. A 2016 analysis from a Boston University political scientist Neta Crawford calculated that by August 2016, the United States had "already appropriated, spent, or taken on obligations to spend more than $3.6 trillion in current dollars on the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria and on Homeland Security." But after adding an estimated $1 trillion for the future cost of treating wounded veterans through 2053, plus money for the Defense Department to fight wars, the total reached nearly $4.8 trillion. Crawford’s paper included this table: In the last row of her table, Crawford adds about $3 trillion in cumulative interest to reach a figure of nearly $8 trillion — over 35 years. She told us she used unpublished projections from the economist who wrote a 2011 paper on the macroeconomic impacts of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The estimated future cost of veteran care and debt service also played a role in a 2013 Harvard Kennedy School working paper that estimated long-term costs of $4 trillion to $6 trillion. "The largest portion of that bill is yet to be paid," the authors wrote. The key costs in the years ahead were veterans care, replacing military hardware, and interest on the debt that financed the fighting. According to the Congressional Budget Office, recent tax and spending bills make rising debt more likely in the years ahead, adding weight to the projected finance costs associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The authors of both papers acknowledge that there are large uncertainties in predicting costs so many years in the future. Looking at direct spending, the Congressional Research Service estimated in 2014 that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars had cost the United States about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. That figure did not include ongoing care for veterans. Our ruling Trump said that America has spent $7 trillion on the Middle East. The key flaw is Trump treated long-range estimates as money already spent. The money actually spent so far is closer to $2 trillion. The reports cited by the White House estimated costs about 30 years into the future. The highest estimate in those reports supports Trump’s $7 trillion figure. Still, wounded veterans will need care and debt must be repaid with interest. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04141	Says "10 days after Hurricane Katrina, this chamber passed two separate bills amounting to $60 billion. It has been nearly two months since we had Superstorm Sandy, and nothing has passed."	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/03/robert-menendez/hurricane-sandy-aid-still-pending-us-sen-robert-me/	Two months after Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of the Garden State, New Jersey officials and residents are still waiting for Congress to sign off on roughly $60 billion in emergency relief aid. But after Hurricane Katrina pummeled New Orleans in August 2005, it only took 10 days for a similar level of federal aid to be approved for that disaster, according to U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez. Raising his voice, the New Jersey Democrat offered that comparison during a Dec. 27 speech on the Senate floor in regard to a $60.4 billion aid package for Sandy victims. The Senate approved the package Dec. 28, but the House has delayed action on the funding. "I want my colleagues to remember that 10 days after Hurricane Katrina, this chamber passed two separate bills amounting to $60 billion," Menendez said. "It has been nearly two months since we had Superstorm Sandy and nothing has passed." Menendez is right. In the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, the Republican-controlled Congress approved two bills providing $62.3 billion in emergency funding, and President George W. Bush immediately signed them into law. In this fact-check, we’re not comparing the levels of damage caused by Katrina and Sandy. Our focus is on the timing of emergency appropriations approved by Congress. Here’s how the timing breaks down: Katrina made landfall Aug. 29, 2005, near Buras, La., and continued north toward New Orleans, leaving about 80 percent of the city flooded, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center. On Sept. 2, 2005, Congress passed a bill to provide $10.5 billion in emergency funding for disaster relief related to Hurricane Katrina. Then, on Sept. 8, 2005, Congress passed another bill for an additional $51.8 billion in emergency appropriations. So, 10 days after Katrina reached New Orleans, Congress had approved $62.3 billion in emergency funding. Now, let’s talk about federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy. Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City on Oct. 29, ultimately damaging more than 70,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey alone, The Star-Ledger has reported. Parts of New York and Connecticut suffered extensive damage as well. On Dec. 7, President Obama requested $60.4 billion in emergency appropriations to assist the states affected by Sandy. In a 62-32 vote on Dec. 28, the Democrat-controlled Senate approved that amount. But around the same time when the GOP-led House passed legislation dealing with the so-called "fiscal cliff," Speaker John Boehner canceled a vote on the disaster relief Tuesday night. Boehner is expected to schedule a vote tomorrow on $9 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program and another vote on Jan. 15 for the remaining $51 billion in the aid package. Our ruling In a Dec. 27 speech on the Senate floor, Menendez said that "10 days after Hurricane Katrina, this chamber passed two separate bills amounting to $60 billion. It has been nearly two months since we had Superstorm Sandy, and nothing has passed." The senator’s claim is on the mark. Within 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana in August 2005, Congress approved two separate bills providing a total of $62.3 billion in disaster relief funding. The Senate on Dec. 28 approved a $60.4 billion aid package for Hurricane Sandy, but the House has delayed action on the emergency funding. We rate the statement True.

pomt-03852	"More than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-64-percent-minimum-wage-earners-/	On news of the stock market hitting an all-time high, U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it’s time to raise the minimum wage. In a news conference on March 7, 2013, Pelosi, D-Calif., announced her support for a bill raising the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. "If we are to honor our commitment to a middle class, which is the backbone of our democracy, we have to reflect ... that intention in our public policy," she said. Then she added, "It is important to note in this Women's History Month, that more than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women. So this has a big impact on the financial security of our women." A reader asked us on Facebook about the statistic -- that nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage earners are women. We thought it was an interesting fact to check, and it turns out Pelosi is right. The best source for this information is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. BLS figures show there were slightly more than 3.5 million men and women earning minimum wage or less in 2012, and nearly 2.3 million women at those wage levels. So dividing the total by the women workers gets you to 64.4 percent. It’s interesting to note, however, that people earning the minimum wage account for a very small percentage of people working -- in this case, 2.6 percent of working women. Our ruling Pelosi said 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women. Government figures from 2012, which are based on census data, back up her assertion. We rate the claim True.

pomt-10925	"Every time they’ve done those border patrols, they’ve taken out people who have trafficked drugs. That’s the federal government’s role. They’re doing their job."	/new-hampshire/statements/2018/jul/27/chris-sununu/sununu-says-nabbing-drug-traffickers-border-patrol/	As the country was debating a federal policy of separating children and parents when they illegally enter the country, New Hampshire has been home to its own immigration debate. For almost a year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have set up shop on Interstate 93 in Woodstock, conducting a mandatory checkpoint for southbound vehicles on summer weekends. Motorists passing through are lined up, stopped and questioned by agents on their citizenship. Some applauded the checkpoints as a useful front in northern border control, but civil libertarians bristled at what they see as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. Recently, Gov. Chris Sununu defended the use of the checkpoints, invoking a well-publicized side effect of the stops: drug enforcement. "Every time they’ve done those border patrols, they’ve taken out people who have trafficked drugs," Sununu said on June 26. "That’s the federal government’s role. They’re doing their job." PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to explore whether arresting people for drug offenses is part of the federal government’s role at immigration checkpoints within the Granite State. Backing up the statement, Sununu’s spokesman pointed to the Customs and Border Patrol mission statement relating to the drug checks, which is two fold: "Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to (1) detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border and (2) to detect illegal narcotics," the agency states on its website. And Sununu is correct that the federal government has used the checkpoints in the recent past to facilitate drug arrests, according to Customs and Border Patrol and widespread media coverage of the stops. But a series of court decisions indicate that Sununu’s characterization is at odds with state and federal law. To start, the drug arrests were carried out by local law enforcement, not by federal agents directly. Over two multi-day stops in 2017, federal agents netted 984 grams (2.2 pounds) of marijuana and other drugs in narcotics, news releases said. But the 18 arrests for drug possession were handed over to the town of Woodstock Police Department, according to a CBP spokeswoman and Ryan Oleson, Woodstock Police Chief. In other words, the federal agents aren’t the ones making drug arrests. Local police are. During the same checkpoint, federal agents said they arrested eight people who did not have a valid immigration status, two of whom had overstayed their visa. The individuals were from Bulgaria, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala. In total, 55 undocumented people have been detained and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the four checkpoints set up since August 2017, according to CBP. Four more are planned this summer. Still, regardless of which agency brought out the handcuffs, Sununu’s comment raises a more basic question: Do drug arrests conducted at checkpoints fall under "the federal government’s role" - specifically Customs and Border Protection’s role? And Sununu’s comment about the "federal government's role" raises a larger question about the purpose of the checkpoints -- are they to catch illegal immigrants or drug offenders? On this, the U.S. Supreme Court and state Supreme Court are clear: The checkpoints must be intended for immigration enforcement, not drug searches. The federal precedent Inland border checkpoints -- those positioned up to 100 miles of the physical border -- have been in use since at least 1953, when a U.S. Department of Justice rule was passed authorizing the practice. They cleared their first major legal test in 1976, in the Supreme Court case U.S. vs. Martinez-Fuerte. In that case, three people arrested at a checkpoint at an interstate between San Diego and Los Angeles were appealing their immigration charges on constitutional grounds. The court held that immigration checkpoints did not constitute a violation on the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure -- even without specific probable cause. The decision gave the green light to inland CBP checkpoints in dozens of other states, including New Hampshire. But Martinez-Fuerte did not uphold the use of those checkpoints for searches of vehicles. The majority opinion made clear that the role of the checkpoints was to into citizenship status and papers, and expressly forbade automatic searches. "Neither the vehicle nor its occupants are searched, and visual inspection of the vehicle is limited to what can be seen without a search," wrote Justice Lewis Powell, Jr. for the majority. That distinction was made even more clear in Indianapolis v. Edmond, a 2000 decision that centered on a targeted drug enforcement initiative. In 1998, Indianapolis operated a series of vehicle checkpoints specifically designed to interdict drugs. But the Supreme Court took issue, finding the practice of mandatory vehicle searches without probable clause a clear Fourth Amendment violation. In that decision, the court drew a line between the drug searches and other forms of stops. Immigration checkpoints near the border were established by Martinez-Fuerte, the court held. And the court had already separately held that sobriety checkpoints — directly connected to the act and dangers of driving — were not overly-intrusive. But the drug possession checkpoints were inappropriate, the justices decided. Today, Customs and Border Patrol officials are careful to characterize any drug arrests as ancillary to the primary purpose of the checkpoints: immigration checks. Shortly after the second New Hampshire checkpoint of 2017 — held in September — Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman Stephanie Malin made clear the boundaries of permitted behavior in a statement to the Monitor. "At a Border Patrol checkpoint, an agent may question a vehicle’s occupants about their citizenship, place of birth, and request document proof of immigration status, how legal status was obtained and make quick observations of what is in plain view in the interior of the vehicle," she said. However, she added: "While running immigration checkpoints agents will sometimes encounter subjects with illegal contraband. In these instances, we will work with our state and local partners to mitigate the case accordingly." The ‘Live Free or Die’ exception Even though the Supreme Court has made clear what the primary purpose of the checkpoints should be, it hasn’t prevented the drug arrests that sometimes accompany them. In fact, courts in several states have held that those arrests are valid, even when done using drug sniffing dogs and a lack of specific probable cause. That’s where New Hampshire differs. In a May 1 state circuit court decision, Judge Thomas Rappa, Jr. moved to suppress drug evidence collected during the 2017 checkpoints. Federal officers walked drug sniffing dogs between the cars and those vehicles that the dogs "alerted" were pulled aside and searched. The evidence collected in this manner was used to support possession charges against 18 people charged with drug offenses, all U.S. citizens. "The CBP (border patrol) and the WPD (Woodstock Police Department) were working in collaboration with each other with the understanding that the WPD would take possession of any drugs seized below the federal guidelines for prosecution in federal court and bring charges in this court based on that evidence," Rappa wrote. "The evidence was seized in violation of constitutional rights recognized by the New Hampshire Supreme Court." Rappa indicated that the underpinning reasons have more to do with the state constitution than the federal constitution. While courts have allowed such drug arrests to stand in neighboring states like Vermont and Maine, New Hampshire’s Supreme Court has long established stringent search and seizure limits, rooted in Part I, Article 19 of the state constitution. A 1990 decision in State v Pellici, a New Hampshire case, established that the arbitrary use of drug sniffing dogs by state police would violate that article. Rappa said that precedent would apply to federal officers as well. "This Court finds that given that the defendants in this matter are facing prosecution in the State court for violations of State laws the constitutional protections of the New Hampshire Constitution should apply," Rappa wrote. As to the first part of Sununu’s statement that Border Patrol agents have "taken out people who have trafficked drugs" every time they’ve held a checkpoint, that’s not the case if he’s referring to arrests. Since that circuit court ruling, the Woodstock Police Department has ended its involvement with the the checkpoints, Sgt. Kevin Millar said earlier this year. And while drugs have been seized by CBP agents, no drug-related arrests have been made since the decision. Our ruling Gov. Chris Sununu said federal border checkpoints in New Hampshire help "take out" drug traffickers and were a key tool in the opioid crisis. "That’s the federal government’s role. They’re doing their job," he said. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that drug interdictions and arrests cannot be the intended role of Customs and Border Patrol agents, but rather ancillary actions taken if the situation arises. So, border patrol agents may seize drugs during checkpoints, but they turn over drug cases to local police. Meanwhile, state courts have ruled that New Hampshire’s constitution prevents drugs found at vehicle checkpoints by drug sniffing dogs from being used as evidence in court. In fact, local-federal cooperation on drug cases has stopped, and no drug-related arrests have been made since the decision. While drug detection is not the primary purpose of the checkpoints, it is a secondary aim, according to the Border Patrol. Sununu’s defense of the checkpoints leaves out important details.

pomt-03654	Accuses Ed FitzGerald of "pay-to-play and corruption politics."	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/30/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-portrays-ed-fitzg/	Before officially declaring his candidacy for governor last week, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald spent months preparing for his run against Republican incumbent John Kasich. Kasich’s allies have been preparing for FitzGerald nearly as long. There is little doubt FitzGerald will trade heavily on his experience as an FBI agent and his reputation for turning the page on a corrupt chapter of county government. But the GOP prefers to focus on FitzGerald’s largely inconsequential mention as "Public Official 14" in the indictment of Jimmy Dimora, the county commissioner later convicted on racketeering and other charges. Consider how the Republican Governors Association (RGA) welcomed FitzGerald to the race. "After failing to recruit a more experienced candidate, Democrats are now stuck with Ed FitzGerald’s brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics," said Executive Director Phil Cox. PolitiFact Ohio decided this was a good time to reexamine FitzGerald’s tangential connections to the widespread federal investigation of county corruption. The RGA statement was not the first -- nor will it be the last -- reference to the case. The Ohio Republican Party has launched a web site -- www.publicofficial14.com-- to blast FitzGerald, known in GOP shorthand as P.O. 14. But how fair and truthful are these tactics? The Plain Dealer wrote extensively in 2010 about FitzGerald’s bit role in the Dimora investigation. FitzGerald at the time was the mayor of Lakewood and the Democratic nominee for the powerful new position of county executive. Federal prosecutors charged Dimora a week after FitzGerald won the primary. They described a Lakewood deal for which Dimora had been bribed. On March 6, 2008, Dimora called FitzGerald on behalf of developer William Neiheiser, who was interested in leasing Lakewood’s ice rink. Neiheiser had been having trouble reaching the mayor. Neiheiser "wants to make a proposal to you ... that he thinks will be advantageous to the city and to you if you wanted to talk to him," Dimora told FitzGerald, according to a wiretap transcript. FitzGerald replied: "I’ll make the time … I’ll make time to talk to him." Dimora added: "If there’s anything we can do, uh, let us know …. any help we can provide." Neiheiser pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Dimora with free home improvements and other gifts in exchange for favors involving the ice rink and other public contracts. Essentially Dimora, then the chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, flaunted his ability to get lower-level party leaders on the telephone when a patron such as Neiheiser was in need. Prosecutors did not accuse FitzGerald of wrongdoing in the Dimora indictment, let alone charge him or even identify him by name. But as The Plain Dealer found, Neiheiser contributed $250 to FitzGerald’s political campaign the following month. And in June 2008, the Lakewood City Council unanimously agreed at FitzGerald’s urging to lease the ice rink to a Neiheiser company. FitzGerald and those who served on the Lakewood council at the time defended the deal as a smart financial move for the city. The lease called for Neiheiser’s company to operate the rink and pay the city about $75,000 a year in rent. Neiheiser’s attorney told The Plain Dealer in 2010 that his client had spent more than $2 million to refurbish the city-owned complex. Matt Dolan, the Republican nominee for county executive in 2010, raised questions about FitzGerald’s involvement in the Dimora deal and branded his opponent as Public Official 14. FitzGerald rid his war chest of contributions from Dimora, Neiheiser and others caught up in the investigation by making a charitable donation. And after beating Dolan and taking office as county executive he rid the county payroll of many patronage hires loyal to Dimora’s political machine. But in January, FitzGerald’s name again surfaced in a case, this time at a trial for another crooked contractor, Michael Forlani. An FBI agent testified that Forlani used two intermediaries in 2008 to disguise his campaign contributions to the then-mayor. FitzGerald told The Plain Dealer at the time that the agent’s testimony was the first he had heard of the donations. Then came an extraordinary announcement from Ann Rowland, the lead prosecutor in the corruption case. In a statement U.S. attorneys rarely make, Rowland cleared FitzGerald. "Ed FitzGerald is not a target of the investigation," Rowland said. "We have no evidence Ed FitzGerald knew Michael Forlani had anything to do with these contributions." After seeing Cox’s statement last week on FitzGerald, PolitiFact Ohio asked RGA spokesman Jon Thompson to specify what the group meant by FitzGerald’s "brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics." Thompson specified the Public Official 14 designation. Thompson also noted that the Ohio GOP has tied FitzGerald to the corruption probe. And he shared a link to the conservative Third Base Politics blog, which reported that the left-leaning Plunderbund blog had deleted posts from 2010 that presented FitzGerald as Public Official 14. So, let’s review. Cox accused FitzGerald of perpetuating a "brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics." More than 60 other public officials, government employees and contractors have been convicted of charges stemming from the federal investigation. But the agents and prosecutors who tore up county government never accused FitzGerald of a crime. And though FitzGerald has surfaced a couple of times in the investigation, the lead prosecutor has said he is not under suspicion. The "brand" in question is one Republicans no doubt prefer as they gear up for Kasich’s re-election battle. But they have no proof that FitzGerald engaged in corrupt politics. And they misleadingly hide behind the cryptic and nuanced "Public Official 14" designation while ignoring the much more direct and meaningful exculpatory statement from the lead prosecutor. They also ignore the work FitzGerald has done to clean up after the corrupt regime that preceded him. Facts lay waste to any effort like this one that explicitly brands FitzGerald as a corrupt politician. Pants On Fire!

pomt-14238	"Senate Bill 1070, simply, just mirrors federal law."	/arizona/statements/2016/apr/13/jan-brewer/former-arizona-gov-jan-brewer-claims-states-immigr/	Arizona knows a thing or two about controversial laws. As Mississippi and North Carolina deal with the fallout of passing anti-LGBTQ laws, losing out on a Bruce Springsteen show, for example, former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer reflected on a controversial Arizona immigration law in a March 28 Fox Business interview about President Barack Obama’s plan to admit 100,000 refugees by 2017. Brewer, who has endorsed Donald Trump for president, was asked about criticism that followed the former governor after she signed the 2010 Arizona measure into law. The interviewer singled out a provision in the law, that gave "law enforcement the right to ask people to see their papers." "The Arizona law, Senate Bill 1070, simply, just mirrors federal law," Brewer said. "What we need is the federal government to do their job, they need to secure our borders, it’s their job to protect the people." SB 1070, signed into law by Brewer in April 2010, allows law enforcement officers to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. It sounded a bit of an odd response by Brewer, given that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down most of the law since then, which included provisions such as making working in the country illegally a crime. Does Arizona’s immigration law really mirror federal law? We did not hear back from Brewer’s press office. SB 1070 a shell of its former self The law on the books today is a shell of the legislation that passed in 2010. Federal courts struck down every provision of the law with the exception of Section 2(B). That section allows state and local law enforcement to ask for proof of citizenship if that person is detained on a non-immigration related offense and the officer has "reasonable suspicion" that the person is undocumented. Because that portion of the law was not tossed out by the courts, you can reasonably conclude that it does not conflict with federal immigration law, said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. "It does not really ‘mirror’ federal law, which delegates enforcement power to federal immigration authorities, not state and local law enforcement," Johnson said. But it’s close. UC Davis law professor Gabriel "Jack" Chin noted that there is a federal statute that allows the exchange of immigration information between the federal government and state and local police. And a 2005 Supreme Court ruling in Muehler vs. Mena found that local police can ask someone lawfully stopped for their name, date of birth or immigration status. "It is not inaccurate to say that the state policy of gathering immigration information is consistent with federal law," Chin said. "As the Supreme Court held, it is certainly possible that SB 1070 could be interpreted in ways that violate federal law, but the basic step of gathering information does not." What about the rest of the law Brewer signed? The problem with this narrow view of Brewer’s statement is that it ignores the host of other provisions passed by the Legislature that were deemed inconsistent with federal law. SB 1070 initially included several provisions. According to Northern Arizona University criminology professor Raymond Michalowski, the law originally: 1. Made it a crime of "trespassing" to be undocumented in Arizona; 2. Allowed citizens to sue a local entity if they feel immigration laws are not properly enforced; 3. Made it a crime to stop your car to pick up a day laborer; 4. Made it a crime to transport an undocumented immigrant; 5. Made it a crime to work without papers and allowed state police to arrest individuals without a warrant if they believed the person was in the country illegally. All of these provisions, in the opinion of the courts, contradicted -- not mirrored -- federal law. "Federal immigration and criminal law contains none of these provisions," Michalowski said. "So the claim that SB 1070 ‘mirrors’ federal law is a fundamental misrepresentation of what that law sought to do." Stephen Legomsky, an immigration expert and professor emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis, said Brewer "clearly misspoke." SB 1070 once made it a state crime, without probation, for people who failed to carry their papers. This is still a misdemeanor at the federal level, but probation is allowed. As far as making working without papers a crime, Legomsky said Congress made that an "authorization for removal," not a criminal offense. And police arresting people without a warrant they suspect are undocumented is only permitted under federal law when the person is "likely to escape" before a warrant is issued. It is prohibited otherwise. Again, all these provisions were stripped, with the exception of police stops. "The Supreme Court in its decision over SB 1070 indicated that it did not believe that the statute mirrored the federal law, and in fact, even if it did, it felt that it was improper for the state to engage in the activity that they wanted to do under that statute," said Evelyn Cruz, Arizona State University’s Immigration Clinic Director. Justice Anthony Kennedy’s majority opinion in the SB 1070 case makes this clear: "Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law," he wrote. Our ruling Brewer said, "Senate Bill 1070, simply, just mirrors federal law." The law on the books today comes close to mirrored federal law. But that’s only because the majority of the law was tossed out by the federal courts because it conflicted with federal law. It’s an odd thing for Brewer to be bragging about. Brewer’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4da56f6c-dc6b-4c5b-a867-f213f0ac5b84	None	Jan Brewer	None	None	None	2016-04-13T19:00:00	2016-03-28	['None']
pomt-13677	Says Donald Trump "is going to go out and carpet bomb" the Middle East.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/02/joe-biden/joe-biden-wrong-say-donald-trump-has-called-carpet/	The morning before he was scheduled to speak at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden made an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe program, where the topic quickly turned to foreign policy and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. "Some of the things he says, like for example, I know he's trying to be tough but he's going to go out and carpet bomb," said Biden. "You want to make friends and influence people in the Middle East? So you're going to go carpet bomb innocent people and bad people at the same time, and that's going to help us fight against ISIS and Daesh?" Biden said. "I mean, the things he says are — are — are — make absolutely no sense." Carpet bombing is the strategy where the military indiscriminately bombs everything within a predetermined area regardless of whether civilians are present. A few hours later, at a news conference, Trump said Biden had lied about his position. "I never said I wanted to carpet bomb," Trump responded. "That was Ted Cruz." Who's correct here? We contacted a Biden spokeswoman but didn't receive a reply. So we searched the transcripts of major interview shows and Trump rallies and could find no instance where Trump called for carpet bombing. Instead, the Republican has repeatedly said he would "bomb the hell out of ISIS," with no reference to carpet bombing or any comparable tactic. Some examples: He's said he would "bomb the hell out of them" to destroy ISIS's oil-producing capacity, then send in United States oil companies to take that oil because "there is no Iraq" (Fox News, June 16, 2015); "I'd bomb the hell out of the oil fields. I'd then get Exxon, I'd then get these great oil companies to go in. They would rebuild them so fast your head will spin" (CNN, July 8, 2015). And this July 8, 2015, exchange with NBC's Katy Tur: Trump: "With ISIS, you kill them at the head. You take the oil. That’s where they’re getting their money. If you bomb the hell out of it, you bomb the hell out of it. You’ve got to stop their wealth. They have tremendous wealth." Tur: "What about civilians?" Trump: "I'm talking about oil. I’m talking about oil areas. I'm not talking about civilian areas." Tur: "Civilians are near oil areas." Trump: "Oh, give me a break, Katy. Go ahead. Next question." Trump is also correct that Cruz was the candidate who called for carpet bombing. The Texas senator proposed the strategy in a Dec. 5, 2015, speech, promising that "we will utterly destroy ISIS. We will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I don't know if sand can glow in the dark, but we're going to find out." Cruz repeated it several times throughout the campaign but tried to redefine carpet bombing by saying he did not want civilians to be targeted. (PolitiFact concluded in December 2015 that Cruz's definition, saying that only enemy soldiers would be bombed, was essentially the opposite of carpet bombing.) So Trump was right and Biden was wrong. We should also note that Biden isn't the only Clinton enthusiast to level that accusation against Trump. Four days later, on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, retired Marine Corps General John Allen, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan, made a similar claim. Allen, who spoke at the Democratic convention, has endorsed Clinton. "What we do have to do, George, is listen to what (Trump) has been saying about our military," Allen said. "He's called it a disaster. He says our military can't win anymore. That's a direct insult to every single man and woman who's wearing the uniform today. He's talked about needing to torture. He's talked about needing to murder the families of alleged terrorists. He's talked about carpet-bombing ISIL." "Who do you think is going to (be) carpet-bombed when all that occurs?" Allen said. "It's going to be innocent families." Our ruling Biden said that Donald Trump "is going to go out and carpet bomb." Trump has made it clear that he's not going to be reluctant to bomb ISIS, but the candidate has not, as far as we could find, called for a practice that includes bombing civilians, which is what carpet bombing can entail. It was another GOP candidate, Ted Cruz, who called for carpet bombing. We rate Biden's claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f4590925-b207-4146-81aa-f6940c99f7c6	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2016-08-02T15:57:26	2016-07-27	['Middle_East']
pomt-08938	"The Arizona law basically parrots the federal immigration law."	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/24/tom-ganley/congressional-candidate-tom-ganley-says-arizonas-n/	The Obama administration’s decision to sue Arizona over its newly adopted immigration law provoked howls of outrage from Republicans around the country. While the Justice Department said the lawsuit was needed to avoid racial profiling and stake out the federal government’s role in setting immigration policy, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele called it "another instance of hollow, political gamesmanship from a White House unwilling to take the bold action necessary to solve one of the country’s most pressing issues." House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio opined that border violence is "out of control," and that states have "a right and responsibility to ensure order and the safety of their citizens, especially when the federal government is asleep at the wheel." Even 13th District Congressional Candidate Tom Ganley of Brecksville got into the act, authoring a column on his campaign website blog that asks: "Why is the Obama Administration Suing Arizona?" Like Boehner, Ganley said states should step in if the federal government isn’t enforcing immigration laws. "Interestingly, the Arizona law basically parrots the federal immigration law," Ganley continued. "I wonder what part of the federal law the Obama Administration doesn’t like?" Ganley’s claim about the Arizona law parroting federal immigration law itself parrots statements that conservatives have made since the Arizona law was adopted. We looked at a version of the claim that that columnist George Will floated on an April 25th talk show. "What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is a crime, a federal crime," Will opined on ABC This Week. Legal scholars we talked to highlighted two key sections of Title 8 of the U.S. Code, which duplicate the "meat" of the new Arizona law. Section 1304e of the federal law requires that "every alien, 18 years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him." Those who fail to comply will be guilty of a misdemeanor and will be fined $100 and can be imprisoned up to 30 days. Section 1306a of the federal law says that, "Any alien required to apply for registration and to be fingerprinted in the United States who willfully fails or refuses to make such application or to be fingerprinted, and any parent or legal guardian required to apply for the registration of any alien who willfully fails or refuses to file application for the registration of such alien shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not to exceed $1,000 or be imprisoned not more than six months, or both." The new Arizona law makes it a state crime if immigrants are in violation of either of those codes. Gabriel Chin, a professor of law at the University of Arizona, said that the claim is generally correct, but those sections of the law are "among the least prosecuted in the U.S. Code." "For the relevant offense at issue here, failure of a non-citizen to register in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1306(a), there were five convictions across the U.S. in FY 2008," Chin said in an email to PolitiFact. "So to be precise, the statement would be 'What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is . . . a federal crime that the federal authorities have chosen not to enforce except in rare circumstances.'" In fact, proponents of the Arizona law have argued that's why new state immigration rules are needed; federal authorities are not doing a consistent job of enforcing immigration laws that are already on the books. So, in the two cases above, the bill does make what are already federal crimes state crimes. There are other parts of the new law that also overlap with federal statute. For instance, section 5 of the Arizona law, which deals with the transportation of non-citizens, is nearly identical to section 1324 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code. However, the Arizona law does break new ground. For example, Section 5 also would make it illegal to pick up day laborers on the street for hire, "which has nothing to do with federal law. It's essentially a traffic law," Chin wrote. Those violating this section are guilty of a misdemeanor. And it also makes it a crime for an illegal immigrant to solicit work. Mary Giovagnoli, director of the Immigration Policy Center, pointed out another aspect of the bill that she finds particularly troubling: Section 2 of the Arizona law would allow citizens to sue local and state authorities if they do not believe the new law is being enforced effectively. State and local authorities could be fined between $1,000 and $5,000 a day for each day the policy remains in effect. The bill also includes new language about how the law applies to employers and specifies the circumstances under which an officer can question and arrest someone he or she thinks is in violation of the law. When it comes to some of the most talked about parts of the law, having to do with aliens who fail to carry proper paperwork and failing to register, Ganley is correct about the core of the law; federal statutes already makes those two provisions a crime. But the law also includes a new prohibition barring picking up day laborers on the street for hire and soliciting for work. That's not in the federal code. As a result, we find the claim to be Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Tom Ganley	None	None	None	2010-07-24T12:00:00	2010-07-06	['Arizona']
pomt-08862	Georgia has lost more than 124,000 jobs and the unemployment rate has increased since the stimulus passed	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/05/republican-national-committee-republican/obamas-stimulus-hasnt-helped-georgia-gop-says/	President Barack Obama rarely comes to Georgia, so when he arrived in Atlanta on Monday for two events, the Republican Party wanted to make sure everyone here was aware of the problems it has with his economic policies. "Since the stimulus was passed, Georgia has lost over 124,000 jobs and the unemployment rate has risen from 8.7 percent to 10 percent," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg wrote in a statement. AJC Politifact Georgia had some questions about the statement and contacted the Georgia Republican Party because it appeared on the state party's Web site. The party forwarded us some comments from Henneberg that highlighted its larger point about Obama: The stimulus package he signed in February 2009, a month into his presidency, has been a dud, according to the GOP. "With an unemployment rate far above what the White House claimed we would ever reach with the stimulus, and with Georgia continuing to shed jobs even since last August, there is simply no way to argue that the stimulus is working," Henneberg wrote. We looked at the numbers to see whether Henneberg's numbers were correct. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, slightly more than 4.8 million Georgians were in the labor force in February 2009. By June 2010, there were slightly less than 4.7 million Georgians in the labor force, the data show. The decrease was slightly more than 124,000 workers. According to the BLS data, the unemployment rate in Georgia in February 2009 was 8.7 percent. In June 2010 -- the latest numbers available -- it was 10 percent. In both areas, the RNC's numbers are accurate. But some economists say there's a larger point to make. They argue that job losses and unemployment would have been higher without the stimulus. Jeff Humphreys, a well-known economist at the University of Georgia, thinks the RNC's numbers do not tell "the full story." Humphreys, director of UGA's Selig Center for Economic Growth, said the stimulus helped counter the lack of growth in the private sector. Mark Vitner, managing director and a senior economist for Wells Fargo, agrees that the job losses would have been greater if the stimulus hadn't been approved. Both men agree the stimulus could have done more for Georgia. They say more money should have been allocated for infrastructure projects that would create jobs, such as building new roads and bridges. "It takes longer to do infrastructure, but in my mind, it would had been an acceptable trade-off," Humphreys said. It appears Georgia has a mitigating factor in regards to how the stimulus has helped unemployed residents. A USA Today analysis reported Wednesday found states with higher unemployment rates received less stimulus money per capita than states with lower unemployment rates. Georgia, the analysis shows, was tied with Kentucky and North Carolina for having the 14th-highest unemployment rate in the nation. Georgia, meanwhile, received $1,353 per person in stimulus money, USA Today reported. Only three states (Florida, Texas and Virginia) received less money per person, the newspaper found. Vitner, who recently completed a report on Georgia's economy, said the Peach State's primary problem in this recession is the glut of vacant housing; some of it never sold, some it was lost in foreclosure. Aside from first-time home buyer credits, there are few silver bullets for Georgia, he said. "Georgia hasn't really benefited that much from the stimulus," Vitner said. Georgia's unemployment rate peaked in February and March at 10.5 percent, according to BLS data, and it has dropped each consecutive month. A comparison of monthly unemployment data in 2010 with 2009 shows Georgia's labor force declined at a slower rate than a similar comparison of monthly data between 2009 and 2008. Interestingly, Georgia's unemployment rate saw its greatest 12-month increase in the past 10 years from February 2008, when it was 5.2 percent, to February 2009, when it was 8.7 percent. In February 2008, Congress approved and then President George W. Bush signed into law the first stimulus package. So is it fair to reach the conclusion in the RNC statement by solely focusing on the 2009 stimulus? The RNC said yes, directing us to comments the president made in an interview with NBC News. "That's my job -- as president -- is to take responsibility for moving us in the right direction [on the economy]," Obama is quoted as saying. Obama also said in the interview that the Bush administration created policies that put the nation into a recession. So where does that leave us? The RNC's numbers are correct, but a closer look at all of the data shows Georgia's unemployment woes would have been worse without the stimulus. The USA Today report shows Georgia may not be getting its fair share in stimulus funds. It seems there are some mitigating factors to consider when looking at the RNC's statement. We rate it as Mostly True.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2010-08-05T06:00:00	2010-08-02	['None']
pomt-13398	Says Donald Trump "was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said back in 2006, ‘Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.’ "	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-rooted-housing-c/	In the opening skirmish of the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton cast her rival as a man who put his own business interests ahead of the welfare of average Americans. "Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis," Clinton said. "He said back in 2006, ‘Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.’ What does the record show? We found many examples from 2006 to 2009 when Donald Trump spoke of the "great opportunity" that came with falling real estate prices. One of the earliest instances was in a Trump audiobook from 2006. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, "There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?" "Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy," he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. "If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money." Now that was before the collapse that led to the Great Recession, and arguably, Trump was simply offering sound business guidance. Trump touted the same view a couple of times in 2007. But at that point, the country still was not looking at an economic catastrophe. The situation was quite different by early 2009. The investment house Lehman Brothers had filed for bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history. The Dow had suffered its worst weekly loss ever. Washington had bailed out General Motors and Chrysler. Foreclosures were rising weekly. Trump was on CNN Feb. 17, 2009, talking about the economy with host Wolf Blitzer and said the moment was a "great opportunity." Blitzer asked Trump why. "If you get something really prime, really good, eventually it's going to be worth a lot more than you paid," Trump explained. "I used to tell people two years ago, don't buy real estate and I used to preach it hard. And now I'm saying, I think that this is a good time. Whether you hit the exact market or not, I can't tell you. But I think this is a great time to buy. If you have cash, this is the great time to buy." To be clear, Trump was speaking as an investor. He was not necessarily rooting for the housing crisis. But it was under way as he spoke. We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not receive any information to add to this picture. Our ruling Clinton said Trump was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. While Trump did not welcome the tragedy of foreclosures for millions of Americans, he did speak optimistically about the opportunities the overall situation created for an investor such as himself. Clinton’s statement leaves out that nuance, but in large measure, it matches Trump’s words.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there will be 34,000 unfilled jobs for auto mechanics and 4,000 for airline technicians each year through 2014. However, she exaggerates the pay that graduates of vocational schools can expect to earn in these professions.

pomt-07186	"The (national) debt really added up $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year."	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/09/scott-rigell/rep-rigell-says-us-debt-could-hit-99-trillion-year/	U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell issued a dire warning recently about the country’s fiscal problems. "When $14.3 trillion is cited as the total of our national debt, that is only taking into account one part of the equation," Rigell, R-2nd, said in a June 3 newsletter e-mailed to constituents. "When the unfunded liabilities of mandatory entitlement spending are accounted for, the debt really added up to $75 trillion in 2010 and is on track to hit $99 trillion this year." It’s widely known that last month, the U.S. government hit its $14.3 trillion "debt ceiling" -- the maximum amount it’s allowed to borrow without further congressional authorization. But when you lump in entitlement spending, was the national debt really $75 trillion in 2010 -- more than five times the debt ceiling? Is the debt really on track to jump another $24 trillion by the end of 2011? We decided to find out. First, we asked Rigell’s office where these colossal numbers came from. Kim Mosser, Rigell’s communications director, pointed to an April slide-show presentation on the debt from the House Budget Committee. It included a graph detailing "unfunded promises." For 2010, the graph showed a tally of $76.4 trillion. For 2011, it showed a total of $99.4 trillion -- close to Rigell’s figures. But exactly what costs are included in those numbers? Conor Sweeney, the communications director for the Budget Committee, told us the figures come from reports by the Government Accountability Office on the nation’s fiscal outlook. Looking at those studies, it’s clear the tallies Rigell cites are not, as he suggests, overall debt totals. They are complex and long-term projections used to estimate the 75-year costs of maintaining Social and Medicare under present-day conditions. Technically, the numbers are GAO estimates of the amount of money needed to keep the level of publicly held debt at its present ratio of debt to gross domestic product for 75 years. The GAO calls it the "fiscal gap," a measure of the shortfall between revenues and spending promises for entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. For example, under one scenario, it would take $99.4 trillion in new revenues, measured in current-day dollars, to keep publicly-held debt 75 years from now at 62 percent of GDP -- its level at the beginning of 2011. That money could come from higher taxes, decreased spending or a combination of both. In a 2010 report, the GAO estimated it would take $76.4 trillion to keep publicly held debt at its January 2010 level of 53 percent of GDP. But these are pessimistic projections of the nation’s long-term finances. The $99.4 trillion and $76.4 trillion figures arise from assumptions that most tax cuts will be extended for 10 years, discretionary spending will grow at the pace of GDP, and physician fees under Medicare will grow with inflation. Under a moderate set of assumptions, the GAO projects the level of money needed to keep the publicly held debt level constant would be much lower -- $31.9 trillion would be needed to keep the debt 75 years from now at its January 2011 level. Regardless of which scenario is used, the country needs to change its long-term fiscal trajectory, according to the GAO. Rigell mischaracterizes the GAO’s numbers as total debt, when in reality they measure something different. Let’s turn to another point. Rigell calls the projected shortfalls in funding entitlement programs for the next 75 years "unfunded liabilities." Many economists dispute that contention, noting that Congress is free at any time to reduce or alter the programs. "Legally, they are not liabilities," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. "They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations." But Edward Mazur, a former member of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, said some social insurance programs should be counted as liabilities until the government alters the parameters of its promises. To summarize: Rigell said that the national debt was $75 trillion in 2010 and is projected to be $99 trillion in 2011 when unfunded entitlement costs are factored into the equation. But his numbers are not based on actual totals of entitlement spending and the debt in any given year. His figures are based on pessimistic 75-year projections of what it would cost to continue entitlement programs under present-day conditions. A lot can change over 75 years. Rigell is mischaracterizing the nation’s debt level. We rate his claim False.	None	Scott Rigell	None	None	None	2011-06-09T13:40:25	2011-06-03	['None']
pomt-09716	A president must "obtain Congress' consent before formally accepting the Nobel Prize."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/29/ginny-brown-waite/does-president-need-permission-congress-accept-nob/	Three Republican members of Congress wrote President Barack Obama a letter telling him he needs to "obtain Congress' consent before formally accepting the Nobel Prize." The members — Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite and Rep. Cliff Stearns of Florida, and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas — point to Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which reads, in part: "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." In their letter, they write, "As the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by a committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway, the Storting, the prize is clearly subject to the requirements set forth in Article 1, Section 9, of the Constitution. Obtaining permission from Congress should be straightforward." They said the precedent was set when President Theodore Roosevelt created a committee to hold his prize money and then obtained the consent of Congress to send the money to various charities. Roosevelt received the prize in 1906 for mediating a peace agreement between Russia and Japan. We wanted to know if the representatives were correct that Obama has to obtain the permission of Congress before accepting the prize, which he was awarded for his diplomatic efforts on international cooperation and nuclear disarmament. We went down many avenues of research here. The Nobel Peace Prize includes a cash gift of about $1.4 million, so that seems to fit the definition of a "present." The Republican members are also correct that the members of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee are appointed by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting. But it's not clear that the Nobel Peace Prize could be considered as being given by "a foreign state." The committee's Web site says it "is formally independent even of the Storting, and since 1901 it has repeatedly emphasized its independence" and that it was "appointed by the Storting (the Norwegian Parliamant), but without the committee being formally responsible to the Storting." Over the years, the Storting has taken steps to distance itself from the committee to emphasize that the award is "not an act of Norwegian foreign policy." The Nobel prizes are administered by a foundation, the Nobel Foundation, and the only reason the Norwegian parliament is involved is because prize founder Alfred Nobel said in his will that he would like members of the Storting to pick the committee members for the peace prize. The other prizes have other selectors. Here's the quote from his will, dated Nov. 27, 1895: "The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical work by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm, and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting." (By the way, the Nobel Foundation is based in Sweden, not Norway, which has also been a source of confusion and controversy over the years.) We asked White House officials for their thoughts on the matter, and they firmly said that the Nobel Prize is not awarded by a foreign government. Spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield gave us this statement: "The President is donating the money to charity. The statute cited does not apply because the gift is from the Nobel Foundation — a private foundation — not a foreign government. The President is free to do what he likes with the money, and he has chosen to donate it to charity." Even if the Nobel Prize would be considered as coming from a foreign government, there is compelling evidence that a president does not have to seek special permission from Congress, because Congress already allows it, via statute. Law professor David Kopel researched the issue and posted a detailed analysis on the respected legal blog The Volokh Conspiracy . Kopel located a statute, which we reviewed, that allows American officeholders and government employees to accept foreign prizes if the recipients meet a number of requirements. The statute specifically mentions that the president and the vice president are included. Kopel said the statute allows a president to accept the prize without any additional permission, as long as he turns the prize money over to his "employing agency," which would likely be an office of the White House. "Thus, it seems clear that the statute already supplies the constitutionally-required congressional consent for President Obama to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, and no further action by Congress is needed, provided that President Obama signs the check over (to) the government, as the statute requires," Kopel wrote. Kopel told us that the statute appears to have been written in 1966, with several revisions since then, so it wouldn't have applied to Roosevelt or Wilson. The problem Obama might run into, Kopel said, is if he wants to direct the money to a specific charity. For that, he would need permission from Congress, because the Constitution says "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." That might be the more pertinent reason Roosevelt sought permission from Congress when it came to giving the money to charity. Roosevelt wanted to use his prize money for a new "Industrial Peace Committee" so Congress created a commission, according to news reports. The committee must have never gotten off the ground, because years later, Roosevelt asked Congress to direct the money toward war relief. We looked for formal Peace Prize authorizations from Congress for Roosevelt and President Woodrow Wilson, the two sitting presidents who have previously received the prize. (Wilson received the prize in 1920 for his work the previous year establishing the League of Nations, a forerunner of the United Nations.) We couldn't find any authorizations, and we double-checked with librarians who specialize in historical congressional research, and they couldn't find anything either. We were also unable to find out what Wilson did with his money; one biography said Wilson was worried about his finances and suggested that he simply kept the money. In his defense, he was in poor health when he left office, and presidents didn't get a pension back then. Finally, a more contemporary comparison to the flap over Obama's prize might be the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize. That year, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger won the prize along with Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam for their efforts to negotiate a peace agreement for the Vietnam War — though Le Duc Tho rejected the prize. We found op-eds from American liberals who thought Kissinger didn't deserve it, and many protests from university students and faculty. Members of the Norwegian parliament were also reportedly infuriated and said they planned to look into the committee's operations. But we didn't find that Kissinger received any special permission to accept the prize. Kissinger told the press he wanted the prize money to go to scholarships for the children of soldiers killed or missing in action. Kissinger donated the money — back then it was $50,000 — to Community Funds Inc., a companion organization of New York Community Trust, and it created a scholarship fund that was expected to last about 10 years, according to a 1974 news report. There was no mention in the news report of Congress authorizing this, and we couldn't find anything in the Congressional Record on the donation, either. This is a tricky one for us. This is a matter of legal interpretation that may ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. We understand the Republicans' point — although it's a tenuous one, in our view — that the Nobel committee might be considered a governmental panel. We believe much evidence points to the contrary — that the Storting's sole task is to appoint members, and then the government's connection to the prize ends. The Nobel Foundation is not part of the Norwegian government; it's a private Swedish foundation. And we haven't found any evidence to show that Roosevelt, Wilson or Kissinger sought permission from the government to accept the prize. But the tenuous link is enough to earn a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04937	Says Democrats racked up a $1 billion state deficit, while Republicans under Bill O'Brien balanced the budget.	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jul/29/new-boston-republican-committee/new-boston-gop-says-dems-left-deficit/	If spring is lilac season in New Hampshire, summertime is election season, and campaign signs sprout like weeds on every corner. One sign, posted recently around the Nashua area by the New Boston Republican Committee, boils down the upcoming state election to a simple, 11-word statement, describing the difference between recent Democratic and Republican legislatures. "NH DEMOCRATS $1 BILLION DEFICIT," the sign reads. "NH REPUBLICANS UNDER BILL (House Speaker William) O’BRIEN BALANCED BUDGET." Certainly, the recession has had its effect on New Hampshire, and state revenues have taken a hit. But did the Democrats, who lost the majority in the Statehouse in 2011, really leave a $1 billion deficit? We decided to crunch the numbers. First, it's important to note that New Hampshire lawmakers are legally required to balance the budget. So it's not accurate to suggest that the last Democratic budget had a deficit. And as you'll see below, they ultimately produced a surplus. We found that the New Boston Republican Committee was using the same tactic PolitiFact National had seen in an attack against Mitt Romney, portraying an interim budget projection as if it was a final outcome. To start our research, we reached out to the Republican committee in New Boston, a small farming community not far from Mont Vernon, the hometown of House Speaker William O’Brien. Committee members confirmed that the sign refers to the last Democrat-led budget, for Fiscal Year 2010-11. That year, the Democratic legislature boosted state spending and accepted federal stimulus funding, according to committee chairman Patrick Murphy. But, the Democrats failed to cover the spending with corresponding revenue increases, leaving the state far in the hole, he wrote in an email. To support his point, Murphy directed us to the Speaker’s office, which then pointed us toward a 2011 report by the Legislative Budget Assistant, a nonpartisan office that conducts investigations, analyses and research into the state government. In January 2011, days after the current Republican-led legislature took office, Jeffry Pattison, the budget assistant, issued a report identifying about $845 million in spending items that could pose concerns for the new legislature if all fiscal policies and structures remained the same. The report highlighted that the federal stimulus had provided $350 million that helped the state pay for schools and the Medicaid program. This was understood at the time to be a one-shot deal.The report also listed $141 million in state education payments set to go into effect if the legislature failed to act, as well as $92 million projected for municipal and school building aid. "I was talking about appropriations that would go up by virtue of formula driven things," Pattison said last week. "Things that would happen if nothing was done about them." Add to the $845 million figure another $50 million shortfall, projected by the House of Representatives at the time, and you reach $895 million -- most of the way to the New Boston Republicans’ $1 billion figure and closer to the $900 million quoted often by O’Brien, the House Speaker. "Combining these items left an anticipated, unresolved deficit, according to the LBA, for the FY2012-13 budget," Greg Moore, chief of staff to the House of Representatives, wrote in an email to the Telegraph. "That is where the Speaker identified that figure and why he uses ‘nearly $900 million’ number regularly." Still, whether $900 million or $1 billion, the numbers didn’t hold up over time. Like in the numbers cited in past PolitiFact items, Pattison never considered his estimates as a final budget tally. Instead, he intended them to be a point-in-time projection to give legislators an idea of what could happen over the years to follow. "These are snapshots in time," Pattison said last week. "I wanted to make sure they had their eyes open, that they knew coming in what was ahead of them." This is a routine situation for both parties. Budget analysis predict when spending will exceed revenues and lawmakers have to balance them. And legislators took note, crafting a 2012-13 budget that responded to the projected deficits. "At the time of the implementation of the new budget, ALL parties expected that the budget would end in deficit," wrote Moore, the House chief of staff. But, by the time the budget accountant office finished its formal audit early this year, the final report told a different story. In the end, the Fiscal Year 2011 budget didn’t show a billion dollar deficit, or any deficit at all. The Democrats actually produced a surplus in their last year. That year, the state, which is required by statute to keep a balanced budget, took in $1.385 billion in revenues, spending $1.325 billion, according to the final audit. Factoring the state’s $64 million surplus entering the 2011 fiscal year, and subtracting the $124 million contributed to the education trust fund, among other fund transfers, the state closed the Fiscal Year 2011 with a $17.7 million surplus. Legislators also maintained the state’s $9.3 million rainy day fund. Some political leaders contend the numbers are skewed because lawmakers relied heavily on borrowing and federal funds to balance the budget, as required by state statute. "It was not solved by any cuts the Democrats made but by a one time infusion of federal money," Murphy, the New Boston Republican chairman, wrote in an email. "A ‘Hail Mary Pass’ thrown by Obama is what made the difference." Still, others say it came through a range of budget cuts and tax hikes common to the budget cycle. "There was an increase in the tobacco tax. Programs were cut. … You have to make budget choices," added Pamela Walsh, an advisor for the state Democratic Party who served as deputy chief of staff to Gov. John Lynch at the time. "The numbers they used, it was as if the state government was on autopilot with no revenue growth." That brings us now to the current budget, for Fiscal Year 2012. The House Republican leadership team have credited themselves with cutting more than $1 billion, nearly 10 percent, from the state operating budget, now totaling $10.48 billion. But, according to initial projections, the state is running about $17 million short of initial revenue projections, Pattison said. "We’re in the process of closing the state books as we speak, but, as of right now, they’re a little off," he said. "This is just starting. (The Fiscal Year) isn’t even 30 days old. We’ll see where it’s at at the end." But here, too, those are projections, not a final deficit. Our ruling: The New Boston Republicans’ sign makes some big claims in only a few words. It wrongly describes a $1 billion interim projection as a deficit, ignoring the state law that mandates a balanced budget and the fact that the Democrats actually produced a $17.7 million surplus. The Republican group's sign is twisting the reality of the state budgets for partisan reasons and leaving people with a false impression. We rate it False.

pomt-02887	"In fact, there’s more state funding for education today than any other time."	/new-jersey/statements/2013/nov/10/chris-christie/chris-christie-tells-teacher-school-funding-highes/	Chris Christie’s heard the complaints often. He cut education funding. He supports charter schools. He’s hard on teachers, and his quest for tenure and other reforms is over the top. But the governor continues responding to those complaints with various versions of this refrain: New Jersey has the most funding put toward education in state history. And Christie said it again Nov. 2 during a gubernatorial campaign stop in Somers Point, when he and a public school teacher got into an argument. Christie was re-elected Tuesday. "In fact, there’s more state funding for education today than any other time," Christie said when the teacher cited the governor’s education funding cuts for why he has referred to New Jersey schools as "failure factories." Technically Christie is right about the level of education funding in New Jersey, but as we’ve pointed out in the past, there’s a bit more to this story that he doesn’t address. First, let’s get back to that remark about ‘failure factories.’ Christie used it during a speech he gave Oct. 6 to the Orthodox Union in Teaneck, where he promoted his education policies. "I would be happy to take as many dollars as possible away from failure factories that send children on a no-stop route to prison and to failed dreams, if we could take that money and put it into a place where those families have hope," Christie said. Now, to the governor’s point about education funding. Christie’s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget called for nearly $9 billion in education funding, about $1 billion more than the previous year. Under that spending plan, state aid to schools increased $97 million. While no district saw a state aid decrease, many either received an increase of $1 or their funding stayed the same as the previous year. At the time, Christie released a statement through the state Department of Education in which he touted the funding level while also emphasizing fiscal restraint. "However, even as we continue to fund education at the highest levels in state history, we must remain willing to reflect on how we are spending our money and work towards solutions that make every dollar we invest count," he said in the statement. We’ve previously run Christie’s claim past Steve Wollmer, a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union. Wollmer agreed that in terms of dollars, it’s correct that the state has its highest-ever level of education funding. But that doesn’t mean there hasn't a been long-lasting downside to cuts that Christie made during his first year as governor. He took office in January 2010. "But what he doesn’t mention is that he cut $1.3 billion from state aid in his first year – Withholding $475 million in aid in January, which was the amount that the state’s nearly 600 districts had in total surpluses for unanticipated expenses (a new roof, a bus that needed replacing, an unanticipated special ed placement), and another $820 million in the FY11 budget (which began for schools in September of 2010)," Wollmer said previously in a statement to PolitiFact New Jersey. "Districts cut back dramatically, and 10,000 teachers and staff were laid off, programs were cut, and class sizes increased." Those cuts continue to sting, Wollmer said. In addition to the cuts, the New Jersey Supreme Court in 2011 ordered Christie to increase aid to the now-former Abbott districts by about $500 million. Our ruling Christie last week said during an argument with a teacher, "In fact, there’s more state funding for education today than any other time." Critics frequently call the governor out for the massive funding cuts he’s made to education since taking office, and for either increasing state aid by a minimal amount or not at all. But the fact of the matter is that despite the cuts, New Jersey’s education funding level is the highest it’s ever been. For that reason, we rate Christie’s statement True.

pomt-01002	On the status of illegal immigrants	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/04/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flop-pathway-citizenship/	Editor's note: We rated this a Half Flip on Feb. 4, 2015 based on Gov. Walker's statements to date at that time. Subsequently, the governor disavowed his previous endorsement of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. We revisted his position in an item published March 6, 2015, with a new ruling of Full Flop. The left-wing group Media Matters for America cried flip-flop after Gov. Scott Walker bluntly told ABC News he opposed "amnesty" for illegal immigrants living in the United States. Walker, the group said in blog post, previously had supported a pathway to citizenship advocated by lawmakers in Washington, D.C. With Walker garnering plenty of attention amid a crowded field of potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates, let’s put this one to the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. In this case, we have visited Walker’s statements on immigration before, notably in August 2013, when we examined how Republicans were framing the issue in the wake of President Barack Obama’s re-election win with strong support from Hispanics. In the past, Walker has been hard to pin down on the question, and has made seemingly contradictory statements. So we were struck by Walker’s direct language and tone Feb. 1, 2015 in the "This Week" interview with ABC’s Martha Raddatz. Raddatz: "We know you want to fix the border and fix the immigration system, but what would you do about the 11 million undocumented who are still here? Walker: "I think for sure, we need to secure the border. I think we need to enforce the legal system. I'm not for amnesty…" In making the comments, did Walker change his position? Here are some key past statements he’s made, all in 2013: -- At a February 2013 national conference hosted by Politico, Walker said fixing the legal immigration system should come first, but said the next step is we "gotta embrace" a "legal pathway" for those here unlawfully. He did not elaborate on what he meant. -- In a July 2013 interview with Wausau (Wis.) Daily Herald staffers, Walker said "it makes sense" that people could not only stay here but get citizenship with the right mix of penalties and waiting periods and other requirements. -- In 2013 and later, Walker didn’t endorse any specific bill in Congress that would have allowed illegal immigrants to stay here. But at the Politico conference, he didn’t dismiss legislative action if some "nuances" were addressed. -- At that conference he flatly opposed deporting people who are here unlawfully, saying "you’ve got to find a way to make it legally possible for people moving forward." Soon after Walker’s reported comments sympathetic to some kind of path to citizenship made headlines, he started to walk back the idea he had supported such a thing. His spokesman told us in August 2013 that Walker had endorsed no specific policy or bill. And Walker said in November 2013 on MSNBC’s Morning Joe that he had not meant to back a pathway. Now let’s revisit the recent ABC interview in more depth. In that interview, Walker also said, "I’m not an advocate of the plans that have been pushed here in Washington" to allow those here to remain. That’s arguably more dismissive than he’s been before. But Walker added that he would roll out a plan of his own to address the issue. And he tossed in what sounded like softening remarks, saying "we’ve got to have a healthy balance. We’re a country both of immigrants and of laws. We can’t ignore the laws in this country, can't ignore the people who come in, whether it’s from Mexico or Central America." Finally, Walker told Raddatz he was not advocating deporting the estimated 11 million undocumented residents in the country. He summed up his position this way: "I am saying in the end, we need to enforce the laws in the United States, and we need to find a way for people to have a legitimate legal immigration system in this country, and that does not mean amnesty." What to make of Walker’s remarks? Walker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson said they were consistent with his past comments on what to do with those living here illegally. Walker does not consider the penalty-laden pathway to legal status that he endorsed in 2013 "amnesty," and he’s not advocating amnesty now, he said. For help, we turned to two groups advocating on this issue. An advocate with a group that backs a path to citizenship agreed Walker’s comments were vague, but detected a change in his words and actions. Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of America’s Voice, noted Walker said nothing in the spirit of his 2013 comments on finding a way, eventually, to allow people to stay. His goal "is to be as vague as possible so that he can court hard-right anti-immigrant voters while remaining viable in the general election," she said. Tramonte said Walker has indirectly backed deportations by joining a lawsuit challenging President Obama’s authority to issue a November 2014 executive order on immigration. That order protected from deportation some 4.1 million parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, and hundreds of thousands more young people. We also spoke with Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). The group is a leading critic of legalizing the status of people who jumped the line to get in. Walker’s description of his views as anti-amnesty doesn’t necessarily mean much, Mehlman said. Republicans, even if they want to find a way to let illegal immigrants remain here, reject the "amnesty" label for political reasons, he said. On the substance of Walker’s remarks, Mehlman said that, coming in such a brief exchange, Walker’s comments were too cryptic to really evaluate his position. Mehlman’s view: Walker really hasn’t backed away from his 2013 statements, so in they eyes of FAIR, he still supports what some might term amnesty. "Politicians from both parties who support granting legal status to millions of illegal aliens go to great pains to define what they support as something other than amnesty," he said. Our rating We don’t see a Full Flop by Walker here. Walker didn’t directly disavow his 2013 remarks -- or repeat them for that matter. And the truth is that we don’t really know whether he has a completely new position, because he wasn’t asked to clarify his views in detail. All we know is he’s not going to call his plan "amnesty" when it comes out. We do see inconsistencies in Walker’s framing of his views and the tone of his remarks as he begins to court conservative GOP primary voters -- including leaving a tough-sounding impression about handling illegal immigrants. On the meter, inconsistent statements or a partial change of position earn a Half Flip. That fits here. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-00640	Hedge fund managers "pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-hedge-fund-managers-pay-less-/	During a visit to Mason City, Iowa, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton resurrected an old Democratic theme -- that the rich pay less in taxes than working people do. "Hedge fund managers themselves make more and pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers," she said during the May 18, 2015, visit. This is a topic we’ve delved into several times previously, but the way Clinton worded this claim makes it particularly off-base. Usually, the claims we’ve seen specifically refer to whether a nurse or truck driver pays a higher tax rate than a millionaire -- in other words, a higher percentage of their income in taxes, rather than a higher dollar amount. But Clinton didn’t make that distinction in her remarks, at around 12:45 in this video. (Later that day, Clinton appeared at another event in Iowa and used the term "tax rates.") Let’s take a closer look. The available data isn’t perfect for making this sort of comparison, but we’ll use the most appropriate data we can find and note the caveats. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median 52-week earnings for industrial truck and tractor operators was $30,888 a year. For registered nurses, it was $56,680 a year, and for nurse practitioners it was $87,516 a year. Let’s take the most extreme example. Say a nurse makes $100,000, which is actually well above the median for the most well-compensated category of nurse. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, taxpayers earning between $75,000 and $100,000 pay an average tax rate of 15.7 percent, which includes not just income taxes but also payroll and other federal taxes. So that nurse earning $100,000 is going to pay, on average, $15,700 in federal taxes for the year. Nurse practitioners earning the median income level, or registered nurses, would pay less. So would truck drivers, who earn less to begin with. Now let’s look at the hedge fund manager. The IRS calculated that in 2012, the 400 highest-income households in the country averaged $336 million in income, and the cutoff to make that list of 400 was about $140 million in income. We can be pretty sure there’s overlap between the IRS list of 400 and hedge fund managers, since the most recent top 10 list of highest-earning fund managers runs from annual earnings of $425 million all the way up to $1.3 billion. These 400 households paid an average of $56 million in taxes each. In other words, these fund managers were paying multi-million-dollar tax bills to the IRS, compared to an above-average example of a nurse paying $15,700. So using taxes paid, Clinton is incorrect. What if Clinton meant tax rates? Roberton Williams of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center told us he suspects that the point Clinton intended to make was that the primary source of income earned by hedge fund managers, known as "carried interest," is taxed as capital gains and not as earnings, and as a result, they face a rate of 20 percent plus surtaxes of 3.8 percent and 1.2 percent. In addition, there is no payroll tax payable on this income. By contrast, the income of ordinary workers is subject to both income and payroll taxes. This can narrow or erase the tax-rate gap between the two groups, at least in some cases. Is it theoretically possible that a particular nurse pays a larger share of his or her income in taxes than a particular hedge-fund manager? Yes -- each category has some variation in tax rates paid. But if you look at the typical case, Clinton’s claim paints a distorted picture of the nation’s tax structure -- and that’s if you grant that she meant to say "tax rates" rather than "taxes." Looking at income taxes alone, the average tax rate -- income taxes paid divided by adjusted gross income -- for the IRS top 400 is 16.7 percent. By comparison, the median trucker is paying approximately 6 percent of income in taxes (and there’s a decent likelihood that they are paying no income taxes at all, after consideration is made for exemptions and credits). So the median trucker is paying a much smaller percentage of income in taxes than a hedge fund manager. We should note that the definitions of income and taxes used by the Tax Policy Center and the IRS top-400 study are not exactly the same. The Tax Policy Center used a broader definition of both income and taxes than the IRS study did, which casts some doubt on the merits of comparing tax rates. When comparing total tax paid, however, the difference is so vast that methodological variations are not going to make much of a dent. Also, Williams noted that focusing on the top 400 earners effectively zeroes in on the best-compensated hedge-fund managers. We don’t have comprehensive data on the full spectrum of compensation for hedge-fund managers. However, even if one lowers the estimated income threshold for hedge fund managers to $1 million a year, the Tax Policy Center, using its methodology, suggests that people in that income bracket pay 34.6 percent of their expanded income in taxes, which is quite a bit higher than nurses and truck drivers do. (The lower tax rate in the top-400 list likely stems from the particular mix of income streams among the very wealthiest, which tend to get more favorable tax treatment.) Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact that, as she has in other appearances, Clinton was "making the point that a nurse making $66,000 per year is in the 25 percent tax bracket while many hedge fund managers are paying less than a 24 percent rate on millions of dollars they earn." However, we'll note that a person's tax bracket refers to the rate paid on the last dollar they earn, not what they pay overall in taxes compared to their full earnings. The latter is what Clinton's phrasing suggests. Our ruling Clinton said that hedge fund managers "pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers." She is certainly wrong for dollar amounts, which is what her statement was about. If she meant to say tax rates, that's more complicated, and the data doesn't clearly back up the point. Here, we're looking at just taxes paid, so we rate her claim False. UPDATE, May 20, 2015, 2:30 p.m.: This article has been updated to reflect a comment from Clinton's campaign staff.

pomt-13142	When asked about bills in Congress important to the North Country, Derrick responded ‘I just don’t know enough about it.’	/new-york/statements/2016/nov/01/elise-stefanik/stefanik-ad-takes-derricks-comments-out-context/	A television ad from U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Willsboro, charges her Democratic opponent doesn’t know enough about the North Country to represent the 21st Congressional District. The ad, which began airing in early October, portrays Mike Derrick as out of touch with the region. A narrator in the ad says, "When asked about bills in Congress important to the North Country, Derrick responded, ‘I just don’t know enough about it.’ Elise Stefanik does." The narrator then highlights Stefanik’s positions on a handful of issues important to the district. Derrick, a native of the Clinton County, attended schools in the town of Peru and Plattsburgh before embarking on his Army career. The West Point graduate served for 28 years in both the active and reserve forces, retiring in 2013 and then moving back to the region. He’s challenging Stefanik, a first-term member of Congress who previously worked in the White House under President George W. Bush and also led debate preparation for Paul Ryan when he ran for vice president in 2012. Is Stefanik’s ad right? Did Derrick say he didn’t know enough about legislation important to the North Country to take a position? When did he say that? We read the article Stefanik’s campaign quotes in the ad. It was published more than a year ago on the website of the Post-Star newspaper in Glens Falls. Derrick was participating in a discussion held by the Glens Falls chapter of Democracy for America, a progressive grassroots political organization led by Jim Dean and his brother, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. Derrick was asked about his position on single-payer health care at the October 2015 event. In a single-payer system, one entity handles health care claims and costs for customers instead of multiple insurance companies. Proponents say it would guarantee health care for people who may now lack it, while opponents believe such a system would drive up taxes and limit access to adequate care. Derrick did not take a position on single-payer health care at the time. "Whether or not we should move to a single-payer program in this country right now, I’m not ready to come out on that yet. I just don’t know enough about it," Derrick said, according to the article. Derrick’s views on health care A year after the event, Derrick’s position has evolved. Derrick, who supports the Affordable Care Act, believes Congress could build on the current health care system to create a single-payer system. "When my wife, Kathy, and I served in the military, we had access to health care through the TRICARE system. For us and so many other men and women in uniform, it was incredibly successful and effective," Derrick said. "I believe that we can use that as a model to build a single-payer health care system for all Americans. With a uniquely American single-payer health care system, we can finally ensure that everyone has access to the health care that they and their family need. This is what we should be working toward." He also said in an article in North Country Now that moving in the direction of a single-payer health care system similar to what the military uses would eventually drive down costs for consumers. Our ruling Stefanik began airing an ad in October accusing Derrick of not knowing enough about the issues that affect the North Country. The narrator in the ad says, "When asked about bills in Congress important to the North Country, Derrick responded, ‘I just don’t know enough about it.’ " Derrick said that about a particular kind of health care coverage - not other issues in the North Country. We rate this claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3e5b1a1f-1410-4e39-b6ef-6b459e4bf60a	None	Elise Stefanik	None	None	None	2016-11-01T11:59:48	2016-10-06	['United_States_Congress', 'North_Country_(New_York)']
pomt-10524	"John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/05/votevetsorg/a-fair-summary-of-what-he-said/	Two new videos — a TV ad from a veterans group and a parody of a popular YouTube video — quote John McCain as saying the United States could be in Iraq for 1,000 years. "John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq," Rose Forrest, an Iraq war veteran, says in an ad for VoteVets.org that aired in Washington, D.C., in late February and is still available on the Web. "That's some commitment to the Iraqi people, Sen. McCain." A YouTube video known as "John He Is" uses humor to make the same point. It spoofs a pro-Obama music video called Yes We Can . The parody has grainy footage of McCain saying, "I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years or a thousand years or 10,000 years" and ends with these words on the screen: "IRAQ WITHDRAWAL DATE: 12,008 . . . . GOOD LUCK WITH THAT IN NOVEMBER." (We're not putting the parody to the Truth-O-Meter, but it's worth checking out for a funny perspective on McCain's comments.) Sen. Barack Obama made a similar charge (but without the catchy music) during the Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Feb. 26, 2008, when he said, "We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years." The videos and Obama's statement made us wonder about the full context of McCain's remarks and whether the comments were portrayed accurately. We've previously addressed Sen. Hillary Clinton's claim about the 100-year remark with this item, but McCain has elaborated since then. It's well known that McCain has been a strong supporter of the Iraq war, even when his position harmed his presidential campaign. At a town hall in Derry, N.H., on Jan. 3, 2008, McCain was glib about the need for a long-term U.S. commitment: QUESTION: "President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years — " McCAIN: "Make it a hundred." Q: "Is that — " McCAIN: "We've been in South Korea . . . we've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea 50 years or so. That would be fine with me. As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, that's fine with me. I hope that would be fine with you, if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al-Qaida is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day." Three days later, he was asked about the remark on CBS's Face the Nation. He likened the future U.S. role in Iraq to other nations where the United States has a military presence: "My point was and continues to be, how long do we have to stay in Bosnia? How long do we have to stay in South Korea? How long are we going to stay in Japan? How long are we going to stay in Germany? All of those, 50-, 60-year period. No one complains. In fact, they contribute enormously, their presence, to stability in the world," McCain said. "The point is, it's American casualties. We've got to get Americans off the front line, have the Iraqis as part of the strategy, take over more and more of the responsibilities. And then I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for 100 years or 1,000 years or 10,000 years. What they care about is a sacrifice of our most precious treasure, and that's American blood. So what I'm saying is look, if Americans are there in a support role, but they're not taking casualties, that's fine." When McCain was asked about the remark Jan. 9 on ABC's Good Morning America, he said the U.S. presence could last 1-million years: "Could be 1,000 years or a million years," he said. "We have bases in Kuwait right now. We have bases in South Korea and Japan, Germany. I mean (the allegation by critics is) a straw man. It's a fallacious argument by people who don't understand that it's not American presence, it's American casualties. If we can get American casualties down and eliminate them, Americans are not concerned — in fact, they may be glad we have a secure base in that part of the world as we do in Kuwait." The interviews show McCain is not advocating that the war in Iraq continue for a thousand years (or a million). But once combat ends and U.S. casualities dwindle, he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Germany. That presence could continue for many years. Clinton correctly described the first remark by saying "Sen. McCain said the other day that we might have troops (in Iraq) for 100 years." We gave that a True. But Obama twisted McCain's words in the Cleveland debate. He said, "We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years." As we explain above, McCain was referring to a peacetime presence, not the war. So we find Obama's statement False. VoteVets is a veterans group that opposes the Bush administration policy in Iraq and is backing nine Democratic congressional candidates who are veterans. VoteVets has joined a coalition of liberal-leaning groups such as MoveOn.org that will be running ads against McCain. The VoteVets ad does not make the mistake Obama does. It says, "John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq." That careful wording might imply the war might drag on that long, but it does not say it explicitly and we find the words are a fair summary of McCain's remarks. We find the statement to be True.

pomt-08759	"Paul Broun Jr. sides with sexual deviants to support sale of 'crush videos.' "	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/27/russell-edwards/congressman-sides-sexual-deviants-no-vote-opponent/	Does a Georgia congressman approve of the sale of sexually deviant videos? Democrat Russell Edwards leveled the attack on his website against U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens and his opponent in the Nov. 2 election. Edwards' claim is based on Broun's vote against a resolution to prohibit the sale of "crush videos." The videos typically show women wearing high heels stomping on kittens, rabbits or rodents. For some, it is a sexual fetish. To most, it's animal cruelty. "Paul Broun Jr. sides with sexual deviants to support sale of 'crush videos,' " Edwards said. The resolution passed 416-3. Broun, a former physician, voted against the resolution, along with Reps. Tom Graves, R-Ga., and Ron Paul, R-Texas. The accusation is an eye-opener, so we decided to check it out. Is Edwards right about the congressman? No, said Broun, who called the videos "morally reprehensible." For those unfamiliar with them, crush videos surfaced in the 1990s. In 1999, federal legislation was signed into law banning the videos and they "vanished overnight," said Michael Markarian, chief operating officer of the Humane Society of the United States. The videos seemed to disappear, although there were no federal prosecutions of such cases, Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker reported. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law in April, saying it violated constitutional guarantees of free speech. Congress worked on a more focused law more specifically targeting animal crush videos. House Resolution 5566 calls for punishing anyone who sells or distributes such videos with five years in prison. The resolution passed July 21. Broun said he voted against the bill for two reasons. One, he believes the federal government has limited criminal justice powers, aside from those outlined in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Broun said in a statement his office e-mailed to AJC PolitiFact Georgia that the bill is another example of the federal government encroaching upon the rights afforded each state under the Constitution. The other reason Broun said he voted against the bill is because each state has laws against animal cruelty. "If states feel that they need to toughen their laws, they can do so," Broun said. "There is no need to create federal laws that are duplicative and unconstitutional." Broun is known for taking a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He believes Social Security is unconstitutional and has said he supports repealing the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to collect taxes. He believes his ideas would resurrect the Founding Fathers' vision of the Constitution, saying they would be disturbed by the size and scope of today's federal government. In fact, Broun, who carries a copy of the U.S. Constitution, caught flak in 2008 for calling then President-elect Barack Obama a "Marxist." He later apologized to anyone who took offense. The American Conservative Union, which describes itself as the nation's oldest grass-roots conservative organization, gave Broun its Defender of Liberty Award. Jason Pye, a former chairman of the Georgia Libertarian Party and close observer of state politicians, said he's not surprised that Broun voted against the amendment. "Paul Broun has always cast himself as a constitutional conservative," Pye said. Pye called Edwards' comments about Broun's vote "demagoguery." Edwards, making his first run for political office, doesn't believe he went too far in criticizing Broun, a two-term incumbent. "[Broun] is picking and choosing which parts of the Constitution he wants to uphold and which ones he wants to dismiss." Not surprisingly, the Humane Society's Markarian also disagrees with Broun's vote. He said the measure is necessary because it is difficult for states to track down crush video traffickers. The payments for videos are often made via Western Union, he said. Many are sold from other countries. Bob Barr a former congressman and U.S. attorney from Georgia, agreed that federal officials have advantages over state officials in investigating and prosecuting "crush video" type cases. He cited the investigative tools of the FBI and statutes to prosecute mail and wire fraud, which carry longer prison sentences. Still, Barr is not a supporter of HR 5566 and cited many of the same reasons cited by Broun. Barr, then a Republican House member, voted against the 1999 law. And Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito noted in his dissent to the April ruling that "the videos record the commission of violent criminal acts," alluding to state animal cruelty laws. To say a congressman sides with "sexual deviants" is a hefty claim. Broun did vote against the resolution, but he articulated reasons that fall well within his political ideals and record. Whether those reasons trump pragmatic concerns about how best to crack down on distribution of the videos is another question. We had a problem with Edwards saying that Broun "supports" the sale of the videos, particularly since Broun condemned them. Voting against the resolution on constitutional grounds is not the same as supporting the sale of deviant material. We rate Edwards' statement about Broun's vote on HR 5566 as False.

pomt-01321	"My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mary-burke-supported-18-percent-/	Reaching out to students and their check-writing parents, Gov. Scott Walker is promising another tuition freeze at UW System schools. And now in the final weeks of his re-election showdown with Democrat Mary Burke, the first-term Republican is blaming her for past tuition hikes. "With two sons in college, I know how hard it is to pay for school," Walker says in a TV ad released Oct. 20, 2014. "That’s why we froze tuition at UW campuses. I want to freeze it again in my next term. My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent." In the campaign, Burke has said she’d like to freeze tuition -- but only if more aid can go to the University of Wisconsin System at the same time. She’s emphasized larger income tax deductions for tuition and refinancing student loans. But, looking back, is the governor right about Burke’s support of policies that led to an 18 percent increase? Let’s hit the books. Walker’s evidence The ad itself lists no footnote as evidence for the 18 percent figure and does not cite any specific policies backed by Burke, who served as head of the state Commerce Department under Gov. Jim Doyle from 2005 to 2007. A Walker campaign news release about the ad simply offers the history of UW tuition increases approved in state budgets back to 1967, and Burke’s statement to a reporter in April 2005 that she supports Doyle’s positions "entirely." A campaign spokesperson pointed us to Burke’s general praise of two of Doyle’s budgets in place during her state government career. None of that makes any direct link between Burke and tuition hikes. That’s not surprising, given that Burke’s job was to grant and track state aid to businesses, not run the UW System, which sets tuition rates in conjunction with lawmakers and the governor. We did a search of news stories from the time and found no statements by Burke about raising tuition. She did, in 2007, praise a Doyle budget investment in more financial aid to help families better afford college. More broadly, Burke promoted Doyle’s overall 2007-’09 budget as a "smart, responsible budget for Wisconsin businesses" that is "fiscally responsible, identifies our priorities for success, and invests in those priorities" while including "more than a dozen separate tax cuts, saving the taxpayers and businesses of Wisconsin $1.7 billion." Tuition history There’s no doubt UW tuition rose rapidly in the Doyle era, which ran from 2003 through 2010. Tuition rates jumped 18 percent his first year, and 15 percent the second. But that was in the 2003-’04 and 2004-’05 school years -- before Burke arrived. After that, increases ranged from 0 percent to 9.3 percent, depending on the year and whether it was a four-year or two-year school, UW-Madison or UW-Milwaukee. Increases were capped at about 5 percent for several years. When Doyle took office, tuition at the system’s flagship UW-Madison campus was $3,854. When he left in 2010 it was $7,933. If you look specifically at Burke’s time in state government, tuition rose 19 percent in those three years, with some variations for different UW campuses. Under Walker, tuition went up 11 percent over his first two years, then was frozen for 2013-’14 and 2014-’15. The difference -- and it’s a big one -- is that Walker directly controlled those changes while Burke had little or nothing to do with them. We’ve been here before. In March 2014, we rated False a Republican Party of Wisconsin claim it was Burke’s budget in 2007-’09 that contained a series of tax hikes. We concluded it is off base to put responsibility for the state budget and its thousands of provisions on an appointed cabinet secretary. Likewise, it is wrong to blame a secretary for spending changes in another department. Our rating Walker said, "My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent." Burke was in state government when that happened, but Walker offers no evidence that she backed tuition hikes other than Burke lauding her boss as she went to work for Doyle. We rate his claim False.

pomt-12713	"We raised the minimum wage to $15 first in city government. Now, working together with people in Albany, it's the law of the state."	/new-york/statements/2017/mar/08/bill-de-blasio/who-led-way-15-minimum-wage-new-york/	New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says lawmakers in Albany followed the lead of city government when they passed a statewide minimum wage increase last year. De Blasio, who is up for reelection this year, made the claim in his 2017 State of the City address. "We all together -- so many partners in this room did again what was said to be impossible," de Blasio said. "We raised the minimum wage to $15 first in city government. Now, working together with people in Albany, it's the law of the state." De Blasio raised the minimum wage for city employees in January 2016, about three months before the New York State Legislature passed a new statewide minimum wage in April. The minimum wage will be phased in to $15 at different rates across the state over the next several years. So is de Blasio right about New York City paving the way for the wage increase? The fast food wage board Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took the first statewide action on a $15 minimum wage in May 2015 when he convened his fast-food wage board. The governor cannot unilaterally raise the statewide minimum wage, but the Department of Labor has the authority to raise wages for a specific industry. The fast-food wage board was charged with recommending a pay increase for workers in that industry. After four public hearings, the wage board recommended a phased-in minimum wage of $15 for fast-food workers. Acting State Labor Commissioner Mario J. Musolino approved the recommendation in September 2015. State and SUNY workers Cuomo, two months later in November 2015, announced a minimum wage increase to $15 for state workers. The order applied to 10,000 New York state employees. Cuomo announced the same increase for employees of the State University of New York in January 2016. The increase applied to 28,000 SUNY employees. Both actions were scheduled to be fully phased in by 2018 in New York City and 2021 statewide. New York City De Blasio announced a $15 minimum wage for city workers on Jan. 6, 2016 -- two days after Cuomo announced the wage increase for SUNY workers. De Blasio’s announcement applied to more public workers than Cuomo’s two major announcements combined. He said 50,000 workers would see a raise in the city, compared with Cuomo’s combined 38,000 employees between the state and SUNY workers. De Blasio’s raise will be fully phased in by the end of 2018, like state and SUNY workers in New York City. Other cities Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner was the first elected official in New York state to raise the minimum wage to $15 for public employees. Miner made the announcement in October 2015, about three weeks before Cuomo announced the raise for state workers and three months before de Blasio. The action only affected 61 city employees in Syracuse, but the raise took effect immediately. The cities of Buffalo and Rochester announced their own minimum wage increases to $15 about a month later in November. Both cities were scheduled to phase in the wage increase by 2021. The action affected 479 city workers in Buffalo and 116 in Rochester. Our ruling De Blasio said during his State of the City address that "we raised the minimum wage to $15 first in city government. Now, working together with people in Albany, it's the law of the state." De Blasio trailed the pack on this issue. Three other cities in New York state gave their public employees a raise before New York City. An increase for state and SUNY workers also came before his action. Fast-food workers were the first to get a raise. He did raise the New York City wage before the State Legislature enacted a statewide wage increase. While that part of his statement is accurate, his claim leaves out important details and ignores other facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08749	Says most of Perry's chiefs of staff have been lobbyists.	/texas/statements/2010/aug/30/bill-white/bill-white-says-most-gov-rick-perrys-chiefs-staff-/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White has vowed to tighten rules restricting state employees from working as lobbyists, recently noting that Perry's top staffers have kept the revolving door spinning. "Most of his chiefs of staff have been lobbyists," White said to a crowd of about 35 people in the North Texas town of Crowell on Aug. 14. White was more specific in an ethics reform proposal he released in April: "Five of seven Perry chiefs of staff have been lobbyists." Quick aside: State law regulates lobbying, defined as "direct communications" with members of state agencies, the legislative or executive branch of state government to influence legislation or administrative action. That includes the offices of the governor. White proposed to prohibit the governor's senior staff from working on issues related to their former employment for two years. And "when departing, they will be prohibited from lobbying the governor's office or their state agency for two years," according to White's plan. Mark Miner, a spokesman for Perry's campaign, has said that "the governor has some of the toughest ethics policies anywhere in the country," according to a Aug. 19 article in the Dallas Morning News. "You cannot lobby his office for one year and a legislative session." Still, we wondered if White's chiefs-of-staff complaint was true. So we went down the roster of the governor's chiefs of staff and combed through the Texas Ethics Commission's online database of registered lobbyists, who are required to report their compensation and expenditures. But that list only dates back to 1998, so we reached out to the former chiefs of staff themselves. Introducing ... Barry McBee chief of staff, December 2000-August 2001; registered lobbyist 2001-02McBee was the first of the seven chiefs of staff Perry has had during his gubernatorial tenure. McBee has also been chairman of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, deputy commissioner at the Texas Department of Agriculture and an aide to former Gov. Bill Clements. McBee was a lobbyist when he worked for the law firm Bracewell & Patterson (now Bracewell & Giuliani). The ethics commission lists nine clients for McBee, including AT&T and defense contractor Northrop Grumman, in 2002, his most recent year as a lobbyist. The commission reports McBee's compensation from the law firm that year as at least $200,000. Where's McBee now? At the University of Texas System, where's he's worked as vice chancellor for governmental relations since 2006 — also a lobbying job, albeit for a public institution. Mike McKinney chief of staff, September 2001-November 2002; registered lobbyist 1999-2001 McKinney served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1984 to 1991 and led the Texas Health and Human Services Commission during George W. Bush's first term as governor. McKinney was registered as a lobbyist from 1999 to August 2001 while he was a vice president of Centene Corp., a St. Louis-based health insurance company. Rod Davis, a spokesman at the Texas A&M University System, where McKinney is now chancellor, said he had "registered as a lobbyist as a standard precaution for having any contacts with legislators" but "was not primarily a 'lobbyist' by any means." Mike Toomey chief of staff December 2002-September 2004; registered lobbyist 1990-2002, 2004-present The ethics commission database lists more than 30 clients, including Merck and Philip Morris, for Toomey in 2002, the year he became Perry's chief of staff. Since leaving the Perry administration, Toomey has resumed lobbying. Among his 25 clients listed for 2010 on the ethics commission report are AT&T, Corrections Corp. of America, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments. This year, Toomey reported a minimum of $800,000 and a maximum of about $1.5 million in prospective compensation, according to the commission. Deirdre Delisi chief of staff September 2004-June 2007 Delisi has been with Perry since he was lieutenant governor. She served as his chief of staff until Perry tapped her to serve as the chairwoman of the Texas Transportation Commission, which governs the Texas Department of Transportation. Delisi told us that she has never been a registered lobbyist, and after searching news clips and lobbyist registries dating from 1998 on the ethics commission website, we confirmed as much. Brian Newby chief of staff July 2007-October 2008; registered lobbyist 2009-present Newby rejoined the law firm Cantey Hanger in 2009 after working for Perry and registered as a lobbyist the same year. This year, the Tarrant Regional Water District was listed as his client, and his prospective compensation from the district was reported as $10,000 to $24,999.99. Jay Kimbrough chief of staff October 2008-June 2009 Kimbrough, a former Marine, has in recent years filled a troubleshooter role at the Texas Youth Commission and the Texas Department of Transportation. Prior, he was a special adviser to the Texas A&M board of regents. Kimbrough told us that he's never been a lobbyist, and we didn't find any evidence to the contrary. Ray Sullivan chief of staff July 2009-present; registered lobbyist 2002-09 Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Perry, told us that Sullivan first registered as a lobbyist in late 2002, although he doesn't show up in the ethics commission database until 2003. Before that, he worked in various capacities for Perry. Perry appointed him as chief of staff in July, prompting Wayne Slater at the Dallas Morning News to single Sullivan out as an example of "how things work in Austin." According to the Aug. 19 article, "Ray has shuttled between top jobs on Perry’s staff and as a lobbyist representing interests with business before the state. His wife has directed the governor’s political fundraising. They haven’t broken the law or the rules governing the practice of politics and policy, and they’ve made between $4 million and $5.7 million since Perry’s been governor, according to campaign reports, lobby filings and state payroll records." In 2009, Sullivan had seven clients listed to his name on the ethics website, including HNTP Corp., a toll-road engineering company. Seven chiefs of staff later, what have we learned? Far as we can tell, five have been registered as lobbyists, as White stated. Three of those — McKinney, Toomey and Sullivan — were lobbyists before Perry hired them as chief of staff. We rate White's statement as True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-08-30T06:00:00	2010-08-14	['None']
pomt-04953	President Obama was saying success "is the result of government," not "hard-working people," when he said, "If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney/putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth/	For nearly two weeks, the Romney and Obama campaign have been arguing about whether President Barack Obama insulted entrepreneurs. The argument started with comments Obama made about the intersection of business and government during a July 17, 2012 campaign appearance. Romney, in comments at public events and in several ads, has argued that the remarks show a general disdain for business. The Republican National Committee and the National Federation of Independent Business are among the groups have released their own videos and statements echoing Romney that the president is out of touch. In one fundraising e-mail, Matt Rhoades, Romney’s campaign manager, decried Obama’s "naïve view that government, and not the hard work, talent, and initiative of people, is the center of society and the economy." In another campaign e-mail, Amanda Henneberg, a Romney spokeswoman, said Obama had "denigrated Americans who built their own businesses." The issue has become so big that the Obama campaign felt the need to address the issue head-on in a Web video titled "Tampered" that quoted media accounts saying the quote had been taken out of context. Earlier, we looked at the full context of Obama’s statement. Here we will put a recent Romney claim about Obama’s comment to the Truth-O-Meter. To do this, we’ll look at the latest Romney web video in the seemingly endless back and forth. Here's how the Romney campaign prefaced the video on its website: "President Obama recently said: ‘If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.’ "Clearly, this President doesn't understand how our economy works. "Mitt Romney understands that we have to celebrate people who start enterprises and employ other people rather than devalue them. Success is not the result of government, it is the result of hard-working people who take risks, create dreams, and build lives for themselves and for their families. "Stand with Mitt today and stand up for Americans who work hard to build their businesses, their homes, their families and their communities." In this item, we’ll rate the claim that Obama was saying success "is the result of government," not "hard-working people," when he said, "If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen." In case you didn't catch it the first 5,000 times the snippet ran on cable, yes, those words were uttered by Obama. But as you can see when you read the full text of his remarks, that quote distorts the meaning of Obama's claim. (Romney himself has been a victim of this kind of shenanigans, when opponents claimed he said he liked firing people.) Here is the full context, from Obama's speech in Roanoke, Va.: "There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me -- because they want to give something back. They know they didn’t -- look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. "If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business -- you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. "The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires. "So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the G.I. Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that’s the reason I’m running for President -- because I still believe in that idea. You’re not on your own, we’re in this together." We believe, as do our friends at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker, that Romney has seriously distorted Obama’s comments. Romney cherry-picked a quote that made it sound like Obama was dismissive of businesses when in fact he was making a point that success comes from the combination of "individual initiative" and the fact that "we do things together." The biggest problem is that the Romney campaign has left out the lead-up to the statement -- that "if you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges." These words indicate that Obama was referring to infrastructure and educational opportunities that were paid for by taxpayers through the government -- things that established a necessary foundation for making private businesses successful. We think his meaning is clear -- that both business people and government play a role in the American enterprise system, not purely one or the other. Our ruling In speeches and videos, the Romney campaign has repeatedly distorted Obama's words. By plucking two sentences out of context, Romney twists the president's remarks and ignores their real meaning. The preceding sentences make clear that Obama was talking about the importance of government-provided infrastructure and education to the success of private businesses. Romney also conveniently ignores Obama's clear summary of his message, that "the point is ... that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together." By leaving out the "individual initiative" reference, Romney and his supporters have misled viewers and given a false impression. For that, we rate the claim False.

pomt-02264	"Before Congress, (Tom) Cotton got paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/09/senate-majority-pac/democratic-pac-says-tom-cotton-got-paid-handsomely/	This election cycle, we’ve seen vulnerable Senate Democrats attacked by the billionaire Koch brothers in costly TV ad spots. It’s safe to say, though, that Democrats are fighting back. Take the Senate Majority PAC, an outside group formed in 2011 to support Democratic Senate candidates. They launched a statewide ad in Arkansas attacking Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who’s up against Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor come November. "Corporate special interests are spending millions to smear Mark Pryor and elect Tom Cotton," the narrator said. "Why? Before Congress, Cotton got paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests." PolitiFact wanted to know if Cotton really worked for insurance companies before taking office in 2013. Cotton’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests for comment. What most people know about Cotton’s work experience is the years he spent serving in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2005 to 2009. That experience has come under fire from Pryor, who accused his opponent of having a "sense of entitlement" about his decorated military past. Shortly after Cotton’s honorable discharge from the military, he worked at a global consulting firm called McKinsey & Company. The firm employs 17,000 people across 60 countries. Democrats like Chelsea Clinton and Susan Rice have also worked there. The Senate Majority PAC pointed us to Cotton’s Facebook biography, which says, "As a businessman, Tom has advised some of America’s most respected companies on business strategy, operations, finance, and marketing. His industry experience includes agribusiness, health care, oil and gas, food processing, insurance, and aerospace." That’s not work directly for an insurance company. And Glenn Kessler, our Washington Post fact-checking colleague, noted that Cotton has never even worked for an insurance company in a consulting role. Cotton worked on an assignment with the Federal Housing Authority to improve insurance offered to lenders who finance apartment buildings in the government’s multifamily housing programs, according to a statement from his former boss. So Cotton didn’t work for an insurance company. But did he get paid handsomely? That’s a subjective judgment we won’t weigh in on. But we can see from his financial disclosure statement that Cotton earned $85,000 from McKinsey in 2011. For comparison, he makes $174,000 per year in Congress. Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad claimed, "Before Congress, Cotton got paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests." Cotton’s never worked for an insurance company, nor has he served as a consultant for one. We rate the statement False.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2014-04-09T15:03:46	2014-03-28	['None']
pomt-12041	Wisconsin is "guaranteeing Foxconn almost $3 billion, but Foxconn is not contractually guaranteeing how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long and at what pay."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/12/andy-gronik/wisconsin-guaranteeing-nearly-3-billion-foxconn-no/	Andy Gronik, one of the leading Democratic candidates for governor in 2018, has bashed Republican Gov. Scott Walker for Walker’s deal with Foxconn, which is nearing final approval. The Milwaukee-area businessman calls the offer to get a manufacturing plant that could employ 13,000 people "nothing but a con to Wisconsin." "We are guaranteeing Foxconn almost $3 billion, but Foxconn is not contractually guaranteeing how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long and at what pay," he wrote in an op-ed published Sept. 5, 2017, in the MIlwaukee Journal Sentinel. Gronik’s right that the Taiwanese manufacturer hasn’t made any jobs guarantees. But the state is guaranteeing to pay Foxconn nearly $3 billion only if the company meets certain investment and payroll requirements. The Foxconn announcement Foxconn drew big headlines -- and a July 26, 2017, announcement at the White House with President Donald Trump -- by saying it plans to invest $10 billion to build a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing plant in Wisconsin. On Sept. 5, 2017, the state Legislature’s budget committee approved the $3 billion incentives package, which still needs the approval of the full Legislature. Walker said Foxconn "is bringing" 13,000 jobs, but we rated that claim Half True. Foxconn has said it plans to initially employ 3,000 people, with the potential for 13,000. We also rated Half True a claim that Wisconsin’s offer could amount to more than $1 million per job. That could occur If Foxconn invests $9 billion in the plant and equipment, but hires only 1,500 workers. But there is no evidence the company would invest that much and only employ 1,500 people. Now to Gronik’s claim. The incentive offer The incentive package is worth up to $3 billion, but $150 million of that is sales tax exemptions -- in other words, Foxconn wouldn’t have to pay up to $150 million in sales taxes on construction materials for the plant. That leaves $2.85 billion -- the nearly $3 billion Gronik referred to. It comes in two parts. 1. The state would pay Foxconn based on how much the company invests in the plant and equipment. The maximum payment is $1.35 billion, if Foxconn invests at least $9 billion. So, the $1.35 billion is not tied directly to jobs at the Foxconn plant, though the investment would clearly employ construction people. It’s theoretically possible, if unlikely, that Foxconn could receive the $1.35 billion, or some portion of it, if it builds the plant but then -- say, if market conditions change -- abandons it without employing anyone. It’s also possible the plant could be built to maximize automation, which would require fewer workers. 2. The state would also pay Foxconn based on the size of its payroll at the plant. The maximum would be $1.5 billion, if payroll reaches $8.8 billion within a 15-year period, Wisconsin Budget Project director Jon Peacock told us. For example, the $1.5 billion could be earned if Foxconn employs 13,000 people who make at least $30,000 and have an average salary of about $54,000, he said. In other words, the more people hired by Foxconn, the more the state would pay to the company. In sum: There is no flat guarantee from the state of nearly $3 billion. Roughly half of the incentives would be based on how much is invested in the manufacturing plant, and roughly half would be paid based on employment. In both cases, the incentives are paid, on a pay-as-you go basis, based on what the company does. A parting note: Walker's administration is negotiating a final contract with Foxconn. So, it’s possible a minimum jobs requirement could be made part of the deal. Our rating Gronik says Wisconsin is "guaranteeing Foxconn almost $3 billion, but Foxconn is not contractually guaranteeing how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long and at what pay." Wisconsin is guaranteeing to pay Foxconn up to $2.85 billion -- but the full amount would be paid only if the company invests at least $9 billion in its plant and, in rough numbers, employs at least 13,000 people earning at least $30,000 per year. The payments would be less, if Foxconn doesn’t meet those targets. It’s true that Foxconn is not guaranteeing how many people it will hire, for how long and at what pay. That means it’s theoretically possible the company could earn up to $1.35 billion in investment incentives but not employ anyone, if it built the facility but never operated it. But the other $1.5 billion would be paid, on a graduated basis, only as people are employed at the plant. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

pomt-06846	Says Republican Sen. John McCain won more votes for president in Cuyahoga County in the 2008 general election than he did in seven states.	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/05/kevin-dewine/ohio-gop-chair-says-democrat-stronghold-cuyahoga-c/	The Ohio Republican Party hosted its annual state dinner and fund-raiser in Cleveland on July 22, 2011, that rallied its members around state and national issues and candidates. The annual event, which is moved outside Columbus during off-year elections, featured Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel of Lyndhurst (near Cleveland), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, and Louisiana’s Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, a conservative who regularly speaks about GOP priorities. The two politicians and others at the dinner easily revved up the crowd by blaming Democrats for the nation’s debt problems and by praising themselves for passing a collective bargaining law for public workers in Ohio that limits the power of unions. Cuyahoga County Republicans deserved to have the event in their backyard because they provide the GOP a big chunk of votes in state elections, Ohio Republican Party chair Kevin DeWine said during the dinner. To illustrate this point, he noted that in 2008 Republican Sen. John McCain garnered more votes for the presidency in the Democratic-dominated county than he did in seven states. PolitiFact Ohio thought the statistic was worth examining given the GOP’s view that Cuyahoga County, Ohio’s most populous, is a battleground within a battleground state that could have a big say in the fate of the new collective bargining law, which will be before voters in November. "The Republican Party must compete aggressively in Cuyahoga County in order to carry the state," explains DeWine, who sees the recent public corruption scandal involving Democratic officials as helping the GOP cause. So how many votes did McCain win in the county? The last amended 2008 general election results on file with the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections shows that McCain received 199,880, or about 30 percent. Democrat Barack Obama received 458,422 votes. Comparing this figure against the state vote totals, McCain indeed racked up more votes in Cuyahoga County than he did in seven states. Obama carried these four states, shown here with McCain’s vote totals: Vermont (98,974 votes) Hawaii (120,566) Delaware (152,374) Rhode Island (165,391) McCain carried three of the states with fewer votes than he got in Cuyahoga County: Wyoming (164,958 votes) North Dakota (168,601) Alaska (193,841) It’s not hard to see why Cuyahoga County offers so much. The county’s population in the 2010 census of 1,280,122 makes it more populous than six of the seven states in the comparison. Only Hawaii, which has 1,360,301 residents, is bigger. Wyoming is the smallest with 563,626 residents. All of this leaves DeWine’s claim right on the mark. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.

pomt-13170	"Paul Ryan’s already spent millions to try and permanently derail Brad (Schneider)’s progressive, energized campaign."	/illinois/statements/2016/oct/27/barney-frank/Barney-Frank-claim-against-Paul-Ryan-teeters/	The race between Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dold and Democratic challenger Brad Schneider in Illinois' 10th Congressional District is one of the most expensive House races in the country. It's a race both parties consider winnable and money from national sources is pouring in for support. Schneider was elected to the seat in 2012, but as an incumbent in 2014, lost to Dold by 5,000 votes. That race was the poster child for extremely high spending by national parties on a local race. Schneider’s friends won’t let voters forget it. Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts sent out a fundraising email in September supporting Schneider and criticizing top Republicans for donating to Dold’s campaign. In fact, in his email, Frank calls out one Republican leader by name. "Paul Ryan’s already spent millions to try and permanently derail Brad’s progressive, energized, campaign." That made us wonder: Has Ryan really spent millions of dollars to try to ensure Dold would be re-elected? We took a deep look at Super PACs and national committees to get to the bottom of this claim. Why is the 10th District so important? In a year where Democrats could take back the United States Congress, competitive races are getting attention. Both parties are sending more to incumbent congressional candidates in tight races. In February, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) selected 12 candidates, including Dold, to receive extra money through a funding model called The Patriot Program. The Patriot Program describes itself as an organization that "plays a vital role in keeping our Republican team on offense and helps build a lasting and productive Republican Majority for the American people." Schneider, too, is receiving money from national PACs like the Democrats Win Seats PAC set up by former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Contributions to Dold’s campaign Schneider campaign spokesman Steven Kirsch sent us a list of contributions the NRCC and the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) donated to the effort to oppose Schneider’s campaign during the 2012, 2014 and 2016 elections. Kirsch also included the money Republicans spent to support Dold in 2014 and the current election. We used the Federal Election Commission website and OpenSecrets.com to verify those figures showing the NRCC and CLF have spent roughly $7.6 million in those campaigns. Of that amount, $1.8 million came while Ryan was speaker of the House. Kirsch explained that because Ryan is the speaker of the House, he is the nominal head of these organizations. Ryan wasn’t elected speaker of the House until October 2015. That means Ryan would not have been in charge of the CLF and NRCC spending in the 2012 and 2014 elections. Kirsch explains: "While he was not speaker during the cycles where this money was spent, we feel that it is appropriate to use him as a representative of the group as a whole," he said. Did Ryan spend that money? Ryan serves as an ex-officio member of the NRCC’s executive committee and we found the PACs Team Ryan and Ryan for Congress gave a combined $31.4 million to the NRCC since Oct. 30, 2015, a day after he was elected speaker of the House. But that is only about a third of the total amount the NRCC raised this campaign cycle and there is no indication Ryan dictates how the NRCC spends its money. In fact, the CLF and the NRCC websites do not explain the decisions behind organizational spending strategy. Neither organization returned multiple emails and calls to PolitiFact Illinois. And while Ryan has attended fundraisers for Dold in Illinois and his committees have donated to the NRCC, we could not find any instances where Ryan directly contributed to Dold’s campaign or spent his own money to oppose Schneider. For analysis on this issue, we turned to Paul S. Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut and author of several books including The Financiers of Congressional Elections: Investors, Ideologues, and Intimates. Herrnson said looking too far into Frank’s statement might be considered "splitting hairs," but Frank’s characterization of Dold’s funding model is misleading. "It’s not exactly fair," he said. "It’s not exactly his money. It’s not a direct contribution from Ryan and it’s not a contribution from Ryan’s personal campaign or congressional campaign committee." Herrnson said Frank’s motive is to paint a negative picture of Dold, saying he relies heavily on outsider money. "They want people to come away with the idea that this campaign is being directed by a political insider of the opposite party," Herrnson said. "It sort of makes the source of the money an issue." But he said neither Democrats nor Republicans are immune. They both point fingers and both accept outsider money. "It happens on both sides of the aisle," he said. Our ruling In a September fundraising email supporting candidate Brad Schneider, former U.S. Congressman Barney Frank said, "Paul Ryan’s already spent millions to try and permanently derail Brad’s progressive, energized, campaign." Ryan’s committees, Team Ryan and Ryan for Congress, have donated $31.4 million to the NRCC since he became speaker of the House. As speaker, Ryan does represent the NRCC, which has given $1.8 million to support Dold and oppose Schneider this election cycle. That's not "millions," but it's not far off. Also, the wording of Frank's statement implies has received a direct contribution from Ryan when the money came from political committees Ryan represents. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02842	A Census Bureau worker says he was told to skew information to bring the unemployment rate down "as we headed into an election season."	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/20/elisabeth-hasselbeck/elisabeth-hasselbeck-suggests-census-worker-admits/	A drop in the unemployment rate right before the 2012 election has given conservatives a whiff of conspiracy. On the Fox News Channel morning show Fox and Friends, co-hosts Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade and Elisabeth Hasselbeck discussed a New York Post report that alleged Census Bureau workers cooked the books between August and September 2012, dropping the unemployment rate from 8.1 percent to 7.8 percent. Hasselbeck said the report, from a Post columnist, identified one Census Bureau worker who admitted to fudging data in the past. "Now we're finding out there was someone on one side of the scale," Hasselbeck told viewers. "There was a name, Julius Buckmon. ... He told in an interview that he was told to make up information as he went along. This is on crucial information as we headed into an election season." The report was also cited on Fox News’ The Five and later on Hannity. We decided to see if Buckmon is indeed a smoking gun about the reported 2012 fraud. We also wanted to learn a little bit more about how the unemployment rate is calculated and what impact a Census Bureau employee can have. The 'Post' report The original New York Post report from columnist John Crudele essentially reaches the same conclusion as Hasselbeck, though perhaps not as definitively. Using an unnamed source, Crudele builds a case that Census Bureau workers were told by their supervisors to help drive down the unemployment rate ahead of the 2012 presidential election. The source also handed over a piece of evidence -- the case of Census Bureau worker Julius Buckmon. Buckmon was part of a Census Bureau team that helped collect information used to calculate the unemployment rate, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households. The Census Bureau is in charge of the people who ask the questions. The data is then collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the Labor Department, which in turn creates monthly employment statistics. Buckmon said he made up at least some of his results instead of surveying households. Buckmon told the Post about a conversation with his supervisor at the bureau. "It was a phone conversation — I forget the exact words — but it was, ‘Go ahead and fabricate it’ to make it what it was," Buckmon said. The problem for Hasselbeck is that Buckmon wasn’t working for the Census Bureau in 2012. According to the Post, the alleged incident he described took place in 2010. Buckmon left the Census Bureau in August 2011, Census Bureau officials told us. So Hasselbeck incorrectly overlapped Buckmon’s story with the rest of the Post article, which relies on an anonymous source. (Buckmon did not return our calls seeking comment.) The unemployment report To be clear, we cannot say if the Post article is correct in its other points. But experts we spoke with agreed that it would be extremely difficult to alter the nationwide unemployment rate. William Shobe, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Studies at the University of Virginia and head of the Virginia chapter of the Association for University and Business Economic Research, said it’s important to remember that there are many measures of unemployment, including privately produced surveys. "And they all agree, within the margins of error," Shobe said. "The immediate conclusion that you can draw from that is that no rogue interviewer or group of rogue interviewers have managed to budge the unemployment far (or at all, mind you) from the value it would have had otherwise." Shobe added that any effort to fudge the national numbers would require the participation of interviewers across the country. "Otherwise you would see only a localized move which would wash out as noise in the national stats," Shobe said. Former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Katharine Abraham backs up Shobe’s point. Abraham, who served as commissioner from 1993-2001 under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said that the typical interviewer handles between 35 and 55 households. That would translate to anywhere between about 1,000 and 1,700 interviewers to cover 60,000 households. "Even if an interviewer made up all of his or her interviews," Abraham said, "each interviewer's share of the full sample is small enough that it would be rather unlikely for the made-up interviews to have affected the topside unemployment numbers at all." In addition, Abraham said the Census Bureau doesn’t trust its staff blindly. It has a regular and random process of going back to the same households that were interviewed and interviewing them again. As for the drop in the unemployment rate that led to suspicions of manipulation, Abraham remembers the popular reaction at the time, but says the monthly numbers can jump around. "It's just not that surprising that, in the context of an unemployment rate that was generally trending downwards, there would be months when it took a big drop," Abraham said. We should note that the Post story has gained traction beyond the media. Rep, Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chair of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to the head of the Census Bureau, saying he found the allegations "shocking." Issa told the bureau to deliver many documents, including emails to or from Buckmon and any investigations of alleged falsification of data. Our ruling Hasselbeck said Julius Buckmon was "on one side of the scale" and his fabricated interviews helped push the unemployment rate lower in September 2012. Buckmon did not work for the Census Bureau in 2012 and even if he had, people familiar with the workings inside the bureau doubt it would have made a difference. If he had slanted all of his reports to show a brighter employment picture, he would have likely been found out. If he slanted a smaller number, it would have no statistical impact. We rate the claim False.	None	Elisabeth Hasselbeck	None	None	None	2013-11-20T09:48:55	2013-11-19	['None']
pomt-03926	"The National Science Foundation spent $1.2 million paying seniors to play World of Warcraft to study the impact it had on their brain."	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/22/eric-cantor/cantor-says-us-paid-seniors-12-million-play-world-/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says Washington’s spending habits are so bad that they’ve entered the realm of fantasy. "The National Science Foundation spent $1.2 million paying seniors to play World of Warcraft to study the impact it had on their brain," Cantor, R-7th, claimed in a Feb. 19 news release identifying examples of what he said are wasteful spending. World of Warcraft, also known as WoW, is a popular fantasy game in which players create virtual characters and enter an online world to battle orcs, kobolds, giant spiders, roving packs of wolves and other adversaries. Gamers pay a monthly fee to play the subscriber-based game in which they join other players to fight monsters and win treasure. A September 2012 article in Wired magazine said the game peaked at 12 million users in 2010 and has since dropped to 9.1 million. Were some of those gamers senior citizens that Washington paid to play to the tune of $1.2 million? We decided to check. Cantor’s statement has drawn attention from The Huffington Post and WoW Insider, an online publication devoted to World of Warcraft. We asked Cantor’s office where the majority leader got his information. Megan Whittemore, a deputy press secretary, sent us information about a $1.2 million grant by the National Science Foundation in mid 2009. The money was awarded to North Carolina State University and Georgia Tech to study whether computer games can slow the mental decline in elderly people and, if so, to develop specific "brain games" to achieve that goal. The premise is that the memory, problem-solving and strategies needed to master some online games may be beneficial to seniors. The first part of the research involves seniors frequently playing Boomblox -- a spatial puzzle game on the Wii entertainment system in which players knock down blocks. About 200 participants undergo cognitive testing before they are introduced to the game and then again at a later date to see if playing has produced any changes. The N.C. State researchers hope to identify the elements of Boomblox that led to mental improvements. That information will be shared with experts at Georgia Tech, who hope to incorporate data to develop new games that will help the elderly retain or improve their everyday cognitive skills. The grant runs out this August. You may have noticed that our explanation of the research has yet to mention the World of Warcraft, the game Cantor says U.S. taxpayers paid seniors $1.2 million to play. There’s a good reason: The National Science Foundation’s abstract on the grant makes no mention of anyone playing WoW. Is any part of the $1.2 million federal grant being used to pay seniors to play World of Warcraft? "The answer is an unequivocal no," said Anne McLaughlin, the principal researcher on the project and co-director of the Gains through Gaming Lab at N.C. State. The information sent to us by Cantor’s office -- media reports, research publications and grant abstracts -- do not undercut McLaughlin’s answer. WoW does have a tiny role in this story, however. In the spring of 2009, McLaughlin’s lab briefly studied how playing World of Warcraft affected seniors’ cognitive ability before receiving the federal grant. The research, on 39 elderly subjects, was funded with $5,000 provided by N.C. State. No federal money was involved, according to Jason Allaire, a co-director of the lab. An experimental group of the seniors played WoW on their home computers for about 14 hours over the course of two weeks and were tested at the start and end of the period. A control group did not play the game, but also was tested at the same intervals. The researchers concluded that seniors who scored well on the pretest for cognitive skills were not aided by playing WoW. But those who scored low on the initial test "saw significant improvement in both spatial ability and focus." The purpose of the $5,000 study, in part, was to run a pilot project to help win the National Science Foundation grant, McLaughlin told us. It "helped us look at what we wanted to measure in a big study and how to do it," she said. Some media coverage of the Gains Through Gaming studies have noted there are skeptics of whether gaming has any potential to slow the effects of aging on senior’s brains. Our ruling Cantor said the federal government spent $1.2 million "paying seniors to play World of Warcraft," a popular fantasy game. His facts are all messed up. He’s referring to federal grant for a study to determine whether computer games can slow mental decline in the elderly. But the grant application never mentioned WoW and participants in the federally-funded study did not play that game. Before applying for the federal money, the researchers conducted a small, pilot study in which seniors played WoW over the course of two weeks and were tested to see if it improved their cognitive abilities. This study was funded with a $5,000 grant from N.C. State. No U.S. money was involved. The federal study involves hours of testing each participant and efforts to identify the aspects of computer games that might help seniors better deal with life offline. Cantor’s statement ridiculously suggests that Washington is sponsoring a geriatric gaming club. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-04373	Says Barack Obama "said when he was running for office four years ago that he would halve the annual deficit by the end of his first term. That simply has not happened."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/21/leonard-lance/barack-obama-broke-promise-cut-annual-deficit-half/	President Barack Obama hasn’t kept his promise to cut the nation’s annual deficit in half by the end of his first term, according to Rep. Leonard Lance. The Republican congressman pointed to the president’s broken promise during an Oct. 11 debate against Democratic state Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula. The two will face off in the Nov. 6 election to represent the 7th Congressional District. "President said when he was running for office four years ago that he would halve the annual deficit by the end of his first term," Lance said. "That simply has not happened, ladies and gentlemen, and it is greatly disturbing." Lance’s claim is correct: Obama vowed to cut the annual deficit in half by the end of his first term and, nearly four years later, he hasn’t done so. The federal deficit represents how much the government's spending exceeds its revenues in a given fiscal year. Lance claimed Obama offered that promise "when he was running for office," but actually the president made the pledge soon after taking office. Obama made those remarks on Feb. 23, 2009 at an event called the "Fiscal Responsibility Summit." Here’s what he said: "And that's why today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office. This will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay -- and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." The president repeated the pledge the following day during a joint session of Congress: "And yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office." But as the deficit figures show, that bold promise has gone unfulfilled. Obama took office in the middle of fiscal year 2009. At the time of his initial pledge, the president said his administration inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit, but the deficit for that fiscal year ultimately reached about $1.4 trillion. In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the annual deficits were roughly $1.3 trillion. For fiscal year 2012, which ended Sept. 30, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated an annual deficit of about $1.1 trillion. That is the last full fiscal year during Obama’s first term. So, the annual deficit has dropped during Obama’s time in office, but not by half. In a February 2012 interview on Atlanta’s WAGA-TV, Obama said he wasn’t able to keep that promise because "this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized." Obama added, "So, the die had been cast, but a lot of us didn't understand at that point how bad it was going to get. That increases the deficit because less tax revenues come in, and it means that more people are getting unemployment insurance, we're helping states more so they don't lay off teachers, etc. "The key, though, is we're setting ourselves on a path where we can get our debt under control. The most important thing we can do, though, to reduce our debt is to make sure that we continue growing this economy." Our ruling In a debate against his Democratic challenger, Lance claimed that Obama "said when he was running for office four years ago that he would halve the annual deficit by the end of his first term. That simply has not happened, ladies and gentlemen, and it is greatly disturbing." Lance should have said Obama made that pledge soon after he took office, but the congressman’s overall point is solid. The president vowed in February 2009 to cut the annual deficit in half by the end of his first term, and he hasn’t done it. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-15320	"134,000 (criminal) aliens have been released by the (Obama) administration in just the past two years."	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/16/hans-von-spakovsky/heritage-analyst-obama-administration-released-134/	The sanctuary city movement has drawn much fire since the shooting death of a young woman visiting San Francisco in early July. The man accused of the killing should never have been in the country in the first place but, despite a request from federal immigration officials, had been released from a San Francisco jail. By local ordinance, San Francisco employees generally don’t help enforce immigration laws. In a column published by the conservative Heritage Foundation July 9, 2015, Heritage analyst Hans von Spakovsky charged that the sanctuary movement leaves Americans vulnerable to crime at the hands of non-U.S. citizens. For von Spakovsky, this is all in keeping with White House policy. "In fiscal year 2013, the Obama administration released over 36,000 convicted criminal aliens awaiting the outcome of deportation hearings upon an unsuspecting public, and another 30,558 in fiscal year 2014 according to the House Judiciary Committee," von Spakovsky wrote. "And in 2013 alone, the administration didn’t even bring removal proceedings against an additional 68,000 criminal aliens convicted of everything from homicide to sexual assault." Von Spakovsky added it up and issued a chilling warning. "If the over 134,000 aliens released by the administration in just the past two years follow the pattern of those aliens studied by the GAO (Government Accountability Office) in 2005, they will commit hundreds of thousands of more crimes, victimizing countless innocent Americans in crimes that could have been prevented." In this fact-check, we focus on the claim that the administration moved to release about 134,000 criminal aliens. We exchanged emails with von Spakovsky but ultimately did not get any answers to the questions we raised. However, his column pointed to his sources. Convicted criminals As you might guess from von Spakovsky’s words, there are two sets of criminal aliens -- one group of about 66,000 (36,000 + 30,558) and another of about 68,000. We’ll take each in turn. The group of 66,000 stems from a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that favors reduced immigration. The people in this category have been convicted of a crime, served their sentence in jail or prison and were then turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation. The center’s director of policy studies Jessica Vaughan looked at the federal numbers for 2013, and the House Judiciary Committee took a similar approach for 2014. Federal officials confirm the accuracy of the overall numbers. According to ICE data, the agency released 36,007 criminals in 2013 and 30,558 in 2014 (both are fiscal years.) The most significant caveat comes from Vaughan, who told us that by her calculations (not included in the report), about 45 percent of the releases were the result of a court order, not administration policy. In some instances, an immigration judge issued the ruling. In a smaller number of cases, the driving force was a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2001 that limits how long immigration authorities can hold people once they’ve served the sentence that put them behind bars. Either way, the judiciary said the government could no longer detain the person as it waited to move forward with deportation. ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea told us that "the majority of releases of serious criminal offenders were made pursuant to federal court decisions or bond decisions by immigration judges." How you apportion responsibility depends on your point of view. "Just over half of the releases came because ICE decided to release them," Vaughan said. Plus, Vaughan noted that ICE has the option to challenge a court’s ruling but rarely does. Investigative reporters at the Atlanta Journal Constitution and the Boston Globe also found that pattern. (Those articles documented the failure of ICE to monitor violent criminals after release or warn their past victims, sometimes with deadly consequences.) For the purposes of this fact-check, the prime significance of these court orders is that the administration did not choose on its own to release nearly half of these criminal aliens. When von Spakovsky faulted the Obama White House for releasing these people, he failed to note the role of the courts, which reduces by some large percentage the overall total of 66,000 attributable to the administration . A failure to deport There is no doubt that all of these people were deportable. They were sitting in ICE custody as their case was processed which raises the question, why wasn’t the government able to follow through? In some cases, the person’s home country refused to accept them. A hat tip goes to investigative reporter Jeremy Redmon at the Atlanta Journal Constitution who used the Freedom of Information Act to get hard numbers from ICE. When we crunched that data, we found that in FY 2013, home country refusal led to the release of 3,746 people. Over 80 people convicted of homicide were on that list. Nearly half of them came from Cuba, a country that routinely rejects any prisoners from the United States. Vietnam came in second, refusing to take back 15 convicted killers. 68,000 criminal aliens This second group in von Spakovsky’s tally is much harder to pinpoint. Von Spakovsky said their crimes range "from homicide to sexual assault." In reality, the range is much wider. According to Vaughan, the great majority of these people have come to ICE’s attention because they were reported by local police or some other law enforcement agency. Their crimes include misdemeanors and felonies. And in some cases, Vaughan said the criminal alien label comes when an ICE agent decides that the person represents a criminal threat (meaning they haven’t been accused of a crime), an obviously subjective assessment. The meaning of "criminal alien" itself is broad. The term includes anyone who is not an American citizen and includes both those who are here legally and those who aren’t. The label can apply to a wide range of crimes from breaking immigration laws, to driving without a license, to more serious offenses like sexual assault, rape and murder. Some people are deportable and some are not. Von Spakovsky cited Vaughan’s work. But Vaughan told us the data available from ICE is limited. The agency reported the total number of criminal aliens who came to its attention in 2013. It reported the number of deportation orders it initiated with that group. The difference came to nearly 68,000. The government data show that ICE decided not to deport the person. However, it doesn’t show what happened to the person beyond that. "If ICE doesn't pursue deportation, that person might be released immediately or not," Vaughan said. "They might serve out the duration of their sentience. There are a variety of possible outcomes." The point is, while von Spakovsky said the administration released these people, there are several missing pieces. Most of them were not in federal custody to begin with. We don’t know that they were released. And given the broad meaning of criminal alien, it isn’t certain that every person was deportable in the first place, and so ICE wouldn’t have that option. That said, as a matter of policy, ICE picks and chooses the sort of criminals to deport. The Department of Homeland Security issued guidelines in November 2014 that established a hierarchy of criminal offenses. Adam Cox, a law professor at New York University, has studied this for several years. Cox said ICE discretion is crucial. "These data show clearly that the agency is not simply arresting every person it identifies," Cox said. "The data also show, however, that the likelihood that ICE chooses to detain a person identified through fingerprint screening goes up as the person's criminal record becomes more serious." In a prepared statement, ICE told us that the agency "prioritizes its available resources on those who pose the biggest threat to national security, border security and public safety." Our ruling Von Spakovsky said that the Obama administration had released about 134,000 criminal aliens. There are several flaws in this statement. About half of von Spakovsky’s total, 66,000, involved convicted criminals who had completed their sentences but remained in custody pending deportation. For some large fraction of that group, perhaps as high as 45 percent, it was a court ruling that drove the release, not a decision by the administration. Regarding the other half of von Spakovsky’s total, 68,000, it is likely that in most cases ICE decided not to pursue deportation. However, some portion of that group might not have been deportable, and some portion might have continued to serve out a locally imposed sentence and not been released. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Hans von Spakovsky	None	None	None	2015-07-16T11:13:39	2015-07-09	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-05846	Newt Gingrich "co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy."	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/15/restore-our-future/newt-supported-chinas-one-child-policy-super-pac-s/	There they go again. With Georgia’s Republican presidential primary just a few weeks away, the four remaining candidates and their supporters are expected to blanket the airwaves with attack ads in this delegate-rich state. One that we’ve seen -- scheduled to hit the airwaves Wednesday -- takes aim at former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who represented portions of Atlanta’s western suburbs for 20 years in Congress. "He co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy," says the voice in the ad paid for by Restore Our Future. The super PAC is run by supporters of Republican hopeful Mitt Romney. There’s nothing that makes conservatives see more red than a reference to Pelosi, the liberal California congresswoman and House minority leader. Or talking about China for that matter. The ad that will soon be on your TV screens in Georgia is different than what Restore Our Future aired in Florida and South Carolina before their primaries. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida looked into this claim and rated it a Pants On Fire. We wondered: Did the group get its facts right this time? Gingrich is ahead in the polls in Georgia, a state where he desperately needs to do well to keep his campaign from becoming an episode of "The Walking Dead." His GOP rivals, particularly Romney, are trying to make Gingrich work hard for every vote here. Romney made a campaign stop in Atlanta last week and took a couple of shots at Gingrich. Restore Our Future has another ad on its website that says Gingrich "is no Ronald Reagan." The Georgia ad contains the same language as the one that aired in Florida and South Carolina. Here’s some more detail about the issue: Restore Our Future refers to House Resolution 1078, which was introduced on Feb. 22, 1989, before Gingrich became speaker and when Democrats had control of the House of Representatives. The legislation was called the Global Warming Prevention Act of 1989. It set national goals to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and encouraged international agreements to address global warming, PolitiFact Florida reported. It required the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor global warming and create plans for future action. It supported stricter fuel standards for cars and alternative energy. It also sent money to developing countries to encourage practices that reduce carbon emissions. The bill had several hearings but received unfavorable reviews from the administration of George H.W. Bush and never became law. The resolution was introduced by Rep. Claudine Schneider, a Rhode Island Republican who left Congress in 1991. Yes, Gingrich and Pelosi co-sponsored the bill. In all, there were 144 House members who sponsored the legislation. Most were Democrats, but there were a handful of Republicans in the mix, such as Olympia Snowe of Maine and Jim Kolbe of Arizona. China’s one-child policy generally refers to the government’s efforts to limit population growth to one child per couple. Human rights advocates say the policy has resulted in forced sterilizations and abortions. The Restore Our Future website says the $60 million went to the United Nations Population Fund and that President Ronald Reagan withheld funds from the program after he determined the program, which supports family planning and contraception, was supporting Chinese actions. The bill did propose money for the United Nations Population Fund. But Section 1102, Part C, of the bill prohibits using any of the funds for "the performance of involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning." That is the exact opposite of the language in Restore Our Future’s ad about Gingrich. As we mentioned, PolitiFact Florida rated this claim Pants On Fire. The language is the same in this ad. And the facts haven’t changed. Pants On Fire.	None	Restore Our Future	None	None	None	2012-02-15T06:00:00	2012-02-15	['Nancy_Pelosi', 'United_Nations', 'Newt_Gingrich', 'China']
pomt-03491	Says Democratic Party created the Ku Klux Klan.	/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/	State Sen. Stephen Martin was recently asked to weigh in on controversial comments by GOP Lieutenant Governor candidate E.W. Jackson that denounced the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party in the same breath. In defending Jackson, Martin sparked a controversy of his own. "The fact is that both the KKK and Planned Parenthood are creations of the Democratic Party," Martin, R-Chesterfield, said in a May 23 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. We decided to check whether the KKK really was spawned by the Democratic Party. We’ll post another Truth-O-Meter that examines Martin’s contention Planned Parenthood was created by Democrats. When we asked Martin for the facts behind his KKK statement, he said he had misspoken. "What I should have said is it was started by Democrats, not by the Democratic party," the senator said. "It wasn’t an official subdivision of the party, obviously … It was definitely founded by Democrats." Soon after our conversation, Martin released a statement saying he "regretted the carelessness and inaccuracy" of his comments regarding the KKK, calling his statement an "impromptu" response to questions about Jackson’s comments that Planned Parenthood has been more lethal to blacks than the KKK. PolitiFact Virginia respects when people tell us they erred, but we still feel obliged to complete our fact checks of their statements. So we asked several historians about the origins of the KKK. Details about the hate group’s founding are murky -- including the exact year it began. Some cite 1865 as its start, others say it was 1867. Historians generally agree it was founded by a handful of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity and it quickly changed into a violent group that terrorized newly empowered black and white Republicans in the South. J. Michael Martinez, the author of a 2007 book "Carpetbaggers, Calvary and the KKK," told us many angry Southern whites during the 1860s and 1870s were Democrats and a smaller number of them joined the KKK. So there is some historic link between Democrats and the KKK. But Martinez said it is misleading to say that the hate group was started by the Democratic Party because it was more of a grassroots creation. There’s another point to consider. "To say that the Ku Klux Klan was started by the Democratic Party -- it’s not the Democratic party of today," Martinez said. "(From the) 1930s until today, you think of the Democratic Party being considered the party of the disenfranchised." Other historians had similar takes. Carole Emberton, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo, wrote in an email that various "Klans" that sprung up around the South acted as a "strong arm" for many local Democratic politicians during Reconstruction. Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest -- believed to be the KKK’s first Grand Dragon -- even spoke at the 1868 Democratic National Convention, said Emberton, author of "Beyond Redemption: Race, Violence and the American South after the Civil War." But Emberton added a major caveat: "The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today," she wrote to us. "Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century." Elaine Frantz Parsons, an associate professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh said that most post-Civil War southern whites were Democrats who were unhappy with Republican policies on Reconstruction while large numbers of newly-freed slaves were Republicans. "So it is not surprising that the Reconstruction era Klan would have been very largely Democrats attacking Republicans," Parsons said in an e-mail. "But this simply does not map well at all onto the party structure we know today. Among other things, the Republicans (during Reconstruction) were condemned as the party of big government and as wanting to centralize authority on the federal level." Our ruling Martin said the KKK was created by the Democratic Party. He acknowledged he was wrong. Historians say the KKK consisted of a group of Southern whites after the Civil War who were Democrats. But there’s no evidence the KKK was created by their political party. It should also be noted that the anti-black Democratic Party of the 1860s and 1870s bears no similarity to the party of today. Recognizing that Martin has expressed regret for his statement. We rate his claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Stephen Martin	None	None	None	2013-06-10T10:05:53	2013-05-24	['None']
pomt-08126	When it comes to the state deficit, Wisconsin is "proportionally in as much trouble as the State of California."	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/09/alberta-darling/state-sen-alberta-darling-says-wisconsins-state-de/	When the state owes you money, you expect to get a check, not an IOU. But in California, budget problems got so bad that in 2009, the state issued temporary IOUs to state employees and business contractors. In 2010, it delayed issuing tax refunds as well as payments to schools, community clinics and day care providers. In October, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed nearly $1 billion in spending from the 2011-2012 budget. Then, less than two months later, he ordered the legislature into special session to address a $19 billion deficit in that budget as well as a $6 billion shortfall in the 2010-2011 one. Now those are some serious budget problems. Believe it or not, Wisconsin’s budget situation is just as bad, according to Wisconsin state Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills). On the "Upfront with Mike Gousha" TV news program Dec. 5, Gousha asked Darling about contracts the state is negotiating with state employee unions. Darling said the contracts should not be finalized until after Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker replaces Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle on Jan. 3. "I think what we need to do is say, Can we afford the benefits and salaries that we pay for our state employees? That is the question," said Darling, who will co-chair the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee starting in January. "We are in deep debt. Our spending is over the top. "And we are proportionally in as much trouble as the State of California, who we hear about all the time in national news." Hey, we were planning on getting a state tax refund from Madison in a few months. If cautious Wisconsin is in as much of a fiscal mess as crazy California, we’d like to know now. Let’s sort it out. One of Darling’s aides said the 20-year state lawmaker based her comment on a December 2009 article by Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Using the most recent figures available at the time, Berry said that Wisconsin’s 2007-2008 state budget deficit of $2.5 billion amounted to $445 per person -- tops in the nation. California, according to Berry’s analysis, ranked fourth at $113 per person. So, as of mid-2008 Wisconsin was actually worse off than California. But Darling’s claim was that Wisconsin is in as much trouble as California is now. Berry provided us state deficit numbers for 2008-2009, the most recent period, and suggested we use 2008 U.S. Census population figures to make the same per-capita calculation. He said that’s what the census bureau does when generating per-person state statistics for budget periods that start in one calendar year and end in another. Our calculations show Illinois had the highest state budget deficit per person ($595.39) for 2008-2009. Wisconsin was second ($481.81) and California was third ($437.58). So by that measure, Wisconsin was still in worse shape than California as of mid-2009. But let’s look at a more common measure used by a number of national research organizations -- budget shortfall as a percentage of a state’s budget. Jon Shure, an official at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the percentage is preferred over deficit per capita because it compares a budget shortfall to the state’s budget, rather than to an "artifice" such as population. Shure’s group, based in Washington, D.C., found that Wisconsin’s 2008-2009 budget gap was 11.7 percent of its budget. California, at 36.8 percent, was much worse off. We checked with other outside groups as well, some of which have made projections into the future. That helps provide perspective on the comparison Darling is making. 2009-2010 In a November 2009 report, Beyond California: States in Fiscal Peril, the Pew Center on the States labeled Wisconsin as one of 10 states in fiscal trouble. The rankings were based on six measures, including budget gaps. "California’s problems are in a league of their own," the report said. But Wisconsin "narrowly" made the list partly because of "the size of the hole" the recession made in the state budget. The report said Wisconsin’s 2009-2010 budget gap was the equivalent of 23.2 percent of its state budget. Not good, perhaps, but much better than California, which was at 49.3 percent. 2010-2011 In October 2010, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that Wisconsin’s shortfall in the current budget -- 2010-2011 -- was $3.4 billion, or 23.9 percent of its budget. That indicated Wisconsin was in slightly worse shape than California, whose deficit was $17.9 billion, or 21.6 percent of its state budget. 2011-2012 Looking ahead, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities put Wisconsin’s budget gap at 8.7 percent of its total budget for 2011-2012. Much better than California’s 25.7 percent. The National Conference of State Legislatures, in a report released Dec. 7, 2010, also found Wisconsin better off. The report says Wisconsin’s gap is 9.2 percent of its general fund budget while California’s is more than twice as high, at 18.7 percent. 2012-2013 The National Conference of State Legislatures also projects gaps out to 2012-2013. The budget gap for both states is expected to grow -- but again, Wisconsin fares better. The report projects Wisconsin’s gap at 9.6 percent and California’s at 20.2 percent. Back to the present: There has been considerable debate about the size of Wisconsin’s current budget shortfall. We rated as False the claim by Doyle’s administration that it is $1.5 billion. The general agreement is around $3 billion. The situation has prompted unpaid furlough days, and promises from Walker to seek union concessions. But unlike California, Wisconsin has not been in the national news for extreme measures, such as issuing IOUs or paying its bills late. So is Darling’s comparison of the Badger State to the Golden State on the mark? In the TV interview, she said Wisconsin is "proportionally in as much trouble" as California and pointed to figures from a year-old article as support. Those figures showed that Wisconsin’s budget deficit per person was higher than California’s; updated numbers for 2008-2009 also put Wisconsin’s per-person deficit higher than California’s. But under a more common measure that many consider a stronger approach -- budget shortfall as a percentage of a state’s budget -- various groups found Wisconsin in better shape than California in 2008-2009 and in 2009-2010; in slightly worse shape in 2010-2011; but much better off than California for 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. Darling’s statement was on target to a point, but left out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Alberta Darling	None	None	None	2010-12-09T09:00:00	2010-12-05	['Wisconsin', 'California']
pomt-05902	Says she "wiped out" the state Agriculture Department’s inspections of eggs at retail sites like grocery stores.	/texas/statements/2012/feb/03/susan-combs/comptroller-susan-combs-says-she-wiped-out-agricul/	Reflecting on her time heading the Texas Department of Agriculture, Susan Combs told a blogger that she shrunk the size of government in 2003 by getting rid of a program to ferret out broken eggs at stores. Combs, who has been the state comptroller since 2007, made the statement in an interview with David Bellow, a blogger for the website Texas GOP Vote, who had asked her about remarks she made during a December 2011 meeting of the State Republican Executive Committee. "You also mentioned ... that people were getting paid to go into stores and open the egg cartons and look at the eggs and make sure none were broken," Bellow said. "How crazy is that?" Combs responded by saying that she didn’t think it made sense for the government to be spending money on such a program. "It was not a health issue," she said. "If you can’t tell when you open the carton that it’s broken, then you really are going to have some hard time buying the eggs." Combs then said she tried to end the practice during the 2001 legislative session but wasn’t successful until 2003, when Republicans secured a Texas House majority. "I went back to the House Appropriations (Committee) and the Senate Finance (Committee), and I showed them again, and I got it wiped out," said Combs, who served two four-year terms as agriculture commissioner, winning election to the statewide office in 1998 and 2002. A reader alerted us to the video — which was posted on the Texas GOP Vote website Dec. 6, 2011 — and questioned Combs’ claim that she ended the egg inspections. Is that what she did? Not eggs-actly. From Agriculture Department officials and documents, we learned that the agency continues to inspect eggs at retail sites like grocery and convenience stories as part of its Egg Quality Program. According to the department’s website, the program’s mission is "to ensure that the eggs sold to Texas consumers meet (the agency’s) quality standards," and to achieve that goal, the agency "inspects eggs at packing plants, distribution centers, and retail outlets." Agency spokesman Bryan Black told us in emails and interviews that retail egg inspections began in 1957 and continue today. While packing plants and distribution centers are inspected every year, retail sites, which are significantly more numerous, are randomly inspected. Black told us that in addition to looking for broken or cracked eggs, inspectors check labels and examine eggs "for interior and exterior qualities, as well as size." Inspectors are checking to see whether eggs meet the standards for "quality, grade and size" that have been adopted by the USDA and the federal Food and Drug Administration, as required by state law. "Qualities such as shell shape, yolk movement, air cell size, shell appearance and shell integrity determine whether the egg is graded as AA, A or B," Black said. "These are factors that consumers themselves cannot verify without the use of specialized instruments to conduct the assessments and extensive training." Black said inspectors also check storage temperatures at retail sites and notify the Texas Department of State Health Services if eggs are being stored at above 45 degrees. Inspectors also notify local health agencies if they "observe unsanitary conditions during an egg inspection," Black said. "The reason there are egg inspection programs in Texas and in other state is for consumer protection," Black said. "It is the same reason why we inspect gas pumps and scales. When Texans are purchasing products, it is imperative they get exactly what they are paying for. No one should get ripped off if they are buying fuel, fruit or eggs. We provide oversight to keep businesses honest and make sure the marketplace is fair." Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Department of State Health Services, told us that its inspectors also check eggs at retail sites — including distributors, grocery stores and restaurants — as part of its overall inspections of the facilities. The health inspectors are looking to see that food safety standards are being met. "We’re looking mainly at storage temperatures and whether (the eggs) are graded," Williams said. Black told us that the state Agriculture Department has 64 full-time inspectors that conduct egg checks. However, he noted, inspectors have additional responsibilities. According to an undated job posting on the department’s website, an inspector’s duties include becoming "proficient in accurately conducting a variety of inspections administered by TDA, which may include" inspecting and grading eggs in retail stores and processing plants, as well as inspecting "nursery stock and agricultural commodities leaving or entering the state," "growers and/or retailers for organic certification," and "cotton fields for proper stalk destruction to enforce the cotton pest laws." So, what did Combs succeed in wiping out in 2003? That was a challenging year for Texas lawmakers, who resolved a $9.9 billion projected revenue shortfall with funding cuts, fee increases, federal aid and other strategies. In her interview with Texas GOP Vote, Combs said she took her idea to cut retail egg inspections to the budget-writing House Appropriations and Senate Finance committees. Combs’ spokeswoman, Brooke Botello, pointed us to a March 27, 2003, meeting of the Senate’s finance panel at which Combs testified on her department’s funding requests for the 2004-05 budget, which lawmakers were writing. According to video of the meeting, Sen. Kip Averitt, R-McGregor, presented Combs’ recommendations that egg inspections be reduced by about one-third and that the Agriculture Department stop doing inspections at 10 packing plants where the USDA was also inspecting. Averitt said at the hearing that stopping the duplication would save the state about $145,000 a year. Although Combs’ recommendations detailed at the meeting did not include ending the Agriculture Department’s egg inspections, one of the senators — we couldn’t identify the speaker in the video — floated that idea while questioning Combs. She replied that the Legislature could certainly pass legislation to do that but said she had not calculated how much money ending egg inspections would save the state. The senator then asked whether she thought it would be "logical" for the Legislature to consider shrinking the Agriculture Department’s egg inspection duties down to simply checking the 22 packing facilities not being inspected by the USDA — and halting retail inspections. Combs’ response: "Yes, with one observation. When you’re at the point of sale, one of the things that comes up is ‘Are the eggs broken?’ and we talked about the fact that a broken egg is readily ascertainable by the consumer flipping the box. It does not require some kind of arcane testing. … I would say, yes, we could go to the packer-only (inspection)." Ultimately, however, that’s not what happened. Instead, lawmakers that year reduced the number of overall state Agriculture Department egg inspections. When appropriating funding for the department for 2004-05, lawmakers set the target amount of annual "egg packer, dealer, wholesaler, and retailer inspections" at 2,000, compared with the 3,500 in the previous budget. That was a decrease of 42 percent. According to Black, the department has conducted about 2,100 inspections every year since then. Looking specifically at retail inspections, the annual number dropped along with the overall inspection figure, going from 2,746 in fiscal 2003 to 1,455 in fiscal 2004, a 47 percent decline. Retail checks continued while Combs was commissioner, with 1,955 in fiscal 2005 and 2,055 in fiscal 2006, according to data from the Agriculture Department. Other changes made in 2003: Black told us that the number of full-time positions devoted to inspecting eggs was reduced by 1.5 and that the department adopted a policy implementing Combs’ recommendation that it stop inspecting egg packing plants already inspected by the USDA. Upshot: While the number of annual egg inspections dropped after lawmakers acted, Agriculture Department inspectors continued checking eggs in stores — and still do. Combs’ statement rates False.

pomt-14953	"Even after Syrian troops began to shoot protesters in the streets with live ammunition in 2011, Clinton labeled Bashar al-Assad a ‘reformer.' "	/florida/statements/2015/oct/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-hillary-clinton-called-syrias-bas/	The day Hillary Clinton testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., took aim at her foreign policy record. In an op-ed for the conservative website Breitbart, Rubio criticized Clinton’s statements about Syria: "Clinton touts her early support for arming Syria’s moderate opposition and more recently, a no-fly zone, to contrast her record with President Obama’s," wrote Rubio, a presidential candidate. "But even after Syrian troops began to shoot protesters in the streets with live ammunition in 2011, Clinton labeled Bashar al-Assad a ‘reformer.’ The death toll in the Syrian civil war now stands at more than 200,000. ..." Is Rubio right that Clinton labeled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a reformer? What Clinton said in 2011 PunditFact looked at a similar claim in 2014 when Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace said Clinton had "defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war." We rated that claim Half True. Clinton’s 2011 comments stemmed from when Syria broke into violent clashes between Assad’s government forces and protesters. A civil war erupted after 15 schoolchildren were arrested in February 2011 for spray-painting anti-government graffiti on their school in Daraa. The military responded to protesters with force. Clinton faced questions about Syria on CBS’ Face the Nation on March 27, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer pressed her on why the U.S. reaction would be different from its response to Libya with airstrikes. Syria, Schieffer noted, is no friend of the United States and is an enemy of Israel and an ally of Iran, and Assad’s father had "killed 25,000 people, at a lick" in 1982. Clinton said: "Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don't think that it's yet clear what will occur, what will unfold. "There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer. "What's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning, but there's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities than police actions which, frankly, have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see." So Clinton’s line about Assad as "a reformer" was stated as the opinion of "members of Congress of both parties" rather than as her personal opinion. To be sure, even this formulation was questionable. While Clinton mentioned "both parties," the Washington Post’s Fact Checker was unable to find such comments coming from Republicans. Democratic politicians who had expressed such hope included Nancy Pelosi who visited Syria in 2007 when she was House speaker. She said, "We came in friendship, hope, and determined that the road to Damascus is a road to peace." And then-U.S. Sen. John Kerry at one point had a hopeful view of Assad, though he later changed his tune. A spokesman for Rubio, Alex Conant, pointed to the Fact Checker’s piece to argue that "the claim that she made that others of both parties put forth the view that he was a reformer is false, which undermines the notion that she was not stating her own opinion." Two days after her Face the Nation appearance, a Wall Street Journal reporter asked Clinton if it was still her position that Assad was a reformer. "I referenced opinions of others," Clinton said. "That was not speaking either for myself or for the administration." Clinton added, "We’re troubled by what we hear, but we’re also going to continue to urge that the promise of reform, which has been made over and over again and which you reported on just a few months ago – ‘I’m a reformer, I’m going to reform, and I’ve talked to members of Congress and others about that,’ that we hear from the highest levels of leadership in Syria – will actually be turned into reality." As the military crackdown on Syrians worsened, Clinton called on Assad to go. Clinton was interviewed in November 2011 for ABC News by Jake Tapper, who noted she "at one point seemed to have optimism that Assad was a reformer." Clinton said, "Well, we had hoped so because there was a lot at stake, we wanted to see an agreement, for example, between Syria and Israel. That was something that people have been working on for 30 years. We heard what Assad said about what he wanted to do for reform. But when it came to it, in the Arab Spring and as people actually demanded some freedom and their rights, he responded, as we have seen, very violently." She added, "But he’s not going to be able to sustain what is unfortunately growing armed opposition apparently fueled and maybe led by defectors from his army. It’s probably too late for him to change course, but there needs to be a change at the top of that government, and there needs to be an effort to engage in genuine dialogue and start on the path of reform." Our ruling Rubio said "even after Syrian troops began to shoot protesters in the streets with live ammunition in 2011, Clinton labeled Bashar al-Assad a ‘reformer.’ " Rubio has a point that in a March 2011 interview, Clinton did use the word "reformer" to describe al-Assad. However, Rubio glosses over the fact that she didn’t say that was her personal opinion of him, but rather the view of some members of Congress. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-09297	"No member of the American public has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power — a record unmatched by other fuels."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/22/lamar-alexander/facts-risks-nuclear-power-plants/	Not only is nuclear power reliable and efficient, it's also extremely safe, Sen. Lamar Alexander wrote in an op-ed column in the newspaper The Hill. "No member of the American public has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power — a record unmatched by other fuels," wrote Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, along with Theodore Rockwell, a fellow of the American Nuclear Society and a vice president of Radiation, Science and Health Inc. Considering the history of incidents like Three Mile Island and the deadly Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine, we decided to take a closer look at the history of commercial nuclear power plants, and see if, in fact, no one has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power in the United States. In order to help narrow our search, we decided not to count a death from a workplace hazard, for example slipping and falling. We're specifically looking at the workers in plants who are killed from the process of creating nuclear power. Alexander's staff told us the senator got his facts from the American Nuclear Society Web site, which states in a "Myths and Facts" section that "No member of the public has ever been injured or killed in the entire 50-year history of commercial nuclear power in the U.S." We confirmed that with David Decker, congressional analyst for the government's Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal agency in charge of nuclear plants. "I believe that the senator's statement was that there have been no deaths due to nuclear-related accidents at commercial nuclear power plants. From our perspective, this would be true," Decker said. There have, however, been deaths at nuclear plants. Some people have died in workplace accidents in non-nuclear areas of the plants. And three fatalities occurred at a research reactor rather than a commercial plant (Alexander specified commercial plants). Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Oversight Project at Beyond Nuclear, a group that works to eliminate nuclear use in the United States, cited an accident that killed three men in 1961. They were members of the military working at an experimental nuclear plant in Idaho Falls, Idaho. They died in an accident related to the improper removal of control rods and a chain reaction of the uranium, according to a 1961 Milwaukee Journal article. The explosion released so much radiation that rescuers could only enter the area to recover the bodies for one minute at a time. The bodies were so radioactive that they were buried in lead caskets. (One is at Arlington National Cemetery.) In a 1986 incident, four workers were killed at the Surry power plant in Virginia from the rupture of a pipe that sprayed workers with scalding water and steam. But the accident happened in a non-nuclear portion of the plant. Despite these deaths, nuclear power does stack up as one of the safest forms of energy. It's difficult to get a good comparison with other power-source fatalities because the numbers don't necessarily separate between common workplace hazards and those specifically related to the power source. But for comparison, 13 people have been killed in hydroelectric power generation since 2003, and fossil-fuel electric power generation has killed 23 since then, said Andrew Marsh, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So while people in the United States have been killed in non-commercial plants and in non-nuclear areas of a commercial plant, Alexander is right that no has been killed "by commercial nuclear power." And those statistics and the most complete numbers we can find for other energy sources confirm his claim that it is a record unmatched by other fuels. So we find his claim True. Update: This report mistakenly said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not keep numbers on injuries in nuclear power generation plants. We have removed the inaccurate sentence. Our ruling and analysis has not changed.	None	Lamar Alexander	None	None	None	2010-04-22T14:45:13	2010-03-09	['United_States']
pomt-08338	The health care bill "cuts the deficit by over $1 trillion dollars."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-health-care-bill-cuts-deficit/	In an interview with President Barack Obama on Oct. 27, 2010, Daily Show host Jon Stewart summed up the president's first two years in office, saying that despite a campaign that promised audacious change, "legislatively, it has felt timid at times." Stewart cited the Democratic health care law as an example. Obama scoffed at "this notion that health care was timid." "You've got 30 million people who are going to get health insurance as a consequence of this," Obama said. "You've got a patient's bill of rights that makes sure insurance companies can't drop you when you get sick if you've been paying premiums, that makes sure there aren't lifetime limits, that makes sure kids who don't have health insurance can stay on their parents insurance until they are 26. And cuts the deficit by over a trillion dollars. This is, what I think most people would say, is as significant a piece of legislation as we have seen in this country's history." On the campaign trail, many Republican candidates have lumped the health care bill in with the economic stimulus as examples of Obama administration initiatives driving the country deeper into debt. So Obama's claim that the health care bill would actually cut the deficit by over $1 trillion dollars is significant. It's a claim Obama has made many times, and we first weighed in on it when Obama said in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 27, 2010, that health care reform "would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades." So then it was "as much as" $1 trillion and this time it was "over $1 trillion dollars." But the substance is the same: Obama is in pretty speculative territory here. Obama is correct that the Congressional Budget Office, with its teams of economists and legislative analysts, has found that the health care bill passed in March not only pays for itself but brings down the deficit. That's because the plan includes new tax provisions and cost-savings measures to pay for its spending. The CBO found the health care reform bill would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10 years. So how does Obama get to over $1 trillion? He's looking way down the road, at a 20-year estimate, which gets highly speculative. The CBO usually only calculates the impact of legislation's cost over 10 years. But the agency will create calculations for a longer period if Congress requests it. The CBO doesn't like to calculate longer than 10 years because many variables are difficult to predict. Here's what the CBO had to say about calculating health reform's effect on the deficit between 2020 and 2030: "A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal." In fact, the CBO wouldn't even present its findings as a straightforward dollar number, but instead as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or GDP, which is a number that measures a nation's economic output. The CBO said that over the second 10 years, the Senate proposal should reduce the deficit "in a broad range around one half percent of GDP." Obama's $1 trillion figure is an extrapolation of what one-half of 1 percent of GDP might be. According to the CBO's latest numbers, GDP will be $22.5 trillion in 2020. You can do a rough estimate and find that you could get to roughly $1 trillion over 20 years. Back in January, we ran all this by Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Institution. He said that the numbers aren't phony, but that Obama tries to put a hard number on something that is inherently unpredictable. "You really can't model GDP 15 years from now," he said. Riedl also said he thought Congress would not be able to stick to some of the spending reductions contained in the Democratic proposals, especially in regards to Medicare. We also spoke to Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who called Obama's $1 trillion figure " a little speculative." "But if you say in your speech it will reduce the deficit one-quarter to one-half percent of GDP, no one listening to the State of the Union would have a clue as to what you meant, and it would make it sound like a tiny amount when it's not," Horney said. Bottom line, Obama is presenting a highly speculative number as a hard fact. The CBO believes the health care bill will continue to improve the deficit in second 10 years. In an Oct. 22, 2010 presentation on the economic effects of the health care bill, CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf said the legislation sets up a number of experiments in delivery and payment systems, but "it is unclear how successful the experiments will be." For that reason, and others, the CBO noted that the uncertainties involved are too great to create detailed projections. And so now, as then, we rate Obama's statement Half True.

pomt-03334	"The president … by executive order" could grant voting rights to illegal immigrants who are newly legalized under pending legislation.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/23/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-barack-obama-can-use-executi/	She may not be running for another term in Congress, but Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is still making provocative statements. In an interview with World Net Daily, a conservative Web publication, Bachmann urged House Republicans to oppose key features of a Senate-passed bill that allows a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants (a process that critics call amnesty). Among other things, she warned that as soon as illegal immigrants become voters, they will vote for Democrats. Bachmann said that Republicans could lose the House in 2014 if they weren’t careful. "Because, I think the president, even by executive order, could again wave his magic wand before 2014 and he’d say, ‘Now, all of the new legal Americans are going to have voting rights,’ " Bachmann said. Bachmann’s office didn’t return a request for elaboration, but we found several legal experts to analyze her claim that Obama, or any president, could use an executive order to grant voting rights to anyone newly legalized under an immigration overhaul that emerges from Congress. The short answer is that Bachmann is wrong. The Constitution explicitly addresses who can vote for the U.S. House of Representatives (Article I, Section 2), for the U.S. Senate (the 12th Amendment) and for the presidency (Article II, Section 1). In each case, the Constitution says, the states -- not the president or Congress -- determines who can vote for these offices. To vote for Congress, for instance, a voter must be eligible to vote for representatives to the larger house of the state’s legislature. Because of this, "the president can’t change the federal qualification directly, and he also could not, by executive order, change the qualifications for the state legislature," said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Generally speaking, only native-born or naturalized citizens can vote. Legal permanent residents (those with a green card) cannot. Once someone becomes a legal permanent resident, they generally have to wait five years before they are even eligible to seek U.S. citizenship. If they decide to apply for citizenship, they must pass a criminal background check and a civics test before becoming a citizen. In fact, a law passed in 1996 and amended in 2000, says clearly that it’s "unlawful for any alien to vote" in a federal election. "Any non-citizen who attempts to vote unlawfully is subject to criminal penalty under state and federal law," said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis School of Law. The Senate immigration bill would not grant voting rights to newly legalized immigrants immediately, and they would not be guaranteed the right to vote eventually. Rather, the bill sets up a pathway to citizenship -- a pathway that includes additional hurdles beyond the ones facing legal permanent residents seeking naturalization, such as paying a fine. Once the law is enacted, Obama wouldn’t be able to do a quick about-face and use an executive order to strip out all the obstacles to citizenship and simply make illegal immigrants full citizens, Roosevelt and Johnson agreed. "It would violate the intent of, as well as the text of, the law passed by Congress," Johnson said. Indeed, Obama has not demonstrated an inclination to push the envelope on changing voting rules for illegal immigrants. Under an Obama administration policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children can seek a delay from deportation, as well as permission to work legally. But the right to vote is not allowed under the policy. So, Bachmann is flat wrong about Obama’s ability to turn illegal immigrants into voters. However, as we have sometimes noted, even her incorrect statements raise some interesting questions. As it turns out, Obama can’t issue an executive order that allows non-citizens to vote, but states may be able to extend voting rights to non-citizens, as long as doing so is not barred by the state’s constitution. As recently as this year, the Supreme Court ruled in Arizona vs. Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona that the Constitution "empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them" -- which only strengthens a state’s claim to the power to decide who can vote. "I think a state would have a strong argument" that it could do this, Roosevelt said. Of course, just because it’s possible doesn’t mean it’s likely. Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a former member of the Federal Election Commission, said states that try to allow non-citizens to vote would likely face a court fight. "They would have to pass a state law, and then go to court and argue that the state law is not pre-empted by the federal statute and that the federal law is an unconstitutional invasion of the state’s right to set qualifications," he said. In general, states might have an easier time arguing that non-citizens should be permitted to vote in state elections. A state that sought to permit non-citizen voting in federal elections would face greater legal obstacles, experts say. However, an even higher hurdle would be overcoming the idea, now deeply ingrained in the public mind, that there’s a bright line between citizens and non-citizens -- citizens vote, and non-citizens do not. Today, very few non-citizens vote for any office, and the few who do only vote for local offices. For instance, non-citizens can vote in a handful of localities in Maryland, such as Takoma Park, and only for purely local positions. No state today allows non-citizens to vote in state-level elections, and the occasional efforts in state legislatures to expand voting to non-citizens have gone nowhere. This was not always the case. Alien voting was permitted in many states early in the nation’s history, and while the idea waxed and waned over the years, the impulse to let aliens vote spread widely during westward expansion, when new territories were eager to attract residents, political scientist Jamin Raskin has written. Such laws were reversed one by one during the first quarter of the 20th Century, due to World War I-era nationalism and fears about rising immigrant populations. The last state to allow alien voting, Arkansas, ended it in 1926. No state has resurrected it since. Our ruling Bachmann said "the president … by executive order" could grant voting rights to illegal immigrants newly legalized under pending legislation. That’s not true -- the states, not the president, have the power to determine who can vote. It’s right there in the Constitution. We rate Bachmann’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12222	"The last majority-Anglo high school class in Texas graduated in 2014."	/texas/statements/2017/jul/19/evan-smith/evan-smith-incorrectly-says-last-anglo-majority-te/	Stressing the changing population of Texas, the Texas Tribune’s CEO pinpointed 2014 as a milestone year perhaps troubling to historically dominant residents. As quoted in The New Yorker magazine, Evan Smith noted first that the Republican-led Legislature this year allocated a fresh $800 million toward border security. "White people are scared of change," Smith went on, "believing that what they have is being taken away from them by people they consider unworthy. "But all they’re doing is poking a bear with a stick," Smith told Lawrence Wright for an extensive July 2017 story on Texas government and politics. "In 2004, the Anglo population in Texas became a minority. The last majority-Anglo high-school class in Texas graduated in 2014. There will never be another. The reality is, it’s all over for the Anglos." Whether anything is over, for anyone, strikes us as a factually uncheckable opinion. It’s otherwise old news that Anglo, or white, residents haven’t made up the majority of Texans for a while. But did the last majority-white high school class graduate as recently as 2014? A reader asked us to check Smith’s 2014 claim, noting it could be read to mean there are no longer any high schools where white students make up a majority of graduates. Asked about that notion, Rice University’s Steve Murdock, former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, told us by email: "There are of course schools where this is not true such as some suburban schools and some rural schools in the Panhandle and other areas where the residents are still disproportionately non-Hispanic white." For our part, we checked regional figures for high school completion in 2015, the latest year of state-posted data. That year, white students comprised more than half of high-school seniors and graduates in East Texas (Education Service Center regions rooted in Huntsville, Mt. Pleasant and Kilgore) and the Wichita Falls and Abilene areas of West Texas. Across Texas, in contrast, some 109,200 white students made up 32 percent of the state’s 339,026 12th-graders and 102,000 white graduates accounted for 34 percent of the state’s total 302,262 graduates, the figures indicate. Separately, Smith told us by email that he wasn’t trying to tell Wright there are no longer any white-majority senior classes in the state. Asked why he specified 2014 as a statewide turning point, Smith said he believes he relied on information from Murdock or possibly the Texas Education Agency. State data Next, we asked the education agency about Smith’s claim. Spokeswoman Lauren Callahan pointed us toward agency-posted high-school completion data indicating that the last time white students comprised even a plurality of the state’s public high-school graduates was 2010. That year, according to the data, there were 109,887 white high-school graduates and 106,514 Hispanic graduates -- though the state’s 135,212 Hispanic high school seniors (not all of them graduating) outnumbered the 119,938 white seniors. Back in time In our subsequent review of agency figures, we didn’t spot a recent year when white students comprised a majority of seniors or graduates. As far back as 2003, 125,262 white high-school seniors amounted to 47.5 percent of all the state’s 263,571 seniors, according to the agency. In 2015, the latest year of posted counts, 109,200 white seniors comprised 32.2 percent of 339,626 seniors. With help from Lloyd Potter, the San Antonio-based Texas state demographer, we looked further back. Potter pointed out TEA reports on enrollment including a 2003 report stating that in 2000-01, 111,781 white students accounted for 50.7 percent of the state’s 220,324 high school seniors and in 2001-02, 113,108 white students broke out to a smidge more than half of the state’s 226,177 12th-graders. In 2002-03, 117,100 white seniors comprised 49 percent of the state’s 238,699 seniors, the agency later reported. Notably, Smith was more specific by declaring 2014 the last time white students comprised the majority of high-school graduates. According to the TEA’s counts, in contrast, white students most recently comprised the majority of Texas public high school graduates in 2003. That year, the agency says, 112,460 Anglo students made up 50.7 percent of the state’s 222,021 graduates. The next year, agency figures indicate, 112,495 white students made up 49.1 percent of the state’s 229,133 graduates. We circled back to Smith with these date findings. He said of his quoted claim: "If it’s wrong, it’s wrong." Our ruling Smith said the last majority-Anglo high school class in Texas graduated in 2014. To the contrary, there remain some Texas high schools with a majority of white students in 12th grade or among graduates, we found, while for all of Texas, state-collected counts show the latest year that white students comprised the majority of public high-school graduates was 2003. White students last accounted for the majority of public high-school seniors in 2001-02. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-08267	In 2011, Milwaukee Public Schools "will provide 77 cents in employee benefits for every dollar it spends on wages."	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/10/bob-donovan/alderman-says-milwaukee-public-schools-spends-77-c/	When new census numbers ranked Milwaukee among the poorest big cities in America, Alderman Bob Donovan laid part of the blame on Milwaukee Public Schools -- and proposed an extreme step for the district. In a statement issued Sept. 29, 2010, the fiery alderman said MPS should declare bankruptcy. It’s not clear if the district could. The state Department of Public Instruction says the MPS board would have to determine if it is possible and the city attorney has not researched the question. We’ll leave it to students of finance to sort out if bankruptcy is the right approach to take. But we were struck by one of the claims Donovan made in stating his case. Arguing that MPS’s pension and health benefits are "unsustainable and overly generous," Donovan pointed to the district’s 2010-2011 budget and said: "MPS will provide 77 cents in employee benefits for every dollar it spends on wages." Wait a minute. Don’t most employers -- even public sector ones -- pay far less in benefits for every $1 in wages? Let’s start with Donovan’s specific claim, then take a look at his larger point -- that MPS benefits are excessive, taking limited money away from the classroom. In making his claim, Donovan said the 77 cent figure came from the city’s Legislative Reference Bureau, which is the research staff for the Common Council. In turn, the reference bureau said it came from a March 2010 column written by education writer Alan Borsuk in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Borsuk said the figure came from an estimate MPS made that month, in developing the school district’s 2010-2011 budget. By the time Donovan made his statement in late September, however, the district had revised its estimate to a somewhat smaller number: 74 cents. That is where the figure remained after the School Board approved the budget in October 2010. So, Donovan is generally on target. But some additional clarification is in order. Donovan’s statement suggests the pay-to-benefits ratio applies to the cost of current employees only. When MPS calculates its benefits in this fashion, it also includes the cost of providing benefits -- including pensions and health care -- to retirees. The district could not separate those costs for us, but that approach makes the figure higher. How does the 74-cent figure compare? Here’s what some other local governments estimate they will spend in 2011 on benefits -- for employees and retirees -- for every $1 spent on wages: City of Milwaukee: 48 cents (for general employees). Racine Unified School District: 57 cents Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District: 59 cents. Meanwhile, Milwaukee County -- struggling with the cost of enhanced pension benefits that led to officials being removed from office -- projects it will pay $1 in benefits for each dollar it pays in wages in 2011. All right, the bell is about to ring, so we’ll wrap up our lesson. In calling on Milwaukee Public Schools to file for bankruptcy, Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan said that for every $1 MPS will spend in 2011 on wages, it will spend another 77 cents on benefits. The figure was off a bit, since he used an early estimate -- the actual number is 74 cents. And it’s a little confusing for taxpayers, since it rolls in costs related to retirees, not just current employees. But his larger point -- that MPS pays a lot more in benefits than other local governments pay -- is on the money. We rate Donovan’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-08099	Beaverton "enjoys the most diverse population (by percentage of population) among Oregon cities."	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/14/city-beaverton/beaverton-tries-take-mantle-oregons-most-diverse-c/	We like very specific claims here at PolitiFact Oregon. It makes our work easier -- less room for waffling by the person making the statement, you know? Well, a recent press release by the city of Beaverton that innocuously promoted an upcoming guest speaker, made one such very specific claim. At the tail end of the release, in a small blurb about the city’s bona fides, was this sentence: "Beaverton also enjoys the most diverse population (by percentage of population) among Oregon cities." Now, no offense to Beaverton, but that just didn’t seem remotely possible. That alone made it a good candidate for a fact check. Add to that the very specific measurement of "by percentage of population," and we just couldn’t help ourselves. We decided to check in on three cities and go from there should Beaverton come out on top in terms of diversity. So, we started by pulling demographic information, as reported by the 2009 American Community Survey, for Beaverton, Portland and Hillsboro. (To get the most recent data, go here and do "Principal City" search for the Portland-Beaverton-Vancouver metro area.) Here’s what we found: In the "race" category -- which includes designations like "Black or African American," "Asian," and "American Indian and Alaska Native" -- Portland is by far the least diverse with 82 percent of respondents reporting their "race" as white and about 23 percent reporting as some other designation. Beaverton comes in at a 76 percent and 28.5 percent respectively. Hillsboro is the most diverse of the three, with 73 percent and 32.1 percent respectively. (Yes, we realize these numbers don’t add up to 100 percent. That’s the result of double reporting by some respondents. Luckily, all cities have about the same instance of overreporting -- about 5 percent.) There’s one other category to look at before we wrap this up. The census asks respondents whether they identify as "hispanic or latino" separately from the race category. If you look at that category alone, Hillsboro comes out on top again with 23 percent identifying as either hispanic or latino. Beaverton comes in second with 18 percent and Portland comes in a distant third with 9 percent. We called up the city of Beaverton to tell them what we’d found. Jordan Imlah, a spokesman for the mayor’s office, looked into it and sent us this response: "You are indeed correct with your current census figures. We got our stats from older census figures and an Oregonian article published in 2007 by Dave Anderson." Imlah said the city will now start billing itself as "one of the most diverse populations in Oregon." The ruling is pretty easy here. The city of Beaverton said it had "the most diverse population (by percentage of population) among Oregon cities." The American Community Survey shows that’s just not the case. And the city now admits its numbers are old. We rate this claim False. Note: A colleague of ours asked why it was that we had focused on Hillsboro and Portland as possible cities with higher minority presence and offered Woodburn as one city that would probably surpass all three in that regard. The reason we chose those two cities was simply that 2009 numbers -- the most recent -- are available only for larger communities. Since we published this PolitiFact, however, the Census Bureau released a 2005-2009 data set. It's not quite as current as the one we used, but it does offer new numbers for smaller cities, like Woodburn. So, we decided to take a look at the demographic breakdown for Woodburn. Our colleague was on to something. About 40 percent of respondents there identified as a race other than "white" and 56 percent identified as Hispanic or Latino. Woodburn far outpaces Hillsboro, Beaverton and Portland insofar as diversity by percentage of population is concerned. Comment on this item.

pomt-02556	"Georgia has the fifth-highest number of uninsured people of any state in the union."	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/03/raphael-warnock/ranks-uninsured-high-georgia/	A chorus of Democratic lawmakers and supporters has been increasingly vocal in pushing Gov. Nathan Deal to expand Medicaid in Georgia. One of those voices is the Rev. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, the former pulpit of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Warnock, the keynote speaker at this year’s MLK Commemorative Service at Ebenezer, used the occasion -- with political heavyweights of both sides of the aisle in the room -- to demand an expansion. He cited a statistic we’ve seen others mention to make his case. "Georgia has the fifth-highest number of uninsured people of any state in the union," he said. Is this correct? PolitiFact Georgia was curious for a few reasons. U.S. census figures show Georgia has the eighth-highest population in the nation, so the Peach State’s ranking would be higher than some states that have more residents, if Warnock is correct. We’ve also heard similar claims in the past from others who support the expansion, so PolitiFact Georgia thought now is a good time to find out if they’re right. As part of the federal health care law, also known as Obamacare, the federal government pays for the full cost of newly eligible Medicaid recipients under expansion for the first three years. Its share then drops to no lower than 90 percent of the cost. In Georgia, it’s estimated that as many as 650,000 additional residents would be eligible for Medicaid. Deal, whose last vote as a congressman was against the health care law, has been adamantly opposed to the Medicaid expansion. The governor has said he’s wary of expanding coverage for fear that Uncle Sam will be unable to fulfill its funding pledge for the additional Medicaid recipients. Deal has estimated the expansion would cost the state $4 billion over a decade, but supporters of the health care law say the cost would likely be closer to half of that. Medicaid expansion supporters contend Georgia could get about $30 billion over 10 years from the federal government. Deal, who spoke at the MLK service, had left by the time Warnock addressed the audience. The pastor — who called Deal "courageous" for his position on other issues, such as prison re-entry — told us, "I’d like to see the same courage on Medicaid expansion." An Atlanta Journal-Constitution statewide poll done in September found nearly 60 percent of Georgians don’t like the health care law, but approximately the same percentage of respondents believe Medicaid should be expanded. Warnock said he had done some research on where Georgia ranked nationally in terms of uninsured residents and believed he was "in the ballpark" on his claim. He forwarded a two-page fact-sheet by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, which supports an expansion, that says Georgia ranks fifth in the number of uninsured residents. He shared a 2012 Kaiser Family Foundation report that ranked Georgia tied for fifth in the percentage of uninsured residents, at 19 percent, along with Alaska and California. In order, the top four states were Nevada, Florida, New Mexico and Louisiana. A 2013 Gallup poll found Georgia ranked sixth nationally in that category, with approximately 22.5 percent of its residents uninsured. The top five were Texas, Louisiana, Nevada, California and Florida. The results were based on telephone interviews conducted as part of a yearlong survey of a random sample of adults across the nation. Some interviews were done in Spanish. The Corporation for Enterprise Development, an organization that works to alleviate poverty, released a study that found nearly 22 percent of Georgians under the age of 65 were uninsured in 2011. That was the fourth-highest total in the nation, behind only Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. The corporation used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for its findings. The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey has a breakdown of uninsured residents by state. In 2012, Georgia ranked sixth, with about 19 percent of its residents uninsured, slightly above the national average of 16 percent. The top five states were Texas, Nevada, New Mexico, Florida and Louisiana. Georgia State University associate professor Bill Custer said there are several factors concerning why Georgia ranks consistently among the states with the highest percentage of uninsured residents. Georgia, he said, has a larger percentage of residents who cannot afford health insurance because their wages are low or they are unemployed. We recently fact-checked a claim by state Sen. Jason Carter, D-Atlanta, that the average Georgia family makes $6,000 less than the average family did 10 years ago when inflation is factored in. Carter’s claim was rated True. Another factor, Custer said, is many Georgians live in rural parts of the state and work in industries such as agriculture and retail where their employers cannot afford to provide health care. Custer wrote a report in February 2013 that concluded the expansion would support 70,343 jobs statewide over a 10-year span. About half of those jobs would be in the health care industry, Custer said. "For us not to accept the Medicaid expansion is a barrier to economic growth," Warnock said in a telephone interview. "You’ll produce jobs. If you provide that health care (to those additional Medicaid recipients), someone has to provide that health care." To sum up, Warnock said Georgia has the fifth-highest number of uninsured residents. Our research showed he’s indeed in the ballpark. We rate his claim True.

pomt-10589	Romney used to favor gun control, and said he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/28/john-mccain/romney-used-to-support-gun-control/	Mitt Romney says he is a supporter of gun rights and a fan of Ronald Reagan. But he didn't always tout those positions, a fact that John McCain uses to mock Romney in a new Internet ad. Romney took positions favorable to gun control in previous races in Massachusetts, a state with strict gun control laws. In 1994, Romney ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy. During that campaign, Romney supported two gun control measures: the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. In 2002, Romney ran for governor, successfully beating Shannon P. O'Brien. During that campaign Romney said, "We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them." The McCain ad accurately quotes Romney on this point. Also during the 1994 race, Kennedy attacked Romney as a conservative similar to Ronald Reagan. (He didn't mean it as a compliment.) That's when Romney responded, "I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Romney made his most detailed defenses to these apparent flip-flops in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News' Face the Nation on Oct. 21, 2007. On the gun issue, Romney said, "I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. ... But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. I sought the support of the NRA when I ran for governor, and I got it." Unfortunately for Romney, he later had to revise his statement that he had the support of the NRA in the governor's race. The NRA did not endorse in that race. (See our previous check on that statement here .) On his Reagan comment: "Well, when I was running in '94 I wasn't trying to return to Reagan-Bush because that was characterized as a very different posture than what I was running for. ... And Senator Kennedy in the debate was saying, `Oh, you're just turning yourself into Reagan-Bush.' I said, 'No, I'm my own person.' " Romney has been attacked on these issues before; we checked an earlier claim here . McCain's ad accurately conveys Romney's positions now and during the previous times Romney has run for office. The ad clearly labels which statements were made during which campaign. For this reason, we find the ad's statements True. For more on McCain's ad attacking Romney, see our story here .

pomt-13339	"Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit."	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-correctly-notes-richard-nixon-released-t/	Mike Pence told Tim Kaine at the vice presidential debate that Donald Trump will release his tax returns -- once an audit of the GOP presidential candidate has concluded. But the Democratic vice presidential candidate responded that explanation didn’t meet the "Nixon standard." "Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit," Kaine said. Kaine often invokes Nixon in calling for Donald Trump to release his tax returns. Back in August, we checked a statement Kaine made where he said that Nixon made his tax returns public "when he was running for president." We found that statement was Mostly False, because while Nixon made his tax forms public as president, he never did so while running for the country’s highest office. Kaine worded his statement differently this time around, so let’s take another look. You can find Nixon’s tax returns for 1969 through 1972 at the website for the Presidential Tax History Project, which is run by Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based nonprofit that specializes in tax issues. That group has compiled tax returns online for past presidents and major-party presidential nominees. Nixon’s returns were released in December 1973, a year after he was re-elected. At the time, the 37th president was embroiled in the Watergate scandal, and questions were being raised about whether something also was amiss with his tax filings. Reports had surfaced that Nixon had been paying a small amount of federal tax for several years, Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts told us in August. To quell lingering concerns, Nixon released tax returns to the public as well as to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Nixon was under an IRS audit at the time, Thorndike told us. In an April 2016 blog post, Thorndike wrote that the IRS audit found Nixon owed almost $500,000 in unpaid taxes and interest. "Nixon released his returns even though he was under audit. Ultimately, the audit didn’t go well for him-- it was unpleasant, embarrassing, and ultimately very expensive," Thorndike wrote. "But it was also necessary, given the persistent questions about Nixon’s returns." Thorndike says Nixon’s disclosure started a tradition where presidents and candidates seeking the highest office release their returns to the public. His successor, President Gerald Ford, didn’t make his returns public, although he did release a summary of his returns. Every president since Jimmy Carter has made their tax forms public. Our ruling Kaine said, "Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit." That is accurate.

pomt-06596	Says that Romney touted the Massachusetts health plan for the nation in his hardcover book but then deleted it for the paperback edition.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-mitt-romney-deleted-health-care-li/	Seems Rick Perry and Mitt Romney have each sold a few more books lately — to each other's campaigns. Romney used Perry's comments about Social Security in Fed Up!, the Texas governor's screed against federal expansionism, to portray Perry as a foe of the popular retirement program. Then, at the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Perry struck back by suggesting that Romney had altered the paperback edition of his book No Apology to downplay his support of the Massachusetts health care plan. PERRY: "Speaking of books and talking about being able to have things in your books, back and forth, your economic adviser talked about Romneycare and how that was an absolute bust. And it was exactly what Obamacare was all about. "As a matter of fact, between books, your hard copy book, you said it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them as you had in Massachusetts. Then in your paperback, you took that line out. So, speaking of not getting it straight in your book sir, that would be a ..." ROMNEY: "Gov. Perry, we were talking about Social Security, but if you want to talk about health care, I'm happy to do that." FOX HOST BRET BAIER: "We are going to have a round on that." ROMNEY: "I actually wrote my book, and in my book I said no such thing. What I said, actually -- when I put my health care plan together -- and I met with Dan Balz, for instance, of the Washington Post. He said, 'Is this is a plan that if you were president you would put on the whole nation, have a whole nation adopt it?' " "I said, 'Absolutely not.' I said, 'This is a state plan for a state, it is not a national plan.' "And it's fine for you to retreat from your own words in your own book, but please don't try and make me retreat from the words that I wrote in my book. I stand by what I wrote. I believe in what I did. And I believe that the people of this country can read my book and see exactly what it is." We wondered: Had Romney really touted Massachusetts-style health care for all — then deleted it? We got copies of the paperback and hardcover editions. Romney's changes to the book have been explored before, by Boston political journalist David S. Bernstein. He noted in February that Romney had added harsher language on the national health care law as passed: "Obamacare will not work and should be repealed," and, "Obamacare is an unconstitutional federal incursion into the rights of states." Romney more clearly explained ways that he disagreed with implementation of the Massachusetts law. He also changed this line, which came after a paragraph touting the success of the Massachusetts health plan: HARDCOVER: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care." To: PAPERBACK: "And it was done without government taking over health care." Why make the change? Well, Romney was in quite a spot. His hardcover was written when the national health care policy supported by President Barack Obama included a public insurance option. So his Massachusetts plan, by comparison, kept "private insurance and personal choice intact," he wrote. Then the Democratic plan passed, without the public option. And it looked uncomfortably close to Romney's plan. As PolitiFact's Angie Drobnic Holan has written, both leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They seek to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering tax breaks to help moderate income people buy insurance. People are required to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." And companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. Suddenly, the line in the hardcover edition to "accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country" as Republican Romney had done for Massachusetts was pretty close to what the Democratic president had done nationally. So Perry was right that there was some strategic editing. But a closer look at Romney's original hardcover shows Perry was distorting what Romney wrote when he told the former Massachusetts governor, "Between books, your hard copy book, you said it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them as you had in Massachusetts. Then in your paperback, you took that line out." Here's the quote with full context from Page 177 of the hardcover: "My own preference would be to let each state fashion its own program to meet the distinct needs of its citizens. States could follow the Massachusetts model of they choose, or they could develop plans of their own. These plans, tested in the state 'laboratories of democracy' could be evaluated, compared, improved upon, and adopted by others. But the creation of a national plan is the direction in which Washington is currently moving. If a national approach is ultimately adopted, we should permit individuals to purchase insurance from companies in other states in order to expand choice and competition. "What we accomplished surprised us: 440,000 people who previously had no health insurance became insured, many paying their own way. We made it possible for each newly insured person to have better care, and ultimately healthier and longer lives. From now on, no one in Massachusetts has to worry about losing his or her health insurance if there is a job change or a loss in income; everyone is insured and pays only what he or she can afford. It's portable, affordable health insurance — something people have been talking about for decades. We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care." So Romney's not really saying "it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them." He's in fact presenting a defense of state-level choice — not a pitch for a mandatory national approach. It's like a shout-out to other state leaders: Hey, you can have what Massachusetts has! And it's consistent with what Romney fired back at Perry in the Sept. 22 debate: "This is a state plan for a state, it is not a national plan." Our ruling Perry's right that Romney's comments about health care were edited between editions. Among other things, a line that advocated the Massachusetts model as a strong option for other states was replaced by a shorter, more generic sentence.

pomt-04281	"Obama's Environmental Protection Agency sent emails for Hispanic Heritage Month with a photo of Che Guevara."	/florida/statements/2012/nov/02/mitt-romney/romney-campaign-says-obamas-epa-sent-emails-che-gu/	A Spanish-language TV ad from Mitt Romney starts off with a question for South Florida voters: "Who supports Barack Obama?" The ad provides three notorious answers: Chávez, Castro and Ernesto "Che" Guevara. The Miami Herald translated the ad, "Chávez Por Obama," which aired on three Spanish-language TV stations on Oct. 30, 2012. The ad mixes footage from interviews with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and the niece of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro with news headlines about a provocative email. Narrator: "Who supports Barack Obama?" Chávez video: "If I were American, I’d vote for Obama." Narrator: "Raúl Castro’s daughter, Mariela Castro, would vote for Obama." Castro video: "I would vote for President Obama." Narrator: "And to top it off, Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency sent emails for Hispanic Heritage Month with a photo of Che Guevara." Chávez: "If Obama were from Barlovento (a Venezuelan town), he’d vote for Chávez." Romney: "I’m Mitt Romney, and I approve this message." The Chavez clips are from a September 2012 interview in which he also called Obama "a good guy." Mariela Castro, a supporter of gay rights, said she would vote for Obama in May 2012 following Obama announcing his support of gay marriage. Here, we wanted to check the claim that the EPA sent emails for Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, with a picture of Guevara, a guerrilla leader and Marxist revolutionary. He played a major role under Castro during the revolution and carried out the execution of more than 150 prisoners without a fair trial. We also wanted to examine the connection to Obama. It’s not the first time someone tried pin Obama, born in 1961, to the revolutionary, who was assassinated in 1967. During Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, bloggers responded to video of a Guevara flag in a volunteer field office with iterations of "Obama loves Che Guevara." PolitiFact rated that Pants on Fire. Romney’s team declined to explain their strategy of invoking Guevara. But for many Cubans, it doesn’t get much worse than Guevara. "When you talk about dislike among the Cubans across the board, Che Guevara might be a notch below Fidel," said Andy Gomez, senior fellow at the University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies. "He was the henchman. Che Guevara was the one that carried the heavy hand." The EPA email in question caused a stir about a month before the Romney ad appeared. An EPA management analyst sent an email containing a picture of a horse and buggy passing a wall with Guevara’s portrait next to his famous slogan, "Hasta La Victoria, Siempre!" (Until Victory, Always). It also contained several passages about Hispanic culture, religion, general manners and family values under the headline "Hispanic news you can use!". "Hispanic people are vibrant, socializing and fun loving people. Among various facts associated to this culture is that they have a deep sense of involvement in their family traditions and culture," the email said. BuzzFeed obtained a copy of the email sent from a management analyst to EPA staff and posted it on its website Sept. 13, 2012. The text presented another problem for the agency. It matched word-for-word, without attribution, text from the website Buzzle, BuzzFeed reported. Still, the plagiarism played second fiddle to Guevara’s picture in news stories that picked up on the email, including the Miami Herald and Fox News Latino, which were the headlines cited in the Romney ad. The agency quickly apologized for the email. A spokesperson explained it was sent "without official clearance." "The email was drafted and sent by an individual employee, and without official clearance. Shortly after sending the email in question the individual apologized to her colleagues for the inadvertent error," the spokesperson told Buzzfeed in a statement. An EPA spokesman could not tell us the number of employees who received the email, but confirmed that it was an internal message and not released as a statement to the general public. Specifically, it was sent to the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response. The employee was not fired for sending the email, the spokesman said. The apology did not quell outrage. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, and chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, issued a scathing statement that said, "The image of Che is an insult to countless people who lost family members because of his evil and twisted acts." "Surely, the EPA could have chosen the image of a Hispanic person who really possessed the attributes that showcase our proud Hispanic heritage," said Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba but fled the country with her parents in 1960. "This sad and unnecessary episode encompasses all that is wrong with this Administration: Their priorities are backwards and their allegiances border on the fringe of society with a leftist fanatical slant that is worrisome and not descriptive of our great nation." Is it fair game for the Romney campaign to pin the email on "Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency"? Yes and no, experts told us. Even though it came from that agency during Obama’s tenure, the ad makes it sound like an official policy message, when really it was the unapproved work of one employee farther down the food chain. "The fact is that individuals are free to make choices about what they do while on the job, and that includes individuals that work in the government," said Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a University of Nebraska at Omaha political science professor who specializes in Cuba policy. Our ruling Romney’s ad said, "Obama's Environmental Protection Agency sent emails for Hispanic Heritage Month with a photo of Che Guevara." The claim is partially accurate. Yes, an email from the EPA under Obama’s tenure marked the start of Hispanic Heritage Month with a picture of Che Guevara. But the message did not go through official clearance, and it was quickly retracted. That makes the assertion that "Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency" is responsible a little dubious. We rate it Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-11-02T16:24:41	2012-10-30	['Che_Guevara', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-04742	Barack Obama has "never even worked in business."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/rob-portman/gop-convention-rob-portman-says-barack-obama-never/	When Barack Obama was seeking the presidency in 2008, Republicans frequently derided his career experience, saying it was limited to a scant four years in the U.S. Senate, some time in the Illinois Senate, and having been a "community organizer" in Chicago. The GOP has often returned to that theme, asserting that Obama doesn’t have the business savvy and private-sector experience to lead the country out of the economic doldrums. And it has reached a fever pitch with a Republican National Convention dominated by criticism of Obama’s comment that business people "didn’t build" their businesses. (We’ve checked that contentious comment here.) During his speech to delegates in Tampa, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- widely considered a finalist for the vice presidential slot eventually given to Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan -- brought up Obama’s career history again. He contrasted Obama’s work experiences with those of GOP nominee Mitt Romney, whose work has primarily been as a business executive. "Then you have Barack Obama, who never started a business--never even worked in business," Portman said. Obama’s work experience, or lack thereof, is well-plowed ground. So we thought we'd explore whether the president has ever worked in a business. (We interpreted Portman’s statement to mean that Obama had never worked in a private, profit-making enterprise.) As PolitiFact first noted two years ago, the president does, in fact, have some experience in business. In 1983 and 1984, he had a stint as a research assistant at Business International Corp. in New York City, where he helped write a newsletter. From 1993 to 2004, he was an associate, and then a partner, at the Chicago law firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, where his work included employment-discrimination and voting-rights cases. (The job also overlapped with his time in the Illinois Legislature.) If you count the best-selling books that have brought Obama millions of dollars in royalties, he also knows something about entrepreneurship. Our rating Clearly, Obama has had less experience in the private sector than Romney; before he became president, he spent most of his working life either in the non-profit sector or in politics. However, Portman went too far when he said that Obama has "never even worked in business." We rate the statement False.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2012-08-29T21:28:47	2012-08-29	['None']
pomt-13987	"Crime is rising."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-crime-rising-its-not-and-hasnt-b/	After big primaries in California and New Jersey on June 7, Donald Trump -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee -- painted a picture of a nation in crisis. "Hard to imagine what's happened to our country," Trump said. "America is being taken apart piece by piece … just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder. We're broke. We're broke. (Our debt is) $19 trillion, going quickly to $21 trillion. Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our schools are failing. Crime is rising. People are scared. The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster." Critics will take issue with some of those assertions, such as the idea that the United States is "broke" -- something we’ve rated False previously. But the line from Trump’s remarks that leapt out at us was this one: "Crime is rising." Our previous research has shown that’s not so. So we took a closer look. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) We looked at two broad categories of crime -- violent crime and property crime -- that are frequently cited by experts as catch-all categories. Violent crimes include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, while property crimes include burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft. We turned to FBI data. Such data is submitted voluntarily by local law enforcement agencies, and thus is not perfectly comprehensive. But it is one of two data sets that is generally considered the best available for answering this question. First, we looked at the trend for violent crime and found that it has been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. The data below shows violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data is available. Next, we looked at property crime data. It showed the same pattern: We also looked at the other widely used data set -- the National Crime Victimization Survey, collected by the Justice Department. Here, the trend looks quite similar: Finally, we asked two criminologists to make sure we weren’t missing something. As it happens, James Alan Fox, the interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, was watching Trump’s speech and noticed the comment as well. "He is incorrect," Fox said. "There are some spikes in homicide and shootings in certain cities, yet other cities continue to experience low rates. As a nation, we are far better off than anytime for the past several decades. Crime rates are low, and there is no consistent and reliable indication that things are getting worse." "Mr. Trump is wrong if he is talking about overall crime and even violent crime," agreed University of Maryland criminologist Raymond Paternoster. Any possible upward swing in the past year or so wouldn’t show up in the data currently available, he said. Our ruling Speaking generally about the state of the country, Trump said, "Crime is rising." If you look at overall violent and property crimes -- the only categories that would seem inclusive enough to qualify as "crime," as Trump put it -- he is flat wrong. In fact, crime rates have been falling almost without fail for roughly a quarter-century. We rate his claim Pants on Fire. UPDATE, July 5, 2016: After we published our article, the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, published a blog post critiquing our analysis. The post cited preliminary figures for 2015 that show crime rising. Our fact-check acknowledged the point made in the post, although this data is preliminary and subject to revision. Two criminologists we checked with before publication warned us that such data may not be indicative of a real trend. In addition, while the preliminary data shows spikes in crime rates in some cities, Trump’s statement was broad, without qualifiers, and it came amid comments that painted an overarching image of a nation in decline. Trump didn’t say that crime was rising "recently" or "in recent months" or "over the past year" or "in some places." Ultimately, we find that Trump’s sweeping rhetoric about a nation in decline and beset by crime ignores the overall trend of violent and property crime rates over the past 25 years, which is that they have fallen, consistently and significantly. We stand by our rating of Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e5c3910-a384-4b3e-8872-742cd9e7c9d5	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-09T11:31:02	2016-06-07	['None']
pomt-01355	"This year," the Austin City Council "granted a small homestead" property tax "exemption of $5,000... applied equally to everyone. And we also granted an exemption for the elderly and the disabled members of the community."	/texas/statements/2014/oct/21/sheryl-cole/austin-mayoral-hopeful-sheryl-cole-says-year-we-gr/	Mayoral candidate Sheryl Cole said at the mid-October "Ballot Boxing" candidate forum that city leaders have acted to soften the bite of property taxes for homeowners. Cole, an Austin City Council member and the mayor pro tem, responded to a reporter's question about what each hopeful would do to change how much residents affected by rising property values pay in property taxes. After saying the Austin school district levies Travis County’s highest property tax rate and also noting her interest in fighting "disportionate" appraisals of commercial and residential properties, Cole said: "This year, we also granted a small homestead exemption of $5,000, which was a flat amount and it wasn’t on a percentage basis, so it applied equally to everyone. And," Cole said, "we also granted an exemption for the elderly and the disabled members of the community. I think it’s important that we continue to address this," she closed. There’d already been talk of property tax exemptions, which reduce the taxable value of a home, in advance of the November elections giving voters a chance to choose a new Austin mayor and fill 10 council seat being fielded for the first time from single-member districts. In August 2014, mayoral candidate Steve Adler called for an across-the-board 20 percent homestead exemption, cutting a typical homeowner’s city tax bill by $189. About three weeks later, an Austin American-Statesman news story described Cole and another mayoral aspirant, Council Member Mike Martinez, as supporters of a proposal by Council Member Kathie Tovo to create a $5,000 homestead exemption, reducing the city tax bill of a median-valued home by $24. So, is Cole right about the council granting the described exemptions? A council resolution According to the Statesman news story posted online Aug. 26, 2014, Tovo’s proposed $5,000 exemption would apply to about 130,000 owner-occupied homes. Later the same week, the council approved a resolution, which we read on the city’s website, directing the city manager to return to the council no later than Dec. 1, 2014, with a percentage-based proposal resulting in a $5,000 a year exemption for each residential homeowner. The resolution noted, too, that under state law, if a city grants such an exemption, it must be for at least $5,000. The resolution also said the exemption would cost the city $3.1 million a year in forgone revenue. A city spokeswoman, Melissa Alvarado, told us by email city staff are preparing the ordinance to bring before the council for approval. Asked if the exemption could possibly apply to property taxes due for 2014, Alvarado indicated not, noting that state law requires such an exemption to be adopted by a governing body before July of the first affected tax year. Alvarado said: "The $5,000 exemption, if adopted, would first affect property tax bills associated with FY 2015-16 (i.e. property tax bills due in January of 2016)." Expanded exemption The council acted earlier in 2014 to increase an exemption benefiting elderly and disabled homeowners. On March 20, 2014, according to an American-Statesman news story, the council by 5-2 voted to raise the property tax exemption for homeowners older than 65 or disabled, from $51,000 to $70,000 -- saving the typical elderly homeowner about $100 a year starting with the 2014 tax year. The city’s tax exemption for senior or disabled homeowners was established, at $3,000, in 1974, the story said, and had been last increased, to $51,000, in 1986. About 34,000 properties in Austin receive the tax break, the story said, causing the city to miss out on about $8 million in annual revenue. Cole's campaign To our queries, Cole’s campaign manager, Kevin Opp, emailed that Cole should have said the elderly/disabled exemption had been expanded rather than granted. But Opp maintained the August resolution calling for city officials to draft an ordinance for the $5,000 exemption was tantamount to adopting the exemption. Cole "took action on the Council this year, and it will go into effect at the earliest possible date for the next property tax bill," Opp wrote. Our ruling Cole, speaking of the Austin City Council, said this year, "we granted a small homestead exemption of $5,000... applied equally to everyone. And we also granted an exemption for the elderly and the disabled members of the community." Both parts of this claim are stretches. That is, a $5,000 homestead exemption might be adopted by the council later this year or in 2015, but it hasn’t been granted or applied to anyone already. And while the council in 2014 increased the homestead exemption for the elderly and disabled, that benefit originated in the 1970s. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-05844	"Many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/15/john-wisniewski/many-high-ranking-port-authority-officials-earn-la/	New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are earning close to $180,000 annually in their roles as chief executive, but most of the highest-ranking officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are doing even better. As the Port Authority’s finances come under greater scrutiny, New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) pointed out in a recent radio interview how many of the top agency officials are earning larger salaries than the two governors charged with overseeing their operations. "Clearly, the Port Authority is needed, because to coordinate bi-state transportation, you can’t be continually going back and forth between two cities and two states and multiple jurisdictions," Wisniewski told host John Gambling on WOR-AM. "But the Port Authority’s grown beyond its original mission. It’s now a real estate empire in addition to everything else." Wisniewski, also chairman of the state Democratic Party, went on: "It’s become so large. Many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them." Could many top agency officials really be taking home more money than Christie and Cuomo? That’s right, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Based on the latest data released by the Port Authority, 11 of the 12 highest-ranking agency officials earn larger annual salaries than Christie and Cuomo. Let’s start with the governors’ paychecks. Christie is earning an annual salary of $175,000, according to Bill Quinn, spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury. In New York, Cuomo receives slightly more, earning $179,000 per year, said Morris Peters, spokesman for the New York State Division of the Budget. But Cuomo reimbursed the state for five percent of his 2011 salary, Peters said. Now, let’s turn to the Port Authority officials. In December, the transportation agency posted information on its website about annual salaries and other earnings for all of its more than 6,000 employees. To evaluate Wisniewski’s claim, we looked at annual salaries for the top 12 positions listed on the agency’s organization chart. Here’s how the salaries for those positions break down, as of Nov. 30: Title Person Annual Salary Executive Director Patrick Foye $289,667 Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni $289,667 General Counsel Darrell Buchbinder $276,926 Chief Administrative Officer Louis LaCapra $251,758 Chief Operating Officer Ernesto Butcher $251,758 Chief of Capital Planning David Tweedy $251,758 Chief Financial Officer Michael Fabiano $240,032 Chief of Real Estate & Development Michael Francois $236,340 Chief Engineer Peter Zipf $219,050 Inspector General Robert Van Etten $208,468 Secretary Karen Eastman $198,328 Chief of Public & Government Affairs Jamie Loftus $165,022 So, of the 12 "top officials" at the Port Authority, 11 of them were getting larger paychecks than Christie and Cuomo. Those figures back up Wisniewski’s statement, but it’s worth noting that even Port Authority workers at lower points in the pecking order earned more in salary and additional pay last year than the two governors' annual salaries. For example, 65 police officers earned more than $200,000 in salary and additional pay, according to a Star-Ledger analysis. Our ruling In a radio interview, Wisniewski claimed, "Many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them." The assemblyman’s comments are on the money, according to data released by the Port Authority in December. Christie and Cuomo earn $175,000 and $179,000, respectively, earning less than 11 of the 12 highest-ranked Port Authority officials. We rate the statement True.

pomt-15151	"I'm the only (Republican) candidate that has actually reduced the size of government."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/30/bobby-jindal/bobby-jindal-im-only-candidate-has-actually-reduce/	Fresh from marking the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal says he thinks the political storm caused by Donald Trump will die down after the weather cools off. Jindal, who’s No. 14 in the latest polls, said on ABC’s This Week that while Trump "has done a great job tapping into the anger, the frustration that voters feel," there’s only one candidate with true conservative bona fides: himself. "I think after we get past this summer of silliness and insults, the voters are going to begin to look at who is prepared to do the job," he said on Aug. 30. "Right now the American people are saying we've got to shrink the size of the government, grow the American economy. I'm the only candidate — there are not two — I'm the only candidate that has actually reduced the size of government, and I think that experience matters." We were curious about Jindal’s claim that he’s the only candidate out of 17, including 8 former or current governors, who’s walked the fiscal conservative walk. The answer is, it depends on the analysis. Jindal’s evidence On his website, Jindal makes a more specific version of the claim: Jindal is "the only candidate to actually cut spending." To back up the claim, he cites a report by libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. (A spokesperson for Jindal confirmed that this is what he was referring to on ABC.) According to Cato, Jindal is indeed the only governor out of the eight running to have cut spending. During his seven-year tenure as Louisiana's chief, Jindal reduced spending by an average of 1.76 percent every year. Every other governor increased spending. Here’s a graph that details this: Jindal’s chart doesn’t factor in the size of the states, which Cato says is important. When adjusted for population, Jindal’s numbers actually come out looking better: 2.41 percent per capita in cuts every year. "Bobby Jindal shows the most fiscal restraint," the report concludes. (Much of the reduction, reported the Times-Picayune in 2011, is "explained by waning hurricane recovery appropriations and the end of federal stimulus aid.") However, the Cato report is just one way, and something of a simplistic way, to look at the state budget picture. It fails to consider the different per capita income levels across different states (higher incomes bring more government services and thus spending), different approaches to handling federal money (Ohio Gov. John Kasich, for example, took the Medicaid expansion while Jindal did not), and different time periods, lists Alan Auerbach, a professor of public finance at the University of California at Berkeley. Unlike Jindal and other sitting governors, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee and George Pataki weren’t leading their states through economic downturns. Auerbach explains: "During recessions, balanced-budget requirements have typically forced states to cut spending, in addition to legislating tax increases." Kasich himself takes issue with Cato’s analysis, arguing that Cato focused on a specific pool of money known as the general revenue fund. Kasich prefers instead to look at the all-funds budget, a much larger pot of federal and state money. (Cato’s response: "Our data is correct, and so is his. Kasich seems to pick the dataset that shed the best light on him.") Chris Edwards, Cato’s director of tax policy, argued that the general fund data is more recent and perhaps more relevant than the all-funds. "Governors have more direct control over the general fund budget," he said. "A lot of the non-general fund budget comes from the federal government, which governors don’t have much control over." Another way to run the numbers Others have looked at this question and come up with different results. If we look at all-funds and adjust for the time differences, four governors actually out-cut Jindal, according to a fact-check by Fox News, which compared each governor’s budgets to their contemporaries (in other words, how Bush stacked up against other governors in the 2000s, and how Jindal is doing compared to sitting governors). The two top spenders by Cato’s count, Bush and Kasich, actually ranked best in Fox News’ analysis. Bush and Kasich slashed spending by 3.66 percent and 1.76 percent respectively. Jindal, meanwhile, came in at No. 5 on the Fox News analysis, with an average reduction of 0.25 percent per year. Here’s Fox’s breakdown: This is still an imperfect way of comparing the budget records of the various governors, but to an extent, it’s fairer, Auerbach said. "Controlling for what other states did at the same time certainly is better than not controlling for time period," he said. "One might do better still by controlling for relative economic conditions in the different states but … the controls are reasonable." Our ruling Jindal said, "I’m the only candidate that has actually reduced the size of government." He was talking about the cuts in spending. To his credit, a Cato report backs his claim. However, there’s more than one way of looking at spending cuts. One other approach that an expert said is valid suggests that Jindal was out-cut by four other governors. Jindal’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Bobby Jindal	None	None	None	2015-08-30T16:34:07	2015-08-30	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-12136	Emails show Democrats, Hillary Clinton and George Soros instigated and orchestrated racial protests in Charlottesville by trying to "control" and keep people "desperate."	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/alex-jones/infowars-alex-jones-falsely-says-george-soros-hill/	Alex Jones, a conspiracy-minded conservative commentator, said the Charlottesville, Va., protests and counter-protests on Aug. 11-12, were staged acts of civil unrest funded by liberal interests to hurt conservatives and President Donald Trump. In a pair of videos posted on his website Infowars.com, Jones accused the Southern Poverty Law Center of going to "central casting" to hire actors to "dress up as white supremacists." There is no evidence that is true, and Jones provided no evidence to support his claim in his video. Jones then claimed the foundation for the Charlottesville protests is seen in emails between the Democratic Party and George Soros, a billionaire who often supports liberal causes. "It was clear once Trump got inaugurated, they were going to go for civil unrest," Jones said. "If you go back to the Wikileaks, from over a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public. Minorities are getting into the free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother’s basement as baristas.’ "Remember even Hillary said that. ‘What are we going to do to keep control of them? Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.’ "These are quotes. Hundreds and hundreds of emails," Jones said." We’ve covered them … linking to them." While Jones offered no evidence the Charlottesville protests were staged, he did say there are quotes from Soros, Clinton or Democratic Party officials in emails talking about controlling minorities and stoking fear in the public to "keep them desperate" and "keep control of them." So we decided to see if there is any evidence of that. We couldn’t find any. (We reached out to Jones through the media contact form on his Infowars.com website and did not hear back.) For this fact-check, we consulted three email batches Jones could be talking about -- the emails Hillary Clinton made public during her time as secretary of state (search the government database), the leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta (search the Podesta emails), or the leaked emails of the Democratic National Committee (search the DNC email database). The George Soros connection Jones claimed the "Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public. Minorities are getting into the free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother’s basement as baristas.’" There are 15 emails in the DNC email database that mention the word "Soros," and five of those come from Politico email newsletters. Of the remaining 10, five reference news coverage and one is text of a speech from Trump referencing Soros ("Forget Soros, leave him alone, he’s got enough problems.") The other four are from May 22, 2016, and discuss a mobile application someone was building to support the Democratic nominee. The developer of the application was looking for funding for the project, including from Soros. We also searched under Soros’ Open Society Foundation or OSF. We found four additional emails, the most interesting of which appears to be a communications officer for OSF trying to schedule a tour of the White House. We did find an email, which Infowars has written about, that Soros sent to Clinton while she was secretary of state (see the email). The 2011 email is about unrest in Albania, which included a series of anti-government protests amid corruption charges. In the email, Soros asks Clinton to bring "the full weight of the international community" to try and ease tensions in the country. Soros writes that he is particularly concerned of the actions of Albania’s prime minister and that Soros has heard of videotape showing national guard members firing on demonstrators. Infowars also has written about a 2014 email from Podesta’s account in which Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Clinton would only attend a fundraiser for a Soros-supported group, America Votes, "to make Soros happy." The most recent emails leaked from Podesta’s account are from March 2016, and seem to be related to a meeting between Soros and Podesta. "In general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se, though I can’t imagine you won’t spend some time on politics," Soros aide Michael Vachon wrote (read the email). "In a separate email I will send you George’s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine. Both the migration crisis and Ukraine are part of his view of Europe as falling apart, and the US as ultimately not doing enough to prevent the political disintegration of its most important ally." Here’s the bottom line: Whatever the emails say about Soros’ access to top Democrats, including Clinton, they don’t say anything akin to what Jones claimed. The Hillary Clinton connection It’s a bit easier to triangulate what Jones was talking about when he said, "Remember even Hillary said that. ‘What are we going to do to keep control of them. Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.’ " He’s likely referring to leaked audio of a February 2016 Clinton fundraiser in which Clinton was talking about the supporters of Bernie Sanders. Infowars wrote about this, too. Here is what Clinton said (bold emphasis is ours): Clinton: "Some are new to politics completely. They’re children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents’ basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don’t see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said, "You know, none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don’t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance." So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you’re feeling like you’re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn’t pay a lot, and doesn’t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be, you know, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic. We want them to set big goals. But to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals." You can listen to the comments here, courtesy of the Intercept, but you can see how Jones distorts Clinton’s comments. Jones said Democrats wanted to keep "people in their mother’s basement as baristas," to "control them," "keep them desperate." But Clinton was talking about people new to politics who grew up at a time when opportunities were difficult to find. She never once discussed controlling or keeping people desperate. Clinton did face criticism for describing Sanders supporters as people living in their parents’ basement, but that’s not what Jones was saying. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Jones said, "if you go back to the Wikileaks, from over a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public. Minorities are getting into free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother’s basement as baristas.’ "Remember even Hillary said that. ‘What are we going to do to keep control of them? Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.’ Jones' comments were part of a broader accusation that the events in Charlottesville were staged by liberals and coordinated by top Democrats. We can find no evidence that Jones’ broad attack, or his specific claim about comments made by Soros, Clinton or Democrats in emails, checks out. Clinton did describe supporters of Bernie Sanders as working as baristas or living in their parents’ basements. But that’s well short of what Jones alleged. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05799	Says "80 percent of the health care dollars are spent by 20 percent of the population."	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/23/alan-bates/does-20-percent-population-really-use-80-health-ca/	Health care debates are always fertile ground for fact-checkable claims. A recent debate on the Oregon Senate floor over the state’s reform plans was no different. During the debate, Sen. Alan Bates was trying to argue the point that the state’s health care system needs to focus on the folks who are highest cost and better integrate their care. A small portion of folks use the most resources, he said, so better organization, more working together, should make a dent in overall costs. "We spend twice as much money per person in the U.S. than any industrialized country in the world and yet we have the worst outcomes," he said. "Our health care system is literally awash in dollars." Same old, same old. But then he said something that really caught our attention: "Eighty percent of the health care dollars are spent by 20 percent of the population." We remembered this 80-20 rule from economics class. Quite a few things are said to split that way. Business owners, for instance, sometimes say that just 20 percent of their clientele account for 80 percent of their sales. But we hadn’t heard the rule applied to health care -- and, honestly, we weren’t even sure the "rule" held up to scrutiny. So we gave Bates’ office a call. An aide there said that the 80-20 split was general knowledge, and that the senator heard it recently from the director of the Oregon Health Authority. That led us to OHA spokeswoman Karynn Fish, who pointed us to two sources. The first was an Oregonian article by Bill Graves that was about this topic exactly: high-cost patients. In his story, Graves notes that at CareOregon, a Portland managed care organization for Oregon Health Plan, about 25 percent of the adult patients accounted for 83 percent of the spending in 2011. That number seemed to reflect the same general principle Bates had mentioned during the floor session. Debra Read, a senior evaluation associate with CareOregon, said the figure was fairly standard across the board when it comes to health care -- though she couldn’t say whether it also applied to children. "That’s well supported, not just in our data." The reason for the high cost of a few, she said, comes down to hospital visits, where most people wind up when they’re managing a chronic condition or they’re in the last stages of a terminal illness. "When you look at health care costs overall, the hospital is the thing that costs the most, vastly costs the most. … So it’s basically driven by hospital costs. The sicker you are, the more likely you are to go to the hospital." The second source that Fish gave us was a chart from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. That chart showed exactly what Bates said: Twenty percent of the population accounts for 80 percent of total expenditures. Maybe even more shockingly, the chart also shows that just 5 percent of the population accounts for 50 percent of all expenditures. The agency cited several studies for the chart, with publication dates running from 2002 through 2006. To get a more current take on the situation, we phoned Stephanie Bernell, a professor with Oregon State University’s Health Management and Policy Program who specializes in the economics of health care. She said the 80-20 split was "a very reasonable thing for somebody to say." She cited a fuller report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that further explored the way in which a minority of Americans account for the largest bulk of spending. Bernell said she was even more interested in whittling down that 20 percent, noting again that just 5 percent account for 49 percent of health care expenses. "I think the stories are more interesting when you get into who’s in that 20 percent, " she said. People consume the most health care at the beginning and the end of life, she said. Births are expensive and so is the latter part of life when "chronic conditions start to creep up." That brings us to our ruling. Bates said that 20 percent of the population accounts for 80 percent of the health care dollars spent. His claim is backed up by two studies from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. That data is a little old, but newer numbers from CareOregon show the same split and a professor who studies the issue also confirmed the senator’s claim. We give this statement a True.

pomt-14658	The United States has a "record number of abortions year after year after year."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/20/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-incorrect-us-has-record-number-abort/	Carly Fiorina may be a former CEO, but her campaign hasn’t been all about business and economics. Fiorina has made abortion one of her top issues, most notably referencing a controversial anti-abortion video during a Republican debate. (We rated her claim on the video Mostly False.) On Jan. 20, 2016, at an Iowa Right to Life event in Des Moines, she cited a statistic sure to trouble her audience, among others. "I think we're being told to settle for a nation where record numbers of men are out of work, record numbers of women are living in poverty," Fiorina said. "We have record number of abortions year after year after year." Here, we’ll look at her claim that the United States has a "record number of abortions year after year after year." There are two data sets for tracking abortions over the long term. One is compiled by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the other is compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. The data from the CDC is current through 2012, while the Guttmacher data -- which includes information for a few states not captured in the CDC data -- is current through 2011. Both groups’ data show the same general pattern -- a small but steady decline in abortion since the early 1980s. In plain figures, there were 1.6 million recorded abortions in 1990 compared to a little over 1 million in 2011. This chart, using CDC data, shows the declines between 2003 and 2012 in the raw numbers of abortions (the solid line), the abortion rate (the number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44), and the abortion ratio (the number of abortions per 1,000 live births). The Guttmacher data shows a similar trend. Here’s the decline in the abortion rate and the abortion ratio going back to 1973, when the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationally in the case Roe vs. Wade. It’s worth noting that this second pair of charts doesn’t come from an abortion-rights advocacy group. It was disseminated by the National Right to Life Coalition. "After reaching a high of over 1.6 million in 1990, the number of abortions performed annually in the U.S. (has) dropped to around 1.06 million a year," the National Right to Life Coalition wrote in its fact sheet, adding, "By 2011, the (abortion) rate had dropped to 16.9, nearly half the peak rate, meaning abortion was a significantly less common feature in women’s lives in 2011 than it was in 1980." And Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, told PolitiFact that "we have no reason to believe that the long-term decline has reversed itself in recent years." We should note that even though the abortion rate has decreased, the annual number of abortions is still significant -- 1,058,500 in 2011, according to Guttmacher, the higher of the two estimates. Still, Fiorina’s claim -- that the United States has a "record number of abortions year after year after year" -- is flat wrong. Our ruling Fiorina said the United States has a "record number of abortions year after year after year." In reality, the raw number, the rate and the ratio of abortions compared to live births has been falling since the early 1980s, and the decline shows no signs of stopping. We rate Fiorina’s statement False.	None	Carly Fiorina	None	None	None	2016-01-20T17:55:27	2016-01-20	['United_States']
pomt-04531	"In every state, women are paid less than men."	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/01/national-womens-law-center/there-gender-wage-gap-every-state/	Women: You’ve come a long way, but still have a ways to go, according to the National Women’s Law Center. The NWLC revisited the gender wage gap debate last month, citing recently released federal statistics showing the difference between the earnings of men and women in the United States. Using the data, the organization devised a state-by-state ranking of women’s median earnings compared with men’s. "In every state, women are paid less than men," the NWLC said in a Sept. 21 news release about its analysis. The liberal-leaning advocacy organization for women’s issues also cited the national gender wage gap showing that women are paid 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. The organization’s leaders are using the analysis to push Congress to enact the Paycheck Fairness Act to address the disparity. That legislation -- sponsored by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and supported by the Obama administration -- is intended to strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963: proposed guidelines to show employers how to evaluate jobs with a goal of eliminating inequities. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives in January 2009 but failed twice in the Senate, in November 2010 and in June 2012. The gender wage gap issue has been studied for years and has been targeted through legislation including the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Still, the NWLC statement about all 50 states seemed broad. Was there the possibility that in at least one state the wage gap either didn’t exist or favored women? And what factors were considered to determine the gap? The two most common sources for this type of gender wage data are the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. NWLC used data from the Census Bureau’s 2011 American Community Survey, released last month, to calculate wage gaps in each of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Using the Community Survey’s statistics, the NWLC calculated the wage gap for each state as the ratio of female and male median earnings for full-time, year-round workers. (The Community Survey classified full-time, year-round workers as those being 16 years old and over and who usually worked 35 hours or more per week.) The wage gaps are presented as the number of cents women are paid for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. Using this methodology, the organization’s statement is accurate. For example, Georgia ranked 13th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., in order of the highest wage gaps by jurisdiction. In Georgia, the wage gap was 80.7 percent, meaning that for every dollar a man earned, women earned just under 81 cents. Georgia males earned $43,902 and women earned $35,438 annually, a difference of $8,464. In that ranking, Washington, D.C., fared the best, with women making about 90 cents for every dollar men make. In Wyoming, where the wage gap was the largest, women earned 66.6 cents for each dollar earned by men. The NWLC analysis also includes the often-used statistic that the national gender wage gap is 77 percent, or more clearly: For every dollar a man earns, a woman earns 77 cents. The national wage gap calculated by the organization is based on census data that tracks full-time, year-round worker wages regardless of occupation. PolitiFact has examined wage disparity claims with varying outcomes. Supporters of wage gap legislation typically cite the 77-cent figure without clarifying that the gap does not take into account other factors that could influence the figure, including occupation, employment longevity and education. The census data shows the widest gap, but other data, including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example, yields smaller differences. Using BLS data, women are paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men. So, does the NWLC’s claim hold up? Based on Census Bureau data, it does appear that women are paid less than men in every state and Washington, D.C. In considering other data and influences, the wage disparity amount, specifically the national wage gap, is smaller, but still exists. We rate it True.

pomt-15223	"I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001."	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/aug/07/chris-christie/christie-says-he-was-appointed-be-us-attorney-day-/	New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wanted everyone at the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 cycle to know that he has experience prosecuting terrorists. When debate moderator Megyn Kelly asked him about Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's position on the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' phone records, he immediately invoked the worst terrorist attack on American soil in the country's history. "I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state," he said. He said that meant he had unique experience as "the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the PATRIOT Act" as well as having "prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after Sept. 11." His comment started a back-and-forth with Paul, who spent more than 10 hours on the Senate floor in May protesting the PATRIOT Act. Christie characterized Paul’s experience as: "sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this...." Christie’s line about becoming the U.S attorney for New Jersey the day before 9/11 is similar to statements he’s made while campaigning in New Hampshire. We wondered: Is it true? A few of our PolitiFact readers were quick to point out a report published in the New York Times on Dec. 8, 2001, which said that on the day before – nearly four months after the terrorist attacks – President George Bush announced he would nominate Christie as the next U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The article notes, however, that the nomination had been "expected for months." Others pointed to a White House press release dated Dec. 7, 2001, saying the president "intends to nominate" Christie as the next U.S. attorney for New Jersey. That doesn’t appear to jibe with Christie’s claim that he was "appointed" on Sept. 10. We contacted Christie’s campaign in New Hampshire for clarification. A spokeswoman for Christie, Samantha Smith, wrote in an email Friday that Christie received a phone call on Sept. 10, 2001, from Attorney General John Ashcroft that set in motion a months-long hiring process. "The point he was making was on Sept. 10 he accepted the job," Smith said in a phone interview. Smith pointed to an article in New Jersey's Star-Ledger newspaper from Sept. 11, 2001, which read: "President Bush nominated former Morris County freeholder Christopher Christie as the state's next U.S. attorney yesterday." It continues: "...the White House notified Christie that he is the President's choice and that extensive background checks on his qualifications would begin immediately." The story, written by Kate Coscarelli and Robert Cohen, estimated that those checks would take "up to six weeks, after which the formal nomination would be put forth to the Senate." Christie was officially confirmed by the U.S. senate on Dec. 20, 2001, and sworn into office on Jan. 17, 2002. Christie unequivocally stated twice that he was appointed on Sept. 10. Given free rein to choose his closing remarks, he circled back to the same story. "I was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail," he said. As Christie stood on stage, he gave the impression that he took the job as U.S. attorney the day before the terrorist attacks and then he "prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after Sept. 11." However, the word "appoint" has more than one meaning. Merriam-Webster says the word can mean "to fix or set officially," or "to name officially." Other definitions use verbs like "assign" and "choose." If that’s your interpretation, then Christie is closer to correct. In any case, the impression Christie left with the debate’s viewers was that he was in charge of prosecuting and investigating terrorists immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks. That’s misleading. Christie’s spokeswoman insisted that his point stood: The world was a different place after 9/11, and in that new world, Christie navigated the laws and brought terrorists to justice. Our ruling Christie said, "I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state." Christie said he received a phone call on Sept. 10, 2001, that began the process of his appointment as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey. However, he wasn’t nominated until months later, and he was sworn into the position until the following year. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4773c653-58b6-4f55-8158-c8b3e83ab0db	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2015-08-07T19:40:13	2015-08-06	['United_States', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-03646	Says that in 2007, "Oregon ranked 25th -- or 7th from the bottom -- in percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data."	/oregon/statements/2013/may/02/oregon-health-authority/did-oregon-rank-no-25-32-states-untreated-decay-20/	Last week, PolitiFact Oregon heard an earful from fluoride opponents upset with our ruling on their claim that Multnomah County has the 15th lowest cavity rate in the country, as the county hovered at roughly the same percentage as the state of New York. We ruled the statement False because county data is not comparable to state data. Plus, we found that New York didn’t really rank 15th lowest because the cavity numbers posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were from varying years and, consequently, can’t be ranked. Accurate dental health statistics are critical because Portland residents will vote May 21, 2013, on whether to add fluoride to the city’s drinking water. For that fact check, we spoke with Shanie Mason, oral health program manager for the state agency that published the "Smile Survey" in 2002 and in 2007. Her office released a draft of the 2012 version last week at the request of The Oregonian. At the time, she cautioned against such comparisons and said, "We have only compared ourselves against neighboring states with a similar methodology." So imagine our surprise when we read this statement in the 2012 draft report: "In 2007, Oregon scored worse in every major measure of oral health for children compared to 2002. At that time, Oregon ranked 25th – or 7th from the bottom – in percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data." It’s accurate to say that Oregon measured worse in 2007 when compared to itself in 2002. However, the "ranked" numbers looked very much like the numbers erroneously relied on by anti-fluoride campaign Clean Water Portland -- which Mason cautioned against comparing -- when it made its claim about New York and Multnomah County. The CDC posts the percentage of third-graders with "untreated decay." But a spokeswoman for the CDC says the statistics are not meant to be "ranked" because they cover different time periods, with some as dated as 1999. The states have different response rates and vary in the percentage of children who qualify for free and reduced-price meals, she said. "There are many caveats in looking at these data across states," wrote Linda S. Orgain in yet another email to PolitiFact Oregon. "These issues make ranking the states on these children's indicators less meaningful and probably not accurate. We would not recommend doing that." We returned to the Oregon Health Authority for a response. Bruce Gutelius, who is presenting the 2012 survey, said in a reply email they wanted to provide context for Oregon’s numbers. He said they had other options -- for example, sticking with 2002 and 2007 Oregon figures, or measuring Oregon against a national figure from 1999-2004 -- but decided that a ranking "was the most meaningful to provide the needed context." We do not see how declaring Oregon No. 25 based on a list of percentages from other states and other years provides meaningful or accurate context. The percentage of third-graders in Oregon who showed evidence of untreated decay in 2006-07 was 35.4. Vermont was at 16.2 percent in 2002-03 and Arkansas was at 42.1 percent in 2001-02. The Smile Survey released last week contains numbers for children ages 6 to 9 -- so we’re talking largely kids in first, second and third grades. This is slightly different from the numbers reflected on the CDC website. In 2011-12, the percentage of children in this group who showed evidence of untreated tooth decay was 20 percent. In 2007 it was 36 percent. That’s a sizable decrease. This week, the Oregon Health Authority also shared statistics for 43 states, including numbers not yet posted to the CDC website. More than 21 percent of third-graders in Oregon and in Alabama have untreated decay for 2011-13. Oregon is in the middle of the pack if you look just at the percentages for the 43 states -- but again, we don’t know how some of the older numbers have shifted since then. We want the state to make recommendations on public health, even if controversial. The Oregon Health Authority has no official position on the city water measure, although public health officials there clearly favor fluoridating water. But we don’t think this was the most responsible way to put perspective on Oregon’s untreated decay percentages. The agency could have run in its 2007 report all the percentages for the 32 states, clearly citing the years and without designating a ranking. In its 2012 report, writers should have deleted the phrase: "Oregon ranked 25th – or 7th from the bottom." The statement is False.

pomt-05413	U.S. Rep. Allen West wants to bring back earmarks.	/florida/statements/2012/may/02/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-allen-west-earmarks/	You’ve probably heard of the earmark to build the bridge to nowhere in Alaska. But what about tariff breaks for those who make snow globes? Or yard ornaments depicting school mascots? Or men’s shoes? Not just any shoes, but to be precise: "certain men's footwear covering the ankle, the height of which from the bottom of the outer sole to the top of the upper exceeds 19 cm, with waterproof molded soles, valued at more than $30 per pair.’’ Those are all items that lawmakers in Washington sought to designate as worthy of a tariff break for companies in 2009-2010. U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Plantation, was one of 65 freshmen Republicans who signed an April 20 letter calling for support of the "miscellaneous tariff bill’’ which would reward these breaks. (Other Florida members who signed included Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami, and Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Panama City.) After POLITICO wrote about the tariffs and their similarity to earmarks, which are currently banned, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blasted out an email: "According to Politico, Representative Allen West (FL-22) has been caught ‘begging’ Republican leaders to bring back earmarks. West signed a letter in support of earmarks ‘even though it runs counter to the earmark ban Republicans campaigned on in 2010 and instituted when they took power.' " Does West calling for the tariff breaks mean he wants to bring back earmarks? What’s a miscellaneous tariff bill? To begin at the beginning: American companies import materials to make everything from umbrellas to medicines to pianos. The importers of these raw materials have to pay federal tariffs. And every year, hundreds of American companies, often with the help of lobbyists, ask members of Congress to suspend those tariffs. Supporters say waivers allow them to keep prices lower and employ more Americans. Members introduce the requests as individual bills, which go through committees and then are vetted by the International Trade Commission and other agencies. The bills must meet certain criteria, including a limit on the loss of tariff revenue to under $500,000 per year. (The Washington Post found that lawmakers circumvent that dollar limit by filing multiple bills. In 2005, a Massachusetts representative filed six different bills changing the wording slightly to cover leather basketballs, rubber basketballs, etc.) The International Trade Commission posts the requests with explanations of the products. For example, here's an explanation about those snow globes, requested by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., on behalf of a company in Missoula: "A snow globe is filled with plastic flakes (or metallic glitter) in an aqueous liquid. ... Shaking or inverting the snow globe stirs up the plastic flakes that settle slowly in the liquid when the globe is set upright, thus creating the effect of snow fall upon the figurine, object, or scenery inside." Members had until April 30, 2012, to submit requests. The bills probably won’t reach the chambers for votes until fall. West didn’t submit any requests, said his chief of staff Jonathan Blyth on the deadline day. At least one South Florida lawmaker did, though. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, filed one for certain coffee brewers with "milk frothing capacity" and another for electromechanical ice shavers. Is it an earmark? The DCCC -- and some Republicans -- say tariff breaks are equivalent to bringing back earmarks. Back in 2010, the House Republican Conference adopted a rule stating members couldn’t request earmarks or limited tariff benefits. A limited tariff benefit is defined as benefiting less than 10 companies. Today, lawmakers introducing miscellaneous tariff bills say they could apply to any company. But it’s not clear that’s always the case, since some of the bills seem quite specific. West’s office pointed us to this myths vs. facts page distributed by the House Ways and Means Committee. In the fact sheet, the Republicans argued that earmarks increase spending, but tariff bills reduce tariffs and are equivalent to a tax cut. They also said the tariff waivers could apply to any company and that the process is a "model of transparency." There is some feuding in the ranks about whether they are earmarks and about how they're handled. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., has teamed up with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to propose changing the process so businesses go directly to the trade commission to seek the tariff break. Lawmakers would still have to vote on it, but they wouldn’t have the chance to pick and choose which ones to forward to the commission. DeMint argues that would get rid of the "pay-to-play racket." "Some want to restart this part of the political favor factory and hope Americans don't notice Republicans breaking their own earmark ban, and others want to redefine earmarks to create a loophole for tariff suspensions," DeMint wrote in an op-ed for CNN.com. Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that monitors earmarking and other budget issues, has raised concerns about the tariff bills because of the "potential pay-to-play and special interest giveaways that it perpetuates," said vice president Steve Ellis in a recent email. "So call them earmarks, call them limited tariff benefits, call them whatever you like, we are still concerned with this legislation," he said. Ellis said he will analyze this year's list to determine if some raise the same concerns as earmarks -- such as benefiting few people who are giving campaign donations to their members in Congress. So would Ellis call them earmarks? "I’m going to wait and see," he said. "I wouldn’t be surprised if some of them are." Our ruling The DCCC said that West’s signature on a letter with dozens of House Republicans calling for a miscellaneous tariff bill means that he wants to bring earmarks back. Tariff breaks do raise some of the same concerns as earmarks. Business owners who can help fund candidates’ campaigns seek the financial benefit from their own representatives. And some of the bills are written in such a way as to only benefit a select few. But the process and the particulars involved in earmarks vs. tariff breaks are very different. Earmarks direct spending; tariff bills are more like tax breaks. More importantly, the process for tariff breaks is transparent and relatively easy to track, unlike the earmarks of previous years.

pomt-06469	"The people in Massachusetts like (the state health care plan) by about a 3-1 margin."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-massachusetts-residents-favor-sta/	Comments about Mitt Romney's support of the Massachusetts health care plan prompted a testy exchange during the CNN Republican debate in Las Vegas. It began with former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum making an aside that Romney's plan "was the basis for Obamacare. Your consultants helped Obama craft Obamacare." Romney said he had consistently said it was"crafted for Massachusetts. It would be wrong to adopt this as a nation." That prompted a feisty back-and-forth with head-shaking and interruptions. When the dust settled, Romney said, "It was something crafted for a state. And I've said time and again, Obamacare is bad news. It's unconstitutional. It costs way too much money, a trillion dollars. And if I'm president of the United States, I will repeal it for the American people." ANDERSON COOPER: "All right. Senator Santorum?" SANTORUM: "Mitt, the governor of Massachusetts just is coming forward saying we have to pick up the job left undone by Romneycare, which is doing something about cutting health care costs. "What you did is exactly what Barack Obama did: focused on the wrong problem. Herman always says you've got to find the right problem. Well, the right problem is health care costs. What you did with a top-down, government-run program was focus on the problem of health care access. You expanded the pool of insurance without controlling costs. You've blown a hole in the budget up there. And you authored in Obamacare, which is going to blow a hole in the budget of this country." COOPER: "Governor Romney, I'm going to give you 30 seconds." ROMNEY: "I'm -- I'm sorry, Rick, that you find so much to dislike in my plan, but I'll tell you, the people in Massachusetts like it by about a 3-1 margin." Romney made a similar claim during last week's debate, so we checked it out. We found one survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Boston Globe. Interviews with a sample of 537 respondents age 18 and older were conducted from May 24 to May 26, 2011. The survey asked this question, among others: "Given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law?" The pollsters found that 63 percent supported the law, 21 percent opposed the law, 6 percent didn’t know, and 9 percent hadn’t heard of the law. The ratio of 63 percent support and 21 percent opposition is exactly 3 to 1, supporting Romney’s claim. (Support is actually up compared to a previous Harvard-Globe poll in 2009, when the breakdown was 53 percent to 25 percent, or slightly over 2 to 1.) And such levels of support don’t appear to be unusual. An annual survey sponsored by the Urban Institute and the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation has somewhat different methodology but found similar levels of support. Between 2006 and 2009, support for the law was, respectively, 69 percent, 71 percent, 72 percent and 67 percent. (We don’t know the exact ratio of support to opposition because the survey did not release the percentages for those who opposed the law or who had no opinion.) "There is no discussion here of repealing the law," said Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. "Romney has it right in the sense that residents in Massachusetts don't want to repeal the law." Our ruling Romney has strong support for this claim. A recent survey by a credible pollster found the ratio of support to opposition for the Massachusetts law at 3 to 1, and other polls suggest levels of support even higher. So we rate Romney’s statement True. Editor's note: This item was originally published on Oct. 12 for the original claim. We have added the new wording from the Oct. 18 debate.

pomt-02387	Says Cathy Jordan was "arrested" and dragged out of her home by "a SWAT team of hooligans" for using medical marijuana.	/florida/statements/2014/mar/13/john-morgan/john-morgan-says-swat-team-hooligans-arrested-medi/	Outspoken Orlando attorney John Morgan doesn’t mince words when it comes to his support of Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment. He does tend to paint his cause in broad strokes, however. During a University of Tampa debate on medicinal use of the drug on Feb. 24, Morgan argued that it’s misguided to enforce marijuana laws, using the example of Cathy Jordan, a 64-year-old Parrish resident who smokes to combat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. "The issue for this year is very simple," Morgan said. "Should about 350,000 to 400,000 people, including Cathy Jordan, who’s here tonight, who was arrested last year, drug out of her home, because she suffers from ALS, and marijuana is the only thing that will help her, the only question this year for us is the legalization of medical marijuana." Later, he added this: "There was an arrest of Cathy Jordan a year ago. An ALS patient who’s sitting right here ... this afternoon, and guess what? The agricultural commissioner sent a SWAT team of hooligans out to her house to drag her and her husband out because it's the only relief that she could get." Jordan is now the president of the Florida Cannabis Action Network, while Morgan has spent $4 million of his own money on a petition drive for a constitutional amendment for marijuana. Some of the details Morgan mentioned about Jordan’s encounter with law enforcement, though, didn’t sound right, so we decided to check it out. Acting on a tip The Tampa Bay Times wrote about Jordan’s plight last year, confirming that her marijuana usage did in fact attract the attention of Manatee County sheriff’s deputies on Feb. 25, 2013. A Realtor noticed an extension cord running from a shed on Jordan’s property to an empty home’s garage next door, then saw a mature marijuana plant growing in Jordan’s garden. The Realtor called the authorities. According to an incident report, two deputies responded to the call, originally for burglary and theft of service for the extension cord, and confirmed the plant was there. The responding deputies’ reports noted that two men harassed them and recorded their arrival and subsequent investigation. One of the men (neither are named in those reports, although Robert Jordan and his son were home) reportedly bumped one of the deputies several times and attempted to prevent the pair of officers from entering their property, saying the marijuana was theirs and they wanted the deputies to leave. One deputy called his sergeant, who responded and then requested the department’s Special Investigations Division, an undercover vice and narcotics unit that responds to drug calls. Three detectives responded to the call and spoke to Robert Jordan, who let the police enter his house and explained his wife used marijuana to deal with her ALS symptoms, according to the division’s report. Police confirmed no marijuana being grown inside the house, then went outside to find three large plants in a plastic container and two smaller plants in another. Robert Jordan then opened the shed that used the extension cord to reveal 18 smaller seedlings, "a lighting system, an air conditioner, a thermometer and a white erase board to track planting dates." The authorities explained to Robert Jordan that growing marijuana was illegal under federal law and they could either take all the marijuana "observed in plain view" or they would go get a warrant and forcibly remove the plants. The report states neither he nor his wife were ever threatened with arrest, but reluctantly agreed to let the department confiscate 23 plants. No one was arrested or dragged out of their house by a SWAT team. The Jordans sued the Sheriff’s Office for the return of their plants last year. Sheriff’s Office public information officer Dave Bristow did verify that none of the officers responding drew their guns and only entered the Jordans’ property with permission. No warrants were necessary. The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office wouldn’t comment on the incident other than to confirm details in the report, citing pending civil litigation. Robert Jordan confirmed the incident happened the way the sheriff’s reports says it did, although he said the deputies who first arrived did rush up his driveway with their hands on their sidearms. He described them as "very, very aggressive," although he said he was aggressive, too, arguing about whether probable cause allowed them on his property. He noted he told his wife to go across the street with friends after the deputies arrived, and no one touched her. He had a different opinion about the Special Investigations Division detectives. "The actual narcotics officers, they were gentlemen," Jordan said. "They were embarrassed, because I told them they were taking my wife’s medicine." Two of the trio wore ski masks, Jordan said, which the Sheriff’s Office said is procedure to conceal their identities for undercover work. The unmasked detective told Jordan he had two choices: They could wait outside a couple of hours while they got a warrant. Jordan said the detective told him they would then come back and "tear your house apart. And we don’t put nothing back." Or the Jordans could walk them through the house and allow the unit to confiscate his plants, then wait for word on official charges. The officer then told Jordan they had a right to take anything in the shed, but opted to only remove the light bulb from the grow lamp and smash it. The same week, State Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, introduced a medical marijuana bill called the Cathy Jordan Medical Cannabis Act. The bill died, but he filed another bill under the same name in February, ostensibly to set a framework should the amendment pass in November. Robert Jordan was in the process of buying the property next door, and the utilities were in his name, so the burglary and theft of service charges were never brought, and the Realtor’s company declined to press any trespassing charges. The Manatee County state attorney’s later reviewed the case and declined to press growing and possession charges because "the state lacks a good-faith belief it can overcome a medical necessity defense in this matter," according to the office’s report. Robert Jordan could have faced a felony count of possession and manufacturing of a Schedule I drug. We asked the United for Care campaign for a response. Manager Ben Pollara said Morgan’s comments were off the cuff. "I think it’s just a case of something that happened a year ago … and he was talking from memory," Pollara said. A story about officers in ski masks with guns probably made it sound like a SWAT team, he said. Robert Jordan said he figured Morgan may have gotten his account from any of the numerous outlets that layered on the hyperbole about machine guns and police brutality -- he named this story by the Huffington Post as being particularly loose with the facts. "No one asked me, or I would have told them the truth," Jordan said. He also said he had only met John Morgan and didn’t know him, but liked the man for his devotion to getting medical marijuana legislation passed, and how Morgan treated his wife. Having a legal supply of cannabis available would certainly make his life easier, he added. Meanwhile, the Jordans continue to cultivate their own plants, thanks to having the charges dropped. The ruling Morgan said "a SWAT team of hooligans" dragged Cathy Jordan out of her home and arrested her after authorities discovered her family’s tiny growing operation in their Parrish backyard. Officers obtained consent to search the property and removed mature plants and seedlings, and Robert Jordan faced charges of growing and possessing marijuana, which were later dropped. No one was arrested. No one was dragged anywhere. It seems Morgan may have read a report of the incident awash in hyperbole and recalled that. There was an incident at the Jordans’ home, but the police reaction was not nearly as drastic as Morgan described. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-11580	Democrats "booed families of children murdered by MS13."	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/01/csc-mediagroupusa/fake-story-says-democrats-booed-families-ms13-vict/	A bogus story on Facebook claims that Democrats booed during the recent State of the Union address when President Donald Trump addressed introduced the families of teenagers who were killed by MS-13 gang members on Long Island. Democrats "booed families of children murdered by MS13," said a Jan. 30 headline by CSC Mediagroup.USA. "This just goes to show that Democrats would rather support illegals who cause harm to Americans rather than support actual American citizens. What does this say about them? They’re DemocRATS." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that video of Trump’s speech showed a bipartisan chamber stood up and applauded the victims’ parents. Trump invited the parents of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, two teenage girls from Long Island, to listen to his speech. The girls were murdered in September 2016 while walking together in their hometown. Members of the MS-13 gang have been charged with their murders, including some who were illegal immigrants. We listened to and watched videos of Trump’s speech to examine the chamber’s reaction. Just before he introduced the girls’ parents, Trump made a statement about illegal immigrants that drew an audible hiss from some members. (Listen around minute 43:30) "For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives." But then when Trump spoke to the girls’ parents, the chamber sounded silent. Speaking to the girls’ parents, Trump said: "Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand," he said, as the parents then stood. "Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you." The videos show that members stood up and applauded the girls’ parents. Some Democrats did boo and hiss a separate part of Trump’s speech about immigration when he called for an end to "chain migration." "Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives," Trump said. Many Democrats brought to the speech as their guests Dreamers, people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The future fate of Dreamers is up in the air following Trump’s decision announced last year to end an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. CSC Mediagroup.USA’s disclaimer proclaims that it isn’t fake news and that it publishes news from a conservative perspective that the mainstream media ignores. However, in this case it’s headline is wrong. We found no evidence that Democrats "booed families of children murdered by MS13" -- instead they booed other comments Trump made about chain migration.

pomt-08179	"Ohio ranks 46th in the country in putting dollars in the classroom."	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/30/john-kasich/gov-elect-john-kasich-says-ohios-classroom-educati/	Incoming governor John Kasich says he has identified a major flaw in Ohio’s public school system: too much money is spent on administrator salaries and far too little on student instruction in the classroom. "Ohio ranks 46th in the country in putting dollars in the classroom," Kasich said the day after the election, disdain in his voice as he drew on a familiar campaign stomping point. He was citing a ranking noted in a 2010 report from the Greater Ohio Policy Center and Brookings Institution. By that measure, 45 states proportionly spend more in the classroom than Ohio, including neighboring Pennsylvania (17th), Kentucky (31st), and West Virginia (32nd). Kasich is using the figure to mount a basis for setting his own education funding agenda while promising to scrap one established under current Gov. Ted Strickland. By stating how dismal the state is faring by this measure, Kasich hopes to win support for his own educational initiatives. But is the ranking accurate? Could nearly every state in the country be applying more cents on the dollar in the classroom than Ohio? State teacher’s unions and other education leaders say the policy center report is misleading and inaccurate. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. The policy center is a non-partisan policy research group focused on improving Ohio’s economy by strengthening its urban cores. It teamed this year with the nationally known Brookings Institution for its report "Restoring Prosperity: Transforming Ohio’s Communities for the Next Economy." The policy center report recommended Ohio determine how to spend more money in the classroom. The center’s Executive Director Lavea Brachman said, "our starting premise is that if we spend less on administrative costs then we can spend more in the classroom." Philip Trostel, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine, constructed the state-by-state education research for the policy center. He used data collected from the National Center for Education Statistics, an off-shoot of the U.S. Department of Education. "It’s reliable data that is comparable from state to state," Trostel said. "The individual school districts report the data so it lessens the likelihood that one state is reporting differently from another state." In-classroom spending includes items such as teacher salaries, textbooks and technological equipment. New York ranked highest, spending nearly 69 cents of every dollar in classrooms. Indiana ranked 50th at just over 54 cents on the dollar. Ohio, ranked 46th, spends 57.2 cents of every dollar in classrooms, the report found. The reason Ohio ranks so low in this category, according to the report, is because its public school districts appear to spend a greater percentage of their funds on administrative costs, as compared to most other states. In fact, Ohio’s spending on district administration for superintendents and other district-level executives is 49-percent higher than the national average, Trostel concludes in the report. But the rankings are based on 2007-2008 school year data, the most recent state-by-state figures available from the national reporting clearinghouse. Two full school years have passed, and education leaders under the Strickland administration argue that changes the Democratic leader made to school funding made during that time would yield a much better funding record for Ohio. "What is Kasich’s education plan?" Patricia Frost-Brooks, president of the Ohio Education Association wrote in a letter printed by newspapers around the state. "Kasich’s Website, stump speech and debate performance all repeat the same tired mantra: Ohio ranks 46th on money for the classroom. … The stats ignore the new school-funding formula as well as deep administrative cuts at the Ohio Department of Education." The Ohio Department of Education said that it is difficult to duplicate Trostel’s state-by-state research to ensure its accuracy. "We are unable to analyze the information that is being referenced because it is part of an unpublished study and we’re unsure of the data being used to arrive at the conclusion," said Scott Blake, a spokesman for the state Education Department. In 2009, the state legislature approved Strickland’s evidence-based model school funding plan which the governor said would, among other things, eventually direct more dollars towards programs that help schoolchildren learn best. It also promises to ensure the state will spend more on public education to lessen the burden on local taxpayers. But none of that particularly guarantees that Ohio will spend more money in the classroom, just that money being spent could be re-allocated for different instructional purposes. Kasich has made it clear that he plans to eliminate Strickland’s funding model altogether and introduce his own. With no recent national data available for comparison, the national ranking that the policy center bestowed on Ohio appears unchallenged. Even the Ohio Education Department admitted that the policy center report’s figures for Ohio appear to be close to accurate, though it can’t say for sure or measure the figures against other states. It would, however, be useful for Kasich to acknowledge that the figures used for the ranking that he has repeatedly cited are more than two years old. That’s a key piece of information needed for context. That’s why we rate Kasich’s statement Mostly True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2010-11-30T06:00:00	2010-11-03	['Ohio']
pomt-03683	Says al Qaeda has camps with the drug cartels in Mexico.	/texas/statements/2013/apr/23/louie-gohmert/louie-gohmert-says-al-qaeda-has-camps-drug-cartels/	A Texas congressman stressing border security told an interviewer that a terrorist group is set up south of the Rio Grande. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, said on C-SPAN’s "Washington Journal" April 17, 2013: "We know al Qaeda has camps over with the drug cartels on the other side of the Mexican border. We know that people are now being trained to come in and act like Hispanic when they’re radical Islamists. We know these things are happening and... it’s just insane not to protect ourselves." We wondered about al Qaeda having camps with the Mexican drug cartels. Gohmert's basis To our inquiry, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham noted a 2006 interim report and November 2012 follow-up report, "A Line in the Sand: Countering Crime, Violence and Terror at the Southwest Border," prepared by the Republican staff of a subcommittee to the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee that was chaired by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin. Both reports say terrorists can cross the U.S.-Mexico border, though neither mentions al Qaeda camps in Mexico. More recently, McCaul suggested that a foiled assassination plot involving an Iranian American resident of Round Rock, north of Austin, suggests a growing link between Mideast terrorist groups and organized crime in Mexico. Manssor Arbabsiar pleaded guilty in October 2012 to participating in a scheme to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States after attempting to hire a hit man Arbabsiar believed to be a member of the Zetas Mexican drug cartel; the assassin was actually a paid Drug Enforcement Administration informant. McCaul, who now chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a December 2012 Austin American-Statesman interview that Iran and Mideast militant groups such as Hezbollah have long had money laundering and fundraising hubs across Latin America and the Texas-tied plot reflected "the first time we have seen that financial relationship become potentially operational." McCaul also told the newspaper: "It is not a real stretch of the imagination that these groups could work together operationally if they already have a financial relationship. Mexican cartels don't want to get into the terrorism business, and I think to a large extent that may be true, but I think the lesson of 9/11 was to connect the dots." McCaul also said he would focus the committee on drawing attention to the threat of such emerging partnerships and keeping narco-terrorist operatives from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The 2006 report overseen by McCaul, referencing a February 2003 report by the Library of Congress, says: "Statements made by high-ranking Mexican officials prior to and following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks indicate that one or more Islamic terrorist organizations has sought to establish a presence in Mexico. In May 2001, former Mexican National security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, reported, that ‘Spanish and Islamic terrorist groups are using Mexico as a refuge.’" The Library of Congress report says there was speculation in Mexico after the 2001 attacks that "al Qaeda cells could be present in Mexico and could potentially attempt to cross the U.S. southwest border to conduct additional attacks." During an October 2001 United Nations conference, according to the report, the director of Mexico’s Center for Intelligence and National Security, Eduardo Medina Mora, said the possibility of an al Qaeda attack against the United States launched from Mexico "could not be ruled out," though Medina Mora also said the center had no reason to believe that there was an al Qaeda presence in Mexico, the report says. Testimony by federal officials The 2006 report says the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert Mueller, confirmed in testimony that there are individuals from countries with known al Qaeda connections "who are changing their Islamic surnames to Hispanic-sounding names and obtaining false Hispanic identities, learning to speak Spanish and pretending to be Hispanic immigrants." We perused Mueller’s March 8, 2005 testimony to a House subcommittee, downloaded via Nexis, seeing no mention of al Qaeda camps in Mexico or links to Mexican drug cartels. Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, asked Mueller if he was aware of individuals from countries with al Qaeda connections entering the United States using false identities, in particular changing Islamic surnames to Hispanic surnames. "We’ve had indications of that," Mueller replied, adding that he would have to check on instances of somebody from, say, a Middle Eastern country adopting an Hispanic name and attempting to enter the country. "I'm not certain how many instances there might have been," Mueller testified. "I can tell you that we are concerned, that Homeland Security is concerned about special interest aliens coming into the United States. We work closely with the Border Patrol and" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement "to interview those when they're apprehended. We have ongoing investigations together into smuggling organizations that may be assisting in getting special interest aliens cross the border." By phone, FBI spokeswoman Kathy Wright told us she was unaware of any FBI statements specific to al Qaeda having camps in Mexico with the drug cartels. Also, she said, "it’s not our practice to release information like that." Weeks before Mueller testified, according to a Feb. 17, 2005, New York Times news story, Adm. James M. Loy, the deputy secretary of Homeland Security, said in written testimony that al Qaeda operatives had considered using the Mexican border as an entry point. But, the Times said, Loy said that there was "currently no conclusive evidence" that this had succeeded. Other news reports Our search of recent news accounts turned up nothing specific to al Qaeda camps in Mexico, though an Oct. 13, 2011, Agence France Press news story, datelined Mexico City, said that in February 2011, Janet Napolitano, the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security, had said U.S. authorities were concerned about a potential alliance between groups like al Qaeda and the Zetas, which the story described as the cartel "started by elite military brass who went bad to sell drugs." Napolitano mentioned the worry, according to the transcript of a Feb. 9, 2011, hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security, after Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Corpus Christi, said that he believed terrorists could exploit the international drug trade to the detriment of the United States. "Indeed," Napolitano replied. "And one of the things that -- all I will say in open setting is that we have for some time been thinking ahead about what would happen if, say, al Qaeda were to unite with the Zetas, one of the drug cartels. And I'll just leave it at that." The Agence France Press story also said that President Barack Obama said in July 2011 that the Zetas "were a threat to international security, comparing them to organized crime groups in Italy and Japan. But experts argued," the story said, that "it is one thing for the Zetas to indulge in cross-border business, and it is quite another for them to decide to take part in a terror strike that would directly challenge and confront the U.S. government." Experts say such camps unheard of Next, several security experts on security issues each told us he was unaware of al Qaeda camps in Mexico. "Never heard this one before," replied Daniel Byman, a Georgetown University professor and the director of research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. "This was a post 9/11 fear, but I never saw evidence for it. " By telephone, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that he would not discount border security, but Gohmert’s claim struck him as "incredibly sloppy. It doesn’t help the debate. We don’t know that these claims are true." Gartenstein-Ross offered, too, that it would be foolish for the drug cartels to let al Qaeda establish camps in their bailiwicks. The cartels, he said, "are out to make money. Right now, they have not drawn the (direct) wrath of the United States. If they had al Qaeda camps," he said, they’d draw U.S. military might. "There has been no credible report of al Qaeda having camps with the drug cartels," he said. Similarly, Brian Michael Jenkins, a RAND terrorism expert, said through an email that he has not seen any evidence to support the claim. A RAND colleague, political scientist Peter Chalk, separately said via email he had not heard of such camps in Mexico. Our ruling Gohmert told C-SPAN that al Qaeda has camps with the drug cartels in Mexico. Since 9/11, there has been occasional speculation about al Qaeda operatives crossing into the country from Mexico. Notably, too, Napolitano said in 2011 that the U.S. government has thought about what would happen if the Zetas united with al Qaeda. However, there appears to be no evidence of al Qaeda now having camps in Mexico, with the drug cartels or otherwise. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-08990	"Ken Hodges badly botched this investigation and, as a result, justice wasn't done in this case."	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/15/rob-teilhet/candidate-says-opponent-botched-prosecution-fatal-/	It is certainly the most emotional political ad of this election season. And, perhaps, its most controversial. A mother claims a prosecutor botched a case in which her unarmed son, Kenneth Walker, was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy on a cold roadway in Columbus. The prosecutor was Ken Hodges, now a Democratic candidate for Georgia attorney general. The ad was put together by Rob Teilhet, a Democrat running against Hodges in a bruising campaign for the party's nomination. "The officer got off because the prosecutor, Ken Hodges, forgot to swear him in; tried to hide the video and refused to reopen the case," the victim's mother, Emily Walker of Columbus, said during the 30-second spot. The ad ends with a final comment from the dead man's mother: "Mr. Hodges should not be our next attorney general." Tough words. But are the claims correct? Teilhet, a Marietta-based attorney who predominantly deals in workers' compensation cases, thought so. "Ken Hodges badly botched this investigation and, as a result, justice wasn't done in this case," Teilhet said in a telephone interview with PolitiFact Georgia. Teilhet did not speak in the ad. PolitiFact Georgia received a few e-mails and requests to take a look into whether the Teilhet ad is right. Let's begin by going back to the night of the shooting, Dec. 10, 2003. Walker and three friends left an apartment complex in Columbus and were riding in a sport utility vehicle on I-185 when it was pulled over by two sets of law enforcement officers. The officials received a tip the men in the vehicle were carrying illegal guns. All four men were pulled from the vehicle. Muscogee County Sheriff's Deputy David Glisson shot Walker twice. No guns or drugs were found in the vehicle. Walker, 39, later died from the gunshot wounds. Glisson said the shooting was an accident. The shooting drew headlines for many reasons. The victim was unarmed. Glisson is white. Walker was black. Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker appointed Hodges, then the Dougherty County district attorney, as special prosecutor of the case. Hodges presented his findings before a grand jury of nearly two dozen citizens. The grand jury, which followed standard practice by meeting behind closed doors, voted not to indict anyone in the case. The NAACP demanded further investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice decided in July 2007 there was insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against Glisson, who had been fired after the shooting. Three years later, the case is back in the news as Hodges and Teilhet duel in a raucous battle to become the state's top prosecutor. The sparring includes who has the endorsement of Andrew Young, the civil rights icon, former U.N. ambassador and Atlanta mayor. (Young has endorsed both candidates.) Teilhet, a former state representative from Cobb County, said he wanted the campaign ad done to examine Hodges' record as a prosecutor. So let's start with the first claim, "the officer got off because the prosecutor, Ken Hodges, forgot to swear him in." Hodges did not swear in Glisson, who gave a statement to the grand jury. Hodges has said he's "sorry" he didn't swear in Glisson, but added that it wasn't necessary to validate the shooter's statement. Teilhet argues not swearing in Glisson hurt the public's confidence in the prosecution. The Georgia Legislature passed a bill earlier this year that requires prosecutors to swear in all witnesses. The second point, Hodges tried to "hide" the video of the shooting. Hodges argued in an Oct. 15, 2004, legal brief with the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia and the District Attorneys Association of Georgia against releasing video of the shooting to the news media before any criminal proceedings took place, court records show. The grand jury saw the video several times before the November 2004 decision not to indict Glisson. Third, Hodges "refused to reopen the case." Gregory W. Edwards, who is now Dougherty County's district attorney, said Hodges told Walker's mother he would reopen the case if there was sufficient new evidence after the grand jury refused to indict Glisson. One community group, the Grassroots Unity Movement for Change, sent Hodges a 10-page letter in October 2007 asking him to convene a second grand jury. Hodges took some heat at the time for not recommending to the grand jury that they indict Glisson. The critics include Teilhet. Hodges told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer he felt it "was important [for the grand jury] to make the decision in this case." Most prosecutors say they'll recommend an indictment if they feel the evidence is overwhelming. Some made no recommendation if the case was a "jump ball." Teilhet said the combination of questions about the video, Glisson not being sworn in, and no recommendation to indict should have prompted Hodges to take another look at the case. "These folks were never given a legal proceeding they could have confidence in," Teilhet said. Teilhet said Emily Walker was eager to talk about her concerns in the campaign video. "No one puts words in her mouth," he said. Others contend Teilhet has taken advantage of Emily Walker and accuse the candidate of pandering to black voters. "The ad is outrageous," said Richard Hagler, Glisson's attorney. Hodges did not swear in Glisson before the grand jury, but it was not required at the time. The prosecutor did oppose efforts to release the video to reporters, but there's no evidence Hodges hid it from the grand jury. Hagler said Hodges told him that he would reopen the case if any new evidence came forward. There's no overriding proof that Hodges refused to reopen the case. There is some truth to two of the three claims in the ad. But was this case "badly botched"? So far, there's been no significant evidence to prove that allegation. Additionally, the federal Justice Department decided not to move forward with a criminal civil rights case against Glisson. The feds found there was insufficient evidence to prove Glisson willfully shot Walker. Teilhet said the feds were considering different criteria. Still, we rate Teilhet's claim as False.

pomt-00933	Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas said: ‘Hey, all you wrinkly, white-aged has-beens: It’s time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet.’	/texas/statements/2015/feb/24/facebook-posts/light-match-facebook-meme-quotes-sheila-jackson-le/	Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee can be a firecracker of a public speaker. But we were skeptical of a Facebook meme, shared online Feb. 7, 2015 and brought to our attention by a reader. The meme showed Jackson Lee, a Houstonian initially elected to the House in 1994, saying: "Hey, all you wrinkly, white-aged has-beens: It’s time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet." A web search led us to similar though less racially charged language posted by Stand Up for the Truth, a Wisconsin-based weekday religious public affairs program, in a November 2012 web post critical of the United Nations. The post opened: "Hey all you wrinkly, middle-aged has-beens: Are you ready to move over and let the next generation have your spot on the planet? After all, you’ve lived a good life. And your aging body is going to cost taxpayers a lot more than the salt you think you are worth. In other words, your return-on-investment isn’t looking so good to the United Nations." By email, the program’s co-host, Amy Spreeman, said she recalled "coming up with the term, ‘wrinkly has-been’ for that article. I'm a descriptive writer who also happens to be seeing a few wrinkles in my own mirror," Spreeman wrote. Our Google and Nexis news database searches for signs of Jackson Lee saying such words came up empty. We also asked the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the activities of hate groups, if it had noticed such words from the Texan. Spokesman Mark Potok said not, otherwise pointing out a center white paper on the United Nations issue raised by Stand Up for Truth. We also queried Michael McQuerry, a spokesman for Jackson Lee, who said by email: "She has NEVER said this... This is someone who has taken her picture and placed these words on this. No truth to this at all." Asked if Jackson Lee had ever called for an individual or individuals to die, McQuerry replied: "NO." Our ruling The Facebook meme says Jackson Lee called on "all you wrinkly white-aged has-beens" to die. Not so, nor has she said anything close. Pants on Fire!

pomt-04346	Says U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin supports a "tax increase that President Obama says" would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year.	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/24/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-senate-foe-tammy-baldwin-backs/	A signature slogan of Tammy Baldwin’s campaign is that she is a fighter for the middle class. Yet her U.S. Senate opponent, Tommy Thompson, claims Baldwin wants to stick it to average folks. And he uses President Barack Obama to back his attack. In a Thompson TV ad releasedOct. 8, 2012, the narrator says: "Baldwin supports a massive middle-class tax increase that President Obama says would be devastating." Then the ad shows a clip of Obama saying: "If that had come to pass, the average middle-class family would have had to pay an extra $3,000 in taxes next year." Thompson’s case Thompson’s claim starts off on the wrong foot in that he uses the present tense -- "Baldwin supports" a middle-class tax increase. But his campaign told us he was referring to a vote Baldwin cast in December 2010, and it’s clear from the ad that the reference is to a measure Obama commented on. The vote was on a compromise Obama reached with Congress over taxes. The compromise involved a number of things, including a cut in the employee portion of payroll taxes and an extension of unemployment benefits. But the big fight was over what to do about tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- that were about to expire. Republicans wanted to permanently extend the cuts, adopted under President George W. Bush, for all Americans. Obama and Baldwin were among Democrats who wanted to extend the cuts for most Americans, but let them expire for wealthier people -- individuals making more than $200,000 and joint tax filers making more than $250,000 in adjusted gross income. That’s a key point -- Baldwin’s aim was to extend the tax cuts for the middle class, not raise taxes on the middle class. With the compromise, the tax cuts were extended for all Americans, for two years. The measure passed the House, 277-148, with Baldwin voting no. She said giving "a special tax break to those with incomes over $250,000" would have added to the national debt and was fiscally irresponsible. As for the Thompson ad’s use of the Obama clip, the president was saying that had all the Bush-era tax cuts been allowed to expire, the average middle-class family would have had to pay an extra $3,000 in taxes in 2011. Obama may have been rounding up a figure generated by the Deloitte Tax consulting firm. It estimated that letting the tax cuts expire would have meant that atypical family of four with a household income of $50,000 a year would have to pay $2,900 more in taxes in 2011. So, if Baldwin’s side had succeeded in defeating the compromise, middle-class taxes would have risen about $3,000 -- if no other action had been taken. On the other hand, Baldwin made it clear she supported extending the tax cuts for middle-class families. A week before the vote on the compromise, she voted for an alternative that would have extended the Bush tax cuts permanently for families earning less than $250,000. So, in the way Thompson frames the issue, it could be said Baldwin opposes -- or supports -- extending tax cuts for the middle class, depending on which vote you consider. Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus noted that Baldwin voted again in 2012 for a one-year extension of most of the Bush tax cuts for the middle class but not for wealthier people. That measure failed. Our rating Thompson said Baldwin supports a "tax increase that President Obama says" would cost families $3,000 per year. Thompson falters in making the claim in the present tense when he’s referring to a vote Baldwin took in 2010. Baldwin did vote no on a law that prevented middle class taxes from increasing by $3,000. But she supported extending tax cuts for the middle class and she voted for a another measure, which failed, that also would have prevented the $3,000 middle-class tax hike. We rate Thompson’s statement Mostly False.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-10-24T09:00:00	2012-10-08	['Barack_Obama', 'Tammy_Baldwin', 'United_States']
pomt-10234	"Gov. Palin ... is somebody who actually doesn't believe that climate change is man-made."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/john-kerry/palin-isnt-convinced-its-a-people-problem/	Now that Sen. John McCain has chosen a running mate, Democrats have a target. Within days of her ascension to the GOP ticket, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin came under attack by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry for her environmental views. In an Aug. 31 interview on This Week with George Stephanopoulous, Kerry said this: "With the choice of Gov. Palin, it's now the third term of Bush-Cheney, because what he's done is he's chosen somebody who actually doesn't believe that climate change is man-made." Kerry's claim is supported by an answer Palin gave in an interview with Newsmax, a conservative news Web site. She was asked for her "take on global warming and how it is affecting our country," in an Aug. 29 interview published on Newsmax.com. She said, "A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made." But McCain is. As we explained in this item, McCain was an early proponent of capping emissions to combat the impact of global warming, a position he has touted in a campaign commercial. Some other past statements by Palin suggest she has been undecided about whether humans are heating up the planet. An Anchorage Daily News candidate survey during Alaska's 2006 gubernatorial campaign that asked "what role does state government have, if any, in addressing global warming and climate change," prompted Palin to answer, "We need to analyze the potential economic costs, needs and opportunities associated with climate change. Let's be cautious in how we react – to make sure we don't overreact." On Nov. 4, 2006, just before her election, the Anchorage Daily News quoted a Palin spokesman, Curtis Smith, as saying Palin was undecided about the cause of global warming. "She's not totally convinced one way or the other," Smith said. In a New York Times op-ed published in January, Palin also signaled that she doesn't think scientists have made the case for human culpability. Palin said proponents of listing polar bears as an endangered species – which she opposes – were trying to "force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces, or even allows, the production of greenhouse gases. But the Endangered Species Act is not the correct tool to address climate change — the act itself actually prohibits any consideration of broader issues. Such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs, and where scientists debate and present information that policymakers need to make the best decisions." In her home state, which has seen significant changes in its glacial landscapes, Palin is addressing the climate change issue. In September 2007, she created a "climate change subcabinet" to prepare a state strategy to respond to global warming. In a report to Alaskans in July, Palin wrote that the subcabinet "will also be making recommendations to me on how Alaskans can save energy and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. " Palin's nod to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the context of global warming would suggest she's not entirely closed off to the idea that the two are related. Still, Palin's Aug. 29 statement was pretty clear: she doesn't attribute global warming to man-made causes, despite a broad, global scientific consensus that human activity is responsible for climate change. We find Kerry's statement to be Mostly True.	None	John Kerry	None	None	None	2008-09-03T00:00:00	2008-08-31	['None']
pomt-03230	"Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans – and 95 percent of gun households in the state – support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them."	/new-jersey/statements/2013/aug/18/mark-kelly/capt-mark-kelly/	Near unanimous support in polls isn’t exactly a frequent occurrence. And it may be even more rare when the topic in question is one of the most controversial in this country: gun control. But that was exactly the case earlier this year when a handful of major polling organizations quizzed people on gun control in the wake of the December 2012 Newtown, Conn. shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 27 people dead, including 20 children. "Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans – and 95 percent of gun households in the state – support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them," Navy Capt. Mark Kelly said in an Aug. 12 opinion column on NJ.com, the online home of The Star-Ledger. Kelly, a New Jersey native, is married to former Arizona Rep. Gabrille Giffords, a Democrat, who was shot in the head Jan. 8, 2011 during a public appearance at a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, Ariz. Six people were killed and 13 were wounded at the event, including Giffords. Kelly’s column expressed support for Gov. Chris Christie to sign some gun-control bills passed recently by the state Legislature, and urged Christie to sign another bill that would, in part, expand background checks on gun purchases and safety training for gun owners. As for the high approval ratings in Kelly’s claim, data supports it. Kelly was referring to a Jan. 24 poll done by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn., according to Katie Hill, press secretary for Kelly, Giffords and their group Americans for Responsible Solutions. The poll of 1,647 registered voters in New Jersey asked, "Would you favor or oppose requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows?" The response, according to poll data: 96 percent favored it. The figure was 95 percent for ‘gun households,’ meaning those households in New Jersey where a gun is present. Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans For Responsible Solutions, noted that federal law requires background checks for guns purchased from federally licensed firearms dealers, "otherwise known as a gun store." That’s not the case, however, if guns are purchased from a private seller at a gun show – and the point that Carusone said Kelly was making with his claim. "When we say expanding background checks, we mean to say to cover guns purchased at gun shows," Carusone said. The Truth-O-Meter reviewed this issue – commonly known as the "gun show loophole" -- in a May 2012 fact-check. At that time we confirmed that The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or Brady Act, requires all federally licensed firearms dealers to run a background check on potential customers to ensure they are not prohibited from owning a gun. Private sellers without a federal license don’t have to meet the same requirement, although some states have stricter requirements than others. In addition to the Quinnipiac poll, we checked with other organizations in New Jersey to determine how their post-Newtown gun control polls fared. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll, said the organization hasn’t done a poll about expanding background checks, but did survey residents earlier this year about whether gun control would influence their vote for governor in November. David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Polling Institute and a political science professor at Rutgers University, said an early February poll asked 794 New Jerseyans a variety of questions about guns. Two of six questions asked randomly were background-check related and had approval levels at 90 percent or higher. Approval levels topped 80 percent for the same questions posed to ‘gun households,’ he said. Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind poll in January asked questions about greater restrictions on guns and ammunition, and better management of the mentally ill, according to Krista Jenkins, director of PublicMind and a political science professor at FDU. Our ruling Kelly said in an opinion column, ""Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans – and 95 percent of gun households in the state – support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them." Kelly was referring to a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll from January, with findings that match numbers he cited. The poll’s question specifically referenced guns bought at gun shows, and Kelly’s spokeswoman confirmed that his statement in his column referred to such purchases. We rate Kelly’s claim True.

pomt-06952	Ninety percent of the job growth in Virginia has been in the private sector.	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/18/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-90-percent-virginias-job-growth-has/	In a recent television interview, Gov. Bob McDonnell was asked whether Virginia’s strong employment numbers should be at least partially credited to the state’s proximity to Washington. "How much of a wind is at your back just from being next to the center of government?" asked Joe Kerne, the host of CNBC’s Squawk Box. McDonnell downplayed the effect of the federal government on Virginia’s job picture. "The fact that we’ve got proximity to Washington, D.C., is certainly somewhat helpful, but I will say that most of the job growth (in Virginia), in fact 90 percent of it, has been in the private sector," McDonnell said. We wondered if the governor’s statistic is correct. Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for McDonnell, backed up his boss by giving us a spreadsheet culled from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It detailed how many jobs have been created in government and the private sector since February 2010, the first full month of McDonnell’s administration. We checked the underlying data on the BLS website to see if the numbers supported the governor’s statement. In February 2010, there were 3,595,600 total jobs in Virginia. By May 2011, the latest month for which data was available, that rose to 3,663,000. That’s a net increase of 67,400 jobs. The BLS numbers break out how many of those positions were attributed to federal, state and local government jobs, as well as how many were in the private sector. In February 2010, there were 2,896,000 private-sector jobs, rising in May 2011 to 2,959,400. That’s an increase of 63,400 private sector positions, which is 94 percent of the Virginia’s net job growth during McDonnell’s term. Of course, many private sector jobs in Virginia are indirectly funded by the federal government. Gary Steinberg, a BLS spokesman, said his agency doesn’t tally how many private jobs are attributable government contracts. But government contracts certainly provide a boost to Virginia’s economy. Companies in Fairfax County alone received $22.6 billion in federal contracts in fiscal year 2009, according to U.S. Census Bureu statistics cited by Alan A. Fogg, a spokesman for the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority. Fogg noted in an e-mail that 26 companies listed in Washington Technology magazine’s 2011 list of the 100 largest government contractors are based in Fairfax or have their U.S. headquarters there. A report by Stephen S. Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, found that in fiscal 2008, Department of Defense spending funded an estimated 268,200 full-time equivalent employees of federal contractors in Virginia. Let’s review: Asked about how much the federal government is boosting Virginia’s jobs picture, McDonnell countered that it’s the private sector that’s been driving the commonwealth’s job growth. The governor said the private sector has accounted for about 90 percent of the state’s job growth and figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics back up his claim. Although many private sector jobs in Virginia are created through federal government contracts, there are no definitive statistics detailing the number. We rate the governor’s claim True.

pomt-00423	"The Dutch (Afrikaners) were" in South Africa "first."	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/27/ann-coulter/coulters-strange-claim-dutch-settlers-preceded-bla/	When President Donald Trump referred to land seizures and "large scale killings" of white farmers in South Africa, he set the stage for a classic Twitter storm. Kenya-born photographer Joseph Muhatia tweeted, "The land in South Africa belongs to black people they are the native owner and not white people." To which conservative pundit Ann Coulter replied, "Actually, the Dutch (Afrikaners) were there first." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Pause a second. Coulter claimed Dutch settlers who started showing up around 1650 were in South Africa before black people. We tweeted her to learn what she had in mind and didn’t hear back. A brief history The history of Southern Africa long before the Europeans (and yes, there is a long before) is a fascinating tale of competing kingdoms, shifting alliances, and territorial disputes. We spent some time with two volumes published by UNESCO in 1992. Wars among the people labeled black today played out before and after the Europeans arrived. As it turns out, the Dutch dropped down in a fairly peaceful area. The Dutch East India Company established a toehold in Cape Town on the southwestern tip of modern South Africa. There, they encountered a group called the Khoikhoi who used the land to graze their cattle. From the start, the Dutch treated the land as theirs. On May 10, 1656, the outpost’s commander Jan van Riebeeck described his dealings with a Khoikhoi leader. "His claim to the ownership of the Cape lands could not be entertained by the Company, which had taken possession of them for its own purposes," van Riebeeck wrote in his diary (Hat tip to our colleagues at Africa Check). Cape Town’s original purpose was simply to resupply merchant ships headed to the East Indies, but over the decades, settlers turned to farming, which put them in conflict with the original inhabitants. By the end of the 1700s, a series of wars broke out with the Xhosa, a larger and more formidable foe than the Khoikhoi. Ultimately, under the British, the Xhosa were defeated in 1853. Apartheid racial categories Clearly, the story of South Africa turns on the Dutch and the British taking land from the people who were there first. There is perhaps one possible thought Coulter had. When South Africa operated under a strict regime of racial categories – the apartheid period between 1948 and 1994 – it used both "colored" and "black" to classify different groups of people. The Khoikhoi, relatively few in number, were classified as colored. In that regard, Coulter might have seen Muhatia’s reference to blacks as broad. But that would play along with the discredited credo of apartheid in racist South Africa. As the authors of a 2000 study of historic migration in Africa noted, "the biological reality of the race concept is bankrupt; the genetic and/or physical variations of hundreds of millions of people cannot be subsumed under a single term." That said, focusing on the Khoikhoi would be excessively narrow because it ignores the conflict with the Xhosa. Under apartheid, people in the Xhosa ethnic group were classified as natives, or black, and restricted to communities called bantustans. The anti-apartheid leader and later president of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a member of a Xhosa clan. (Ethnic classification continues today. Groups called "coloured" under the old regime are now counted as "black" for economic empowerment and labor relations purposes.) Beyond the western areas of South Africa where the Dutch influence was greatest, other groups predated the colonizers by over 1,000 years. One analysis from an international group of archeologists found that farming by Bantu-speaking groups reached South Africa about 2,000 years ago. So Coulter’s focus on the Dutch ignored what was going on in the rest of the region. Our ruling Coulter said that Dutch settlers were in South Africa before black people. This is plainly wrong. Bantu-speaking groups farmed in the eastern regions of modern South Africa perhaps as much as a millennium before the Dutch arrived. In the west where the Dutch settled, other indigenous group lived on the land that the Dutch then claimed. This claim defies logic and history. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-10085	"The McCain campaign is roughly in the position where Vice President Gore was running against President Bush one week before the election of 2000."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/john-mccain/mccain-is-further-back-than-gore-was/	(Published Oct. 24, 2008) Sen. John McCain's chief strategist sought to downplay his candidate's deficit in the polls, comparing the current election to a contest so close it ended up in the Supreme Court. "The McCain campaign is roughly in the position where Vice President Gore was running against President Bush one week before the election of 2000,” Steve Schmidt, McCain’s chief strategist, was quoted as saying on the front page of the Oct. 23, 2008 New York Times . “We have ground to make up, but we believe we can make it up.” The same day's Washington Post front page featured a similar argument by unnamed McCain advisers: "Advisers believe the contest's margin is in the five-to-seven-point range, about the same deficit, they say, that then-Vice President Al Gore faced at this time eight years ago against then-Gov. George W. Bush," the paper reported. Because Schmidt was so specific in the New York Times with his "one week before the election" comparison, we'll start there. Election Day 2000 was Nov. 7. A week prior would be Tuesday, Oct. 31. Let's see how Gore was doing in the polls around that time. We averaged the results of the five polls we could find released right around Nov. 1 – three different tracking polls for ABC News , CBS News and CNN /USA Today /Gallup, as well as surveys from MSNBC/Reuters/Zogby and Pew Research Center – and found Bush at 46.8 percent to Gore's 43. Those polls included third-party candidate Ralph Nader. Data from political scientists Christopher Wlezien from Temple University and Robert Erikson from Columbia University on the averages of all major polls show Gore trailing by 3 points in a two-man contest with Bush seven days before the election. So Gore trailed by about 3 to 4 points a week before the 2000 election. How does that compare to how McCain is doing now? As of early afternoon on Oct. 24, 2008, three Web sites that each average a wide array of national polls, Pollster.com, Realclearpolitics.com and Fivethirtyeight.com, had McCain down 8.2, 7.4 and 7.2 points respectively – about twice the deficit Gore faced. "Obviously they (the McCain campaign) are simply looking at the map through red-colored glasses," said Larry Sabato, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia. There are, to be sure, isolated polls that bode well for McCain. For example, a recent Associated Press poll had Obama at 44 percent and McCain at 43 percent, essentially a tie, given the 3.5 percentage point margin of error. But that poll is so out of line with most others that experts largely discount it. "Bad polls happen and you shouldn't get too excited about one unusual poll," said Charles Franklin, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and co-developer of Pollster.com. Averages are far more trustworthy, Franklin said. This chart he compiled of polling trends from 2000, 2004 and 2008, shows vividly the dramatic gap between how McCain was doing as of Oct. 4, 2008, and how Gore was doing in 2000. (Franklin provided us an updated version of the chart by e-mail; the gap has since narrowed only slightly.) Franklin also checked his data for the span of the past two weeks, a wider time frame than the snapshot we looked at above to cover the comment to the Washington Post about how the campaigns compared "at this time." He found: "This year, Obama leads during these two weeks by an average of 7.1 points. In 2000 the Bush lead was an average of 3.1 points." Again, McCain's deficit is more than double Gore's. We don't mean to suggest that McCain can't come back and win the election. The question we sought to answer was this: Is McCain running in about the same position that Gore was at this point in the 2000 election, as the McCain campaign says? Simply put, no. We find McCain's claim to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-12-03T00:00:00	2008-10-23	['George_W._Bush', 'Al_Gore', 'John_McCain']
pomt-00559	Says Jeb Bush "happens to be where a majority" of Republican voters are on giving legal status to illegal immigrants.	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/14/george-will/jeb-bush-and-majority-republicans-actually-agree-i/	As Jeb Bush readies his push to win the Republican nomination, one of the charges he has to fend off is that he lacks conservative zeal. The issue popped up June 14, 2015, on Fox News Sunday, when a viewer suggested in a note to the show that Bush seems like more of a Democrat than a Republican. Conservative columnist George Will sprang to Bush’s defense. On cutting taxes and government as governor of Florida, and on social issues, Will said Bush was every bit a conservative as President Ronald Reagan, and maybe more. Will downplayed Bush’s electoral challenge even on the hot button issue of immigration. "He happens to be where a majority of Republicans are," Will said. "His (position) is a pathway to legal status." For the record, Bush’s position on immigration has been complicated. But Bush’s most recent comments suggest a pathway to legal status, so we think Will’s point is fair. The question is: Do most Republicans favor a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants like Bush now does? We looked at what the polls say. The latest report from the Pew Research Center bolsters Will’s claim. Pew’s survey found that 56 percent of Republicans favor a path to legal status, not to be confused with citizenship. Legal status would allow undocumented adults to work and pay taxes, but they would not be able to vote. However, George Hawley, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, cautions that the Pew survey also shows a complicated set of attitudes. "A majority of Republicans also felt that giving people who came to the United States illegally a way to gain legal status is like rewarding them for doing something wrong," Hawley said. "Further, 42 percent of Republicans felt legal immigration should be decreased, compared to 21 percent who think it should be increased. Also, far more Republicans view immigrants as a burden, 63 percent, than view them as an asset for the country, 27 percent." At the end of the day, Hawley said he wouldn’t call Will’s statement inaccurate, but it might be misleading. "I would describe Republicans as ambivalent on questions relating to immigration policy," Hawley said. Timing matters Republican support for a path toward legal status has held a slim majority, but there’s been an ebb and flow in the margin depending on the news of the day. When President Barack Obama announced last December that he would hold off deportation for a larger number of undocumented immigrants, feelings among Republicans hardened. A December 2014 poll by Pew saw an 11 percentage point drop in support between the beginning and the end of the year. A majority of Republicans still supported legalized status, 53 percent, but it had been as high as 64 percent. The drop put support within the 5 percent margin of error. Still, older surveys even show that Republicans could get behind the more contentious goal of citizenship. A 2013 Fox News poll found that 56 percent of GOP voters endorsed a path to citizenship with various conditions such as paying back taxes and learning English. Stephen Nuno is a political scientist at Northern Arizona University. "Republicans generally see mass deportation to be unrealistic, so the strength of their support is usually conditional on the terms of legality, whether it be penalties, stronger border security, and so on," Nuno said. Nuno also said that when Republicans feel better about the economy, they tend to take a more pragmatic view on undocumented immigrants, and support for legalized status goes up. Primary voters There is however the question of views among Republican primary voters who generally take a tougher position. One indication of where they stand comes from the 2014 election. According to exit polls reported by National Journal, 57 percent of Republican voters felt that undocumented immigrants should be deported, while just 38 percent favored legal status. More recently, an NBC/Marist poll of likely Republican voters in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina probed whether voters could support a candidate who endorsed a path to citizenship. In Iowa, Republicans were evenly split, while in New Hampshire and South Carolina, a slim majority said such a candidate would be unacceptable. It’s important to note that the question was about citizenship, not legal status. Our ruling Will said that a majority of Republicans support Bush’s stance to craft a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Polls show that more than half of Republicans do hold that view. Republican positions have shifted over time and Republican primary voters might take a harder line than the typical Republican voter. With those caveats in mind, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11053	"Pat Morrisey joined a federal lawsuit to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/26/joe-manchin/did-patrick-morrisey-join-lawsuit-allow-insurers-d/	Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- a vulnerable Democratic Senator in a state that Donald Trump won by more than 40 points in 2016 -- is accusing his Republican opponent of seeking to take away health insurance protections for people who have pre-existing conditions. In a tweet, Manchin said that Patrick Morrisey, the state’s elected attorney general and the GOP’s nominee for the Senate seat, "joined a federal lawsuit to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Historically, getting rid of pre-existing condition protections is an unpopular view. A March 2018 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that 84 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of independents and 59 percent of Republicans favor keeping insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions more for health insurance, which is the existing policy under Obama’s 2010 health care law. Indeed, Manchin tweeted about the issue several other times recently and launched an online petition effort. So is Manchin correct that Morrisey "joined a federal lawsuit to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions"? Pretty much, yes. About the lawsuit Manchin is referring to a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Texas on Feb. 26, 2018. The lawsuit was signed by 18 attorneys general and two governors, all of them Republicans. The suit challenges the Affordable Care Act, arguing that "the ACA is unlawful" and seeking to enjoin, or block, its operation. One of the attorney generals who signed onto the lawsuit is Morrisey: He is listed as a signatory on a court document in the case dated as recently as June 20, 2018, or two days before Manchin's tweet. We could not find any subsequent statement by Morrisey that he had withdrawn his support for the legal action. Here’s the gist of the lawsuit’s argument. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the law’s individual mandate to purchase health insurance by saying it was enforced by a tax penalty. But in 2017, Congress repealed the mechanism to enforce the individual mandate through the tax code. The lawsuit contends that -- with the tax penalty now gone -- the individual mandate is no longer constitutional and, as a result, the law should be either largely or entirely thrown out. If granted, would the lawsuit end the pre-existing condition protections under the ACA? Yes, say health policy specialists. "There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome," said Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute. Blumberg said that if you got rid of insurance regulations like those in the ACA and then tried to require insurers to cover all comers -- a policy known as "guaranteed issue" -- then "insurers would respond by setting their premiums so high" that they’d be out of reach for most customers, and/or "offer extremely high deductibles and other types of out-of-pocket requirements." The impact of a court ruling would take time to filter through the health insurance system, but the scale is potentially large. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis found that "52 million non-elderly adults had pre-existing conditions that would have made them uninsurable prior to passage of the ACA." "Manchin is addressing what is probably the major implication of the lawsuit," rather than just "a detail," said Christine Eibner, health policy analyst with the RAND Corp. Usually, the federal government would defend an existing law in court, but the Trump administration has decided to take the attorney generals’ side in the case. Morrrisey's camp fired back at what it said was the implication of Manchin's tweet -- that Morrisey opposes protections for pre-existing conditions. He doesn't, and he wants them restored in whatever comes next. While Morrisey believes that law should be repealed, "help should be provided to those who need it most, including those with pre-existing conditions," said Nathan Brand, a spokesman for the Morrisey campaign. It’s worth noting that the lawsuit is still a long way from success. "My guess is that the Supreme Court may take a pass on this, and for sure it won’t be going anywhere before the 2018 elections," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. That said, Manchin’s tweet didn’t say that pre-existing condition protections are going to be eliminated immediately. Rather, he tweeted that Morrisey had joined a lawsuit that sought that end. Our ruling Manchin said, "Pat Morrisey joined a federal lawsuit to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions." Morrisey told PolitiFact that he supports some form of protection for those with pre-existing conditions. Nevertheless, Morrisey did join a lawsuit filed by numerous state Republican officials that asks a court to rule all or part of the 2010 health care law unconstitutional and to prevent the enactment of rules, regulations or other actions under the law. Various health-policy specialists agreed that such a decision from the court would effectively eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The statement ia accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joe Manchin	None	None	None	2018-06-26T14:25:51	2018-06-22	['None']
pomt-13703	Florida retirees and families "lost tens of thousands of dollars" in deposits on failed Trump condo projects, but he "pocketed their money and walked away."	/florida/statements/2016/jul/28/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/	Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine questioned Donald Trump’s business ethics, saying the Republican presidential candidate swindled customers in a past real estate deal in the Sunshine State. "Retirees and families in Florida — they believed Donald Trump when he said he'd build them some condos. Thousands of them," Kaine said on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. "They paid their deposits, but the condos, they were never built. He just pocketed their money and walked away. They lost tens of thousands of dollars, all because they believed Donald Trump." A Kaine spokesman told us the senator was referring to not one, but two failed condo projects: One in Tampa and one in Fort Lauderdale. Trump’s campaign did not respond. We wanted to know if people lost tens of thousands of dollars in deposits while Trump took the money without consequence. Since there are two projects, we’ll take them one at a time. Trump Tower Tampa In 2004, at the height of the Tampa real estate boom, local developers incorporated under the name SimDag/Robel contacted Trump to ask him to partner on a condo tower they wanted to build. The group eventually reached a licensing agreement with Trump: He would lend his name to Trump Tower Tampa for $2 million plus a percentage of condo sales. The document stipulated that neither the developers nor Trump would "under any circumstances disclose or permit to be disclosed the existence of this agreement.'' No one would know Trump’s involvement was in name only. Trump announced the deal on Jan. 10, 2005, saying he would "partner" with SimDag/Robel to build a 52-story, 190-unit condo tower in downtown Tampa. (Less than two weeks later, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss in a Palm Beach wedding attended by now-rival Hillary Clinton.) The next month, Trump and his new bride attended a sales launch in Tampa. Trump told reporters at a gala reception with 600 guests that he had a "substantial stake" in the project and that units were selling well. Now, it’s here we’ll note that Kaine said in his speech there were "thousands of them," which his spokesman said was referring to thousands of dollars. By the time Trump came to Tampa, customers had placed sizable deposits on all 190 units, which cost between $700,000 and $6 million. The amount of those deposits varied depending on the unit. With 190 units, Kaine’s description of the customers as "retirees and families" is a plausible definition. Tampa Bay Times reporter Susan Taylor Martin noted customers included doctors, NFL coaches, a video game developer and more. Under the sales agreement, half of the deposit cash went into an escrow account, while the other half went to construction costs. But the project ran over budget quickly. The site required a redesign of the foundation, and construction issues soon ballooned the cost of the project from initially being $227 million to $300 million. In 2006, the developers held a groundbreaking, but had yet to secure financing. Trump’s licensing agreement was modified that year, giving him $4 million but conceding a cut of the sales. SimDag/Robel stopped paying, and Trump sued in May 2007, claiming he was owed $1.03 million in licensing fees. That lawsuit was the first indication for buyers that Trump was only slapping his name on the project. SimDag/Robel countersued Trump for breaking the confidentiality of the licensing agreement by complaining publicly about the project. Trump and the developers settled in 2008. SimDag/Robel called off the entire project and declared bankruptcy. Buyers, meanwhile, were out of luck. While the escrow half of their deposits was returned, the other half had been eaten up by construction costs. Some customers were out as much as $250,000 or more. Several dozen buyers sued Trump in 2009, arguing that they had been misled with "fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations" that the billionaire was more involved with the project bearing his name. Within three years, the buyers in the lawsuit reached settlements. Some were repaid as little as $11,115, according to the Times. Other buyers not a part of the suit received nothing. Jay McLaughlin, a physical therapist from Connecticut, told the Times he lost almost $90,000. An attorney named Mary Ann Stiles told the newspaper she was out $200,000. Other investors who gave SimDag/Robel money said they lost six- and seven-figure sums. Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale A similar scenario played out on Florida’s Atlantic coast, when Trump struck a secretive deal with a group of developers to lend his name to a building. The Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale was slated to be a 24-story, 298-unit condo hotel, in which owners rent out their units like hotel rooms. When the project was unveiled in 2004, units cost between $500,000 and $3 million, with 20 percent deposits required. Buyers were wooed with brochures touting Trump’s involvement, including one in which Trump said the resort was "the finest and most luxurious experience I have created." Units sold well through 2006, and these deposits were split the same way as Trump Tower Tampa. Also like Tampa, construction costs soon spiraled out of control. The building was slated to be finished by December 2007 but was nowhere near done. Then one of the developing partners, Bayrock Group, sold its interest to an Icelandic investment firm for $50 million. The following year, Trump began to voice major concerns to development partner Roy Stillman of SB Hotel Associates that work wasn’t being completed, despite some $140 million being spent on construction. The real estate market began its tailspin and the partners had difficulty securing more financing. In 2009, Trump decided to strip his name off the project after Stillman attempted to close with buyers to get more money, even though the building wasn’t yet completed. With $185 million in debt and no billionaire name recognition, Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale was dead. What Trump actually made on this deal is much more obscure, because the entire project ended in more than a dozen lawsuits among Trump, the developers and the buyers. (Lawsuits against Trump also have resulted in other developments in which Trump licensed his name in places like Canada, Hawaii and Mexico.) One depositor, Naraine Seecharan, told the Miami Herald he was recovering from the removal of a brain tumor when he learned about the fate of his $289,000 down payment. J. Michael Goodson of New Jersey said he put down $345,000 and sued Trump. Pembroke Pines attorney Joseph Altschul represented more than 70 clients who said they had paid about $8 million in deposits. In all, more than 100 buyers filed lawsuits. CFLB Partnership bought the unfinished project in 2013 for $115 million, finishing the building and renaming it the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Resort & Residences. Trump and the developers continued to argue. Trump also sued the developers, saying he lost millions in licensing and hotel management fees over the deal. He maintained in the various lawsuits he held no liability, while the partners struggled to reach settlements with buyers. (Trump’s attorneys also got in trouble for hiding a $5 million insurance policy to help cover lawsuits for making misleading statements.) "Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers," Trump said in a 2013 deposition. "We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer." Trump and his affiliated companies have not been found at fault in the Fort Lauderdale lawsuits, thanks to contract language that stated Trump’s involvement was in name only. His legal team maintained the suits against him were more about Trump’s money and anger over the housing crash. The billionaire maintained that buyers were better off losing deposit money than taking more of a bath in a bad real estate investment, as the condos were worth roughly half what people would have paid in full. In one 2014 trip to the witness stand, he said someone would have to be "very stupid" to have still attempted to buy a condo in the building after the real estate crash. "Only a fool would have closed under those circumstances," Trump said. In April 2016, a Florida appeals court ruled on the last two active cases seeking deposits. The three-judge-panel upheld prior findings that Trump did not misrepresent his role in the development. Our ruling Kaine said Florida retirees and families "lost tens of thousands of dollars" in deposits on failed Trump condo projects, but he "pocketed their money and walked away." It’s clear that many buyers, whatever their occupation or familial status, indeed lost at least that much in the failed Trump projects in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. Some were further compensated partially with settlements after suing the billionaire. Whether Trump cheated them is another matter. While his licensing agreements with the developers were secret, he was entitled to a certain amount of money for putting his name on the building. He was sued by several dozen angry buyers and either settled or was found not at fault, which is not the same as walking away without addressing the problems. Kaine’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b0c3e425-5851-49f6-9bec-ecace6975c3c	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-07-28T20:15:17	2016-07-27	['None']
pomt-10404	"Ronald Reagan met with Gorbachev; Kennedy met with Khruschev; and Nixon met with Mao — and these were folks who have done horrendous damage not only to their own countries but to other countries."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/04/barack-obama/yes-but-you-cant-lump-gorbachev-with-mao/	Sen. John McCain has been putting the heat to Sen. Barack Obama for the senator's willingness to meet with the leaders of enemy nations "without any preconditions." Obama has countered that principled, strong involvement is a better option than President Bush's failed approach of not reaching out, which he says has made countries like Iran stronger. Obama has also pointed to the history of American diplomacy, saying on May 20, 2008: "Ronald Reagan met with Gorbachev; Kennedy met with Khruschev; and Nixon met with Mao — and these were folks who have done horrendous damage not only to their own countries but to other countries." First, those meetings did take place. And they happened without any public demand by the American presidents that action be taken by the other side before the sitdowns could occur, according to scholars of U.S. diplomacy with the Soviet Union and China. In fact, in the case of Nixon's 1972 meeting with Mao, there's evidence that the Chinese were the ones with demands, making it clear America would have to lay off the question of Taiwanese sovereignty if it wanted to meet, said Robert Sutter, a visiting professor at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. Nikolas Gvosdev, editor of the National Interest and a senior fellow at the Nixon Center, said there were no public demands that the Soviet Union make concessions or change policy as a condition for Kennedy's 1961 summit with Khruschev or for the Reagan/Gorbachev talks, the first held in 1985. If you define the idea of "preconditions" more loosely as diplomatic agreements that set the agenda and parameters of such high-level talks between heads of state, then that certainly did happen, Gvosdev said. Obama hinted at this latter approach during the May 20 appearance, saying, "Keep in mind, I have never said that I would somehow have meetings with these folks right away, that there wouldn't by any preparation for them." Obama should have been more careful, however, about how he characterized those leaders whom American presidents met with. There's a strong consensus among scholars that Mao ranks among the great tyrants of the 20th century, who did indeed cause "horrendous damage" to his country and others. Khruschev is both loathsome and admirable, scholars say. He did have blood on his hands as Stalin's deputy in the Ukraine and the move to crush the Hungarian uprising in 1956. But he also freed prisoners from the Gulags and had a record as a reformist. As for Gorbachev, his reforms sparked domestic disorder and a hard-liner could argue that as a younger man he helped perpetuate an evil system, but even Reagan gave him credit for bringing about the end of the Cold War, as does history. Gorbachev is "not in a class with Khruschev who is not in a class with Mao when it comes to damaging his own country and the world," said William Taubman, a professor of political science at Amherst College who won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Khruschev in 2004. Stephen F. Cohen, a professor for Russian and Slavic studies at New York University, said Obama should have stuck to the thrust of his argument, that American presidents had a record of meeting with antagonistic heads of state, rather than getting into details. "I think he violated a rule of political campaigning," Cohen said. "Be as imprecise as possible when making generalizations." So while Obama is right that American presidents have met with some contentious leaders, he's wrong to say that they all had horrendous records. Gorbachev stands out as the strongest exception. We give Obama a Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-06-04T00:00:00	2008-05-20	['Mikhail_Gorbachev', 'Richard_Nixon', 'Nikita_Khrushchev', 'Ronald_Reagan', 'John_F._Kennedy']
pomt-10559	"Everything I have said (on the campaign trail) has been factually accurate."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/12/bill-clinton/clinton-distorted-obamas-position/	While campaigning for his wife in Maine, a reporter asked former President Bill Clinton about some of the criticism he has received on the trail. Rob Caldwell of the local NBC affliate WCSH-TV in Portland asked Clinton, "You have been praised for your campaigning for her; you have been criticized for it. Do you have any regrets about the way you have conducted yourself on the campaign trail in the past months? Any regrets about anything you've said or done?" Clinton began by saying, "Well, everything I have said has been factually accurate. But I think the mistake that I made is to think that I was a spouse like any other spouse who could defend his candidate. I think I can promote Hillary but not defend her because I was president." He went on to complain that critics have mischaracterized his comments in South Carolina as personal attacks on Sen. Barack Obama. Clinton is wrong when he says everything he said has been factually accurate. We found inaccuracies in his comments about Obama's position on Iraq. Clinton said that Obama claimed the same position on the Iraq war as George W. Bush. But that's a selective quote on comments Obama made about the need to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the Iraq invasion once it had commenced. We rated Clinton's statement Half True; read it here ). We also found Clinton was flat-out wrong when he slammed Obama for remarks about Ronald Reagan. Clinton criticized Obama for saying "the Republicans had all the good ideas." What Obama actually said was "I think it's fair to say the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom." Read our extended analysis on Clinton's charge here . We rate it False. And it's not just us: The Washington Post's Factchecker blog awarded the former president two Pinocchios for the same statements we looked at about Obama. So we find Clinton's superlative — "everything I have said has been factually accurate" — to be False.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2008-02-12T00:00:00	2008-02-07	['None']
pomt-06529	The Arab Spring … "drove up gas prices."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-arab-spring-sent-gas-prices-high/	During an Oct. 6, 2011, press conference, President Barack Obama defended his handling of the economy. "With respect to the state of the economy," Obama said, "there is no doubt that growth has slowed. I think people were much more optimistic at the beginning of this year. But the combination of a Japanese tsunami, the Arab Spring, which drove up gas prices, and most prominently (economic turmoil in) Europe, I think, has gotten businesses and consumers very nervous. And we did not help here in Washington with the debt ceiling debacle that took place, a bit of game-playing that was completely unnecessary, completely unprecedented in terms of how we dealt with our responsibilities here in Washington." We’ll take a look at one portion of his comment -- that the Arab Spring, the grass-roots democratic movement that swept the Middle East and North Africa in early 2011, "drove up gas prices." We found that he's correct that the Arab Spring did have an impact on oil prices but that it was just one of many factors. We began by looking at weekly price data for both crude oil and gasoline collected by the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s repository of energy statistics. During the first week of January 2011, a barrel of crude oil on the world market cost $91.04. By mid February, when Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power, the price had risen to $96.25, an increase of just under 6 percent. And how about gasoline prices? During the first week of January 2011, a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. cost $3.12. By mid February, the price had risen to $3.19 -- an increase of only about 2 percent. But the increase did come, just a little later than it did for crude oil. By the first week of April, the price had risen to $3.74, making the total increase for the year almost 20 percent. "The president is right in part," said John B. Townsend II, the manager of public and government affairs at AAA-Mid Atlantic. "Though it started in the dead of winter, the spreading upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East drove up pump prices." However, many of the experts we spoke to also cautioned against oversimplification. One caveat they raised is that the world oil market is complex and it’s hard to single out one factor as the reason for a price increase. "While reduced supply in general does put upward pressure on prices, there are so many influences on price at the pump that pointing to one factor -- the Arab Spring -- is a gross oversimplification," said Eric Wohlschlegel, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute. Asked what the biggest factors in rising prices were, John Felmy, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil companies' trade group, joked that "there are three of them: China, China and China." Along with a number of other developing nations, China is growing so fast that its demand for oil is pushing up prices even though the U.S. and other western nations are seeing economic stagnation. In fact, the timing of the price rises suggest that the Arab Spring may have had a modest effect within a much longer period of generally rising prices, rather than a sudden, jarring spike during the apex of the protests. For a full year before the Arab Spring arrived, the price of oil had already been rising steadily. From January 2010 to January 2011, the price of a barrel of crude rose from $75.55 to $91.04, or a full 20 percent increase. Gasoline prices, too, were already on a long-term upward trajectory. In January 2010, a gallon cost $2.72. A year later it was at $3.12 -- an increase of 15 percent. While Felmy agreed that the Arab Spring played a role, he added that the oil markets "saw a pretty consistent rise from September of 2010 through early February." It’s also worth noting that the price increase, in retrospect, likely stemmed more from speculative worries than actual ones. In a news release issued around the time of the protests, AAA cited fear of a possible "chain reaction of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East could disrupt oil production in the region and cause oil-rich regimes to teeter, totter or topple." Ultimately, such fears didn’t come to pass. Most of the countries hit by major popular protests are minor players in the world oil market. In 2010, Egypt ranked 29th in the world in oil production, Syria ranked 34th, Yemen ranked 38th and Tunisia ranked 53rd, according to the CIA World Factbook. The one exception is Libya, which ranked 18th in the world. And experts say that Libya is pretty much the only tangible -- as opposed to speculative -- reason the markets moved as they did. "The Arab Spring did result in higher gasoline prices, for one specific reason: It took almost all of Libya’s 1.6 million barrels per day of supply off the market," said John Kingston, the director of news for Platts, a publisher that specializes in coverage of energy markets. "That is a significant amount of oil, and it is oil of the highest quality -- low sulfur, and with a very good yield of transportation fuels like diesel and gasoline." Kingston suggested that Obama might have been more accurate had he said that prices rose due to the Libyan uprising specifically. "It’s hard to argue that what went on in Tunisia or Syria" made much of a difference, he said. "But Libya resulted in an actual loss of crude output." Our ruling Obama is right that the Arab Spring was a factor in the increase in gasoline prices. But it's important to note that prices were rising before the democratic movements began. And experts say that while there was some impact on prices, the overall increase is the result of many factors. We rate Obama's claim Half True.

pomt-09749	The Baucus health care bill would require taxes on medical devices such as X-ray machines, female condoms, HIV tests and surgical needles.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/09/blog-posting/conservative-blogger-says-proposed-tax-could-hit-w/	Republicans often complain that the Democratic health care bills would impose a heavy tax burden on Americans. So when the Senate Finance Committee began considering a tax on medical devices — including some modest devices such as enema kits and breast pumps — it was no surprise that conservatives would use the tax to rally opposition. Initially, the Finance panel was planning to subject all medical devices to the tax. (Technically this would be a tax on companies that make devices, based on their market share, rather than an excise tax on individual units.) But an outcry that it would lead to "tampon taxes" and "Q-tip taxes" led the committee's chairman, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., to shift course. He decided to apply the tax rules based on the three medical device categories determined by the Food and Drug Administration. These categories align roughly with how complex and risky the devices are. When the bill was unveiled on Sept. 16, 2009, Baucus said it would exempt items labeled Class I by the FDA, things such as enema kits and elastic bandages. Those items, which account for 47 percent of all devices, are often inexpensive and are defined as "present(ing) minimal potential for harm to the user" by the FDA. But critics continued to argue that including all Class II devices — which rank between Class I and III in complexity and risk — would still mean imposing a tax on a host of inexpensive items that could ultimately be passed on to consumers. So Sept. 22, 2009, Baucus exempted from the tax all Class II items costing less than $100. (Class III items — the 10 percent that "sustain or support life, are implanted, or present potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury" — have always been subject to Baucus' proposed tax.) This eased the attacks somewhat, but not entirely. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., offered an amendment to eliminate the tax altogether, but on Oct. 1, 2009, it failed by a 10-13 vote. Then, on Oct. 7, 2009, blogger Meredith Jessup on the conservative Web site TownHall.com cited work by a Washington Times columnist to show a wide range of items that she said would still be taxed despite Baucus' revision. " Washington Times columnist Amanda Carpenter has looked into the matter and found that new moms who want to use a powered breast pump to bottle milk for their babies will have to pay this excise tax," Jessup wrote. "These pumping devices, Carpenter points out, typically retail for more than $100. In addition, other items used by both men and women — including 'pacemakers, ventilators, X-ray machines, powered wheelchairs and surgical needles — will be taxed too.' ... So what else is on this list of items to be taxed? Lots of things, including dentures, fetal cell-screening kits, female condoms (I'm surprised there aren't angry 'feminists' taking to the streets over this one), tests for syphilis and HIV, hip, knee, ankle and breast prosthetics, dialysis catheters, mammograms and sickle-cell anemia tests." We found many other conservative bloggers have made similar claims. We turned to the FDA's Web site to determine which items would be subject to the tax. We found that the following items would still be subject to the current version of the proposed tax, either because they're rated Class III or because they're considered Class II and cost more than $100: powered breast pumps; tests for HIV; pacemakers; ventilators; X-ray machines; powered wheelchairs; hip, knee, ankle and breast prosthetics; and dentures. Many dialysis catheters are rated Class III, and the female condom is Class III. (Male condoms are Class II — go figure.) Assuming Jessup meant "mammography machines" rather than "mammograms," then you can add that to the list as well. It's a bit more complicated to determine the taxability of the remaining four that Jessup mentioned. Tests for sickle-cell anemia and syphilis are both categorized as Class II, and a Web search turned up prices well below $100 per test, suggesting that both would be exempt. Meanwhile, most surgical needles are rated Class I or Class II, and the one fetal-cell screening kit rated by the FDA is considered Class II; for both the needles and the fetal-cell kit, we were unable to find price quotes on the Internet. Based on this information alone, these products would seem likely to avoid the tax. However, congressional aides said that the final details about what's covered and not covered remain to be written. One possibility is that all Class II items that are generally sold directly to hospitals or doctors' offices, rather than to consumers directly, could be subject to the tax, even if they cost less than $100. Most likely, the Treasury Department would be responsible for providing final guidance — perhaps even a list of specific items — on which items fall into which category. So it's possible the four items above could eventually be hit by the tax. So Jessup is correct about most of the items she cites: They would be subject to the tax. A few others she cites would not fall under the committee's latest definition for the tax, but the practical details of the bill right now are not yet settled, so it's possible that they will be taxed eventually. We should also add that the tax may not necessarily be included in the final health care bill that will be crafted from the various versions in different committees. But for now, the provision remains part of the Senate Finance bill. On balance, we rate Jessup's assertion Mostly True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2009-10-09T14:20:10	2009-10-07	['Max_Baucus']
pomt-13217	"Donald Trump's education plan to dramatically slash funding for public education would fire 49,000 Texas teachers."	/texas/statements/2016/oct/20/progress-texas/progress-texas-makes-unfounded-claim-about-donald-/	Sometimes Donald Trump says that if elected president, he’ll eliminate the federal Department of Education. However, that goal wasn’t part of the education plan he laid out last month. So we were curious when Progress Texas, a liberal-leaning education and advocacy group, attributed dire consequences to Trump’s education plan. The group opened a Sept. 20, 2016, blog post: "He doesn't always talk about policy, but when he does -- it's also terrible. Donald Trump's education plan to dramatically slash funding for public education would fire 49,000 Texas teachers." Trump’s plan So, what does Trump want to do? For our part, we confirmed instances of the Republican presidential nominee saying he could shutter or shrink the 4,400-employee, $68 billion education department. The agency, founded in 1980, says it focuses on distributing federal aid, collecting student performance data and ensuring equal access to schools. In Texas of late, federal aid of late covers more than 10 percent of school spending. On Fox News Sunday in October 2015, Trump was asked if he would cut agencies. Trump replied that he favors "local education" and that "I may cut Department of Education." In April 2016 on Fox News’ Hannity, the candidate called the department "massive, and it can be largely eliminated." But Trump also said, "you maybe want to have a little bit of tentacles out there." Then again, Trump’s formal education initiatives, unveiled in September 2016, don’t mention shrinking or eliminating the department, stressing instead his vow to enable children to attend the public, charter or private school of their choice starting by reprioritizing $20 billion in federal funds. Trump didn’t say where the funds would come from; an Education Week news story on his plan said "it's possible he was referring to Title I money for disadvantaged students, funded at about $15.5 billion right now." Also not in the posted plan: Any statement about cutting teachers in any state including Texas, which has more than 320,000 teachers. Texas group cites speculative study When we asked Progress Texas how the group reached its count of 49,000 potentially doomed teachers, Phillip Martin replied by email that the group relied on a report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning Washington-based think tank. Worth noting: The report, which came out Sept. 1, 2016--before Trump laid out his education platform--draws from Trump the month before telling a reporter for Circa, a video-centric news service, that "we're going to be cutting the Department of Education big league." Circa's story didn’t quote Trump talking about teachers. But the center’s report states: "To calculate the number of teachers who could potentially lose their job as a result of Trump’s proposal, the author added the most recent average teacher salary by state figures from the National Center for Education Statistics to the representative statistic of costs associated with education and health-services occupations from the Department of Labor. Subsequently, the author divided the total dollar amount each state receives for elementary and secondary education from the Department of Education by the above sum," it says. We clicked through to an education department presentation of state-by-state aid, finding that for fiscal 2016, Texas school districts would receive $3,228,065,364 across 19 program elementary and secondary education categories topped by $1.3 billion in grants to local educational agencies. By phone, the center’s Will Ragland told us the center sought to show what the potential impact would be if all Department of Education funds disappeared; the center reached its figure of 49,045 teachers for Texas by assuming the cut funds would play out entirely in lost teaching jobs--a calculation that we confirmed. "His plan wasn’t very specific," Ragland said. Nationally, federal funds cover about 8 percent of school district budgets and such aid flows to specific programs, such as to benefit low-income students, students with disabilities, computer science programs or early childhood education, according to the Department of Education website. Experts say it's speculation Experts we asked about the center’s teachers-vamoosed conclusion saw flaws. By phone, Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University associate professor, told us that 70 percent of more than $3 billion in federal education funds spent in Texas in 2014-15 went to payroll. But, Taylor noted, that spending could include all positions, ranging from administrative assistants to speech therapists to teachers. In contract, to get to the center’s 49,000 teacher count, Taylor said, you have to inaccurately assume that 100 percent of federal revenues are spent on teacher payrolls--plus that every penny of it would be eliminated under Trump’s plan. Taylor added that even if Trump moved to shutter the department, it’s unlikely the government would eliminate funding for popular programs that serve low-income children or students with disabilities. "It’s not politically possible," she said by phone. "I believe the estimates are overblown," she said. For out-of-state perspective, we reached Kevin Welner, director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. Welner told us by email he doesn’t "fault the authors of that report for trying to come up with estimates like this, but it’s very important to stress that, in doing so, these authors are not just adding flesh to a skeletal proposal – they necessarily have to add most of the bones." "To my knowledge," Welner said, "Trump hasn’t provided any specifics at all concerning what he would actually ‘shred’ in the realm of Department of Education programs... So the report authors had to speculate, which means it’s speculative to conclude that the plan ‘would fire 49,000 Texas teachers.’" Our ruling Progress Texas said Donald Trump’s plan would "fire" 49,000 Texas teachers. This claim rests on Trump diverting a great deal of federal aid--something Trump hasn't said he'll do, far as we can tell. Trump has said he wants to shrink the Department of Education toward more local control. However, he’s offered no specifics on what that would entail. Notably too, the education plan Trump rolled out before this claim surfaced doesn’t mention the agency or intentions of cutting teachers. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-03077	With Obamacare, "we're fixing to get hit with the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/27/saxby-chambliss/saxby-chambliss-says-obamacare-biggest-entitlement/	Part of the argument made by critics of President Barack Obama’s health care law is that the law imposes big financial commitments in perpetuity, particularly for subsidizing health insurance for Americans who otherwise couldn’t afford it. On CNN’s Crossfire, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., argued that the nation simply can’t afford this sort of ongoing entitlement. "We're fixing to get hit with the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen -- $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years," Chambliss said. (For those who aren’t familiar with this particular southernism, "fixing to" means "about to.") Is Obamacare really "the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen"? Comparing spending on entitlements between 2014 and 2023 The term "entitlement" is generally used to describe a program that provides benefits to anyone who meets certain criteria, rather than spending money doled out by Congress on an annual basis. In official budget-speak, it refers to programs deemed "mandatory." When we asked Chambliss’ office where they got the $2.6 trillion figure, a spokeswoman pointed to a calculation by the Senate Budget Committee’s Republican staff. The committee concluded that the cost of Obamacare "will amount to at least $2.6 trillion" over the 10-year period from 2014 to 2023. This calculation has sparked some dissent. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytical arm of Congress, has calculated the gross cost of Obamacare’s coverage provisions at approximately $1.8 trillion over the same 10-year period. These costs include spending on increased payments for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, subsidies for insurance purchased on the newly created marketplaces, and tax credits for small businesses. (The CBO figure would be $1.2 trillion if you exclude Medicaid and CHIP on the theory that they’re expansions of existing entitlements, rather than new entitlements.) In any case, to check the accuracy of Chambliss’ claim, it doesn’t matter whether you use the $1.8 trillion figure or the $2.6 trillion figure, because we found at least three entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- that CBO estimates will have higher costs over the same 10-year period that Chambliss was referring to. • Social Security. According to CBO, the 10-year cost of Social Security -- both old-age benefits and disability payments -- is about $11 trillion. • Medicare: The cost for Medicare, the health program that serves all Americans 65 and older, is estimated to be $8 trillion over the same 10-year period, accoring to CBO. • Medicaid: The federal share of Medicaid, the joint state-federal program to provide health care for low-income Americans, is projected to be $4.3 trillion over the same 10-year period, CBO says. Each of these three programs exceeds even the higher, $2.6 trillion estimate of Obamacare’s costs over the exact same 10-year period. But this isn’t the way Chambliss was looking at it. Chambliss’ rationale Instead, Chambliss’ office said he was referring to the initial estimated costs of those programs when they were launched. The figures cited above for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid "reference today’s outrageous costs of those programs due to many years of expansion," Chambliss’ office said in a statement. "When the American people were first given these three programs, costs were much lower." To back up this assertion, Chambliss’ office provided us with the initial cost estimates for all three programs. The estimate for Medicaid is not precisely comparable, so we’ll focus instead on Social Security and Medicare. For Social Security, we didn’t have figures for all 10 years, but we averaged the 1940, 1945 and 1950 figures and multiplied the results by 10. When we adjusted the cost for inflation, the initial 10-year estimated cost worked out to be about $34 billion in today’s dollars. That’s well below the initial 10-year cost of Obamacare. For Medicare, we did have estimates for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) between 1966 and 1975, though the estimates for Part B (medical insurance) were not in a comparable form. For Part A, we added up the first 10 years’ estimates, adjusted for inflation, and came up with a total of about $215 billion in today’s dollars. That, too, is well before the first 10 years’ costs of Obamacare. Analysis We don’t think that, for the average viewer, Chambliss’ explanation would be the most obvious understanding of what he said. We think the simplest reading of his claim is that Obamacare is "the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen," without limiting the comparison to initial cost estimates that are decades old. And even if it were, it’s not clear that the comparison Chambliss is making is valid. A somewhat better way to do it is to measure the cost as a percentage of gross domestic product, economists told us. So we took the one-year average for each program’s initial 10-year period, then divided this by the midpoint year’s GDP. (We did not adjust for inflation.) We found that during its first 10 years, Social Security, on average, accounted for 0.1 percent of the 1945-level GDP. The equivalent figure for Medicare, using the 1970 GDP, was 0.3 percent. And for Obamacare, using the Senate Budget Committee Republicans’ number and the CBO’s GDP projection for 2019, it worked out to 1.1 percent of GDP. The percentage is lower if you use the CBO estimate (0.8 percent of GDP) or if you use the CBO figure minus Medicaid (0.5 percent of GDP). In other words, using the GDP-adjusted calculation and conceding Chambliss’ terms, the senator from Georgia has a point. That said, there are still problems with Chambliss’ methodology. While Medicare and Obamacare are both health insurance programs, the cost of medical care has skyrocketed since the mid 1960s. So counting the 10-year costs for any medical program starting in 2014 will inevitably produce a much higher cost than the first 10 years of a medical program that started in 1966. This biases the comparison. Also, Chambliss’ comparison doesn’t factor in population growth. The universe of possible Social Security beneficiaries in 1940 -- those 65 or older -- was just 12 million. By comparison, by 2022, CBO expects 22 million people to obtain insurance on the Obamacare exchanges and an additional 17 million people to obtain insurance through the law’s expansion of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Combined, that’s a universe of beneficiaries three times larger than those who might have qualified for Social Security in 1940. So Chambliss’ comparison is not apples to apples. Our ruling Chambliss said that with Obamacare, "we're fixing to get hit with the biggest entitlement program the American taxpayers have ever seen." Measured by the most obvious standard -- whether there’s ever been a bigger entitlement program -- Obamacare is hardly the biggest. Over the next 10 years, Obamacare ranks no higher than fourth, trailing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If you use a less obvious standard -- restricting it to the initial projected costs for the first 10 years of any entitlement program -- Obamacare does rank as the biggest as a percentage of GDP, though that’s shaped by differences in population growth and medical inflation that make comparisons questionable. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Saxby Chambliss	None	None	None	2013-09-27T17:33:41	2013-09-25	['United_States']
pomt-06811	"Obamacare was patterned after (Mitt Romney's) plan in Massachusetts."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-says-obamacare-patterned-after-romneycare/	He calls it "Obamneycare." That's the word that candidate Tim Pawlenty uses to express the similarity between the 2010 national health care law signed by President Barack Obama and the 2006 Massachusetts health care law signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney. Pawlenty, a former two-term governor of Minnesota, hesitated to push that attack during a debate in June. But with the race for the Republican nomination tightening up, he made the point forcefully at the Aug. 11, 2011, debate in Ames, Iowa. "Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts. And for Mitt or anyone else to say that there aren't substantial similarities or they're not essentially the same plan, it just isn't credible. So that's why I called it Obamneycare, and I think that's a fair label, and I'm happy to call it that again tonight," Pawlenty said. So are the national health plan and the Massachusetts plan that similar? In a word, Yes. We've explored their similarities before in previous fact-checks, when liberals have made similar statements defending the Obama plan against critics who labeled it extreme. We'll review the two plans' similarities again here. • Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the federal plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two. • Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The federal law sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill isn't quite a mandate. Instead, employers pay fines only if their workers qualify for tax credits to buy insurance. • Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and national plans involve the use of voluntary "exchanges" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels. • Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the national plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. • Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. • Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. They handle the individual and small-group markets differently. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the federal law allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. Still, there are some differences between the federal law and the Massachusetts law. Two of the biggest differences: • Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The federal law makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. • Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and federal law are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the federal law, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost ("Cadillac") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things. We should note that the plans are so similar, we made a quiz, selecting passages from each plan to see if our readers could tell the difference. (Take the quiz yourself!) Pawlenty said that "Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts." In rating that statement, we noticed that Pawlenty phrased his statement carefully. He didn't say it was the same plan, but instead said that the national law was "patterned" after the Massachusetts law, and they had "substantial similarities." He's correct that the plans, thought not completely identical, are very similar in structure. They both require everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty; they both leave the current insurance system in place; they both expand coverage for the uninsured through subsidies or Medicaid. Because his statement accurately categorized the plans as similar -- but not exactly the same -- we rate Pawlenty's statement True.

pomt-13780	Says "Hillary (Clinton) wants to increase the number (of Syrian refugees) by 500 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/20/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-clinton-wants-increase-number-syrian/	On the third night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich scoffed at Hillary Clinton’s willingness to accept a substantial amount of refugees from war-torn Syria into the United States. "We know that Hillary Clinton and President Obama lie to the American people when they say they can safely screen the Syrian refugees. They cannot," Gingrich said. "And yet Hillary wants to increase the number by 500 percent. Clinton has been called out on this before — by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The basis for the claim stems from a Sept. 20, 2015, interview with Clinton on CBS' Face the Nation. Host John Dickerson asked Clinton if President Barack Obama’s plan to increase the number of Syrians allowed in the country to 10,000 was enough. (The United States had accepted about 2,000 by 2015.) Clinton said she would like to see even more refugees allowed into the country — suggesting as much as a 550 percent increase. "Look, we’re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more," Clinton said, "and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in." In a speech in December 2015, Clinton said, "It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones." She also said there had to be vigilant screening and vetting of refugees from Syria and that such process historically takes up to two years. The estimated wait checks out. Gingrich says the government cannot adequately screen Syrian refugees. The refugees admissions process actually involves the FBI as well as the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. FBI director James Comey has said there are challenges and could be gaps in any admissions process of refugees from a conflict zone. However, Gingrich failed to acknowledge the lengthy process before any refugee is admitted into the United States that includes in-person interviews, health screenings and referrals by nongovernmental agencies. (Read more about Syrian refugees in our PolitiFact Sheet.) Our ruling Gingrich said Clinton "wants to increase the number (of Syrian refugees) by 500 percent." Clinton has said she’d like the country to move from 10,000 Syrian refugees under Obama’s plan to 65,000, an increase that could be as high as 550 percent. Gingrich said the United States cannot screen the additional refugees, but that ignores the average screening process of one to two years and involving in-person interviews and NGO referrals. With that caveat, we rate Gingrich’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea5b1b52-e987-468b-9364-7878b1087b5b	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2016-07-20T23:42:19	2016-07-20	['Bill_Clinton', 'Syria']
pomt-13119	Says Russ Feingold "formed his own political group to pay himself and his staff millions."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/03/republican-party-wisconsin/did-russ-feingold-form-his-own-political-group-pay/	Russ Feingold and his staff were out of work after losing the U.S. Senate election to Ron Johnson in 2010, but many top aides found a soft landing in a pair of political groups Feingold founded. Progressives United Political Action Committee and Progressives United Inc. (a nonprofit organization) debuted shortly after the election and began raising money with promises to stand up to corporate influence in politics. But a GOP radio ad that first aired Oct. 14, 2016 alleges these groups were more about the payroll than the mission. Amid criticism of Feingold fundraising practices, the staged conversation turns to Progressives United. "Get this, he even formed his own political group to pay himself and his staff millions," a woman says. It’s a two-pronged claim that merits investigation. Did Feingold and his staffers really bring in millions of dollars from Progressives United? And do the actions of Progressives United support the claim that they were formed "to" pay the staff? Tallying the salaries The ad refers to a single political group, but Feingold formed two national groups — the PAC and the nonprofit. They "shared staff and resources" but had separate fundraising and activities, according to a description on an archived version of the Progressives United website. Feingold campaign spokesman Michael Tyler told us the PAC’s mission was to support candidates directly and indirectly while the nonprofit focused on issue advocacy, particularly "to stand up against exploding corporate influence caused by Citizens United." Since the groups shared a name, a founder and much of their leadership structure — several top aides from Feingold’s campaign worked at both — we think it’s fair to examine them together. The Progressives United PAC had a payroll of $1.1 million from 2011 until it stopped raising money in 2015, Federal Election Commission records show. The Progressives United nonprofit totaled $1.15 million in salaries from 2011 until it shut down in 2014, according to 990 forms filed with the IRS. So the tally reaches $2.25 million, enough to justify the ad’s claim of "millions." The ad doesn’t specify whether the "staff" in question refers to all Progressives United staff or only those who also worked for Feingold in the Senate or through his campaign. But it’s worth noting the groups overlapped heavily. Longtime Feingold Chief of Staff Mary Irvine was paid $317,823 from 2011-’13 between the two groups before leaving for a job at the state department. She was listed as vice president of the nonprofit. Cole Leystra, currently Feingold’s deputy campaign manager, totaled $291,209 between the groups. He was comptroller of Feingold’s campaign from 2004-’11, then executive director of the nonprofit from 2011-’15, according to his LinkedIn profile. Feingold himself was paid $77,000 by Progressives United. He received $17,500 as a "strategic and organizational management consultant" for the PAC and $59,500 from the nonprofit, where he was listed as president from 2011-’13. Examining the mission The ad claims Progressives United was formed "to" pay Feingold and his staff millions, implying a primary purpose was merely to keep staff employed. Only Feingold knows his motivation for starting the groups, and we can’t fact check intentions. But we can look at outcomes. Financial records for both groups show the majority of money raised went to salaries and administrative costs – several times higher than projected, in the case of the nonprofit. The groups spent a combined $10 million between 2011 and 2015. IRS documents submitted by the Progressives United nonprofit said half of its activities would focus on grassroots organizing, lobbying and education, and about 10% would be administration and fundraising. In reality, the more than half of the group’s expenditures each year fell into the fundraising and management/general categories, peaking at 63% in 2011. The PAC spent even more of its money in those categories. Fundraising, salaries and administrative costs accounted for 88 percent of spending in the 2012 election cycle, 97 percent in the 2014 cycle and 94 percent in the 2016 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Direct donations to candidates were between 2 percent and 7 percent of total expenditures in each two-year cycle. Republicans hold up those numbers as evidence of a shady operation. "This PAC obviously served as a campaign in waiting," said Pat Garrett, spokesman for the Wisconsin GOP. "Look who was on the PAC, look who was on the senate campaign." The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel identified nine former Feingold staffers that went on to work for one of the two groups. Likewise, eight Progressives United staffers now work for Feingold’s current campaign, the paper reported in April. There are other connections as well. The Feingold campaign bought the mailing list created by Progressives United PAC and used it to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, and Progressives United and Feingold’s campaign used the same direct mail, telemarketing and online firms. Paul Jossey, a Republican campaign finance attorney who has previously criticized Tea Party PACs for questionable practices, said the Progressives United PAC was "warehousing his top political staff in plush jobs and building up his email list for his future candidate run." He called the group a "shadow campaign." Tyler, the campaign spokesman, said Progressives United was not a stereotypical PAC that focused on donating large amounts to candidates. He noted similar groups such as Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee also reported minimal donations directly to candidates. Tyler said Progressives United focused on organizing and encouraging donors to give directly to candidates. He said those appeals led to $1.6 million in donations for various candidates. FEC records list $350,000 in direct donations to candidates, and Tyler said the rest were donations through Act Blue, a nonprofit that lets third-party groups like Progressives United set up a page to encourage members to donate directly to specific candidates. When asked for examples of action Progressives United took in support of its mission, Tyler provided a list focused largely on communications. It included a news story where Feingold was quoted on behalf of the group, a number of emails the group sent out and four examples of the group urging members to take action, including signing a petition, contacting the SEC and calling state attorneys general. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Progressives United filled a legitimate purpose as one of many groups focused on grassroots organization rather than direct donations. Green’s group also focuses on grassroots efforts. "The real point was to do the hard work of organizing," Green said of Progressives United. "It’s just honestly a degree of old-school political thinking and naiveté about how hard-working organizations are structured to look at a modern day PAC and only judge its work by the checks it cuts." Barry Burden, professor of political science at UW-Madison, said the extensive spending on staff and infrastructure don’t mean Progressives United was a sham, just that it wasn’t overly successful. "My sense is this group probably just didn’t raise as much as Feingold would have liked to spend on candidates, so nearly all of its income went toward either salaries or infrastructure or advertising," Burden said. Our rating A Wisconsin GOP radio ad said Progressives United paid Feingold and his staffers millions of dollars and was formed by Feingold essentially to do just that. IRS and election filings show the payroll did indeed top $2 million between Progressives United PAC and nonprofit, so the numbers are right. But there’s no smoking gun to show the group was formed for the purpose of paying and warehousing staff until the next campaign. Yes, records show the vast majority of money raised by Progressives United went to salaries and overhead — far more than the group itself projected. And yes, there is significant overlap between Feingold’s campaign staff and the leaders of Progressives United.

pomt-03188	The R.I. Turnpike and Bridge Authority "was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free."	/rhode-island/statements/2013/sep/01/steven-frias/commentator-steven-frias-says-once-tolls-paid-cons/	One of the most contentious issues of 2013, at least among residents of the eastern half of Rhode Island, is the question of whether there should be a toll on the new Sakonnet River Bridge. In an Aug. 14, 2013, commentary in The Providence Journal, Steven Frias, a lawyer and the state's Republican National Committeeman, argued that Rhode Island should use the revenue from its gasoline tax and motor vehicle fees exclusively to maintain its bridges and roads. We were intrigued by this statement: "When the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority was first created in 1954, it was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free." The state has always charged a toll on that span, now officially known as the Pell Bridge. We were curious about the accuracy of Frias' characterization. When we contacted Frias, he sent us 34 pages from Chapter 3390, the 1954 act creating the authority. It authorized the construction of the Newport Bridge, the acquisition of the Jamestown Bridge, and the construction of a turnpike for the bridge that could run from Connecticut, through Washington County to the Massachusetts border. It also gave the authority the right to finance, "maintain, repair and operate" any of those projects, along with the ability to issue new bonds and collect tolls of any amount at any and all points along the project. The law is silent about ending tolls on the Newport Bridge, which opened June 28, 1969, although Section 17 dictates that "No tolls shall be charged for traffic over the Jamestown Bridge after December 31, 1970." On that date, the Jamestown Bridge, which has since been replaced, was to become property of the state, without any money being owed on it. Frias, asked about his statement, focused on that section, which also says that once the authority has paid off all its bonds or set aside enough money to cover those bonds, "all other projects financed under the provisions of this act shall be transferred to the state in good condition and repair, and thereupon the authority shall be dissolved . . . " So the law did call for eventually turning everything, including the Newport Bridge, over to the state. But, once again, there is no mention of ending any other tolls. In fact, the law doesn't specifically dictate that the Newport Bridge have a toll. The authority has continued to exist to maintain the bridge, now 44 years old. RITBA chairman David Darlington said the authority currently has about $50 million in bonds that remain to be paid off, and that indebtedness is expected to continue because the state doesn't have the funds to take over and maintain the bridge. (The current bonds mature in 2017.) Frias said his statement is correct because the original legislation makes it clear that the intent was to eventually transfer ownership of the Newport Bridge to the state. The bridge would then have to be toll free, he argued, because the state, at the time, had not given itself the authority to levy tolls on roadways. "This is inherent in the law," he said. "An intent to transfer ownership of a bridge to an entity that has no legal authority to impose tolls, at the time the legislation was first enacted, is an intent to make that bridge a toll-free (bridge)." That strikes us as a stretch, especially when the law specifically talks about transferring the Jamestown Bridge to the state and making it toll free. If the act of transference automatically meant that no tolls could be charged, as Frias asserts, there would be no need to mention ending the Jamestown bridge toll. We also checked with Thomas Evans, the state librarian, who pointed out that the act creating the Mount Hope Bridge Authority, also passed in 1954, also contains language that calls for the project to be turn over to the state AND be toll free after Dec. 31, 1969. (East Bay residents will note that the bridge subsequently carried a toll until 1998.) Frias was not dissuaded. He said it was necessary to specify a date for the Jamestown and Mount Hope bridges to become toll-free because, unlike the Newport Bridge, they were in existence in 1954. "It makes no sense that the Newport Bridge would have a toll on it once it was transferred over to the state," he said. "The state had not given itself legal authority to impose a toll in 1954 (nor has it since then) therefore a bridge owned by the State is synonymous with a bridge that cannot have a toll." Legal interpretations aside, it seems that the public perception at that time was that the Newport Bridge toll would go away eventually. Frias produced a copy of an article in the March 11, 1963, edition of The Evening Bulletin, headlined "Newporters Pressing for Span." Part of it reports on arguments of "the bridge advocates," saying, "And when the new bridge finally was paid for, they add, the state would come into ownership of a valuable property, a toll-free bridge across the East Passage." Darlington said that when he was appointed to the RITBA board in 2002, "My dad said, 'Those tolls were supposed to come off that bridge when it was paid for. It has to be well paid for by now. Go down and get those tolls taken off that bridge.'" "Then, when you find out what it costs to maintain the bridges, the state doesn't have anything like the money that's required," Darlington said. "It's so enormous, and you have to focus on them year after year because if you let a bridge go three, four, or five years, you have to start planning a new bridge. So it's really not practical." Our ruling Steven Frias said that "When the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority was first created in 1954, it was supposed to exist only until the bonds used to build the Newport Bridge were paid off through tolls. Once the bonds were paid, the Newport Bridge was to be transferred to the State of Rhode Island and become toll-free." The first sentence accurately characterizes the 1954 legislation. The big question is whether the bridge was supposed to eventually be toll-free. Despite what the public believed and Frias is inferring, there was no mandate in the 1954 legislation to end tolls on the Newport Bridge once the state took ownership. Perhaps other historians have additional evidence that will cause us to rethink our ruling. But for now, while most of Frias' statement is true, the key element regarding tolls on the Newport Bridge is open to serious question. For that reason, we rule it Mostly True.

pomt-11555	"Californians are overwhelmingly against this concept of the illegal sanctuary state."	/california/statements/2018/feb/07/travis-allen/travis-allen-repeats-false-claim-californians-over/	It’s become a well-worn talking point for GOP gubernatorial candidate Travis Allen: ‘Californians overwhelmingly oppose’ sanctuary state policies. The problem? The claim is simply not backed up by the facts. We handed out a False rating when Allen made the assertion on Fox News on Jan. 2, 2018. We found four recent polls that contradicted Allen’s statement. They showed Californians generally favor cities having the ability to declare themselves sanctuaries. Two specifically found greater support than opposition for California’s sanctuary state law, which limits state and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal authorities on immigration holds, under some circumstances. Then Allen made similar claims during a Feb. 1, 2018 interview on Capital Public Radio. "Californians are overwhelmingly against this concept of the illegal sanctuary state, which simply put is sheltering people in this state who are here illegally and committing crimes while they are here with taxpayer dollars. I got to tell you, you walk down the street and ask any Californian, nobody agrees with that idea." One of the top issues in California, he added later in the interview, "is this illegal sanctuary state, which I would tell you the overwhelming majority of Californians disagree with." We examined his recent statements to see if they line up with our past False rating. "I don't care which poll you look at" Allen has pointed to a 2015 UC Berkeley survey to back up his assertion, correctly noting one response in that poll found 74 percent of respondents opposed sanctuary policies. But he continues to dismiss findings in more recent surveys that contradict his claim, including a 2017 poll by the same UC Berkeley group. On Jan. 11, 2018 during a talk at the Public Policy Institute of California, he said, "I don't care which poll you look at, whether it’s a 2015 poll or a 2017 poll, Californians do not believe in sheltering people who are here in the state illegally that are committing crimes while they’re here with taxpayer dollars." Allen's campaign spokeswoman has described the 2015 UC Berkeley poll as "the most accurate and appropriate to use." She has claimed the 2017 poll "was biased" and "adds politics and inaccurate descriptions of sanctuary policies into the poll." Some might take issue with how Allen characterized the law, particularly the idea that the state is sheltering people who are "committing crimes." Even so, 53 percent in the most recent survey on the topic, published in November 2017 by USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times, favored California’s sanctuary state legislation when asked "Do you favor or oppose the new law that says California law enforcement personnel will not hand over immigrants in the country illegally to U.S. immigration agents, unless the person has committed a serious crime?" Twenty-nine percent were opposed. That doesn’t fit with Allen’s claim "nobody agrees with" the policy or that Californians are "overwhelmingly against" it. Ignoring key context We also found Allen’s statements ignores some key context. Here’s more about what the law does and doesn’t do, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times in October 2017 when Gov. Brown signed the sanctuary state law: "The new law will largely prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from using either personnel or funds to hold, question or share information about people with federal immigration agents unless those individuals have been convicted of one or more offenses from a list of 800 crimes outlined in a 2013 state law." "Federal immigration authorities will still be able to work with state corrections officials — a key concession Brown had demanded — and will be able to enter county jails to question immigrants." Our ruling During a recent radio interview, Travis Allen twice repeated the unfounded claim Californians are "overwhelmingly against" the new sanctuary state law. He’s made this assertion numerous times in recent months despite four polls that show a majority, or in some cases a near-majority, of Californians support the sanctuary policies. A past claim on the topic earned Allen a False rating. On these latest statements, we again rated Allen’s claim False. UPDATE: After publication, the Public Policy Institute of California released a new survey, on Feb. 8, 2018, showing 65 percent of California adults, including 58 percent of likely voters, favored local governments making their own policies and taking action separate from the federal government to protect the legal rights of undocumented immigrants in the state. It found 83 percent of Democrats, 53 percent of Independents and 21 percent of Republicans were in favor. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-09912	"The ACLU has filed a suit to have all military cross-shaped headstones removed."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/02/chain-email/no-aclu-lawsuit-over-cross-shaped-headstones/	We received the following chain e-mail from a reader, who asked us to check it out. "Subject: In Jesus' Name — No! No! "Did you know that the ACLU has filed a suit to have all military cross-shaped headstones removed and another suit to end prayer from the military completely? They're making great progress. The Navy Chaplains can no longer mention Jesus' name in prayer thanks to the wretched ACLU and our new administration." There's a lot packed into that e-mail, but here, we're checking whether the American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit to have all military cross-shaped headstones removed. We couldn't find any news stories or court cases to support such a claim. We asked the ACLU if they had filed such a suit. No way, said spokesman Will Matthews. "The ACLU has never once advocated for or initiated any litigation in favor of, removing cross-shaped headstones from federal cemeteries," he said in an e-mail. For good measure, he added the ACLU has also not filed suit to stop voluntary prayer in the military, either. Not content with the ACLU's denial, we went to the National Cemetery Administration of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. They are responsible for maintaining the national cemeteries and issuing headstones and markers for deceased military veterans. "To begin with, we don't have cross-shaped headstones at VA national cemeteries," said spokesman Michael Nacincik. The headstones and markers the government issues are rectangular. He also said there was no lawsuit concerning headstones. Family members of the deceased can select an emblem of religious belief to be inscribed on the headstone or marker. Currently, there are 39 different emblems from which to choose. The symbols include different types of crosses, the star of David, the Muslim crescent and star, the Buddhist Wheel of Righteousness, and many others, including symbols for atheists and secular humanists. "Many people choose to have a Christian cross inscribed, but people can choose other symbols, or no symbol at all," Nacincik said. "We're not going to be removing emblems of belief that people have chosen," he added. Those emblems are the closest we could find to the origin of this claim: In 2006, the ACLU helped the families of three deceased veterans sue the National Cemetery Administration to add the Wiccan symbol, a pentagram, to the list of approved emblems. The administration did end up adding the symbol. Believe it or not, we still didn't feel we had exhausted every avenue here, because hadn't we seen photos before of military cemeteries with rows of crosses ? It turns out these cemeteries are mostly in Europe, the final resting place for some of the American troops killed during World War I and World War II. The cemeteries are maintained by the American Battle Monuments Commission, an agency of the executive branch established in 1923. "I'm not aware of any efforts to remove cross-shaped headstones at our site," said Thomas Sole, director of engineering for the commission. Generally speaking, the cemeteries are located at the sites of battles where many troops died. Families had the choice of having the remains repatriated to the United States or being buried overseas. The graves in these cemeteries are marked with crosses or, if the deceased were Jewish, with stars of David, Sole said. The graves of deceased who were neither Christian nor Jewish also are marked by crosses. In the immediate aftermath of a battle, troops would bury their fallen and mark the graves with wooden crosses. "Our marble crosses are a reflection of those temporary wooden crosses," Sole said. Technically, the cemeteries are owned by the foreign country in which they are located, but the land is "given to the U.S. for use in perpetuity as commemorative cemeteries," Sole said. The cemeteries are closed to new interments, even to veterans, except for the remains of any servicemen and women lost during the World Wars that may be found on the battlefields. But just to repeat, Sole said he didn't know about any lawsuits to remove the crosses. So to sum up, the ACLU said it was not suing over that. ("The ACLU believes very deeply in the cherished value of religious freedom, and the right of all Americans to practice the religion of their choosing — or to practice no religion at all — freely and without fear or compulsion," Matthews said.) The U.S. Department of Veterans doesn't know about any lawsuit. And the American Battle Monuments Commission said there is no lawsuit. So we rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-04308	Says she voted against the Medicare Part D prescription drug program "because it was unfunded."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/30/tammy-baldwin/senate-candidate-tammy-baldwin-says-she-voted-agai/	In the political war for a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat, a key battleground for Republican Tommy Thompson and Democrat Tammy Baldwin is Medicare Part D. Thompson, who was President George W. Bush’s point man in getting Congress to approve Part D, touts the prescription drug program as an important benefit for senior citizens. And he chides Baldwin for voting against it. In an Oct. 24, 2012, meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Baldwin explained why she voted no. "I want you to know I support strongly Medicare Part D," the Madison congresswoman said, "but I would have paid for it. And that's why I voted no, it was because it was unfunded." Baldwin has been portrayed in the campaign as anything but a fiscal hawk. So, did she really cite the lack of a tax increase or other funding mechanism when she opposed the program? The program and the vote Medicare Part D is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans, and recipients choose the plan that's best for them. When the program was created in 2003, the government subsidy to help recipients buy their drugs was estimated to cost $394 billion over 10 years. We’ve rated True a claim by Baldwin that the Part D law, "adopted under Thompson’s watch," bars the government from negotiating for "better prices" on prescription drugs. Thompson’s was Bush’s health and human services secretary at the time. We’ve also rated as Mostly False a Thompson claim that he "had nothing to do" with the clause in Part D that prevents the government from negotiating drug prices for Part D. Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus did not respond to our requests for evidence that Baldwin voted against Part D because it was unfunded. But we found a half dozen statements made by Baldwin at the time, which make clear what her quarrel with the measure was when it passed. June 22, 2002: In a statement on the House floor, a year before the initial House vote, Baldwin called the GOP’s Part D bill a "sham," saying senior citizens "need a comprehensive prescription drug benefit that has no gaps or gimmicks in coverage. They need real prescription drug coverage under Medicare." June 28, 2003: After the initial House vote, Baldwin said in a news article in The Capital Times of Madison that she voted against the bill because it would force senior citizens into health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations that, unlike Medicare, limit their choice of doctors. July 21, 2003: Baldwin said in a news releases he voted against the bill because it "creates a gaping hole that fails to cover millions of seniors." She also said there were concerns about the bill leading to the privatization of Medicare. Nov. 21, 2003: In remarks on the House floor prior to the final House vote, Baldwin repeated several of her criticisms, noting the federal government is barred from negotiating drug prices under Part D. Nov. 22, 2003: In an opinion piece for The Capital Times, Baldwin said the GOP bill "offers a meager prescription drug benefit, does nothing to control the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs and begins to dismantle the entire Medicare program." The same day, Baldwin voted against the bill that was signed into law; it passed, 220-215, largely along party lines. Dec. 8, 2003: In a news release on the day Bush signed Medicare Part D, Baldwin made the same criticism she did in the opinion article. In general, Democratic critics complained that expanding the role for private insurers would undermine traditional Medicare. There were also conservative critics, who said the bill didn’t do enough to contain Medicare costs. So, Baldwin at the time cited a host of reasons for voting no -- that the measure left some seniors without coverage, that it undermines traditional Medicare, that it does not control prescription drug costs, that the federal government is barred from negotiating drug prices. But in the statements we found, there was nothing about the bill being "unfunded," which Baldwin now says is the reason for her opposition. Our rating In the heat of the Senate campaign, Baldwin said she voted against the Medicare Part D prescription drug program "because it was unfunded." At the time, Baldwin cited a number of reasons for opposing the program. But we didn’t find any statements about the program being unfunded. Absent any evidence to the contrary, we rate Baldwin’s claim False.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2012-10-30T13:37:42	2012-10-24	['None']
pomt-05754	The U.S. has a "record number of oil rigs operating right now – more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined."	/florida/statements/2012/mar/01/barack-obama/obama-says-us-has-record-number-oil-rigs-operating/	President Barack Obama came to the University of Miami to talk about energy, and with Republicans attacking him over a recent spike in gas prices, Obama attacked back. "Only in politics do people root for bad news, do they greet bad news so enthusiastically. You pay more; they’re licking their chops," Obama told the college crowd on Feb. 23, 2012. "You can bet that since it’s an election year, they’re already dusting off their 3-point plan for $2 gas. And I’ll save you the suspense. Step one is to drill, and step two is to drill. And then step three is to keep drilling," he said. Obama said we can’t drill our way to lower gas prices, but then he touted current production underway. "Now, we absolutely need safe, responsible oil production here in America. That’s why under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years. That’s why we have a record number of oil rigs operating right now – more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined." PolitiFact rated Obama’s statement about production being at an eight-year high as Mostly True. Here, we wanted to explore if the U.S. has a record number of oil rigs in operation and more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined. For this report, we're focusing only on the accuracy of Obama's numbers, not whether his administration gets the credit. We should also note that Obama made similar, though not identical remarks a week later in Nashua, N.H. Here, we're looking at his remarks in Miami. Recent rig counts in the U.S. and abroad To define our terms: A rig rotates the drill pipe from the surface to drill a new well to explore for, develop and produce oil or natural gas, according to Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company. Baker Hughes has done rig counts for decades and does a weekly count of oil and natural gas rigs in the U.S. and Canada. (In fact, when we posed our question to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, they pointed us to Baker Hughes.) According to Baker Hughes, there were 1,994 rigs in the U.S. and 705 in Canada as of Feb. 17, 2012. The company also conducts a monthly census for active drills outside of the U.S. and Canada. In January 2012, that number was 1,171. Using those numbers, Obama is right, but there’s a big catch here: Due to the difficulty of data collection, Baker Hughes does not count rigs drilling in Russia or onshore China. Since Russia and China are such large countries, we contacted experts in the oil industry to ask if including Russia and China could potentially outweigh U.S. rigs. "I personally suspect the international count is higher, but it is difficult to say definitively based on the available information," said Richard Mason, who works for the publication Hart Energy Digital, in an email. "However, the last numbers I saw out of Russia, which are 18 months old, had more than 1,000 rigs active, which would push the international total above the U.S., even without China.’’ Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, another energy publication, said he also believes the international rig count would be higher if Russia and China were included. He cited a report from a Chinese state-owned company that manufactures rigs and rig equipment that shows more than 1,000 land rigs. So Obama’s statement is supported by collected data, but that data undercounts the true number of international rigs. Historical data on rigs Now, what about the other half of Obama’s claim that we have a "record number of oil rigs"? Obama here is counting only oil rigs, not oil and gas rigs, an important distinction. News reports in February 2012 stated that the U.S. had hit a record number of oil rigs at 1,272, the most since Baker Hughes separated oil rig and gas rig data in 1987. The U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that 2011 was a record year since data was collected solely on oil rigs starting in the late 1980s. The problem here is that much of the data before 1987 combines oil and gas rigs, and some of the counts are much higher than the current total of oil rigs alone. The EIA’s historical rig data shows a high of 4,521 rigs in 1981. Baker Hughes showed a record rig count of 4,530 recorded on Dec. 28, 1981. The experts we consulted said it’s possible that 1981 was the record year for oil rig counts. We reviewed various estimates that suggested that could be the case. "In my mind, 1981 probably was the peak," said Raoul LeBlanc of PFC Energy, a consulting firm to industry and investors. But LeBlanc and other experts said rig counts going back that far can be deceptive. "Those rigs were different rigs than they are today. The ones today are more powerful and can do more and drill more wells and drill them faster," LeBlanc said. Another catch is that the industry arbitrarily assigns rig data to oil or gas; in reality, there can be overlap, with natural gas production coming from oil wells, said Mason of Hart Energy Digital. Finally, strictly comparing the number of rigs doesn’t tell the full picture of how much oil is being produced, said University of Texas Chair of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Tadeusz W Patzek. "If one looks at an average oil and gas well productivity in Texas and elsewhere in the U.S., it has been declining for several years, and this is a clear warning sign that even with more rigs that are more efficient, we will get less incremental oil (and gas) per rig and per day," he wrote in an email. "One prolific offshore well, like the Macondo well, is equivalent to dozens of low productivity wells in the Bakken shale. So one rig in an offshore environment brings as much oil as several rigs onshore.’’ Still, whatever the causes, domestic drilling is definitely on the upswing. "The substance of the president's comments, that we are currently involved in one of the most aggressive efforts to pursue energy production domestically, is a generally accurate description of what's happening in our domestic market," Mason said. Our ruling Obama made two claims here, and neither one is simple to dissect. Obama’s claim that the U.S. has "more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined" is borne out by the best available data. But that data doesn’t tell the full picture because it excludes China and Russia, where getting accurate rig counts is difficult. Obama also said that we have a "record number of oil rigs operating right now." That’s true if Obama starts the clock in 1987, but it’s possible that 1981 may have been the record. Again, we can’t say for sure, because record-keeping is incomplete. He’s right that that the United States is in the midst of a strong effort to increase domestic energy production, but we found evidence that undercuts the literal accuracy of his claims. So we rate this statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-03-01T14:40:45	2012-02-23	['United_States']
pomt-10588	"Gasoline would rise in price by approximately 50 cents a gallon" if the McCain-Lieberman bill became law.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/28/mitt-romney/it-might-whack-you--in-20-or-30-years/	Mitt Romney set up camp at a Texaco station in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday to take a poke at the McCain-Lieberman bill that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "On a very different topic, we're at a gas station," Romney told reporters. "And the reason for that is that I want to underscore the fact that Senator McCain's McCain-Lieberman (bill) would be a very expensive bill for the people of Florida. By our calculation, a family of four would have to spend about an extra $1,000 a year if McCain-Lieberman became law. And again that's because gasoline would rise in price by approximately 50 cents a gallon and natural gas would rise about 20 percent. The burden on Florida homeowners would obviously be excessive." The McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007 requires that greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 2004 levels by 2012, 1990 levels by 2020, and 60 percent below 1990 by 2050. It is a so-called cap-and-trade plan because it includes a market-driven plan in which companies that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions can sell emission allowances to other companies struggling to meet required standards. The plan also would provide some support for low-carbon alternative fuels, including nuclear power. We're not taking sides on whether the McCain-Lieberman plan makes economic sense, or even whether it would help to solve global warming. But there's enough research in to judge Romney's numbers. Lots of assumptions go into various projections about the impact of the McCain-Lieberman plan (or any other, for that matter), so you could probably find a study to say about anything. But take a look at the information Romney cites as background material in a press release about his attack on McCain's plan. First off, the Romney camp switches back and forth between analyses of the 2003 and 2007 versions of the McCain-Lieberman plan. For example, it cites an American Council for Capital Formation study that concluded the McCain plan could increase gas prices 30 to 50 cents by 2020. But that was an analysis of the 2003 plan. More on point are two government analyses of the 2007 McCain-Lieberman bill, one by the EPA and the other by the Energy Information Administration, which produces the official energy statistics from the U.S. government. The EPA concluded in July 2007 that if the bill passed, it would increase gasoline prices about 26 cents per gallon by 2030; 68 cents per gallon by 2050. The Energy Information Administration analysis, released in August 2007, concluded the price of gas would increase 34 cents per gallon by 2030. Romney's claim that gas prices would rise 50 cents per gallon is grossly misleading considering these two reports conclude the increase would be 26 cents or 34 cents in 22 years. Romney's projection of the plan costing Florida families $1,000 a year rests on a 50-cent increase. Sure, the projections may come into Romney's wheelhouse in 30 or 40 years, but c'mon. Both plans do, however, suggest that the price of electricity would rise (22 percent according to the EPA projections; 21 percent according to the EIA). But again, that's a projection for 2030. Janet Peace, a senior economist with the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, doesn't take issue with either the EPA or EIA projections — based on the assumptions they made — but she argues that the farther out you go in years, the more difficult it is for the government to anticipate energy technology that may significantly alter the picture. The whole idea is to decrease Americans' reliance on fossil fuels through alternative energy sources. Romney's claims didn't give a time frame, but we bet voters would be surprised to hear that he's talking about 20, 30, maybe even 40 years from now. We rate his statement Barely True.

pomt-01548	Women still do not get paid as much as men, even "for the same work, period."	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/15/connie-stokes/stokes-broadly-right-gender-pay-claim/	With the national implications of Georgia’s U.S. Senate battle and the close battle for governor, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor recently tried to draw some attention to that overshadowed race by highlighting so-called women’s issues. Connie Stokes, one of a handful of female candidates (all Democrats, save for the Libertarian choice for U.S. Senate) for statewide office, mentioned issues such as business, domestic violence and women’s health in a recent fundraising email. Then she referenced an issue that has tripped up candidates all year: the pay gap between men and women. "After serving in the state Senate for 10 years, it saddens me that women still do not get paid as much as men," Stokes wrote. "There appears to be some discrepancy about the difference in the amount of money women are paid compared to men," she continued. "You know It does not matter what the difference is, women are paid less than men for the same work, period. " Democrats from President Obama on down have emphasized the "gender wage gap" all year, in an apparent bid to woo the female voters that tend to favor the party to polls. Stokes would need that turnout and then some to win her uphill battle against Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle for the job that mostly presides over a tantrum-prone state Senate. PolitiFact Georgia, and our PolitiFact national arm, have fact-checked various incarnations of the gender-wage claim before. For example, we gave Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn a Mostly True rating in April for her statement, "On average, women make 77 cents for every dollar men make." Her qualifier "on average" and broad statement kept the claim on target. By contrast, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter – the grandfather of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jason Carter – earned a Mostly False rating for his statement that, "in the United States for the same exact work for a full-time employee, women get 23 percent less pay than men." In those cases, they were referring to a 2010 U.S. Census Bureau study that examined total wages of male and female workers. Men’s total wages were about 23 percent higher than women’s, the study found. But the gap was due in part to men working more hours, the study concluded. It did not look at pay rates for the same work or the same number of hours. Stokes avoided the specifics of numbers in her statement. And other data backs up her claim of an overall wage gap between men and women. Her claim, however, gets more problematic as she gets more specific. Looking at weekly wages, a 2011 Bureau of Labor Statistics report found women earned 81 percent of men’s wages for all occupations (Table 18). The gap is smaller than the Census figures, which rely on annual wages and can therefore include pensions, bonuses and other factors that widen the difference. Those different conclusions show the inherent problem with bold statements on a wage gap, especially when referencing specific numbers. Numbers also don’t tell the whole story about the second part of Stokes’ claim, that women are paid less "for the same work." Again, the data overwhelmingly back up the broad claim – but not in every field. The 2011 BLS report shows women actually earn 12 cents more than men in the food preparation/serving industries, 10 cents more as "billing and posting clerks and machine operators" and 5 cents more than men working as store clerks. Yet beyond those three jobs, and looking at broad industry categories, women still earn less than men overall (Table 19). Stokes said that was the point to her statement. "We know the numbers don’t agree because of the variables, but we all know that women are paid less than men," Stokes said. "That’s the bottom line." If the point is women earn less than men, it would be. But the comparisons are not as simple as they seem at first blush. Experts agree on a gender-based wage gap. Yet differences in life choices such as occupational choices and hours worked can make simple comparisons tricky. The gap can narrow, for instance, when accounting for education level and specific jobs. Stokes was on target to cite a gender pay gap. But vastly oversimplifies the "same work" claim -- it does matter what job is being performed. Stokes claim is accurate on one level. But a lot of context is needed to really understand what is going on. We rate her claim Half True.	None	Connie Stokes	None	None	None	2014-09-15T00:00:00	2014-08-27	['None']
pomt-10630	The church Barack Obama belongs to only admits black people.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/11/chain-email/any-race-may-join-chicago-church/	An anonymous e-mail criticizes the church Barack Obama belongs to: "Notice too what color you will need to be if you want to join Obama's church... B-L-A-C-K!!!" (For more on this e-mail and its claims, read our story here .) Barack Obama belongs to Trinity United Church of Christ, which serves predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Chicago and has a mostly African-American membership. But you do not have to be black to join Trinity. The church, which has been overwhelmed with media inquiries, said in a statement that it welcomes people of all races and has white members. "There's no question (the e-mail) is a distortion," said Martin Marty, a retired Chicago-based historian of religion and public life, who is white and has attended services at Trinity several times. Dwight Hopkins, a professor of divinity at the University of Chicago who attends Trinity and is black, said he also regularly sees a few white people at Trinity. Many churches are ethnically homogenous, but that doesn't mean they require members to be a certain race. We find the e-mail's statement that Trinity United Church of Christ only accepts African-Americans for membership to be False. UPDATE: Barack Obama resigned from Trinity United Church of Christ on May 31, 2008, after church pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. made controversial remarks about U.S. foreign policy and other matters. Obama said he intends to join another church after the election.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-01-11T00:00:00	2008-01-06	['None']
pomt-09726	The Obama administration notified Poland and the Czech Republic about cancellation of major missile-defense facilities "at the last minute in midnight phone calls."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/23/dick-cheney/cheney-accuses-obama-telling-allies-canceled-proje/	Former Vice President Dick Cheney made news on Oct. 21, 2009, when he accused the White House of "dithering while America's armed forces are in danger" in Afghanistan. That was just one of many fireballs he lobbed at the Obama administration’s policies on Iran, Iraq and the interrogation of suspected terrorists. Cheney also rapped the White House for sloppy diplomacy in its decision to cancel a planned missile-defense radar in the Czech Republic and planned missile interceptors in Poland. The administration decided that the facilities were designed with a less-severe threat – long range missiles – in mind, and that missile-defense efforts should instead be focused on countering short- and medium-range missiles. Work on the missile-defense facilities – which had prompted strenuous opposition from Russia and mixed feelings by residents of the two Eastern European countries – was conceived during the tenure of Cheney and President George W. Bush. So Cheney’s opposition to Obama’s canceling the project was not surprising. However, in his speech, Cheney went beyond the substance of the decision and accused the White House of bumbling diplomatic protocol in making its announcement. "It is certainly not a model of diplomacy when the leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic are informed of such a decision at the last minute in midnight phone calls," Cheney told an awards dinner sponsored by the Center for Security Policy, a conservative group. "It took a long time and lot of political courage in those countries to arrange for our interceptor system in Poland and the radar system in the Czech Republic. Our Polish and Czech friends are entitled to wonder how strategic plans and promises years in the making could be dissolved, just like that – with apparently little, if any, consultation. Seventy years to the day after the Soviets invaded Poland, it was an odd way to mark the occasion." In this item, we will try to determine the timing of when the Obama administration told the Czech Republic and Poland of the decision. According to many news accounts, Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer was indeed told shortly after midnight, Warsaw time, on Thursday, Sept. 17, 2009. (That is, indeed, the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion.) "Just after midnight I was informed," Fischer said, according to the Independent , a British newspaper. The Russian newspaper Vremya Novostey pinpointed the call to 12:21 in the morning. A call received at 12:21 a.m. in Warsaw would have been placed six hours earlier – 6:21 p.m. in Washington. News of the decision began to leak out the following morning, Washington time. CNN, for example, reported the decision in its 9 a.m. block of CNN Newsroom . Obama announced it at 10:21 a.m. in a brief address in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room. So, the time between Obama’s call to Fischer and the formal White House announcement was about 16 hours, most of which was nighttime in one country or the other. Pinning down the time that Obama contacted Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is a little trickier. According to Agence France Presse , the Czech leader said that Poland "had been informed in the same way" as he himself had been. But the Russian paper, Vremya Novostey , citing "Polish news media reports," said that a "technical" glitch prevented Obama from speaking to Tusk late Wednesday night, so the conversation "took place only [on Thursday] afternoon." (We presume that is Warsaw time.) If Obama did finally make personal contact with Tusk that late, it still would have been before the formal White House announcement, though barely. The White House declined to provide additional details about the timing. By way of context, it’s worth noting that the announcement was not exactly a surprise. After Obama's announcement, Fischer himself said that "we knew the United States was reviewing its plan to build the radar ... within a reassessment of specific threats, and that one option might be to give up the plan to build the radar," according to Agence France Presse . "The threats now rest in short- and medium-range missiles, not long-range ones. The American side decided this was the most serious threat and this is their reaction." It's not clear why the White House chose to make the announcement when it did. Obama still had six days left if he wanted to get the news out before world leaders arrived in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. Asked by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, at a Senate Armed Services hearing whether the announcement could have been handled any better, undersecretary of defense Michele Flournoy blamed leak-fueled speculation. ''We too would have preferred a longer period for consultation and rollout, but leaks and speculation in the press sort of forced us to go sooner to set the record straight,'' she said. As for Cheney's statement, he's definitely right about Fischer, the Czech leader, being contacted about midnight. And although there is a discrepency about the time of the final notification for Poland, the reports indicate that Obama first tried about midnight. So we find Cheney's claim to be True.

pomt-00599	The Texas Senate "approved a bill to put a special label on the insurance cards of anyone who bought a plan through Obamacare" that includes the letter "S" for subsidy.	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/03/al-sharpton/sharpton-texas-lawmakers-want-insurance-cards-carr/	MSNBC host Al Sharpton accused Texas Republicans of trying to slap a "scarlet letter" on people who use private health insurance under Obamacare. "The Texas Senate just approved a bill to put a special label on the insurance cards of anyone who bought a plan through Obamacare," Sharpton said on PoliticsNation on May 29. "But if those labels weren't absurd enough, anyone who receives financial assistance for insurance would have a letter 'S' on the cards, too. 'S' for subsidy." Sharpton said critics of the move worry that it might lead hospitals and doctors to turn away patients who use tax credits to make their insurance more affordable. We wondered: Did the Texas Senate approve a new ID card that includes an "S" for subsidized Obamacare plans? The missing 'S' The bill in question, HB 1514, started in the Texas House. The original language indeed included reference to the letter "S." Here’s that text: An identification card or other similar document issued by a qualified health plan issuer to an enrollee of a qualified health plan in this state must ,... display on the card or document in a location of the issuer’s choice: (1) The acronym "QHP"; or (2) If the enrollee receives advance payment of the premium tax credit, the acronym "QHP-S". The bill’s language is in government-speak, but basically any enrollee in a qualified health plan (more on that in a bit) who gets a premium tax credit through the federal health care exchange would receive a card that includes the letter "S." That would be a clear cue to a doctor or hospital that a person’s health insurance is being subsidized by the federal government. But before the bill passed the House (by a vote of 129 to 8 margin) on May 11, that language was amended. The revised bill dropped the letter S. Here’s the text the Senate passed on May 26, 2015: An identification card or other similar document issued by a qualified health plan issuer to an enrollee of a qualified health plan purchased through an exchange must... display on the card or document in a location of the issuer’s choice the acronym "QHP." So Sharpton was more than two weeks out of date. The Texas bill requires that insurance through the online exchange be labeled as such, but the precise identification of those who use the federal tax credits is not part of the bill. An MSNBC spokeswoman said Sharpton would address this issue on his June 3 show. What the QHP label tells providers So all plans purchased through the federal exchange -- whether they include a subsidy or not -- would have ID cards marked QHP. Why is that? Hospitals and doctors say the issue is that people who buy their insurance through the federal government’s exchange have 90 days to stay current with their premiums. That’s two months longer than the industry standard. If a patient goes to the hospital during the first month that they have failed to pay, even if they never pay another dime of their premium, the insurance company will cover the cost. But for care given in the second and third months, federal law allows the insurance companies to make the providers pick up the tab retroactively. That’s what the providers want to avoid. The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association, the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, and other trade groups supported the bill. Neurologist Sara Austin, a medical association member, testified that seeing the QHP designation would create a teachable moment with such patients. It would be an "opportunity to stress the importance of continuing to pay their portion of the premium that is not subsidized by the federal government," she said. Austin said the change would reduce the number of times that providers have to go after patients to collect on a bill. But it’s unclear how much the current bill will accomplish. Sabrina Corlette, director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, thinks it won’t do much. "That label wouldn't tell a provider whether the patient is actually in the grace period," Corlette said. "It also doesn't tell the provider whether the patient is subsidy eligible. So I wouldn't think it provides much in the way of useful information." However, Corlette said there is a possibility that the QHP label might prompt providers to call insurance companies before they provide care, rather than afterward. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 85 percent of plans purchased through the federal exchange in Texas receive a tax subsidy. There’s also room for a tug-of-war between the providers and insurers. Federal regulations require the insurance companies to put hospitals and doctors on notice when there is a possibility that claims might be denied because the patient is in the second or third month of the grace period. In other words, under existing law, the providers have another option to seeking collection from the patient who fails to pay his premiums. They can go after the insurance companies. Our ruling Sharpton said that the Texas bill would add a label to insurance cards for coverage purchased through the federal exchanges and that people receiving a subsidy would see the letter "S" on their insurance card. That provision was dropped more than two weeks before Sharpton said it. The bill that passed the Legislature and has been sent to the governor would add the letters QHP to any insurance card tied to a health care plan on the federal exchange. But it wouldn’t differentiate between those purchased with or without a federal tax credit. Special label? Yes. Scarlet "S"? No. Sharpton’s claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-01690	"If 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/14/joe-miller/granting-illegal-immigrants-amnesty-will-destroy-s/	Joe Miller thinks there’s an obvious link between illegal immigrants and the Second Amendment. In a recent mailer to Alaskans, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate touts a record that is "100 percent pro-gun" and "100 percent against amnesty." And, he says he’s the only candidate with endorsements from various pro-gun groups. Alaska’s Republican primary is next Tuesday, and Miller is trailing far behind his opponents Mead Treadwell and Dan Sullivan (the leader) in the latest polls. Whoever wins will face off against incumbent Democrat Mark Begich. He says Begich wants to give amnesty and the right to vote to illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, and this is bad for the country’s gun rights. (Both Begich and Alaska’s other senator, Lisa Murkowski, voted for the Senate’s immigration reform bill.) "If 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye," the mailer says. We thought drawing a connection between illegal immigration and the right to bear arms was dubious, so we decided to dig into it. Understanding the amendment First, some background on the Second Amendment and how it’s interpreted: The amendment reads: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." So the Second Amendment ensures that Americans are born with a certain amount of gun freedom. How courts have interpreted the text, though, is important. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in District of Columbia vs. Heller that an individual who is not part of a militia has the right to own a weapon. Additionally, the court said the amendment permits individuals to use the guns for legal purposes, like self defense in their homes. Two years later, the court ruled that these rights also apply to the states. But the Heller decision does not necessarily mean a person can own a gun of any type for any purpose. The court has approved gun regulations, such as the decision this year that upheld a ban on "straw purchases" (one person buying a gun for someone else). In sum, the court believes the Second Amendment means individuals have the right to own guns, with limited regulations. If 20 million people who all leaned one way or another on gun control were suddenly injected into the population, the surge could change the country’s political make-up and tip the balance in favor of Americans that support stricter gun laws, said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Under this scenario, he said, the country would elect politicians that support stricter gun laws, and those politicians would nominate Supreme Court judges who reflect their own views. These judges could reinterpret the Second Amendment as restricting gun ownership, and the right to bear arms as we currently understand it would disappear over time. This is also how the Miller campaign explained to us how immigration and gun rights are connected. However, the mailer does not say that the current understanding of the Second Amendment would disappear, it says the amendment would disappear altogether. Could that happen? ‘If pigs could fly’ Every scholar we spoke with agreed that it’s ridiculous to think that the Second Amendment could be removed from the Constitution under any circumstances -- let alone because of immigrants. "If pigs could fly, would it change air travel?" said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor. "I guess it might, but it’s hard to imagine the premise." First of all, citizens (and undocumented immigrants) cannot vote on a change to the Constitution. Amending the Constitution is a laborious process that requires two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of states to approve the change. With the current population, this would be nearly impossible, considering that only 25 percent of the country believes that there should be a law banning gun ownership except for police and other authorized individuals, according to a Gallup poll from October 2013. And just around 50 percent of the country thinks there shouldn’t be control over gun ownership, according to a February Pew study. The addition of 20 million new voters -- a population of about 6 percent -- of any ideological persuasion is unlikely to make a dent, said Clark Neily, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice. Additionally, there are about 12 million -- not 20 million -- illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, according to the latest estimates by Pew. (Alaska alone had fewer than 50 illegal immigrant households in 2010.) Of these illegal immigrants, about 60 percent of them are concentrated in just six states -- far fewer than the 38 states that would be needed to approve a change to the Constitution. It’s fair, though, for Miller to imply that illegal immigrants might be more sympathetic to Democrats than Republicans, Neily said. They are a predominantly Hispanic group, and Hispanics tend to align with Democrats. (In fact, a 2013 Pew study found that illegal immigrants strongly lean toward the Democratic Party.) America’s Hispanic community tends to be in favor of more gun restrictions. A recent Pew poll on political polarization found that 70 percent support controlling gun ownership, but that still leaves about 30 percent that prefer less control over gun ownership. If the primarily Hispanic illegal immigrants reflect this group, far fewer than 20 million would support scrapping the Second Amendment. At Republican primary debates recently, Miller explained why he thinks illegal immigrants would be more likely to support gun restrictions. "There’s a clear correlation, and the clear correlation is this: If you end up granting amnesty to those who don’t value gun rights, who have not been raised in an environment where the Second Amendment is cherished -- is considered to be a God-given right -- the reality is over a generation or two, the likelihood is very strong that the Second Amendment will not be here," he said, according to Alaska Dispatch News. Even though it’s plausible immigrants could bring their cultural beliefs to the United States, it’s also likely that American culture -- which is overwhelmingly in favor of the Second Amendment -- would rub off on them, said Trevor Burrus, a research fellow at the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Our ruling Miller said, "If 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye." We found that it would be nearly impossible to remove the Second Amendment from the Constitution, given the country’s ideological make-up, and adding a voting bloc of 20 million would be unlikely to change that -- regardless of their political persuasions. However, it’s possible that adding 20 million new voters who lean Democrat could result in stricter gun control laws. Miller’s mailer muddies the waters, because increasing gun ownership regulations is not the same thing as scrapping the Second Amendment entirely. The ad is wrong when it suggests 20 million voters can repeal part of the Constitution’s Bill of Rights. We rate it False.	None	Joe Miller	None	None	None	2014-08-14T11:19:02	2014-08-09	['None']
pomt-05927	Siemens has been unable to fill approximately 200 skilled trade positions in metro Atlanta.	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/30/nathan-deal/deal-tech-company-needs-200-skilled-trade-workers/	Think twice about going to a four-year college, young Georgians. Gov. Nathan Deal wants you to Go Build. People are struggling to find work in today’s jobs-poor economy, Deal said Jan. 10 as he outlined his 2012 agenda during the governor’s yearly State of the State address. Yet jobs are abundant in skilled trades, which don’t require four-year degrees. Deal’s solution: Go Build Georgia, a major jobs and education initiative that makes students aware of skilled trades and helps train them. "Right here in metro Atlanta, Siemens has been unable to fill approximately 200 skilled trade positions in the fields of manufacturing automation, health care technology, transportation systems and technical service," Deal said. They’re having trouble filling 200 open positions? Right here in metro Atlanta? The state’s unemployment rate is stuck near 10 percent. Please, tell us more, we asked the governor’s office. "Skilled trade" positions are jobs that don’t require a bachelor’s degree but do require specialized knowledge and training. They include commercial construction workers, pipe fitters, draftsmen and electricians. A governor’s office spokeswoman referred us to Siemens for more details about the positions. The company posts job openings on its website. Some 130 positions were listed for Siemens’ locations in Alpharetta, Atlanta, Norcross and five other locations in the metro area. This number was short of Deal’s estimate by about 70 positions. Siemens spokeswoman Camille Johnston said that is because not all open jobs are posted. Some are only advertised within the company. Other listings are taken off the website if they have enough candidates. A few have one listing but multiple openings. A difference of 70 positions seemed high to us, but her explanations did not seem unreasonable. We opted to take them at face value. Then we pored over the online listings. For the most part, they did not advertise positions in the skilled trades. More than 60 percent explicitly required at least a four-year degree, and many of these listings sought candidates with majors in science or technology. One posting was for an attorney. Even positions that appeared open to candidates without bachelor’s degrees favored employees with four-year degrees or were typically held by people with four-year degrees, according to the listings. One preferred candidates with a Master of Business Administration or other post-graduate degree. In fact, we found only 12 posted listings that did not require or favor candidates without bachelor’s degrees. That’s about 10 percent of the online jobs listings. Most of them were squarely in the "skilled trade" category. For instance, two were for heating, ventilation and air conditioning workers. One was for a draftsman, and three sought field service workers. Two of them were not. One Atlanta position was for a training assistant who would handle tasks such as billing and scheduling. Another was for an administrative assistant in Roswell. We emailed and called Siemens to ask why most of the listed positions were not for skilled trade workers, but we received no response. Deal spokeswoman Stephanie Mayfield said that regardless of the actual numbers, the state needs skilled workers, and the governor’s office is glad Siemens offered to work with Georgia to solve this problem. Siemens may be struggling to fill some 200 jobs in metro Atlanta, but the overwhelming majority are not skilled trade positions as Deal claimed. They’re geared to candidates with bachelor’s or post-graduate degrees. We rule Deal’s statement False.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-01-30T06:00:00	2012-01-10	['Atlanta']
pomt-04705	Says Milken Institute rated San Antonio as nation’s top-performing local economy.	/texas/statements/2012/sep/04/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-milken-institute-named-san-anto/	Second-term San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro did not shy from celebrating his hometown during his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention. Addressing the delegates assembled in Charlotte, N.C., Castro said that San Antonio residents recognize the value of investing in pre-Kindergarten and student college loans. "We're investing in young minds today to be competitive in the global economy tomorow," Castro said. "And it's paying off. Last year the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation's top-performing local economy." Castro made the same claim in his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we’ve previously dipped into twice -- Julián Castro said his city’s investments in infrastructure and education paid off "late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute." Indeed, we confirmed, San Antonio topped Milken’s 2011 list of the nation’s best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the 2007-09 recession. The economic think tank’s annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for "more than a decade," was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, Texas Tribune news story as "a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs." Milken’s 2011 report on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there. Some measures are weighed across five-year spans, to flatten out extreme swings, and the most recent year, "to capture recent momentum." In recent years, the Tribune said, "companies have flocked to San Antonio, making it an economic center rivaling Houston and Dallas." In contrast to those cities, though, "San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry." The Tribune story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain. The San Antonio Express-News credited the city’s rise to reasons "including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care" in a Dec. 16, 2011, news story. Texas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken’s 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth. Back in 2008, Austin was Texas’ only top-five city, but the state claimed most of those slots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The other chart-toppers for 2011 were No. 2, El Paso; No. 3, Fort Collins/Loveland, Colo.; and No. 5, Killeen/Temple/Fort Hood. Texas’ rise in the ranks, the Express-News wrote, came partly because of downturns in other parts of the country. The story quoted research economist James Gaines of Texas A&M University’s Real Estate Center: "Our growth rate and advancement isn't all that wonderful. We've managed to stay flat or have very small positives. But because everybody has so many negatives, we look so much better." A Philadelphia Inquirer columnist interviewed Milken’s chief research officer, Ross DeVol, and wrote Dec. 16, 2011 that "Technology and energy explain why nine Texas cities placed in the top 25 of the 2011 Milken ranking." Our ruling San Antonio hasn’t just been holding steady in the economic downturn; it’s been gaining ground, even compared to other Texas cities. Castro’s statement rates True.

pomt-06904	"When the Republicans were in charge, they actually expanded government health care with the prescription drug program."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/25/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-when-republicans-were-power-they-exp/	Years before "Obamacare," congressional Republicans saw political gold in expanding government's role in health care by adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul says the "Part D" drug benefit is a reminder that the GOP sometimes can't resist the temptation of big government. "I'm not all that optimistic (about repealing the Democratic health care law) because when we did have the chance, when the Republicans were in charge, they actually expanded government health care with the prescription drug program," Paul said in a July 16, 2011, interview with the Nashua Telegraph in Derry, New Hampshire. "We've got a long way to go on that." Because memories can be short, we thought it would be worthwhile to explore whether Paul was right that the GOP was responsible for such a big increase in government. A bit of background: The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 was an effort by President George W. Bush in his first term to address a major gap in the senior citizen health care program -- a lack of drug coverage. Bush's political advisers saw the drug plan as a way for Bush to broaden his appeal with seniors. Early on, the drug benefit had bipartisan support, although many Democrats later abandoned the effort, saying it provided too big a handout to the pharmaceutical industry without requiring enough competition. A check of the rolls confirmed that the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress at the time of the vote in 2003 and that the bill passed with strong GOP support. According to voting records, the GOP held a 229 to 205 majority in the House at the time of the Nov. 22 vote, and of the 229 Republicans, 204 voted in favor. Across the hall in the Senate, Republicans held a 51 to 48 majority on Nov. 25 when 42 of the 51 GOP Senators supported the bill. Nine Republican Senators voted against. In the Senate, only 11 of 47 Democrats approved the bill, with 36 against and two abstaining. And, in the House, only 16 Democrats voted in favor, with 185 against. Of the current presidential field, Paul voted against the bill, while then-U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican, voted in favor. (We recently checked his claim that the program was coming in below projections.) The bill had roots in previous Democratic proposals, said Jack Hoadley, a policy analyst at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. But "the version of the drug benefit that passed was certainly the Republican approach -- competing private plans, no government regulation," Hoadley said. "There wasn't a lot of compromising." So Paul is right about the Republicans being the driving force. And how much did it expand government? Hugely. The new drug benefit was used by 34.5 million beneficiaries in 2010, and that number is projected to reach 40.5 million in 2015. (Most were already enrolled in Medicare.) Through 2010, Medicare Part D had cost $203 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The program is expected to cost another $391 billion through 2015, according to CBO projections. "It was certainly not the first time that Congress tried to improve the system of private plans within Medicare. But it’s fair to say with the addition of the drug benefit, it was the biggest expansion of the program since the beginning," said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. "(It) was filling a major gap that existed since the beginning of the program," he said. "That was a real, fundamental change." Our ruling: So Paul is right on both counts. It was a Republican bill that passed with strong Republican support. And it dramatically increased government. We rate his statement True.

pomt-12679	"The past (Obama) administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth."	/illinois/statements/2017/mar/16/peter-roskam/rep-roskam-gdp-growth-obama/	Speaking at an event in Chicago earlier this month, U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., was talking tax policy and the economy when he pointed to lackluster economic growth that occurred under former President Barack Obama. "The past (Obama) administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth," Roskam said during a March 6 speech at the City Club of Chicago. It’s an oft-cited figure Republicans tend to throw around to highlight the weak economic recovery throughout Obama’s presidency, but does the data back it up? A familiar claim Roskam’s claim lacks some specifics, particularly the type of growth and time frame he was referring to in his speech. David Pasch, the Wheaton Republican’s communications director, provided a link to data compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showing both the annual and quarterly percentage change in real gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the total value of goods and services provided in the country. While annual figures on GDP growth date back to the Herbert Hoover administration and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the federal government did not start tracking quarterly growth until 1947. Considering the time frame for which this annual data is available, it’s safe to assume Roskam was referring to economic growth since the Hoover administration. In fact, Roskam’s claim is quite similar to a statement Donald Trump made during a campaign speech in October, which was fact-checked by our colleague Joshua Gillin at PolitiFact Florida. As was the case with Trump’s claim, Roskam is right when he says that year-over-year GDP growth never topped 3 percent while Obama was in office. But as Princeton University economist Alan Blinder told PolitiFact at the time, looking at annual data can be misleading because it doesn’t provide context or account for historical factors that affect economic growth, such as recessions and global crises. For example, Hoover came into office on the cusp of the Great Depression, and Obama took over during the tail end of the Great Recession and amid instability in the Middle East. That’s one of the main reasons why economists suggest looking at the percentage change in GDP by quarters, rather than growth in a single calendar year. When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked Trump saying Obama was the first president "in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth," data for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 was not yet available. But now it is. GDP growth in 2016 and the Obama years According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the percentage change in GDP growth during the third and fourth quarters of the last year of Obama’s final term was 3.5 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, resulting in an average growth rate of 1.6 percent for 2016. That was down 1 percentage point from 2015 when GDP grew by 2.6 percent, which marked the best year for average growth under Obama. Typically, economic growth in the first quarter of a new presidency is attributed to the previous administration, meaning former President George W. Bush gets credit for the 5.4 percent contraction in the economy during the first three months of 2009. As for the remainder of Obama’s time in office, quarterly GDP growth averaged 2.0 percent, or 1.5 percent when averaging out annual figures. But if the data is used to compare one quarter to the same quarter from a year ago, there were two periods during Obama’s tenure in which growth exceeded 3 percent. Between the third quarters of 2009 and 2010, GDP growth was about 3.1 percent; and between the first quarters of 2014 and 2015, the economy grew by 3.3 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. With the way Roskam refers to growth, however, Obama indeed was the first president who did not achieve more than 3 percent growth in GDP. Average growth under Bush Sr., was 2.1 percent; 3.9 percent for Bill Clinton; 2.3 percent for George H.W. Bush; and 3.5 percent for Ronald Reagan. The highest annual growth on record occurred in 1942 during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, when GDP grew by a staggering 18.9 percent as the United States entered World War II and ramped up production following the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Our ruling Roskam said the Obama "administration was the first administration that never had a whole year of 3 percent growth." While Roskam’s claim is accurate when based on annual GDP growth figures between 2009 and 2016, there are other ways to look at the data, such as from one quarter to the same in the previous year. Doing so reveals economic growth has surpassed 3 percent during two periods of Obama’s presidency. We rate Roskam’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-07643	"Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high" in 2010.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-gulf-oil-production-hit-record-l/	In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of higher prices at the pump. "We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas, "he said. "Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn’t match up with reality," In this item, we’ll check the second bit of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn’t "shut down" oil production -- that "oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high." As we did in our other fact-checks of the president’s press conference comments, we turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said "oil production," we will only look at oil, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products, and since he said, "federal waters," we will ignore production from state waters. The agency’s data goes back to 1981. Here are the annual figures for Gulf production in barrels per day. 1981: 719,000 1982: 786,000 1983: 876,000 1984: 956,000 1985: 941,000 1986: 960,000 1987: 892,000 1988: 818,000 1989: 764,000 1990: 739,000 1991: 799,000 1992: 822,000 1993: 825,000 1994: 860,000 1995: 943,000 1996: 1,021,000 1997: 1,129,000 1998: 1,228,000 1999: 1,354,000 2000: 1,430,000 2001: 1,536,000 2002: 1,556,000 2003: 1,559,000 2004: 1,453,000 2005: 1,282,000 2006: 1,299,000 2007: 1,277,000 2008: 1,152,000 2009: 1,559,000 2010: 1,640,000 (estimate) So the president is right -- 2010 was the highest ever. But some critics say that isn’t the whole story. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began in April 2010, the federal government allowed existing wells in the Gulf to continue production but imposed a moratorium on new drilling. While that moratorium has now been lifted, it slowed production, as output began to decrease at old wells and new ones were not on line yet to pick up the slack. Critics say the administration has slow-walked new applications -- a perception Obama challenged at the press conference by arguing that his administration is simply demanding "common-sense standards like proving that companies can actually contain an underwater spill." We won’t assess whether the permit approval rate is slower than it ought to be, but the oil-production numbers do tell a story. In May 2010, production in the Gulf peaked and then continued to decline for the rest of the year. And the Energy Information Agency expects this decline to continue for at least two years more -- by about 240,000 barrels per day in 2011 and by an additional 200,000 barrels per day in 2012. "Since there is a lag time from the time an exploration permit is approved to the time of actual production, and since only a handful of permits for new wells have been granted since April of 2010, it is likely that Gulf of Mexico production will continue to be hit hard in 2012 and beyond," wrote Kyle Isakower, the vice president of regulatory and economic policy at the American Petroleum Institute, in a recent blog post. In an interview with PolitiFact, Isakower added that "while the administration is correct" in its statistics, EIA found that "Gulf production peaked in May of 2010, due in large part to permits awarded three or more years earlier, and has been decreasing ever since. This matters because markets don’t look backward, they look forward." We think that’s a fair point. Obama is indeed correct about the record-high levels of Gulf oil production in 2010. However, he ignores a downward trend that began in 2010 and that is projected to fall further over at least the next two years. We think it’s problematic to use the record-setting statistic to buttress the notion that Gulf oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate Obama’s statement Half True.

pomt-09847	Republicans Chuck Grassley, John Boehner and John Mica flip-flopped on providing end-of-life counseling for the elderly.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/17/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-republicans-chuck-grassley-john/	We've had to set the Truth-O-Meter on fire in the past several weeks because of the ridiculously false claims about end-of-life counseling in the health care reform bill. So it looked like a real gotcha when bloggers dug up what appeared to be hypocrisy – that a number of Republicans who have recently harrumphed about end-of-life consultations in the health care bill had voted for something similar in the 2003 Medicare drug bill. This was MSNBC host Rachel Maddow’s take on this discovery: "As we have reported recently, many Republican officials have enthusiastically embraced the conspiracy theory that health care reform is a secret plot to kill old people," Maddow told viewers. "Health reform really isn‘t really a secret plot to kill old people. The part of the House bill that is cited by the conspiracists to supposedly prove their point actually says that Medicare will cover consultations about living wills, advanced directives — if patients want to talk to their own doctors about what they want to happen at the end of their own life. That's it. "But that hasn‘t stopped people like Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on health care in the Senate, who said, quote, 'We should not have a government program that determines if you‘re going to pull the plug on grandma.' Then there was House Minority Leader John Boehner who said, quote, 'This provision may start us down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.' And putting the exclamation point on ridiculous — Florida Rep. John Mica, who said, quote, 'There are death counselors. There is authorization for reimbursement for those counselors for Medicare. You have a whole new cottage industry.' "Well, as Amy Sullivan reports on Time magazine's 'Swampland' blog today, Sen. Grassley and Congressman Boehner and John Mica have another thing in common in addition to being 'deathers.' They all also voted for the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug Bill. That bill in part provided funding for end-of-life counseling. And I quote, 'Counseling the beneficiary with respect to end-of-life issues and care options and advising the beneficiary regarding advanced care planning.' Or as these things are now known in Republican circles, death panels. "In all, 204 Republicans in the House and 42 Republicans in the Senate voted for the death panels. And there was not a peep about then-President Bush having a secret plan to kill old people. "Bottom line? Either Republicans like Chuck Grassley and John Boehner and John Mica have totally changed their minds about whether living wills are really a secret plot to kill old people or they voted for something just a few years ago that they actually thought was a secret plot to kill old people. Take your choice." Maddow (unlike her cited source, Sullivan) glossed over an important difference in the language of the two bills. The 2003 bill applied to terminally ill patients, including those in hospices, whereas the 2009 bill applies to Medicare recipients — that is, everyone over 65. The current bill would reach many more Americans than the 2003 language did — all healthy seniors nationwide, rather than just those who are terminally ill. The current bill would allow consultations every five years — something that, almost by definition, cannot happen in a hospice setting, where stays are often two months or less. It would shift the time frame for discussing these issues to years before someone falls seriously ill. We turned to independent experts to see whether they thought the bills were significantly different, as Boehner’s staff suggested to us. And the consensus of the experts was that the bills are indeed different. Robert Applebaum, a gerontologist at Miami University in Ohio, said that "calling advanced planning a 'death panel' is ridiculous, but comparing this legislation to (the drug bill version) is not factual either." Applebaum said that the drug bill "really focused on hospice care, while the proposed legislation is really about planning for future health care. … One of the problems with hospice is that the vast majority of patients wait until they are very close to death to even consult hospice. … So the (drug bill) legislation was relatively inconsequential" in terms of the numbers and types of people it affected. We presented Applebaum’s reasoning to three other academic experts in gerontology — J. James Cotter of Virginia Commonwealth University, Julie Masters of the University of Nebraska at Omaha and John Krout of Ithaca College — and all agreed that Applebaum’s reasoning was sound. We also asked Amy Tucci, the president and CEO of the Hospice Foundation of America, and she said she agreed that the two bills are "apples and oranges." "The 2003 legislation did not encourage or compensate doctors generally for having the conversation with people before a health crisis was looming," Tucci said. "The 2003 legislation really only pertained to hospice doctors, who could be compensated for providing an evaluation of a patient and/or having a discussion with a prospective hospice patient about care plans, which would mean the services they're entitled to under hospice, other options for care, and so on. These evaluations would be to ensure that the patient was hospice eligible, which would be an evaluation that certified that the patient had six months or less to live." By contrast, Tucci said, the current legislation "intends for the conversation to be held with … doctors who a patient would see, theoretically, long before the onset of some kind of terminal illness." When PolitiFact asked Maddow what she thought of our experts’ perspective, she said she still believes the lawmakers’ positions on the two bills are hypocritical. She cited a quote that Grassley reportedly made to a crowd of 300 in Winterset, Iowa, on Aug. 12, 2009, that "in the House bill, there is counseling for end of life. You have every right to fear. You shouldn’t have counseling at the end of life, you should have done that 20 years before. Should not have a government-run plan to decide when to pull the plug on grandma." Grassley, Maddow said, "supported the 2003 bill covering 'end-of-life' counseling and 'advanced care planning' specifically for patients who were terminally ill. To be clear: he voted for it for terminally ill people, and he's railing against it for all seniors, despite saying, 'You shouldn't have counseling at the end of life, you should have done that 20 years before." It's not only disingenuous for Sen. Grassley to deride measures he earlier supported as 'pull[ing] the plug on grandma,' it is rank hypocrisy for him to state that he has a particular objection to this counseling when it occurs at the actual end-of-life." We see her point, but it's clear to us from our interviews with experts that there's a distinct difference between the 2003 law and the 2009 bill. Yes, there's the appearance of inconsistency given the similar purpose for both bills, but the 2009 bill is more far-reaching than the 2003 law, which was focused narrowly on hospice patients. So we find Maddow's claim that they flip-flopped to be Half True.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2009-08-17T18:38:02	2009-08-14	['Chuck_Grassley', 'John_Boehner', 'John_Mica']
pomt-10930	Says detained immigrant parents separated from their children at the border are being charged "as much as $8 a minute to call their children."	/florida/statements/2018/jul/26/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-claims-detained-immigrant-parents-char/	Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson said the Trump administration reached a new low by charging detained immigrant parents high fees to call the children they were separated from at the border. "The Trump administration has been charging detained parents, get this, as much as $8 a minute to call their children," Nelson, of Florida, said July 23 on the Senate floor. "And the children were separated from the parents because the administration separated them; $8 a minute if you want to talk to your child. That is a new low." Nelson faces a tough re-election challenge from Republican Gov. Rick Scott. More than 2,300 children were separated from the adults they were traveling with as a result of President Donald Trump’s "zero-tolerance" immigration policy, which directed the prosecution of all immigrants who crossed into the United States illegally. As adults were referred for prosecution, children traveling with them were placed into the custody. The Trump administration has reunified more than 1,000 children with their parents. But not all can be easily reunified, in part because some parents have already been deported. Overall, exact government figures on separations and reunifications have been inconsistent and limited. We wondered about Nelson’s claim that parents in detention were being charged as much as $8 a minute to call their children. Nelson’s office pointed to media reports saying parents had to pay for phone calls. But U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rebuked those claims. Some advocates for immigrants said they couldn’t confirm the $8 a minute claim, or had heard lower rates. Nelson’s evidence About 150 lawmakers, including Nelson, sent a letter July 20 to ICE’s acting director, Ronald D. Vitiello, expressing concerns over "apparent misinterpretation" of ICE’s telephone access policies. "Reports and first-hand accounts have indicated that many of these detained parents have been forced to endure weeks without any information as to the location of their children," the letter said. "Once their children are finally located, moreover, reports indicate that their parents are forced to pay as much as $8 per minute to speak with them by telephone, and that their access to this service can be limited to as little as one call per week." The letter cites a June 21 NPR interview of Jenny Hixon, outreach director for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. Hixon told NPR that some parents at a detention center in Pearsall, Texas, "had not been able to speak to their children yet because in order to be able to speak to their children, they needed to pay $25 to get a commissary account. And then the phone calls are about $8 a minute." PolitiFact emailed Hixon for more information but received an automated message saying she was no longer employed by the legal services group. We asked the group’s communications director to confirm the figure, but did not receive the confirmation by deadline. Nelson’s office also referred us to a July 3 article from the Texas Tribune reporting that immigrants in detention faced "usurious phone rates and bureaucratic hassles to contact their family members." The story said advocates were worried that "the cost and complexity of using detention facility phones could hamper family reunification efforts that have already been plagued by chaos and confusion." But the Texas Tribune story didn’t cite an $8 a minute rate. It said the cost "can top 20 cents per minute and has been criticized as exorbitant." The story mentioned comments made in a June 22 court filing by a mother detained in Texas who was separated from her children. "The calls are very expensive so I am only able to call when I have money, but when I do not have money, I am not able to communicate with my children. In one month I only received one free call from the center," the woman said. The story added: "Lawyers and advocates working with immigrants detained since the ‘zero tolerance’ policy went into effect say costs and procedures vary from facility to facility, but they have heard that charges range from 10 to 25 cents per minute for domestic calls." It did not say if those calls were made to children. Trump administration denies charging parents to call their children ICE spokeswoman Jennifer D. Elzea told PolitiFact calls are facilitated "at no charge" to detained parents whether their children are in HHS custody or with sponsors. But Buzzfeed, in a July 23 story about the lawmakers’ letter, reported that "when asked about reports detailing high, per-minute fees for phone calls to children," a different spokeswoman "agreed it was ‘possible’ that occurred when parents were trying to call children who were no longer in federal custody." Children in HHS custody don’t have 24-hour access to phones, but calls are being arranged at least twice a week, sometimes more frequently, Elzea told PolitiFact. In some cases, detained parents are able to talk to their children through video-conferencing, she said. ICE detention standards say detainees shall be able to make free calls to an ICE-provided list of free legal service providers, to consular officials and to certain government offices. "Indigent detainees, who are representing themselves pro se, shall be permitted free calls on an as-needed basis to family or other individuals assisting with the detainee’s immigration proceedings," standards say. HHS said that children in its shelters don’t pay for calls to their families or sponsors. The agency said it pays for those calls. Two legal services groups representing immigrant families were unable to confirm to PolitiFact if parents were charged as much as $8 a minute to call their children. Some parents detained at Port Isabel detention center in Texas told lawyers that they were charged about $3 a minute to call their children, said Megan McKenna, spokeswoman for Kids in Need of Defense. The group represents unaccompanied immigrant and refugee children in deportation proceedings. "It’s possible that there was a free call number, but the detainees our team spoke to did not know about it, if there was," McKenna said. Efren Olivares, a program director at the Texas Civil Rights Project, said he couldn’t confirm the $8 a minute figure. But when detainees at the Port Isabel detention center call Texas Civil Rights Project lawyers, they get a recording saying the call is 20 cents a minute, Olivares said. Our ruling Nelson said detained immigrant parents separated from their children at the border are being charged "as much as $8 a minute to call their children." ICE told us that parents should not be charged to talk to their children. But lawyers working with parents have heard that they were charged. One legal services group told PolitiFact that there may be a free number to call, but its clients did not know about it and had been charged. Having said that, we were only able to find one instance of anyone claiming that parents had to pay as much as $8 per minute. Most of the accounts we found mentioned amounts ranging from $3 a minute to 20 cents a minute. There is some anecdotal evidence to back Nelson's claim, but not enough to establish that $8 a minute as standard practice. Nelson’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03696	A "wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation" on gun background checks.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/19/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-wide-majority-nra-households-sup/	After the Senate failed to advance an amendment that would expand federal requirements for background checks on gun purchasers, President Barack Obama took to the White House’s Rose Garden to denounce the vote, calling it "a pretty shameful day for Washington." Flanked by relatives of some of the slain children from Newtown, Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, Obama emphasized how broadly Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases. At several points in his remarks, Obama invoked his gun-policy adversary, the National Rifle Association. "To the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn’t represent your views on this one," Obama said. We found two independent polls have attempted to take the pulse of the NRA’s membership on universal background checks, the linchpin of both the failed compromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa, and the underlying bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Here’s how the data stacks up. • One poll was done by CBS News and the New York Times. The survey, conducted Jan. 11-15, 2013, found that 85 percent of those living in a household with an NRA member favored background checks for all potential gun buyers. • The other survey, by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, was taken Feb. 13-18, 2013. It found that "people in NRA households overwhelmingly favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks: 74 percent favor this proposal while just 26 percent are opposed." These results verify that rank-and-file NRA members and those who live with them favor universal background checks by margins of between 74 percent and 85 percent. Still, there’s a problem with Obama’s phrasing. He said that a "wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation." While the percentages supporting universal background checks in the latter two polls qualify as a "wide majority" in our book, each of these polls were taken before either of the two relevant pieces of legislation were filed in the Senate. Reid’s underlying bill was submitted on March 21, while the Manchin-Toomey amendment was submitted on April 11. So while the polls do demonstrate strong support for background checks -- a key element of both Senate measures -- it’s a bit of a stretch to say that NRA members polled supported "this legislation." The legislation in question hadn’t even been introduced yet. Our ruling Obama said a "wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation." Two fully independent polls showed that NRA members or households support expanded background checks, but the polls couldn’t have asked about the "legislation" Obama referred to because those measures had not been introduced yet. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-04-19T15:40:01	2013-04-17	['None']
pomt-01520	Says "President Obama hijacked the farm bill (and) turned it into a food stamp bill."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/19/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-incorrectly-says-obama-turned-farm-bill/	Back in January, Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., took some heat for voting against the final version of the farm bill -- particularly being the only lawmaker from Arkansas, a state that depends on farming, to do so. Now, the Republican Senate candidate is out with an ad to defend his vote, arguing that it was the fiscally responsible course. The 30-second spot features Cotton and his father on their family farm. Cotton says his dad taught him financial lessons that he carried into his current role. "(My dad) taught me early: farmers can’t spend more than they take in, and I listened," Cotton said in the ad. "When President Obama hijacked the farm bill, turned it into a food stamp bill, with billions more in spending, I voted no." Cotton, who is running against incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, goes on to say that the farm bill was a case of politicians taking a bad idea (food stamps) and attaching it to a good one (the farm bill). Is this true? Is Obama really to blame? We took a closer look. A brief history Food assistance legislation has been tied to agriculture for decades. Congress passed the first farm bill in 1933, during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, to aid farmers struggling with low commodity prices and dry soil in the Midwest. To fight poverty in the general population, the bill also established a nutritional assistance program. The program took surplus crops, meat and dairy products and distributed them to people in need. The program became known as "food stamps" in 1939, overseen by the Agriculture Department, according to SNAP to Health, an organization that aims to improve health among food purchasing assistance recipients. This program ended in 1943 but was reinstated nationally in 1964 as the Food Stamp Act, part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society program to address poverty. In this iteration, food stamp policy was not addressed in farm bills, but the Agriculture Secretary administered the program. The farm bill and food stamps merged once again in 1973. Representatives from urban areas and those from rural areas figured this pairing would aid the bill in securing broad support in Congress, according to an article by New York University law professor John Ferejohn. Since then, a program -- currently called SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- has been part of every farm bill that has become law, according to a December 2013 Congressional Research Service report. Today, a farm bill is passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy, including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food stamps. In 2013, the House -- led by Republicans, Cotton included -- became the first chamber to pass a farm bill that didn’t include food stamps. But that bill wasn’t able to pass the Senate, and the final farm bill that became law in February 2014 did include food stamps. So how does this history illuminate the accuracy of Cotton’s claim? Obama did support passing a farm bill that included food stamps in 2013, with the White House releasing an extensive report in November 2013, titled, "The Economic Importance of Passing a Comprehensive Food, Farm and Jobs Bill." But the idea of merging the two topics together in one bill hardly came from Obama. It had been that way, uninterrupted, since 1973 -- when Obama wasn’t even a teenager yet. And while the number of food stamp recipients grew dramatically in the wake of the last recession, which bottomed out around the time Obama took office, food stamps have accounted for a majority of farm bill spending for more than a decade. The bill passed in 2014 has a nearly $1 trillion price tag over 10 years, and 80 percent of that goes toward nutrition assistance. In the 2008 version of the bill, 67 percent of spending was devoted to nutrition assistance. In the 2002 bill, about 55 percent of spending went to nutritional assistance. Our ruling Cotton said that Obama "hijacked the farm bill (and) turned it into a food stamp bill." That’s not correct -- food stamps have been part of every farm bill enacted since 1973. One could say that Cotton and his allies in the House, by seeking a farm bill stripped of food stamp provisions, were actually the ones taking a more radical step, one that Congress ultimately voted against.

pomt-07679	"I have asked the Division of Emergency Management to report directly to me."	/florida/statements/2011/mar/08/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-wants-more-control-over-state-hurri/	Florida’s CEO-turned-governor Rick Scott wants more control over the state’s response to emergencies, like hurricanes. During his first State of the State address on March 8, 2011, Scott said he has asked the Division of Emergency Management to "report directly to me." "If a hurricane comes our way -- I hope it doesn’t -- I will be personally and continuously engaged in solving problems," he said. "Direct, clear lines of authority will expedite our efforts." This wasn’t the first time Scott announced his intention to move the division within the Executive Office of the Governor. That news arrived simultaneously with his appointment of Wal-Mart emergency management director Bryan Koon to the agency’s helm on Dec. 28, 2010, a week before Scott’s inauguration. "If approved," Scott said in a press release, "this move will create a direct reporting structure and enhance communication and cooperation across all federal, state and local entities involved in Florida’s disaster preparedness efforts and response. This transfer will help cut bureaucratic red tape during emergencies and ensure the director has full access and accountability to Florida’s CEO." Scott cited the proposal, which needs legislative approval, as an example of his mission to streamline the way state government operates. So we wanted to see just how many government hoops Scott's plan would eliminate. The Division of Emergency Management was created in 1969 by the Florida Legislature to act as a liaison between federal and local bodies amid environmental and man-made disasters. The division currently is housed within the Department of Community Affairs -- an agency the governor already controls. That, by itself, gives the governor broad leeway in handling personnel and policy decisions. And the division itself, it turns out, already reports to the governor. Gov. Lawton Chiles came up with the idea after Hurricane Andrew came ashore in 1992 but the direct link between the governor's office and the division became permanent under Gov. Jeb Bush after the 2004 hurricanes when Bush sought legislation to put it into law. Craig Fugate, now director of FEMA, was head of the division at the time. Sen. Mike Fasano, R-Port Richey, sponsored the bill in the Senate. Rep. Tom Anderson, R-Dunedin, was the House sponsor. The law was effective July 1, 2006, and created the Division of Emergency Management as an independent agency with its own budget and a director appointed by the governor. Fugate said, in an interview with the St. Petersburg Times' Lucy Morgan on March 9, that the change was made so it was easier to coordinate the state’s emergency response in the face of a disaster. The division explained it this way as part of its 2009 annual report (the most recent report we could find online): "Though the Division is administered through the Department of Community Affairs, Section 20.18 (2) (a) of the Florida Statutes states that the Division’s executive leadership reports directly to the Governor on all matters concerning the agency’s purview." We checked the statutes. They establish the division as a unit of DCA, note that the division is a separate budget entity not within DCA’s control, and require the governor to appoint the division director. Scott’s budget proposal would formally transfer the Division of Emergency Management (and a budget of $238,593,605 plus 128 positions) from DCA to the Governor’s Office. That’s about the extent of the formal changes we could find. Scott took time during his first State of the State speech to say that he wants to have the Division of Emergency Management "report directly to me." By statute, it already does. All that seems to be changing is where the division is housed for budgeting purposes. He's really just redrawing lines on an org chart, and it's not as groundbreaking a change as it sounds. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05930	"Chesterfield has eliminated more positions from its general government operations than the Commonwealth has from the entire state government since (fiscal) 2009."	/virginia/statements/2012/jan/29/james-stegmaier/stegmaier-says-chesterfield-county-has-cut-more-go/	Chesterfield County Administrator James J.L. Stegmaier wants folks to know he oversees a lean government. "Chesterfield has eliminated more positions from its general government operations than the Commonwealth has from the entire state government since (fiscal) 2009," Stegmaier said in an outline of a Dec. 14, 2011 speech he made to the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce. We were struck by this statement. The state government has 33 full-time equivalent workers for every one in Chesterfield’s central government. Is it true that the county, in raw numbers, eliminated more jobs than the much larger state? We ran a check. Chesterfield’s general government operations include workers in all services except education. Stegmaier said that if education was included, the numbers would only grow in Chesterfield’s favor since the county has trimmed employment in that department as well. Stegmaier, to support his claim that Chesterfield’s central government has shed more jobs than the state, pointed us to two sets of statistics. He cited county budgets that detail Chesterfield’s authorized full-time employment levels in general government. In fiscal 2009, there were 3,697 authorized jobs. In fiscal 2012, which ends June 30, there were 3,516 such positions. That’s a decrease of 181 approved jobs. For state figures, Stegmaier relied on data from Virginia’s Department of Planning and Budget that detail authorized employment levels for all agencies. The state lists the number of employees as "full time equivalents" -- a figure that lumps together full-time and part-time employees. That’s why the overall number ends in a decimal. In fiscal 2009, the state had a maximum employment level 114,724.44 jobs. This fiscal year, the maximum is set at 114,566.73. So the state’s drop of about 157 authorized employees falls 24 short of Chesterfield’s reduction. But we had some issues with Stegmaier’s proof. He had not made an apples-to-apples comparison because Chesterfield only tallied full-time employees while the state counted full-timers and part-timers. Also, the state and county numbers Stegmaier compared are maximum employment levels in budgets. Not all of those jobs were filled. We think the acid test for Stegmaier’s statement is measuring the change in the number of people who actually worked for Chesterfield County and the state. We turned to the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management’s website, which lists the number of state employees for any given month over the past 21 years. On June 30, 2009 -- the end of fiscal 2009 -- , the state had 119,850.81 full-time equivalent employees. By Oct. 31, 2011, the latest date for which statistics were available, the number rose to 120,465.97. The state had gained 615.16 full-time equivalent workers. Then we turned to Chesterfield. Matt Harris, the county’s senior budget analyst, told us Chesterfield had 3,816 full-time equivalent employees on July 1, 2009. The number dropped to 3,664 on Nov. 1, 2011. The county lost 152 full-time equivalent workers. Our ruling: No matter which set of numbers you use, Chesterfield has eliminated more jobs from its general government operations than Virginia has from its entire state government since fiscal 2009.

pomt-06987	"A recent study revealed that, across the nation, taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year just to support the currently unsustainable public employee pension systems. In Florida, that dollar figure translates to $813 a year."	/florida/statements/2011/jul/12/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-taxes-would-climb-support-publ/	Gov. Rick Scott's Independence Day e-mail message to state employees offered thanks to servicemen and women for defending our freedom, a reminder to use care with fireworks over the drought-parched weekend — then support for pension reform. "I also want to share with you information I came across in a New York Times article last week. A recent study revealed that, across the nation, taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year just to support the currently unsustainable public employee pension systems. In Florida, that dollar figure translates to $813 a year. "That means if we did nothing, every household in Florida would have to contribute more than $800 of their hard-earned money every year, for the next thirty years, just to meet our pension obligations for state and local government retirees. "As I’ve said all along, raising taxes is not an option. The pension reform we accomplished this year prevents tax hikes, and also protects the retirement of government workers." A state employee asked us: Did a recent study in the New York Times actually say taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year nationally — $813 a year for Floridians — to support public employee pensions? We should mention the pension reform Scott recently signed was a law requiring state workers to put 3 percent of their salaries toward retirement and eliminating cost-of-living increases on benefits earned after July 1. We checked out the New York Times article, which focused primarily on pension challenges in Costa Mesa, Calif. A related graphic told the national story. Headlined "Tax Increases for Government Pensions," it said that "even if pensions are funded today, costs are expected to rise as promises come due. Though many pension funds dispute their findings, two economists, Robert Novy-Marx and Joshua D. Rauh, have calculated: How much each state needs to increase taxes per household per year to eventually fund its pensions 100 percent ... or the returns that state pension funds need to earn every year for the next 30 years to be fully funded." A list of states followed. In Florida that annual tax increase was estimated at $813 — just what Scott wrote. Meanwhile, the abstract of the complete study — also linked to from the story — said it would take a tax increase of $1,398 per U.S. household per year to fully fund state and local pension systems over the next 30 years. So Scott's message actually used a slightly more conservative number. He could have rounded up to $1,400. So Scott accurately quoted both the state and national estimates for tax increases it would take to fully fund pensions, according to Novy-Marx and Rauh. But he also said taxes "would have to be increased." Even a quick look at the New York Times graphic shows that's not the case. The economists had in fact offered an either/or scenario. Either Florida would need to increase taxes each year by $813, or it would need to average a 12.1 percent return on its pension fund investments. We asked Joshua Rauh to clarify this for us. Hang with us for just a few moments of economist-speak. He said the baseline scenario for the tax increase calculation was an asset return of inflation plus today's long-run real Treasury bond yields — under today's conditions, an annual return of just under 5 percent. "If returns are more than that, required tax increases for Florida will be less than $813," he said. "If returns are less than that, required tax increases will be more than $813. To eliminate the need for tax increases entirely, returns would need to be 12.1 percent a year." A footnote to the New York Times graphic pointed out that historical returns nationally averaged about 8.8 percent a year. In other words, if over 30 years Florida pulled in the average historical return on its investments, it would still need to raise taxes. But it wouldn't need to raise taxes by a full $813 a year. Meanwhile, "Tax Increases for Government Pensions" wasn't the only graphic that accompanied the New York Times article. The story also included a handy map headlined "A $176 Billion Gap for Public Pensions." Sounds like it would support Scott's description of "currently unsustainable public employee pension systems," doesn't it? Under the headline, the graphic reads, "In general, many experts say pension funds should hold 80 percent of the funds needed for future obligations. Many states, however, have failed to put enough aside." The map showed which states fall short of the 80 percent goal, and by how much — and which states exceed the 80 percent goal, and by how much. Given Scott's message to state employees, which category would you assume Florida is in? Well, it turns out that by this measure, Florida's fund is among the nation's most healthy. Its pension funds hold $5.9 billion over the traditional 80 percent benchmark, the graphic shows. And that's the story supported by a Pew Center study last year and the most recent annual state report on Florida's pension funds. While other states' funds entered the recession underfunded, Florida's was fully funded. And while it took a hit during the recent economic tsunami, in 2010 it gained more than 14 percent, ahead of the state's target. That added $9.8 billion to the bottom line. Ash Williams, executive director and chief investment officer for the State Board of Administration of Florida, which oversees the state's pension investments, declared in November, "We are healthy." He called Florida's plan "a very positive exception to the rule" that "remains one of the best-funded, and therefore strongest, public plans in the country. Still, there have been plenty of voices saying Florida would need to raise taxes, increase returns or trim benefits to keep that plan strong. And Scott has made it clear he doesn't share Williams' sunny take. For example, he thinks the state's expected return of 7.75 percent requires too risky an asset mix for contributions that should be cautiously invested. So there's legitimate disagreement about the long-term health of even comparatively healthy public pension systems like Florida's. But we can still weigh in on the accuracy of Scott's characterization of the New York Times report to state employees. Scott told them that "a recent study revealed that, across the nation, taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year just to support the currently unsustainable public employee pension systems. In Florida, that dollar figure translates to $813 a year." But he left out that investment returns could also offset this need. He also failed to distinguish between states that have long struggled to meet their pension goals, and Florida's comparatively strong performance. We think those are important details, and rate Scott's statement Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-07-12T15:59:57	2011-07-01	['None']
pomt-10989	Says Patrick Morrisey’s "family’s firm was paid $500,000 to lobby AGAINST Trump’s last Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/13/west-virginia-democratic-party/did-patrick-morriseys-family-firm-lobby-against-go/	In West Virginia’s closely watched Senate race, the state Democratic Party is shining a spotlight on Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey’s wife, Denise, who is a Washington lobbyist. In a tweet on July 10, a few days after President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the high court, the state party referenced the role of Denise Morrisey’s firm in the previous Supreme Court nomination battle, involving the nomination of Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch. Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, had publicly expressed support for Gorsuch’s confirmation. The state Democratic Party party tweeted, "U.S. Senate candidate @MorriseyWV CAN’T have his CAKE & EAT it too! FACT: His family’s firm was paid $500,000 to lobby AGAINST Trump’s last Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This isn’t the first time Denise Morrisey’s employer has caused friction for Patrick Morrisey. We have previously written about lobbying that her firm, Capitol Counsel, did for major pharmaceutical companies, some of which produce or distribute opioids — a category of drug that has caused severe problems in West Virginia and elsewhere. As for Capitol Counsel’s work against Gorsuch’s nomination, we found some truth in the West Virginia Democratic Party’s allegation, but also some significant overreaches. Is Capitol Counsel the Morrisey "family’s firm"? Not really. The party backs up its claim that "the Morrisey family owns the Washington, D.C. lobbying firm Capitol Counsel" by citing a Gazette-Mail article from May 2017. That article said that Denise Morrisey holds "the second-largest ownership stake" in the firm. The firm partly confirmed and partly contradicted that account in a July 2017 letter outlining the scope and limits of the firm’s connections to the Morriseys. In the letter, the firm’s founder, John Rafaelli, said Denise Morrisey has an ownership stake, but a smaller one than the newspaper had reported. "She is a minority shareholder with 15 percent of the stock," Rafaelli wrote. Regardless of the exact amount of ownership, the Democratic Party’s assertion is overly expansive. Just because Denise Morrisey is a part-owner of Capitol Counsel doesn’t make it the Morriseys’ family firm. She doesn’t own a majority stake, and her husband is not involved in its operations. Did the firm lobby against Gorsuch? Yes. According to federal lobbying disclosure forms, Capitol Counsel lobbied on behalf of Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc., including for a time on "legislative issues related to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States." We should note that Denise Morrisey did not personally lobby against Gorsuch. Her name was absent from the firm’s disclosure forms for Planned Parenthood. This is consistent with Rafaelli’s statement in the letter that a lobbyist from the firm who recuses from a particular client will not be listed on that client’s disclosure form. Was the firm paid $500,000 to lobby against Gorsuch? No, it was paid substantially less. The party cited a May 2017 article in the Washington Examiner that said in part that "the lobbying shop has cashed Planned Parenthood checks worth $460,000." But the party twists this figure by saying that all paid for the anti-Gorsuch lobbying. Disclosure forms show that, in all, Planned Parenthood has paid Capitol Counsel $710,000 to date. Their relationship began in the first quarter of 2015, and the most recent filing covered the first quarter of 2018. But the only two quarters that overlapped with Gorsuch’s nomination were the first two quarters of 2017, and during that period, Planned Parenthood paid the firm $120,000, which is much lower than what the tweet said. (Gorsuch lobbying was listed as an issue on the third quarter 2017 form as well, but that is likely an oversight since he was already sitting on the court by then.) It’s also an exaggeration to say that the firm spent all of its lobbying efforts during those two quarters on Gorsuch’s nomination. The firm listed a number of other issues on its disclosure form, specifically "health care issues related to HR 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017; legislative issues related to Title X family planning funding, including HJRes 43, a Resolution of Disapproval of a rule submitted by the Department of Health and Human Services relating to Title X project recipients." For the record, the firm insists that, despite her ownership stake, Denise Morrisey did not benefit personally from Planned Parenthood payments to the firm. In the letter, Rafaelli wrote that "Mrs. Morrisey’s compensation is based 100 percent on the revenue generated by clients that she is listed as working on behalf of on the (disclosure forms)." Morrisey's current clients include the American Academy of Dermatology, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the California Dental Association, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the National Society of Genetic Counselors, Physician Hospitals of America, the Physicians Advocacy Institute, and Varian Medical Systems. Our ruling The West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted that Morrisey’s "family’s firm was paid $500,000 to lobby AGAINST Trump’s last Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch." The firm Denise Morrisey worked for did lobby for Planned Parenthood against Gorsuch’s confirmation. However, the tweet exaggerates key aspects of the relationship. Capitol Counsel is affiliated with Denise Morrisey but not the family as a whole, and the firm was not paid nearly as much as the $500,000 the tweet alleged. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-12067	"In 1986, President Ronald Reagan" cut the business tax rate to 34 percent and "it worked -- our economy boomed, the middle class thrived and median family income increased."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/06/donald-trump/milwaukee-op-ed-donald-trump-overstates-economic-i/	To reach what a White House spokesman called "the heartland of America," President Donald Trump wrote an opinion article for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that called on Congress to pass his tax reform bill. In the Sept. 3, 2017 op-ed, Trump invoked a Republican famous for tax cutting to argue that his own proposed cuts would spur economic growth. Trump wrote: In 1986, President Ronald Reagan led the effort to make America the most competitive nation in the world by cutting our business tax rate to 34 percent, well below the average rate of other developed nations at the time. It worked. Our economy boomed, the middle class thrived and median family income increased. As we’ll see, some economists say Reagan’s reduction in the corporate tax rate helped boost the economy. But seven experts we spoke to were unanimous in saying that a single tax cut can’t be credited for making dramatic gains in an economy that is affected by a whole host of taxes, as well as many factors not related to taxes, such as demographics and trade policies. "Mathematically, he’s on firm ground" in terms of economic growth and increases in median income in the years after the corporate rate cut, Manhattan Institute senior fellow Brian Riedl said of Trump’s claim. But attributing those gains to one cut is something else. "It’s always very hard to specify which policies led the economy to perform the way it did," Riedl said. Said University of Wisconsin-Madison professor emeritus of applied economics Andrew Reschovsky, who worked in the Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury: "The problem is, economies are complex things. It is really impossible to attribute any change" in the economy to a single tax cut. Trump’s evidence To back Trump’s claim about the effects of the 1986 corporate tax rate cut, the White House cited several statistics indicating the economy improved during the next several years. Among them: A 4.2 percent increase in gross domestic product in 1988, according to the World Bank; and an increase of nearly $2,000 -- from $51,388 to $53,367 -- in the real median household income, from 1986 to 1989. But there are two important points to consider here, the economists told us. 1. The corporate tax rate cut -- from 46 percent to 34 percent -- was only one of a host of cuts made in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. As Americans for Tax Reform recalled in celebrating the Reagan bill, the legislation also reduced the top marginal individual income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and slashed the total number of income brackets from 14 to two, among many other tax changes. As the Washington Post reported, "tax shelters for the wealthy, which proliferated before the bill became law, were struck a mortal blow," the "once-all-powerful oil-and-gas lobby also had a few of its tax benefits clipped" and "millions of low-income Americans were taken off the income tax rolls entirely." A corporate rate tax cut can help grow the economy and raise wages, said American Enterprise Institute economics policy resident scholar Aparna Mathur, whose specialties include tax policy and corporate taxation. But "it’s really hard to pin down" cause and effect, or to determine how much improvement they yield, she said. Bruce Bartlett, a domestic policy adviser in the Reagan White House, was more critical of Trump’s claim. "The economy did not boom. It grew at about the same rate as before the tax reform and by 1990 was tanking," he told us. University of California, Berkeley economist Alan Auerbach, the author of an American Economic Association journal article on the economic effects of the 1986 tax reform law, gave a more positive view. "The economy did OK after 1986 until the 1990-91 recession, but there was no significant change in the economy's overall trajectory immediately after the 1986 act," he said. "The economy did boom in the mid- to late-1990s, and the middle class did relatively well during that period, but it's hard to attribute that to the 1986 act." And much more difficult to attribute, as Trump did, any economic gains to only the corporate tax rate cut among the broader package of 1986 tax reforms. 2. Many factors aside from taxes help determine the performance of the economy. Mathur said factors such as immigration and trade also affect the economy. While the economy improved after the various 1986 Reagan tax changes, "you had a lot of winds behind the sails," said Tax Policy Center former co-director Eugene Steuerle, who was deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury for Tax Analysis under Reagan. He cited baby boomers reaching their peak earning years and more women entering the workforce. Said Cato Institute senior fellow Daniel Mitchell, whose specialties include fiscal policy and tax reform: "One could certainly make an argument the (corporate tax rate cut) was good for growth, it was good for the middle class -- but lots of other things are, too." To claim major economic gains were fueled only by the corporate cut, he said, "is puffery." Our rating In a Journal Sentinel op-ed, Trump said: "In 1986, President Ronald Reagan" cut the business tax rate to 34 percent and "it worked -- our economy boomed, the middle class thrived and median family income increased." Some economists say the corporate rate reduction, from 46 percent, did help lead to economic growth and higher income. But it wasn’t necessarily any more important than a cut -- from 50 percent to 28 percent -- in the top individual income tax rate that was part of the same 1986 package that included other tax changes, as well. More importantly, many other factors beyond tax cuts -- demographics, immigration, trade policy and more -- bear on the economy. Trump’s statement contains only an element of truth -- our definition of Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-09-06T13:06:31	2017-09-03	['None']
pomt-14592	Says a Sanders campaign ad "never said ... a newspaper endorsed us that did not."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/04/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-mistaken-about-whether-his-campaign/	MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow pressed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders about a few controversies surrounding his staff during the Feb. 4, 2016, New Hampshire presidential debate. One that had emerged in the previous 24 hours concerned an ad Sanders’ campaign had run in advance of the New Hampshire primary. Maddow asked Sanders about the Nashua Telegraph complaining recently "that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not." Sanders responded, "We did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper." Maddow then said, "Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was ‘Endorsement.’ " Sanders responded, "But that was only for -- that was not to be on television. That's an important point. That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us." As it happens, Maddow had referred specifically to one of two newspapers cited in the ad, and her choice might have allowed Sanders an out -- the ad in question did not explicitly say the Telegraph had endorsed him. But in his answer, Sanders broadened his response to include "those newspapers," which is a problem because the initial version of the ad did explicitly include text that said the Valley News had endorsed him when it had not. This version was later tweaked for subsequent use. The ad was first posted online Wednesday, Feb. 3 and touts endorsements from unions, an environmental group and The Nation magazine. "From postal workers to nurses, he’s been endorsed for real change," a narrator says in the ad. The narrator goes on to quote editorials from two New Hampshire newspapers, The Telegraph, of Nashua, and the Valley News, which covers both Vermont and New Hampshire from West Lebanon, N.H. Up to that point in the 30-second ad, every logo for an organization or publication has been accompanied by the words "endorsed by." Those words disappear when the Telegraph’s logo appears, along with the quote: "He’s not beholden to Wall Street Money." The words "endorsed by" then reappear next to the logo of the Valley News, which appears along with the quote: "Sanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary Americans for as long as we can remember." Neither the Valley News nor the Telegraph endorsed Sanders. Telegraph executive editor Roger Carroll posted on Twitter the afternoon of Feb. 3: "For the record, despite @BernieSanders deceptive ad to the contrary,@NashuaTelegraph has not endorsed any Dem prez candidate #nhpolitics" More problematic for Sanders’ claim in the debate is how the original ad handled the Valley News. Valley News editor Martin Frank said Feb. 4 that his newspaper had likewise not endorsed a Democrat in the primary, PolitiFact New Hampshire reported. As news of the spot’s issues spread, the Sanders campaign ended up revising the ad. It removed the word "endorsed" by the Valley News logo, although it left the quotes from both New Hampshire newspapers untouched. That’s the version of the ad that was on the campaign’s official YouTube channel immediately before the debate, and the ad is still titled "Endorsed." After the debate, Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels told PolitiFact that the incorrect version of the ad never aired on television. "A YouTube version of this ad mistakenly used this word, but it was never aired on television. As soon as we discovered this mistake it was taken down," Gunnels said. However, during the debate Sanders didn't draw a distinction between the campaign buying air time on TV and posting a publicly viewable ad on the Internet. The Valley News editorial quoted in the ad – from Dec. 31, 2014 -- encouraged Sanders to enter the presidential race. "A presidential candidate who vigorously espoused populism from a progressive point of view could help restore much-needed balance to American political life, which has tilted sharply to the right in recent decades," the paper wrote. However, it was published far too early in the campaign cycle to be considered an endorsement. Our ruling In the debate, Sanders said one of his campaign ads "never said ... a newspaper endorsed us that did not." Sanders is glossing over the initial version of his campaign ad. It originally included text that said Sanders had been "endorsed" by the Valley News, a word that was later removed after it became clear that the newspaper had made no such endorsement. We rate Sanders’ claim in the debate False.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-04T23:39:41	2016-02-04	['None']
pomt-07755	Tim Kaine wants to thwart "right-to-work reform measures in Midwest battleground states."	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/25/christopher-peace/del-chris-peace-says-tim-kaine-lock-step-obama-opp/	The Wisconsin labor fight between public sector unions and Gov. Scott Walker is sending tremors to Virginia’s capitol. After The Washington Post reported that Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine made a Valentine’s Day trip to Madison to meet with Wisconsin union leaders, Del. Chris Peace, R-Hanover, attacked the former Virginia governor. "Rumored VA Senate candidate Kaine [is] in lock-step with Obama to thwart pro-business, job creating right-to-work reform measures in Midwest battleground states," Peace wrote Feb. 18 on his Facebook page. While there is no question Kaine made a trip to Wisconsin and met privately with union leaders, we wondered if he really is an opponent of "right to work" laws like Peace claims. First, let’s define what it means to live in a right-to-work state such as Virginia. The National Labor Relations Act, passed by Congress in the 1930s, says unions and companies can strike deals that require every employee covered under a collective bargaining agreement to either join the union or pay dues and fees. But the law contained an exception, saying states could ban this practice. Virginia and 21 other states have done so. This means a person cannot be fired from a job for declining to join a union or not paying union fees. In states without these laws, bargaining contracts can require certain workers to join the union or pay dues. Virginia law says "no employer shall require any person, as a condition of employment or continuation of employment, to pay any dues, fees or other charges of any kind to any labor union or labor organization." We asked Peace to back up his statement. In an e-mail, he said The Post’s article about Kaine’s visit "suggests that the [White House] political operation got involved at the state level Monday after Kaine spoke to union leaders. The causal connection seems present and begs the question that since the President and the DNC chair agree on this issue that resources would be deployed." Peace also said he thinks the proposed Wisconsin law would make the Midwestern state more like Virginia, at least in terms of labor regulations. Kaine’s most prominent run-in with right-to-work supporters came in the weeks after he became governor in January 2006. The Democrat nominated Daniel LeBlanc, a former state director at the AFL-CIO, to be his secretary of the commonwealth, a post that oversees patronage appointments on the state’s boards and commissions. But Republicans in the House of Delegates, citing LeBlanc’s long opposition to right-to-work laws, scuttled the nomination in a party-line vote. Kaine was furious. "Never before has the Legislature - regardless of which party is in the majority, and regardless of which party controls the Governor's office - ever denied a Governor his prerogative to make Cabinet-level appointments," he said in a March 2006 press release. "The Secretary of the Commonwealth has no - I repeat, no - role in the enforcement of Virginia's right-to-work law, a law I strongly support." The statement supporting "right to work" earned Kaine the ire of liberal bloggers at sites such as Working Life and Daily Kos. When Kaine was considered a possible vice presidential candidate in 2008, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation noted his support for right-to-work laws and said "Kaine’s nomination might not sit well with big city unions, who are strong Democratic Party supporters." But there’s a major problem with Peace’s claim: The bill being proposed by Wisconsin’s Gov. Walker does not contain "right to work" provisions. It is solely aimed at removing collective bargaining rights from public-sector unions on all non-salary issues. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel confirmed that there are currently no Republicans making a prominent push in the state for rules similar to those in Virginia. We called the National Right to Work Foundation, a group that opposes mandatory unionization. Patrick Semmens, a spokesman for the organization, said Kaine’s nomination of LeBlanc and the campaign support he received from unions made him suspect in the group’s eyes. Semmens also shared the foundation’s December 2005 newsletter with us, which included an article on Kaine’s election headlined, "Union bosses’ man wins Virginia governorship." But the story said, "Kaine pledged to oppose any changes in Virginia's right-to-work law." Semmens argued that was a strategic move, not one borne out of conviction. "The political climate and large support in the state for right-to-work probably account for Kaine's occasional pro-right to work statements," Semmens told us in an e-mail. "Recognizing the reality that Virginia's right to work is too popular to repeal is not the same as real support. After he got in office, I don’t think he gave us that much trouble, but I expect that was because [Virginia]’s political climate didn’t allow him to do so." We asked DNC spokesman Alec Gerlach if Kaine’s position on right-to-work laws has changed. Gerlach declined to comment. Let’s review. Peace claimed Kaine is seeking to scuttle "right-to-work reform measures" in Wisconsin and other Midwestern states. Kaine did meet with union leaders in Madison. But he supported Virginia’s right-to-work laws during his gubernatorial campaign and his four years in office. Even the group that seeks to expand these laws concedes Kaine did few things that troubled them. Peace provided no evidence that Kaine’s visit to Madison marks opposition to right-to-work laws. He has no information on what Kaine said during his visit. The Wisconsin bill under debate is not even aimed at establishing "right to work" provisions. Instead it is focused on collective bargaining rules.	None	Christopher Peace	None	None	None	2011-02-25T17:18:36	2011-02-18	['Midwestern_United_States']
pomt-06621	Says "We do about 300 investigations a year into housing discrimination and in recent years have put about $150,000 of damages into the pockets of individuals who have been treated unfairly."	/oregon/statements/2011/sep/20/brad-avakian/oregon-labor-commissioner-investigates-300-housing/	The Bureau of Labor and Industries enforces Oregonians’ civil rights in housing and employment. Last week, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian took to public radio to talk about his role in enforcing federal fair housing laws. "We do about 300 investigations a year into housing discrimination and in recent years have put about $150,000 of damages into the pockets of individuals who have been treated unfairly," he said. That seemed easy enough to check. We searched online the words Avakian, housing and complaints, and found an April 2010 press release in which his office claimed investigating more than 200 complaints since May 2008. Two hundred in two years versus 300 a year? We asked the commissioner’s office to reconcile. Bob Estabrook, the commissioner’s spokesman, owned up to the discrepancy right away. He said the commissioner misspoke. An August 2011 check found roughly 350 housing investigations since May 2008, when BOLI was reauthorized to investigate federal housing claims. That comes out to more than 100 complaints a year, not the 300 a year claimed. As for the money, Estabrook said he couldn’t release dates or other details, because some of the information may be confidential or not easily available. But he said 67 complaints were settled privately, between the parties, or settled at agency prompting. Of the 67 cases, 31 included monetary exchanges totaling almost $160,000. The amounts ranged from $500 to $20,000. It’s not all technically "damages," but it is money that probably would not have gone to complainants without intervention by the agency, he said. PolitiFact Oregon can’t verify the dollar amounts, but we can rule on -- and tell you more about -- the number of cases. A BOLI database shared with The Oregonian shows 339 housing cases through early August 2011. Of those: - There were 77 complaints in calendar year 2008. - There were 88 complaints in 2009. - There were 108 complaints in 2010. - There were 66 complaints through early August 2011. - There are 75 cases currently under investigation. - There were 141 cases closed with no substantial evidence of discrimination. Avakian’s claim of 300 a year is clearly inaccurate. We give his office points for admitting he misspoke -- that’s a good thing in a politician -- and under some circumstances that might cause us to ignore the flub. But Avakian is in a special election race for Congress, making his record as a state official that much more important for voters to understand. To correct that record, we rate the statement False.

pomt-01467	After the 2012 redistricting, Wisconsin has competitive congressional districts.	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/01/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-congressional-districts-wisconsin-a/	When Republicans took over state government in 2010, they scored a golden opportunity to redraw the lines for state and congressional districts in their favor. For the first time since the 1950s, the same party had control of both houses of the Wisconsin Legislature and the governor’s mansion at a time when the required population-based rebalancing of districts took place. At the congressional level, the drawing of the new borders was led by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville) and resulted in significant changes to the district represented by U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Ashland), and smaller but important tweaks to the districts represented by U.S. Rep. Ron Kind (D-La Crosse) and Ryan himself. In a Sept. 2, 2014 appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club, Ryan said the state lawmakers had not engaged in the gerrymandering seen in other states, where districts are redrawn in dramatic fashion to favor the party in power. He also credited Wisconsin incumbents with being good at winning reelection. "I come from one of the battleground districts in the country," Ryan said, during a question and answer session after his speech. "Wisconsin’s like that. We have competitive districts." When we asked for evidence to support his claim that even after the redistricting the seats are competitive, Ryan spokesman Kevin Siefert cited the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan organization that follows federal elections. The Cook Report creates a partisan voter index, or PVI, for each congressional district in the country, a gauge that allows you to compare voting for president in a single district with the national results. "Congressman Duffy’s district is an R+2 and Congressman Kind’s is a D+5, both falling in the ‘swing seats’ range as determined by the Cook Political Report," Siefert said. "Congressman Ryan stated that both seats were very competitive, and the Cook Report’s substantiates that with its Partisan Voter Index." The index means that Duffy’s district voted two percentage points more Republican in the last presidential election than the nation as a whole. Meanwhile, Kind’s district voted five points more Democratic. At the speech, Ryan described the Milwaukee-area seats held by Democrat Gwen Moore and Republican F. James Sensenbrenner as "very much" favoring the incumbent’s party. He spent spent little -- or no -- time on three seats, those held by Democrat Mark Pocan, and Republicans Reid Ribble and Tom Petri. He focused primarily on his own district, and those represented by Kind and Duffy. But the Cook Report’s expert on the House of Representatives said redistricting made the Duffy and Kind districts -- and Ryan’s -- less competitive. "If Paul Ryan claims that these seats are competitive, he’s living in the past," said David Wasserman, who analyzes house districts and races for the Cook Report. "That’s preposterous. There are virtually no competitive seats in Wisconsin." Let’s take a closer look. Changes to the districts At the event, Ryan pointed out that in recent decades the seats that he and Duffy now hold have swung from party to party. The 7th District, in northwest Wisconsin, "went from Dave Obey to Sean Duffy," Ryan said, adding his own district, in southeastern Wisconsin, "went from Les Aspin to Peter Barca to Mark Neumann and Paul Ryan." But Ryan compares apples and oranges. Thanks to redistricting the districts have different voters in them now than when those seats were held by Obey and Aspin. Obey stepped down in 2010, before the latest changes, and was replaced by Duffy. Aspin left in 1993 to join the Clinton administration. And Barca, the most recent Democrat in the seat, last held it in 1995 before losing to Neumann, a Republican. Swapping voting blocks In the 2012 redistricting, significant changes were made to Duffy’s district that gave it more of a Republican base. "The Republicans’ biggest goal was to shore up Sean Duffy in the 7th and they did so by removing Stevens Point and Wood County from the 7th and replacing them with the Twin Cities exurbs of St. Croix County," Wasserman said. That made the district three points more Republican. At the same time, Kind’s district became even more more Democratic, moving from a D+4 in 2010 to a D+5, according to the Cook scale. Ryan aide Seifert notes that this puts the districts in the Cook Report’s "swing" category -- which the report defines as those between Republican +5 and Democratic +5. That is a technical, by-the-numbers definition. The Cook Report separately rates each election based on additional factors, such as incumbency, challengers and the likelihood to change hands in the next election. "Sean Duffy hasn’t had a competitive race in 2012 or 2014 because of the makeup of the district," Wasserman said. Similarly, Ryan’s district became more Republican after the latest redistricting, by swapping some Democratic-leaning areas for Republican-leaning parts of Waukesha County. "Now he’s ultra safe" from losing the seat, Wasserman said of Ryan. "You have a R (plus) 3 district and that’s still safe for Paul Ryan." Here is a look at the state’s eight congressional districts, according to the Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voter Index. The redistricting change came between the 2010 and 2012 elections. 2010 2012 2014 District 1 (Ryan) R+2 R+3 R+3 District 2 (Pocan) D+15 D+16 D+17 District 3 (Kind) D+4 D+6 D+5 District 4 (Moore) D+22 D+21 D+23 District 5 (Sensenbrenner) R+12 R+12 R+13 District 6 (Petri) R+4 R+5 R+5 District 7 (Duffy) D+3 Even R+2 District 8 (Ribble) R+2 R+2 R+2 A 2012 Journal Sentinel analysis of the new districts contained this conclusion: "The new map also reduces partisan competition overall. While some of the changes were small, every U.S. House seat in Wisconsin that wasn’t safe already became safer for the party that now occupies it." Good candidates Ryan said that both Duffy and Kind have won reelection because they’re good politicians. "These guys are good at getting reelected … and these are very competitive districts," he said. Records show that incumbency brings massive fund-raising advantages. As of July 23, 2014, Ryan received $5.9 million in contributions and had $3.9 million in cash on hand, the Federal Election Commission reports. That compares with $502,635 raised and $107,901 in available cash for Democratic challenger Rob Zerban. Similar fund-raising advantages are held by Kind ($1.3 million in cash) compared with challenger Tony Kurtz ($35,666) and Duffy ($1 million) vs challenger Kelly Westlund ($119,000). "But let’s just say one of those guys hangs it up," Ryan said. "That would be a very competitive race." Wasserman said he tended to agree with the what-if scenario for an open seat. "If this was an open seat it would be more competitive, sure," he said, referring to Duffy’s district in particular. But when the Cook Report rated the eight districts by likely outcomes in the upcoming November 2014 election, seven of the eight were listed as "solid" Republican or Democrat. The remaining district -- the seat being being vacated by Petri, who is retiring -- is listed as "likely Republican." Our rating Ryan says that Wisconsin’s congressional districts are competitive. He raised several points to buttress his argument, and each has elements of truth to it. But, overall, the impact of redistricting on the seats cited by Ryan -- including his own -- is clear. Seats now held by Republicans Duffy, Kind and Ryan were redrawn in favor of the incumbent in the 2012 redistricting. We rate Ryan’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-10502	Barack Obama has written and co-sponsored more bills in three years than Hillary Clinton has in seven.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/28/chain-email/distorted-and-unfair-comparison/	Fighting perceptions that their candidate has a thin legislative record, supporters of Sen. Barack Obama say he has written and co-sponsored more bills in three years in the Senate than Democratic opponent Sen. Hillary Clinton has in her seven years. A chain e-mail widely reproduced on Web blogs says Obama authored 890 bills and co-sponsored nearly 1,100 more, and contrasts that output with the record of Clinton, noting she got 20 mostly inconsequential bills passed during her first seven years in the chamber. The numbers use data retrieved on the Library of Congress' legislative search engine, Thomas (named for Thomas Jefferson and found here ). "An impressive record for someone who supposedly has no record, according to some who would prefer this comparison not be made public," the e-mail reads, concluding, "He's not just a talker. He's a doer." But while you can obtain those search results with the right query, the e-mail is misleading for several reasons. First, it compares apples to oranges by contrasting every bill and amendment to a bill that Obama sponsored or co-sponsored, regardless of whether each advanced or languished, to those measures Clinton sponsored or co-sponsored that were signed into law. That guarantees a low count for Clinton, because Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House for most of her seven years in the Senate. The e-mail does not reveal how many of Obama's legislative attempts never got considered. Plus, including amendments in Obama's total but not in Clinton's total unfairly distorts the difference even more. Technically, amendments aren't really "bills," as the e-mail calls them. But more to the point, amendments, in which lawmakers seek to change some narrow part of legislation, can be the best way for members of a minority party to play a role in the legislative process. And then there's this: Experts say it's misleading to use the number of bills a lawmaker sponsors to gauge his or her ability to get things done, anyway. Most of the thousands of measures that senators and representatives introduce each year never get acted on, fond as politicians may be of talking about them. The number of bills they co-sponsor is even more insignificant, because in many of those cases the lawmakers are piggybacking on the efforts of a like-minded colleague who did most of the legwork. "Introducing bills is a relatively cost-free activity because it doesn't involve much time or political capital," said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. "If you think about political capital and how it's used, you need some way of measuring whether this or that senator made a difference and influenced an outcome." A side-by-side tally of Clinton's and Obama's legislative output on Thomas shows Clinton has sponsored 635 bills and co-sponsored 2,441 more since she was elected in 2000, 54 of which became law. Obama has sponsored 272 and co-sponsored another 834 since he was elected in 2004, 16 of which became law. So in an apples-to-apples comparison of bills written and co-sponsored, it's Clinton: 3,076; Obama: 1,106. Not quite the conclusion the e-mail sought to reach. We don't need to rule on whether counting pieces of legislation is a legitimate way of measuring the effectiveness of lawmakers, though experts make clear that it's not. For us, it's enough to look at the facts in the e-mail, the actual numbers being used to make the comparison, and when we look we find manipulation and mistakes. We find a clear False.

pomt-04118	Says Texas is "dead last in support for mental health."	/texas/statements/2013/jan/10/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-dead-last-mental-health-spe/	A Democratic state senator unleashed Twitter posts on the first day of the 2013 legislative session saying what she thinks lawmakers should accomplish. The Jan. 8, 2013, posts by Wendy Davis of Fort Worth included a familiar claim about the state’s low standing in mental health spending. "It's time for the Texas Legislature to take responsibility and move up from dead last in support for mental health," Davis said. Last in the land? We explored similar territory in January 2010, rating as Mostly True candidate Marc Katz’s claim that Texas then ranked last in spending for mental health care. For that fact check, we relied on the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation’s roundup of per-person mental health care spending for the 50 states in fiscal 2006. According to its analysis, Texas ranked 49th among the states that year in per capita spending, not quite last. At expenditures of $34.57 per resident, Texas bested New Mexico, which spent $25.58. The national average was $103.53. In total dollars spent, Texas ranked 10th in 2006, spending about $805 million. Davis spokesman Rick Svatora said the senator drew on a Dec. 18, 2012, news report by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, which quoted the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities as saying that Texas ranks last in the country in per-person mental health spending. Anne Dunkelberg, the center’s associate director, told us by email that the center had passed information to WFAA about spending in fiscal 2009 as written up in an August 2012 report by the Texas-based Hogg Foundation for Mental Health. We found the Kaiser foundation’s latest state-by-state breakdown with help from Gyl Switzer, public policy director of Mental Health America of Texas, which advocates for programs that prevent and treat mental illness. A footnote to the research says the figures come from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, Inc., which says it’s the only national association to represent state mental health commissioners/directors and their agencies. Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to the charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. Its per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th--not last--among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56. Dunkelberg noted that the 2010 breakdown, posted by the foundation on Nov. 20, 2012, suggests Idaho saw its per-capita spending drop by nearly $8, from $44 in 2009. In 2010, Texas spending was up 61 cents per person from its $38.38 in 2009, according to the state-by-state charts. Texas surpassed a state, Dunkelberg wrote, "not because of a significant improvement in our per-capita investment in mental health, but because poor Idaho cut per-capita spending." Finally, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which folds in the state agency over mental health, replied to our inquiry about the Kaiser breakdown by pointing out the analyzed figures do not take into account all funding for mental health services and saying it "doesn’t really give a clear picture of all of the money that goes into mental health spending in Texas." Christine Mann said by email the unnoted funding includes aid funneled through government-supported insurance programs plus services via agencies such as the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the Texas Education Agency, the Texas Youth Commission, the Department of Family & Protective Services and the Department of Aging and Disability Services. Mann said by phone that her agency does not have a figure for total Texas spending on mental health services nor has it compared spending on mental health services among the states. A footnote to the 2010 Kaiser chart says its Texas figure includes money spent on mental health services for prisoners. Dunkelberg, asked to comment on Mann’s critique, said the Kaiser breakdowns do not reflect all mental health funding--for any state. Regardless, Dunkelberg wrote, "the state ranking is a good measure of direct public and community (mental health) spending by a state for the population that is NOT in prison, or" served by the agency that bird-dogs child abuse "or on Medicaid." In each state, too, she said, it’s "likely that Medicaid is a very large payer for (mental health) services, and also likely that no one is tracking that expenditure." Our ruling Davis said Texas is "dead last" in mental health spending. The Kaiser-posted figures do not take into account all mental health spending--for any state. But unless more comprehensive research surfaces, the figures appear to be the best way to compare relative spending. And in 2010, the latest year analyzed, Texas spent more in raw dollars on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending--a better metric for comparing states--Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after ranking last to all other states for several years. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11450	"The vast majority of crime that is gun related is committed by people who illegally are possessing that firearm."	/new-york/statements/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/	U.S. Rep. John Faso says he opposes some gun-control measures because they target the wrong people. Laws that limit the rights of law-abiding gun owners don’t make sense because most gun crime is committed by those who illegally possess a gun, said Faso, a Republican. "The vast majority of crime that is gun related is committed by people who illegally are possessing that firearm," Faso said in an interview on C-SPAN. Faso - who represents parts of the Hudson Valley and Capital Region - supports strengthening background checks for gun buyers, banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21. He does not support other measures, like a ban on assault-style firearms. Is Faso right that the majority of gun crime is committed by those who illegally possess a gun? National data The last time the government tracked this kind of data was in 2004 when the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed inmates in federal and state prisons. Part of the survey asked inmates who had a gun during their crime where they originally got it. Dr. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, was part of a team that used the data to estimate how many illegally possessed guns. In the 13 states with the fewest restrictions on gun ownership, 40 percent of inmates illegally obtained the gun they used, Webster said. Only about 13 percent purchased the gun from a store or pawn shop. In the other 37 states, including New York state, 60 percent of inmates illegally procured the gun they used, Webster said. "If you look at the most stringent standards for legal gun ownership, it’s more like 65 percent," Webster said. The data is hard to track because gun ownership laws vary from state to state. New York state has universal background checks, for example. All gun sales have to go through a federally licensed dealer. A state like Mississippi, meanwhile, does not require background checks outside of gun shops. New York state also prohibits people convicted of several violent misdemeanors from buying or owning a gun. Many other states do not, Webster said. "What people don’t really appreciate is that the standards for gun ownership are so that you can be a legal gun owner but not so much law abiding," Webster said. About 48 percent of state prison inmates surveyed said they got the gun they used from a family member, friend, gun store, pawn shop, flea market, or gun show. Most states only require a background check if the purchase happens at a gun store, according to the Giffords Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Forty percent of state prison inmates admitted they obtained the gun illegally on the black market, from a drug dealer, or by stealing it. Federal agencies have not released research similar to Webster’s on illegal gun crime. His study was the only analysis of federal data we could find and experts were not aware of another. Congress since the 1990s has had an effective ban on federal taxpayer money being spent on research into gun violence as a public health issue and gun control advocacy by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But other government agencies are free to collect data on guns and gun crime. Local data Regional studies have found that a higher share of criminals did not legally possess a gun when they committed their crimes. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh teamed up with the Pittsburgh Police Department in 2016 to look at almost 900 firearms recovered from crime scenes in 2008. They found the criminals connected to these firearms did not legally possess them in 80 percent of the cases. A study from the University of Chicago looked at 99 inmates at the Cook County Jail in Chicago in 2015. It found only about 3 percent of inmates who used a gun bought it at a gun store. Researchers did not track the share of inmates who purchased a gun legally through other means. Previous ruling MSNBC Host Joe Scarborough claimed in 2015 that a very small share of crimes were committed by those who legally possess guns. PolitiFact rated that claim Half True. For that check, we spoke with Philip Cook, a professor of economics and sociology at Duke University. He co-authored the study from the University of Chicago. "I think it’s safe to say that a low percentage of criminal assaults and robberies are committed with guns that were acquired by legal purchase from a gun store," Cook said in 2015. As we noted in 2015, not all guns purchased outside a gun store are illegally obtained. We checked back with Cook for this story. He said the data on violent crimes supports Faso’s claim. "Most people who commit assault, robbery, or murder with a gun anywhere in the U.S. are disqualified under federal law from being in possession of a gun due to age, criminal record, addiction status, immigration status or other reason," Cook said. But there are caveats to the data, experts warned. • Some gun crimes are never solved, so it’s impossible to know whether the gun was obtained illegally. • The national data is more than a decade old. The prison population of 2004 may be different from today’s inmates. • The data also varies between states. An illegal gun sale in one state may be legal in another. Someone can legally sell a gun to their friend without a background check in Mississippi, but not New York. That means Faso’s claim may be true in some states but false in others. Our ruling Faso said "The vast majority of crime that is gun related is committed by people who illegally are possessing that firearm." People can differ on what constitutes a "vast majority." What's more, illegal gun crime is not well researched in the U.S. The latest data is more than a decade old. One analysis of the data showed Faso’s claim is not true in some states while true in others. But experts say most gun crime is likely committed by those who illegally possess guns. His statement is accurate but needed additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	John Faso	None	None	None	2018-03-12T13:57:23	2018-02-27	['None']
pomt-02119	"During the George W. Bush period, there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world. Sixty people died."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/12/john-garamendi/prior-benghazi-were-there-13-attacks-embassies-and/	As the U.S. House of Representatives was readying a new special committee to investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, many Democrats were arguing that continuing to probe the Sept. 11, 2012, attack -- which killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens -- amounted to a political witch hunt. On May 5, 2014, Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., told MSNBC host Ed Schultz that there has already been exhaustive testimony and investigation of the incident. "This thing is just going on and on to boredom actually," Garamendi said. "The Armed Services Committee actually did a hearing and the result was there’s nothing here. That’s obviously a great tragedy, but Ed, during the George W. Bush period, there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world. Sixty people died. In Karachi, there was a death of one of our diplomats, and those were not investigated during that period of time because it was a tragedy." Readers asked us whether it’s true that under Bush, "there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world, (and) 60 people died." We turned to the Global Terrorism Database, a project headquartered at the University of Maryland. The database documents terrorist attacks around the world going back to the 1970s, and experts told us it is the best resource available for this fact-check. We searched the database for descriptions between January 2001 and January 2009 that included the term "U.S. embassy." We supplemented these with a few other attacks listed in a Huffington Post opinion piece that Garamendi’s staff said was their main source for the claim. The Huffington Post column Garamendi cited purposely didn't count any attacks in Baghdad. So we decided to construct our count from scratch. While Garamendi spoke of "embassies and consulates," we found several U.S. diplomatic targets killed in the line of duty outside official compounds -- such as in convoys or their homes -- and we included them in our count. Once we cross-referenced the attacks in the article and those in the database, we narrowed down the total to 39 attacks or attempted attacks on U.S. embassies and embassy personnel. Of these 39 attacks, 20 resulted in at least one fatality. (Our complete list is here.) This is higher than Garamendi's claim, though if you only count attacks on embassy and consular property, there were 13. Garamendi also understated the number of deaths. In the 20 incidents with at least one fatality, the total death toll was 87 -- quite a few more than the 60 Garamendi cited. If you only count those at embassies and consulates proper, the number of deaths drops to 66. We should note that the vast majority of these deaths were not Americans. We counted 63 deaths that were either of non-Americans or of people whose nationality is unknown. Another three were U.S. civilians. Another 21 were workers at the U.S embassy or consulate, either of American or foreign nationality. So, using what we think is the most reasonable definition, Garamendi's numbers are a bit low. What about the implicit comparison he made between Benghazi and these previous attacks? That’s a little shakier. Generally, the experts we contacted agreed that Garamendi was making a reasonable point that there has been a steady, and comparatively overlooked, series of deadly attacks on U.S. embassies in recent years. Still, these experts also said there are valid reasons to treat Benghazi differently from the earlier attacks. "Is Benghazi different? Absolutely," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an adjunct assistant professor in Georgetown University’s security studies program. One reason, he said, is that an American ambassador died in the attack, which hadn’t happened since the 1970s. Another relevant question, Gartenstein-Ross said, "is whether what happened was put to the American people in an honest manner, not just with respect to the administration, but also with respect to the intelligence community." Gartenstein-Ross added that he wasn’t endorsing "how the Republicans go about" investigating this question. But he did say it’s a "real, legitimate question." "As always, what causes the problem is not so much what happens, but the response to it," said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "‘If the administration had come out shortly after the attack and said, ‘Our consulate was attacked by organized Islamist forces, and we will pursue these terrorists and bring them to justice, one way or the other,’ I very much doubt there would be much juice in these hearings, if indeed they were being held at all." Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, agreed that Benghazi brings up important issues. "We probably should have had more United States forces on site or at least nearby," he said. And the administration had a "muddled response in terms of releasing information," he added. Our ruling Garamendi said that "during the George W. Bush period, there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world. Sixty people died." There are actually different ways to count the number of attacks, especially when considering attacks on ambassadors and embassy personnel who were traveling to or from embassy property. Overall, we found Garamendi slightly understated the number of deadly attacks and total fatalities, even using a strict definition. Garamendi’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06536	"We have a $2 trillion to $3 trillion infrastructure deficit. We’ve got work that needs to get done. We’ve got people that want to go to work."	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/06/tim-ryan/tim-ryan-says-nation-needs-spend-2-3-million-get-i/	President Barack Obama’s $447 billion American Jobs Act is front and center on the political stage -- and those on both sides are using big numbers to bolster their arguments. So it was little surprise that the topic stirred emotion last month when Ed Schultz, a liberal who hosts a nightly cable talk show on MSNBC, brought "The Ed Show" to Columbus. Schultz, who has made it clear he favors Obama’s plan, had a friendly panel that included Ohio’s senior U.S. senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown and Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Niles. Asked during the live broadcast if the GOP could be expected to offer any help in the House, Ryan expressed pessimism, then pivoted to a talking point dear to Democrats. "We have a $2 trillion to $3 trillion infrastructure deficit," Ryan said. "We’ve got work that needs to get done. We’ve got people that want to go to work. And they’re Ohioans." The American Jobs Act does call for more infrastructure investment, which would mean more jobs for construction workers and suppliers. Given the high-charged political debate and occasional theater surrounding the plan, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to check Ryan’s numbers. But first things first. What, exactly, is an infrastructure deficit? Generally speaking, it’s a phrase used often by politicians and policy wonks to amplify how much money needs to be spent to bring the nation’s roads, bridges and waterways up to date. Think of it as the difference between how modern and sturdy the infrastructure should be and how modern and sturdy it actually is. "Need" and "should be," of course, can be matters of opinion. With that background in mind, we contacted Ryan’s office, where a spokesman pointed us to a 2009 study from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Reston, Va., trade group graded U.S. infrastructure as poor and estimated it would cost $2.2. trillion over five years to modernize. Ryan was hardly the first politician to notice or embrace the report. Our research found people on both sides of the aisle cite the ASCE study as evidence of the nation’s crumbling foundation. And we found no other estimate so detailed or so widely accepted and repeated as ASCE’s. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, tackled the issue at a July hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee: "We certainly need a new approach," she said. "The American Society of Civil Engineers' most recent estimate says that the U.S. needs to invest $2.2 trillion in order to keep pace with the national infrastructure needs." A few weeks later, Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts used the $2.2 trillion figure, though he did not note the original source, in an appearance on NBC’s "Meet the Press." The conservative Hoover Institution has cited the ASCE estimate while noting, without attribution, other estimates that "range from $1.6 trillion to $3.5 trillion." In September, the White House Press Office sent out a statement from Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who cited the ASCE figure in his enthusiastic endorsement of the American Jobs Act. And on a web site promoting Obama’s plan, the Democratic National Committee cites the group’s study. But Washington can be an echo chamber, where erroneous numbers take on a life of their own while being repeated as fact. So PolitiFact Ohio checked in with ASCE to get a better handle on the group’s mission and method -- and to find out if pols were using the findings correctly. ASCE, according to its web site, represents more than 140,000 civil engineers and, though it is nonpartisan, lobbies for policy that might create more design and construction jobs. To complete the 2009 report card, researchers reviewed about 20 independent studies to calculate a deficit estimate. Sources ranged from the Congressional Budget Office and other federal agencies to other trade organizations. Brian Pallasch, ASCE’s managing director for government relations, told PolitiFact Ohio that his group tried to use as much government data as possible. Pallasch believes the group’s $2.2 trillion figure was conservative. But slapping the word "deficit" after it might not be the most accurate depiction of what the number means. ASCE was careful to describe the $2.2 trillion as a "need" over five years to plug the infrastructure gap. The study also estimated that about $1 trillion would be spent over that time to fulfill the need. That forecast included nearly $72 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the stimulus package, from 2009. Ryan and other politicians tend not to subtract the $1 trillion when talking of the infrastructure deficit. Then again, Pallasch said, the numbers don’t account for flooding and other calamities that have weakened or destroyed infrastructure since the 2009 study was released. And ASCE has not yet tracked how much of that $1 trillion has been spent in the last two years. The $2.2 trillion need "probably isn’t going down," Pallasch said. Ryan spoke of an infrastructure "deficit." Like others before him, he did not cover all the nuance and did not account for likely changes since the year the ASCE study was released. Those who watched him on "The Ed Show" might have had a more complete picture of the problem had they known that nearly half of that $2.2 trillion need was expected to be met over five years. Those pieces of information provide clarification. But given the fluidity of those numbers, and given the fact that he correctly pegged ASCE’s key number between $2 trillion and $3 trillion, Ryan wasn’t cherry-picking. This precision gap is much narrower than the infrastructure gap. As a result, we rate Ryan’s statement Mostly True.	None	Tim Ryan	None	None	None	2011-10-06T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['None']
pomt-12270	Says that Bill Clinton "basically" told then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch in 2016 that "we killed Vince Foster."	/texas/statements/2017/jul/05/pete-olson/pete-olson-said-bill-clinton-basically-told-lorett/	A Texas congressman said President Bill Clinton intimidated the government’s lead lawyer into not seeking an indictment of Hillary Clinton by telling her, "We killed Vince Foster." Did Clinton, desperate to help his wife, declare as much about killing Foster, the White House deputy counsel at the start of Clinton’s two terms? That's what Rep. Pete Olson said in a June 9, 2017, interview on the Houston-based Sam Malone Show. Conspiracy theories have abounded since Foster’s body was found in 1993--all of a part with unsubstantiated tales alleging the Clintons share a sordid history of sidelining people. Over the years, debunkists at Snopes.com and for The Washington Post’s Fact Checker each found no basis to claims about fishiness in Foster's death. Olson, R-Sugar Land, initially said in his radio interview that it was "awfully strange" for Bill Clinton to bump into then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an Arizona airport tarmac at a time in 2016 when Hillary Clinton’s handling of email was under Justice Department review. "I guarantee you," Olson said, "they had the conversation where he basically said, ‘Mrs. Lynch, call your attack dog off. We’ve killed people. We killed Vince Foster. We destroyed Webb Hubbell. We will destroy you.’ And then what happens to things?," Olson said. "All of a sudden--well, she did it, yeah, it was all terrible, don’t know who got the information, very classified. But no indictment." Olson was correct about about a few points. Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016, met privately with Lynch in a plane on the tarmac of Phoenix’s airport. Also, Hillary Clinton was not indicted for how she handled confidential emails. By authoritative accounts, too, Foster, an Arkansas lawyer close to the Clintons, suffered from depression affected by what he felt to be his own personal failings in handling White House events including the Travelgate and Whitewater matters before he was found dead with a gun in his hand in a Washington-area park. But we identified no evidence for Olson’s claim that Bill Clinton told Lynch the Clintons killed Foster. Lynch insisted at the time that the airplane conversation centered on topics such as Clinton’s grandchildren. Our search of the Nexis news database turned up no Bill Clinton accounts of what was discussed. A delayed backpedal Olson himself backed off after his account was brought to light by Right Wing Watch, a project of a liberal group, People for the American Way, 11 days after the radio interview. In a written statement made available the same day, Olson said in part that "in my discussion about Loretta Lynch and Vince Foster, I took the accusations a step too far. I regret my choice of words." On June 23, 2017, we asked Olson after he spoke at a Capitol Hill conference on civility in public life if he’d intended his radio comment about Bill Clinton to be factual. Olson replied: "That was a little out of bounds. It was over the top. I regret it and I apologized for it." Investigations A series of investigations of Foster’s death include the July 1994 finding of a special counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., that Foster’s death in the area’s Fort Marcy Park in July 1993 was a suicide influenced by Foster’s depression associated with episodes involving his legal work for the Clinton White House. Fiske concluded that "Foster's death was a personal collapse, not a White House scandal," The Washington Post said in a news story at the time. "The Fiske investigation involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents, approximately 125 witnesses; also DNA tests, microscopes and lasers," the newspaper reported. In October 1997, an investigation by the office of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr reaffirmed that Foster committed suicide, the Post then reported. "The report concludes that Foster was severely depressed about his work at the White House, took a revolver from a closet in his home, placed it in an oven mitt, and on the afternoon of July 20, 1993, drove to a Virginia park and shot himself," the story said. "And it contains new forensic details that refute the conspiracy theories that have long surrounded his death – that Foster was a victim of foul play, or that his body was moved to Fort Marcy Park after his death at another location, perhaps the White House," the story said. The report itself states in its closing summary: "The available evidence points clearly to suicide as the manner of death." The summary also quoted Dr. Alan L. Berman, an expert suicidologist, saying: "No plausible evidence has been presented to support any other conclusion." Previously, the story said, Fiske and two bipartisan congressional panels similarly concluded that Foster took his own life. By email, we connected with Berman, who said of Olson’s claim: "There is not a scintilla of fact in this statement – it is a blatant falsehood, unsupported and unsupportable. There were four investigations into Foster’s death, all arriving at the same conclusion." Our ruling Olson said Bill Clinton said "we killed" Foster. There’s no evidence of Clinton saying as much nor a factual basis for anyone to say the Clintons killed Foster. This claim, which Olson backed off after it became widely known, adds up to a baseless accusation. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-02493	"Two-thirds of the people who start out in minimum wage are above the minimum wage within a year."	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/16/steve-forbes/steve-forbes-says-two-thirds-people-who-earn-minim/	President Barack Obama made good on his State of the Union promise to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 starting in 2015. But he doesn’t have the executive power to do the same for all workers, so the debate among the White House, Congress, economists and business leaders continues. CNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley asked Steve Forbes, chairman and editor-in-chief of Forbes Media, if raising the minimum wage would be good or bad for the bottom line, economically speaking. "Remember, in terms of minimum wage, they are often with businesses with small margins, and two-thirds of the people who start out in minimum wage are above the minimum wage within a year, when they get skills," said Forbes, a former Republican presidential candidate. We’ll leave it to the economists to debate whether or not raising the minimum wage would help or hurt these workers. PunditFact wanted to know if two-thirds of minimum wage workers do start earning more within a year. Forbes didn’t return our request for comment. We found two papers that directly address his claim. In 2004, economists William Even and David Macpherson published their findings for the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative nonprofit think tank. Using federal labor statistics from the Current Population Survey, they did find that about two-thirds of workers see wage growth within a year. However, since that’s pre-recession data, we’ll place more emphasis on a 2013 report. Two Texas A&M University economics professors, Jonathan Meer and Jeremy West, updated Even and Macpherson’s findings using the same data source from 1979 to 2012. Meer and West reported the following trends of minimum wage workers: 16.55 percent leave the labor force 5.85 percent become unemployed Of those that remained in the workforce, Meer and West found that 65.85 percent receive higher wages the next year. So it’s not that two-thirds of minimum wage workers earn more money the following year. It’s two-thirds of those who continue to work, or 51 percent of all minimum wage workers. Minimum wage earners may choose to leave the labor force because they figure they can do about as well without a paycheck, but with government benefits, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economics professor. There’s a lot of flow in and out of the labor market that complicates Forbes’ claim, she said. Sinclair also pointed out that there’s selection at play in this statistic. Individuals who keep their minimum-wage jobs for one year are proving that they’re dedicated employees who can hold down jobs. That might speak more to why they’re getting a raise than anything else, Sinclair said. Our ruling Forbes said two-thirds of people working for the minimum wage earn more money within a year. The real figure is 51 percent, because some people leave the labor force or lose their job. Forbes’ claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00853	Birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger was "an active participant in the Ku Klux Klan."	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/mar/18/william-obrien/nh-rep-bill-obrien-says-margaret-sanger-was-active/	Debates about Planned Parenthood often find their way back to Margaret Sanger, the outspoken birth control advocate who founded a forerunner to the group. Opponents of Planned Parenthood, and of abortion more generally, have seized on Sanger’s sometimes controversial beliefs as a way to discredit the organization that she helped found. Such was the case on Feb. 8, 2015, when former New Hampshire speaker of the House William O’Brien posted a lengthy online comment about a previous fact check. O’Brien writes, in his first paragraph: "In language that would only occur to one of the liberal elite, here is what Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood and an active participant in the Klu Klux Klan and the eugenics movement, had to say about the immigrants, blacks and poor people for whom that organization’s services were targeted," going on to quote Sanger as saying they were "human beings who never should have been born." That’s a lot to unpack. There is little question that Sanger supported the eugenics movement (more on that later), but one statement really stuck out. Sanger was "an active participant in the Ku Klux Klan." PolitiFact NH decided to check it out. It turns out, Sanger did speak to a group connected to the KKK and wrote about it openly. In Margaret Sanger: An Autobiography, published in 1938, Sanger details her work advocating birth control across the United States and emphasizes her willingness to talk to virtually anyone. "Always to me any aroused group was a good group," Sanger writes, "and therefore I accepted an invitation to talk to the women's branch of the Ku Klux Klan at Silver Lake, New Jersey, one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing." Sanger’s account suggests she didn't hold the group in the highest esteem. After arriving at the meeting, a complicated process that involved driving to a secret location, it was time for her to speak. "Never before had I looked into a sea of faces like these. I was sure that if I uttered one word, such as abortion, outside the usual vocabulary of these women they would go off into hysteria. And so my address that night had to be in the most elementary terms, as though I were trying to make children understand," Sanger writes. It’s important to note that the Women of the Ku Klux Klan was not the KKK itself. It was a parallel, official organization, with branches in all 48 states. It supported the goals of the men’s group, and was based in Little Rock, Ark. And that’s a far cry from being an "active participant" in the Ku Klux Klan, as O’Brien claims. As for Sanger, she indeed supported the eugenics movement. While the notion that the human race could be perfected by better breeding led to a horrific outcome in the Holocaust, it had been widely accepted in progressive, reformist political circles. Supporters included Winston Churchill, H. G. Wells, Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, George Bernard Shaw and economist John Maynard Keynes. And while he disagreed with and worked to debunk eugenicists who insisted on black people’s inferiority, African-American activist W. E. B. Du Bois subscribed to a number of the movement’s principles. In other words, supporting eugenics did not automatically equal racism. Jean H. Baker, who wrote the biography Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion and is the Bennett-Harwood professor of history at Goucher College in Maryland, says attempts to paint Sanger as a bigot are simply false. "As for Sanger as a supporter of KKK, it is just untrue," Baker wrote in an email. "She was far ahead of her times in terms of opposing racial segregation. She worked closely with black leaders to open birth control clinics in Harlem and elsewhere. She believed all women should have the information about birth control that rich women had, hence her lecture to the KKK women." Ruth Engs, a professor emeritus of applied health science at Indiana University who has studied the eugenics movement, also said O’Brien’s claim was incorrect. "Margaret Sanger, as far as I know, was never a member of the Klan. She would speak to any group who was interested in how to control their reproduction. This includes immigrant groups, black groups, church groups, in addition to professionals, physicians," she wrote in an email. Author Edwin Black, whose 2003 book War Against the Weak paints a scathing portrait of the American eugenics movement, criticizes Sanger harshly in its pages for her eugenic beliefs. Ultimately, though, he writes, "Sanger was no racist. Nor was she anti-Semitic." Contacted for comment, O’Brien referred to two articles online, one a piece from the American Spectator and the other an entry on a blog that has no other content. The Spectator article mostly refers to the passages from the autobiography, although it leaves out the paragraph in which Sanger compares her audience to children. It also treats the women’s branch of the Ku Klux Klan and the actual Klan as one and the same. The blog includes similar content, along with information about the effect of abortions on the African American community. We should note, however, that no Planned Parenthood chapter offered abortions until 1970, four years after Sanger’s death. O’Brien and the sources he cited all highlight a comment made by Sanger in a Dec. 10, 1939, letter. In it, she writes, "We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs." A 2011 PolitFact Georgia article examined this statement and found it was actually innocuous. "Sanger’s correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears," the article states. We should also note that in 1966, while she was still alive, Planned Parenthood bestowed the Margaret Sanger award on Martin Luther King Jr. He accepted, and while he was unable to attend the event, his wife Coretta showed up in his place to read his speech. In it, King wrote: "There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts. She, like we, saw the horrifying conditions of ghetto life. Like we, she knew that all of society is poisoned by cancerous slums. Like we, she was a direct actionist – a nonviolent resister." Given the fact that Sanger’s autobiography had been published nearly 30 years before King’s speech, her earlier address was no secret. It should be clear the civil rights leader did not think of Sanger as a racist. In addition to the links O’Brien shared, he also threw a little vitriol our way. "These facts won’t stop your defamatory attacks in your article or in the future," he said through his Facebook account in response to an inquiry for this article . "Your article is certainly already written and will be yet another attack piece intended to satiate the prejudices of the narrower band of the electorate who care what the Concord Monitor has to say." Our ruling Former New Hampshire Speaker of the House William O’Brien wrote that Margaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood and "an active participant in the Klu Klux Klan." Birth-control advocate Sanger did give a speech to a women’s branch of the KKK and she was a believer in eugenics. However, her writings and other contemporary evidence make clear that she was not ideologically in tune with the Klan -- much less an "active participant." O’Brien’s claim goes far beyond the evidence. We rate the statement False.	None	William O'Brien	None	None	None	2015-03-18T15:59:04	2015-02-08	['Margaret_Sanger', 'Ku_Klux_Klan']
pomt-01902	"Since the governor took office, Oregon’s unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest point in three years."	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/02/john-kitzhaber/under-gov-kitzhaber-has-oregons-unemployment-rate-/	Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, is seeking an unprecedented fourth term in office. The problem-filled rollout of Cover Oregon, the state’s health insurance exchange, is bound to be a contentious issue in his race against challenger Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point. But so is the state’s economy, which took a beating in the wake of 2008’s Great Recession. The claim: On his campaign website, Kitzhaber lists "Getting Oregonians Back to Work" among his top priorities. At the same time, the site says, some positive economic news has been generated since he took office in January 2011. Chief among those, it says, are the creation of 25,000 jobs and an improvement in the state’s credit rating. Then, there’s this: "Since the governor took office, Oregon’s unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level in three years." PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know if that’s true. The analysis: This fact-check seemed about as straightforward as they get -- find the relevant statistics, see if they comport with the claim and proceed to the rating. However, there’s an aspect to this claim that goes beyond the bottom line. Kitzhaber doesn’t take complete credit for the turnaround, but it’s clear -- especially combined with his job-creation numbers and better credit rating -- that he’s submitting an economic resume to bolster his 2014 campaign. Kitzhaber defeated Republican Chris Dudley in November 2010 to win his third term. His first two terms ran from 1995 to 2003. He was sworn in most recently in January 2011, so that’s when the clock starts ticking. We emailed Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor, who sent an online interactive graph showing unemployment rates for Oregon and the nation as a whole from 1990 through May 2014. Here are the numbers, as shown on a graph prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: In January 2011, the month Kitzhaber was sworn in, Oregon’s unemployment rate was 10 percent -- down considerably from the Great Recession peak of 11.6 percent in May and June 2009. By comparison, the U.S. unemployment rate when he took office was 9.1 percent, down from the post-recession high of 10 percent in October 2009. So when Kitzhaber took office, Oregon’s unemployment rate was already trending down, as was the rate for the nation as a whole. Still, has it dropped since then to its lowest level in three years, as the governor claimed? The answer is essentially yes, according to Oregon Employment Department figures for May 2014, the most recent month available. The statewide rate, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, is 6.9 percent, down from the 10 percent when Kitzhaber took office. The rate was slightly lower in February and April at 6.8 percent, but it’s ticked back and forth between 6.8 and 6.9 percent since. It needs to be pointed out, however, that 6.9 percent is a statewide average. Rates in some rural counties remain stubbornly high, although down significantly from their recession peaks. We contacted Nick Beleiciks, a state employment economist, for his view. "Unemployment rates are generally higher in Oregon’s non-metro counties, which has been the case for at least 10 years," he wrote in an email. "They have the same overall pattern of falling unemployment rates that the Portland metro area counties and other metro area counties show." Combined, all non-metro counties in the state have an average unemployment rate of 8.5 percent, he added. That’s down from just under 11 percent three years ago. We contacted Kitzhaber’s office to see how much credit the governor is taking for the statewide dip. As it turns out, at least some. In rural Oregon, for instance, various initiatives the governor has launched are "making a difference in reducing unemployment and encouraging economic development," according to a statement emailed by spokeswoman Rachel Wray. The statement also singled out the six Regional Solutions teams deployed across the state, the Governor’s Strategic Reserve Fund to help support job training and hiring, and the Oregon Business Plan -- Kitzhaber’s "blueprint" for strengthening the economy across the state. Last, we got back in touch with Duy, the University of Oregon economics professor. "Politicians in general like to take credit for the economy," he said in a voice message. "But in many cases, including this one, there are larger cyclical factors at play, and we’re caught up in those larger cyclical factors. To me, this is best evidenced right now by unemployment rates dropping for the U.S. as a whole." The ruling: Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, is seeking a fourth term as governor. Among the accomplishments listed on his website is that unemployment in Oregon is at its lowest in three years. Kitzhaber’s office, in a statement, also took some credit for the drop. Statistics largely bear out the claim that the unemployment rate is the lowest in three years -- down from 10 percent when Kitzhaber was sworn in to 6.9 percent currently. Although it was one-tenth of a point lower in February and April than in May, the most recent month available, we aren’t dinging the governor for that. Monthly unemployment numbers are often adjusted later and the figure remains between 6.8 and 6.9 percent. It’s important to note, however, to keep two things in mind. The first is that unemployment rates across the country, including Oregon, had been trending down for at least two years before Kitzhaber was sworn in. Second, that unemployment rates in a handful of rural counties remain considerably above the statewide average (although they, too, are down from when the governor took office). An economist also stressed that the drop in Oregon’s unemployment rate over the course of Kitzhaber’s most recent term is inextricably linked to a similar national reduction in unemployment. The governor’s statement is accurate, as far as it goes, but lacks key context to shine a true light on the state’s unemployment situation. We rate it Half True. Comments? Questions?

pomt-12258	Says because of Donald Trump, "the IRS decided to stop enforcing the individual mandate that was the underpinning of the ACA. That has resulted in insurance companies all across the country jacking their rates up, explicitly because they don't believe that healthy people will buy insurance."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/10/chris-murphy/donald-trump-responsible-rising-health-insurance-p/	Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., blamed President Donald Trump for insurance rate hikes through the administration’s attempts to weaken the Affordable Care Act. "It all started when he issued an executive order … that commanded all federal agencies to start undermining the ACA, and his agencies listened," Murphy said in the June 26 video. "The IRS decided to stop enforcing the individual mandate that was the underpinning of the ACA. That has resulted in insurance companies all across the country jacking their rates up, explicitly because they don't believe that healthy people will buy insurance." Insurance rates have indeed been on the rise, but we wondered whether it could all be traced back to the IRS and a weakened enforcement of the individual mandate. We found that Trump has continued the weak enforcement of the individual mandate in place during the Obama administration, freezing a change that was set to begin with the 2016 tax year. But his party’s rhetoric on repealing the Affordable Care Act, as well as other issues, have been linked to premium rate increases. The role of the IRS The IRS is the agency tasked with enforcing the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which requires most individuals to obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty for going without. The mandate was designed to encourage healthy people to enter the risk pool and thus lower insurance costs. When people file their individual income tax returns, they must indicate their health insurance coverage or list a waiver or exemption. Otherwise, they must pay the penalty for lacking coverage. For the 2016 tax year, those who weren’t covered had to pay 2.5 percent of taxable income or $695, whichever was higher. Those tax returns that failed to do any of these three actions were considered "silent returns," and elicited a letter from the IRS alerting the taxpayer of the issue. "Most of the time the taxpayer didn’t get back, and there was nothing else the IRS could do," said Chris Condeluci, a former Republican tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee when the Affordable Care Act was written. President Barack Obama instructed the IRS to stop processing silent returns beginning with 2016 tax filings to punish taxpayers expecting a refund who failed to comply with the law. Trump’s executive order scrapped that change. "Processing silent returns means that taxpayer returns are not systematically rejected by the IRS at the time of filing, allowing the returns to be processed and minimizing burden on taxpayers, including those expecting a refund," the IRS said in a Feb. 15 press release. "When the IRS has questions about a tax return, taxpayers may receive follow-up questions and correspondence at a future date, after the filing process is completed. This is similar to how we handled this in previous years, and this reflects the normal IRS post-filing compliance procedures that we follow." Murphy’s team pointed us to that announcement when we asked for evidence for Murphy’s statement. Trump’s order did cause the IRS to change direction internally, but outwardly, the agency is enforcing the same policy. "They’re adhering to the same enforcement policy as the Obama administration did. At the end of the day it’s merely business as usual when it comes to the IRS," Condeluci added. The IRS may have maintained the status quo, but the announcement still made an impact. "It was noted by the actuaries who calculate rates. But it’s another element in a complex mosaic in factors that lead to rate increases," said Dan Mendelson, the president of Avalere, a health care consulting firm. Then there’s Congress. Regardless of the Trump administration’s impact on the IRS, Congress is working to effectively scrap the individual mandate. The House Committee on Appropriations has drafted a bill that would terminate the tax penalty on those who go without insurance, which the House Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government approved on June 29. Premiums on the rise Insurance rates for the most popular type of exchange plan are an average of 18 percent higher than last year, according to Avalere. A combination of medical inflation and political volatility account for the hike, although it’s hard to apportion the causes of the rate increases. The individual mandate isn’t the only factor, though. "Although the mandate is a reason for higher premiums for next year, it's probably not the main reason," said Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University’s Graduate School of Public Service. "The main reason is uncertainty about whether Congress will fund the ACA’s cost-sharing reductions." That's a different animal. Congress is weighing whether to continue funding the $8 billion pool of cost-sharing reduction subsidies under the ACA. In 2010, the House filed a lawsuit arguing the subsidies were illegal, and the Trump administration has not clarified whether it will defend them in court. The bipartisan budget bill passed late June did not include those funds. "This is one of the larger premium hikes because there's a lot of uncertainty about what’s going to happen to the insurance marketplace," said Claire Brindis, the director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. "Whenever insurance companies feel like there's going to be dramatic changes, they get skittish about profit margins." Our ruling Murphy said that insurance companies are jacking up their rates because of the IRS’ weakened enforcement of the individual mandate under Trump. That’s an exaggeration. The Trump administration has continued the same policies as Obama. A mandate to buy insurance is in place, but there’s not much punishment for those who refused to comply. Murphy suggested that the individual mandate itself was key in keeping insurance rates low. In theory, the requirement invites greater diversity to the health insurance risk pool, but the IRS never had sufficient tools at its disposal to enforce it effectively. Blaming rate increases on the IRS is too simplistic, particularly as there is no evidence of a direct link. A number of other factors are at play, including uncertainty around future health care subsidies. Because there has been little outward change in the IRS enforcement policies, we rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-14490	When Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate, "that was the end" of Romney’s chances to win.	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/26/donald-trump/picking-paul-ryan-ended-mitt-romneys-chances-winni/	Reflecting on the 2012 presidential campaign, Donald Trump blamed Mitt Romney’s loss on his choice of a running mate: Paul Ryan. "That was the end of that campaign, by the way, when they chose Ryan," Trump said Feb. 17, 2016 on the campaign trail in South Carolina. "And I like him. He's a nice person, but that was the end of the campaign." In some quarters, Romney’s choice of the Republican congressman from Janesville, who is now speaker of the House, was seen as boosting the GOP nominee’s chances. Democrat Barack Obama, of course, defeated the former Massachusetts governor to win a second term. But did Romney’s fortunes plummet as soon as he chose Ryan? Not according to the polls. Importance of the veep pick Let’s note at the top that a vice-presidential pick is only one of an innumerable number of factors that bear on the outcome of a presidential campaign. And it’s not typically regarded as a pivotal one. "For the most part, voters look almost exclusively at the presidential candidate and there’s little evidence that very many of them base their choice on the vice-presidential selection," said longtime political reporter Peter Brown, who is now assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, which does national polling in presidential races. Indeed, the vice-presidential selection might make a big splash in the news briefly, but it occurs long before voters cast their ballots. In the meantime, the campaign is quickly overtaken by other events. Gallup has found, though, that there typically is a temporary bump in the polls for presidential contenders shortly after they announce their running mate. That’s essentially what happened with Romney. Polls after the pick Romney announced his selection on Aug. 11, 2012. In Ryan, wrote Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Washington bureau chief Craig Gilbert, Romney was tapping "perhaps his party's most influential politician on economic and budget policy, a huge favorite of pro-business and free-market conservatives, a personable policy wonk and energetic campaigner, and the architect of two deeply controversial federal budget plans that sharply scale back social spending and health care entitlements." The controversial budget plans were what Trump cited when he made his statement about Ryan. Answering a question at a retirement community about Social Security, Trump said Romney was hurt by what he described as Ryan's calls to cut Social Security and other entitlement programs for the elderly. As the Washington Post noted in reporting Trump’s comments, shortly after Romney picked Ryan there was an ad attacking Ryan's stance on Medicare that showed an elderly woman in a wheelchair being thrown off a cliff by a man in a dark suit. The message on the screen: "Mitt Romney made his choice. ... Now you have to make yours." Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back his claim. But Romney did not tank in the polls after choosing Ryan. Pollster Charles Franklin of Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee told us that in the trend estimates he did of all national polls during 2012, Romney’s support was declining immediately before Ryan was picked, and rose immediately after. And in the polling completed just before the Ryan pick compared to polls begun just after, there was a slightly higher average for Romney after the pick, though it was not statistically significant. But there was no evidence, Franklin said, that support for Romney declined in the immediate aftermath of the Ryan pick. Said Kathleen Weldon, communications director at Cornell University’s Roper Center: Ryan "neither hurt the ticket nor brought on a substantial bounce." News stories on polling just before and just after the Ryan pick painted a similar picture. The pick gave Romney a "micro-bump" in battleground states such as Florida in Wisconsin, even though the ticket’s proposal for changing Medicare was wildly unpopular in those states, according to a Quinnipiac poll. A Huffington Post article, meanwhile, found in a handful of national polls that the veep bump was "somewhere between small and non-existent." In closing, two other notes, even though they reflect results long after Ryan was chosen: 1. The Romney-Ryan ticket did well among senior citizens As the Post article on Trump’s claim pointed out, despite Trump’s emphasis on how Ryan hurt the ticket among senior citizens, exit polls showed more voters over the age of 65 voted for Romney and Ryan than for Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, with the Republican candidates winning that age group by 12 percentage points. That was higher than in 2008 when Republican nominee John McCain won that age group by 8 percentage points or in 2004 when George W. Bush won it by 5 percentage points. 2. The ticket did as well or better at the ballot box than in polls prior to Ryan’s choice In polls tracked by Real Clear Politics, Romney’s support ranged between 39 percent to 47 percent in six national polls taken in August 2012 in the days before Ryan was selected. Obama’s ranged from 44 to 52 percent. Ultimately, in the election, Romney ended up with 47 percent of the vote, with Obama getting 51 percent. Our rating Trump said that when Romney chose Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate, "that was the end of the campaign." Polls taken in the days after Ryan’s selection generally showed that Romney’s standing vs Obama was as good or better than in the days before the pick. We couldn’t find any evidence that the Ryan pick sunk the ticket. We rate Trump’s statement False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-02-26T10:00:00	2016-02-17	['Mitt_Romney', 'Paul_Ryan']
pomt-01154	The United States has "more of our people in prison than Russia, China, and North Korea combined."	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/16/matthew-cooke/us-prison-population-big-russia-china-and-north-ko/	The United States gets a bad rap for the huge number of residents in lockup across the nation. And in many cases, its reputation for incarcerating more people than any other country is deserved. But one recent attempt by Hollywood activists who wanted to put the country’s prison population in perspective went too far. Following on protests stemming from the shooting of Michael Brown, director-writer Matthew Cooke and producer-actor Adrian Grenier co-wrote a Huffington Post column that called on Americans to support three groups focused on criminal justice reform. Many of the claims in the column were supported by links from outside sources, but one that wasn’t caught the eye of a reader, who asked us if it is true. "Behind the front lines we've systematically corralled masses of Americans into the largest prison system on the planet. We have more of our people in prison than Russia, China, and North Korea combined," the column said. "And most are non-violent, so what is this colossal net we've cast over so many people? What's it really doing? And who are the 2.3 million Americans we've dragged into cages?" We can only evaluate statements on the Truth-O-Meter from one person at a time, so we’ll focus on Cooke since we spoke to him for our story. About that interview: After we presented some of our initial findings to Cooke via email, he quickly wrote back that he used the wrong countries in his statistic. He meant to include Iran, he said, which has about 220,000 prisoners, and not Russia. He said he would seek a correction for that line, but the overarching point that there are more people locked up in the United States than other countries holds up. Here’s what we found. Nailing down how many Americans are behind bars is complex. We saw recent estimates from 2.24 million people, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, to more than 2.4 million, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population. It’s hard to calculate a tally of inmates because the scope of incarceration facilities is so wide. There are state prisons, local jails, federal prisons, military prisons, juvenile correctional centers, immigration detention facilities and others for American Indian territories and overseas territories. State prisons house the biggest chunk of inmates by far at an estimated 1.36 million people, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, which detailed population snapshots for nine population facilities in a pie chart earlier in 2014. Combined with the massive turnover of old inmates leaving and new ones coming in, it makes pinning down an exact number very difficult. For the sake of fleshing out Cooke’s initial comparison with China, Russia and North Korea, we delved into a global report from the International Centre for Prison Studies, which is widely reported and recently partnered with the Institute for Criminal Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London. The group’s China estimate is 1.64 million sentenced prisoners, though it does not factor in citizens who are in pre-trial detention or "administrative detention," which could be around a half-million people. For Russia, the prison population was estimated at 681,600 in January 2013, down from earlier years after leaders granted political amnesty to prisoners, and tuberculosis swept detention facilities. The center does not have a reliable estimate for North Korea, notorious for its secretive government and political prison camps, though it loosely references an estimate of 150,000 prisoners. A United Nations report showed satellite images of prisons holding around 120,000 people. Regardless, using the conservative estimates for just China and Russia produces a sum (2.321 million) that is either more or less than the estimated U.S. prison population depending on the source. Adding in rough estimates for part of North Korea’s population obviously pushes up the total. Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, said we should set the raw numbers aside because they are not as useful as comparing each country’s incarceration rate, which factors in population size. The U.S. prison population rate is highest in the world, at 716 per 100,000 of the national population, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies. Russia’s is 475 prisoners per 100,000 of the national population, and China’s is 121 per 100,000 population, which is below the world’s median rate, Wagner pointed out. More than half of countries and territories have rates below 150 per 100,000 population, the report said. Wagner’s group also compares incarceration rates for U.S. states with other countries. At the top are Southern states like Louisiana (1,341 inmates per 100,000 population) and Mississippi (1,155). At the bottom are Northeastern states like Maine and Vermont (rates of 277 and 257, respectively), which still put more people behind bars than any of the United States’ close allies, such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Canada. Our ruling Cooke (and Grenier) tried to make a striking point about the size of the U.S. prison population when they wrote, "We have more of our people in prison than Russia, China, and North Korea combined." When we contacted Cooke, he acknowledged that the comparison is questionable, as respected (and conservative) estimates for China and Russia alone exceed the low-end count of American prisoners. Cooke said he would change the line in the column to be more accurate, and it now says, "We have more of our people in prison than anyone else -- more than Iran, more than North Korea, more than Russia or even China." (Kudos to him for acknowledging the error.) Still, experts say the preferred measure of comparison, a country’s incarceration rate, shows the United States far ahead of other countries, which supports the underlying point. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Matthew Cooke	None	None	None	2014-12-16T11:20:56	2014-12-10	['United_States', 'Russia', 'China', 'North_Korea']
pomt-09386	Marco Rubio's "income skyrocketed while his power increased."	/florida/statements/2010/mar/26/charlie-crist/charlie-crists-first-tv-ad-focuses-marco-rubios-mo/	In his first TV ad in the U.S. Senate primary, Gov. Charlie Crist wastes no time trying to shatter former House Speaker Marco Rubio's image as an ideologically pure, conservative crusader. Using a line graph with red ink, Crist claims that Rubio's income soared when he became a member of the state House in 2001. "His income skyrocketed while his power increased," the narrator says in the 30-second spot titled "We Thought He Was Different." The line graph starts in 2002 and ends in 2005, and indicates that Rubio's income more than tripled, starting at about $100,000 and rising to more than $300,000. We know state legislators are paid modestly, so we were curious if Crist's made-for-TV graphic is charting reality. To find out, we turned to the Florida Commission on Ethics, which requires elected officials to file a financial disclosure form each year. The forms list a person's net worth, assets and liabilities, and income. Connie Evans, an executive secretary with the commission, provided PolitiFact Florida with Rubio's financial disclosure forms from 1998, when he was a member of the West Miami City Commission, until he left the Florida House as speaker in 2008. The financial disclosure forms include legible income information for every year except 2000. (We could not discern Rubio's handwriting for that year). A lawyer by trade, Rubio reported his income for each year: 1998: $73,380 1999: $99,000 2001: $89,878 2002: $124,721 2003: $122,718 2004: $298,825 2005: $329,916 2006: $346,896 2007: $346,000 2008: $414,000 For some context: Rubio was part of the House Republican leadership beginning in 2001 as a whip, rose to be majority leader, and was speaker from 2006 to 2008. Rubio's income in the first few years included his salary of between $72,000 and $120,000 plus his West Miami City Commission pay ($1,380) and later his legislative salary (around $30,000 a year). But in 2004, Rubio's income increased dramatically, records show. That year he collected almost $270,000 by working for three separate law firms in South Florida -- Broad & Cassel, Becker & Poliakoff and the Haggard Law Firm. Starting in 2005, Rubio earned $300,000 a year working for Broad & Cassel, a well-connected statewide firm that had done millions of dollars of legal work for the Florida House. Between 2002 and 2005, Broad & Cassel had billed state taxpayers $4.5 million for legal work authorized by former Speaker Johnnie Byrd. Byrd and a managing partner of the firm, Steve Burton, were friends. But the expenses appeared so great that the then-incoming speaker, Alan Bense, ordered an audit of Broad & Cassel's work. The results of the audit were never publicized. In 2008, Rubio added $69,000 from Florida International University where he was hired as a visiting professor. In the television ad, Crist focuses on the years 2002 to 2005, which is a bit misleading because it brackets Rubio's big salary spike in 2004. If you included more years, the income increase is still dramatic, just not as much. Let's compare Crist's graphic (it's the one near the top of this item under the ruling) with two graphics we created ourselves. First, we charted the same thing Crist did, years 2002-2005. Here's what it actually looks like: Then we decided to chart all of the years on file with the state. That chart looks like this: Not huge differences, mind you, but differences. In his TV ad "We Thought He Was Different," Crist said Rubio's income skyrocketed and showed a red-line graphic that illustrates the dramatic increase. While his ad chose years that had a particularly steep increase, a broader range of years show much the same thing. In his eight years in the House, Rubio's income more than quadrupled.

pomt-05596	Says President Obama and his allies in Congress gave "power" to control Medicare patients’ health care decisions to "a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington."	/tennessee/statements/2012/mar/30/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-says-patients-power-control-healt/	As the U.S. Supreme Court, after three days of oral arguments, moves toward determining the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we note that U.S.Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., has again weighed in on one of its provisions. Like many other Republicans, she is attacking the Independent Payment Advisory Board created in the legislation and voted to repeal the provision last month. The board is intended to rein in Medicare costs beginning in 2015 with Congress required to either accede to its recommendations or act to overrule them. Specifically, Blackburn said: "Instead of giving patients control of their health care decisions, the President and his allies in Congress chose to delegate this power to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington." We asked Blackburn spokesman Mike Reynard for evidence backing the claim and he referred to Section 3403 of the law where the board is established and to an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. Ryan said the board would be "empowered by the new health-care law to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for seniors." Our PolitFact Ohio colleagues took a look at a similar assertion about the IPAB by the former "Tutti Frutti" crooner Pat Boone on March 11 and rated it a "Pants on Fire" distortion of the truth. Closer to what Blackburn said about the IPAB are the statements PolitiFact national looked at from of U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and PolitiFact Georgia looked at from U.S. Rep. Phil G Gingrey, R-Ga., the latter an obstetrician-gynecologist. Both suggested the IPAB’s "bureaucrats" would make medical decisions for patients. In both instances, those assertions were rated False. PolitiFact Georgia asked four different health experts about Gingrey’s claim that "a bunch of bureaucrats" would "decide whether you get care." All four said Gingrey was wrong. Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank usually at odds with Democratic positions, said that the assertion that the IPAB would be controlling patients health-care decisions is "not even close to correct." Cato scholar Michael Tanner is himself an opponent of IPAB but nonetheless said: "It [IPAB] has nothing to do with individual care at all. It’s not making decisions on individuals." The letter of the law shows the board has nothing to do with individual patients or their health care decisions, but would suggest cost-savings proposals within a mandate that specifies it cannot ration care. The board might recommend, based on medical best practices, that every discharged hospital patient get guidance on wound care or that they drink plenty of cold water. They might find that surgery to install certain medical devices – like hip replacements – should not be done on Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 105. The goal is cost-savings, not micro-managing patient care. Blackburn couches her statement about the IPAB in the context of physicians cutting back on the number of Medicare patients they treat and suggests that, with the IPAB, "this problem will only get worse, leaving our seniors without the necessary access to physicians they deserve." This overstates the case. Some physicians are not taking on new Medicare patients for a variety of reasons, including low reimbursement rates. And it’s true the board could recommend lower rates for some procedures and discourage more doctors from taking on new patients. But the board is mandated to do so on a medically sound basis. The board exists to rein in costs, a job Congress has repeatedly declined to undertake, as this Washington Post editorial, among others, has pointed out. Gingrey also made an assertion that the board will be stocked with "unelected bureaucrats," and said it would be capable of making life-and-death decisions. That was found to be just not false but outrageous by PolitiFact Georgia. "This claim is incorrect," it said "The IPAB does not have anything close to the power that Gingrey suggests. It cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying life-saving care." Blackburn’s claim that the IPAB will consist of "15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington," like Bachmann’s grievance that the IPAB consists of political appointees, "leaves out a lot of detail of the law’s requirements," as PolitiFact National put it in its check of Bachmann’s claims about the IPAB. The law states that the members "shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation and a balance between urban and rural representatives." It also says the board "shall also include representatives of consumers and the elderly." And, it says individuals who are directly involved in providing or managing health care "shall not" constitute a majority of the board’s members. The president appoints 15 members, who undergo confirmation by the Senate, and there are three ex-oficio members. Once appointed to the board, the members become full-time government employees and are not allowed to hold other full-time employment. Our ruling Blackburn to her credit did not mention rationing -- connecting that practice to the IPAB is what pushed Boone’s claim to judged ridiculously false. But she did say that President Obama -- through the law -- would be giving the "power" to control Medicare patients’ health-care decisions to "a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington." Since we find that the IPAB would not control decisions made at the individual patient level, we rate it False.

pomt-06170	"If Congress does not pass the renewal of the payroll tax cut before the end of the year, nearly 160 million working families will see their taxes go up by roughly $1,000."	/texas/statements/2011/dec/15/charlie-gonzalez/san-antonio-democrat-says-failure-extend-payroll-t/	Like many in Congress, U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez of Texas says letting a payroll tax cut expire would be a bad move for families. The San Antonio Democrat said in a Dec. 13, 2011, press release: "If Congress does not pass the renewal of the payroll tax cut before the end of the year, nearly 160 million working families will see their taxes go up by roughly $1,000." That many families will face that much of a tax hit? The payroll tax at issue is the 6.2 percent of eligible earnings that American workers pay to help fund Social Security. It’s called a payroll tax because the money is taken directly out of people’s paychecks. There are limits to the total amount that individuals are required to pay. In 2009 and 2010, the levy applied to the first $106,800 of salary, meaning no one would pay more than $6,621. Employers paid a matching share. In December 2010, the employee tax was cut to 4.2 percent through 2011 as part of an agreement President Barack Obama worked out with Congress to extend income-tax reductions passed during President George W. Bush’s administration. Obama later proposed slicing the payroll levy to 3.1 percent for workers next year. Congress has been debating how to extend and possibly expand the payroll tax cut. Asked how Gonzalez settled on his figures, his office urged us to contact the Office of Management and Budget, which is part of the executive branch, and also pointed us to a November 2011 web post by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, stating that the average annual benefit per household if Obama's proposed cut to 3.1 percent was adopted would be $1,426. A footnote attributes that information to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent research organization. In an interview, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the center, walked us through its estimates of the impact of renewing the current payroll tax cut through 2012. Regarding the congressman’s reference to the tax cut benefiting "nearly 160 million working families," the center estimates that the country will have 165 million households in 2012. However, it says, about 122 million households — not nearly 160 million — are projected to benefit from extending the cut. About 40 million households would not benefit, Williams told us, because the residents are not projected to have paying jobs. The congressman, he said, "has got the wrong number of benefiting households." Next, we took up the claim that working families will see their taxes go up by roughly $1,000 if the cut is not extended. By the end of this year, according to another center calculation, nearly 121 million households will have taken home an average of $934 more thanks to the cut. And the center estimates that the average benefit, for all benefiting households, would be $920 in 2012. Logically, the dollar value of each household’s projected 2012 tax savings is greatly driven by how much each household earns. If the payroll tax cut is extended, the center projects, the poorest 20 percent of households will average a $165 benefit. Higher-income households would accumulate more take-home dollars; households earning $62,043 to $104,401 are projected to average $1,280 in benefits and those earning $104,402 or more would average $2,253 in 2012 benefits. Next, we asked the OMB about the $1,000 tax-cut figure. By email, spokeswoman Meg Reilly pointed out that according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the nation’s median household income in 2010 was $49,445, nearly $50,000 -- the 2-percent cut amounts to $1,000 of that total. Summing up, the center’s Williams told us that extending the cut would benefit about 122 million households next year, saving them an average of a little over $900 apiece. "The range will be large, though, going from virtually no savings for people who work very little to" more than $2,200 for workers with the highest earnings, he said. Our ruling Gonzalez’s claim overstates the households that would benefit from extending the tax cut -- by about 40 million. Also, his warned-of $1,000 tax increase is based on an average; actual results for each working family would vary widely. We rate his statement Half True. UPDATE, Feb. 16, 2012: This article has been updated to clarify that the projection cited by the Center for American Progress applied to President Obama's unsuccessful proposal to reduce the payroll tax by 3.1 percent.

Even the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas seems to be chiming in. Among the most shared is a photo that claims to show the results of refugees assaulting Mexican police officers. But the photo is actually from 2012. "Mexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to FORCE their way into Mexico - And WE are supposed to believe these are just poor, helpless refugees seeking asylum???" read several posts that have appeared on Facebook since Sunday alongside a photo of a bloodied officer, among others. "I am 100% behind POTUS deploying military to protect our border and keep them out. If any need asylum, they need to apply for it and do it the right way - LEGALLY and with CIVILITY" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And as fact-checkers have debunked it, some of the posts are disappearing from the social media platform. One widely-shared post now shows an error message, meaning the link expired or the user restricted its audience. The photo of the bloodied officer is authentic but it’s from 2012. Student protesters were involved in the violence, not migrants making their way to the U.S. border. Earlier this week, Buzzfeed reporter Jane Lytvyenko tweeted tips to help people check allegations like this for themselves. First, search for the image in Google by dropping a JPEG into the search bar. If the caption is in another language, copy and paste it into Google translate. The translated caption she found for the bloodied policeman?

pomt-00222	Says Patrick Morrisey undertook "efforts to put educators in jail."	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/11/joe-manchin/did-patrick-morrisey-make-efforts-put-educators-ja/	The West Virginia teachers’ strike in February was months ago, but rhetoric about the strike has continued to crop up on the campaign trail. On Sept. 14, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. -- who is in a tough reelection contest against West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey -- tweeted, "It’s really a shame that Pat doesn’t have the guts to answer questions about his lawsuit to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, his career as a Washington lobbyist for the opioid industry, or his efforts to put educators in jail." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We’ve already looked at the question of pre-existing conditions and his lobbying history, so we decided to look at the question about the teachers’ strike. PolitiFact previously concluded that Morrisey was on solid legal ground when he said the teacher strike was unlawful. But did he make efforts to put teachers behind bars, as Manchin charged? Let’s take a closer look. (Manchin’s office did not respond to inquiries.) The strike Teachers in West Virginia went on a nine-day strike on Feb. 23, 2018, after Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed a bill giving teachers and other state employees a 1 percent to 2 percent pay raise, an amount they deemed insufficient. The striking teachers teachers sought higher salaries and relief from rising health care costs. The strike involved 34,000 workers and touched all 55 counties; it was considered one of the nation's biggest strikes in recent years, according to Tthe New York Times. It ended when Justice signed a bill giving teachers a 5 percent raise. Morrisey’s stance From the start, Morrisey asserted that the strike was unlawful. On Feb. 21, 2018, he tweeted, "The impending work stoppage is unlawful and should come to an end." As we’ve previously reported, there was precedent for this. During a 1990 teacher strike, the West Virginia Supreme Court found that the stoppage was unlawful because "public employees provide essential public services which, if interrupted by strikes, would threaten the public welfare." A preliminary injunction was issued by Jefferson County Court in 1990, ending the strike. MetroNews reported that Morrissey was ready to take legal action against striking teachers if he was asked to do so under the law. "Let us make no mistake," Morrisey told MetroNews on Feb. 21. "The impending work stoppage is unlawful. State law and court rulings give specific parties avenues to remedy such illegal conduct, including the option to seek an injunction to end an unlawful strike." "Unlawful" doesn’t mean "criminal" However, Morrisey’s words were more precise -- and accurate -- than Manchin’s. Morrisey said the strikes would be unlawful -- but that doesn’t mean they would lead to "jail" for striking teachers. "The teachers may have been subject to an injunction to go back to work, but they could not have been prosecuted for going out on strike," said West Virginia University law professor Bob Bastress. In a news release at the time, Morrisey talked about the possibility of seeking an injunction -- but not jail. "State law and court rulings give specific parties avenues to remedy such illegal conduct, including the option to seek an injunction to end an unlawful strike," he wrote. When we reached out to Morrisey’s campaign, a spokesman said that Morrisey never suggested locking up teachers. "You can go through his statements from the time, and you won't find anything that suggests what Manchin is claiming," the campaign said in a statement. When asked about what Morrisey meant when hold MetroNews he was willing to take "legal action" against teachers, the Morrisey campaign cited an opinion letter by the then-Attorney General, Democrat Roger Tompkins, in 1990. Tompkins wrote that teachers who went on strike in 1990 could be "disqualified from teaching in a public school for one year, and the state department of education and county board of education may withhold all papers and credentials of such teacher." These are serious consequences -- but well short of jail. "Morrisey has civil legal authority, which does not include criminal authority," the campaign said. "That authority is left to the governor and the criminal justice system." Our ruling Manchin tweeted that Morrisey made "efforts to put educators in jail." Morrisey, in his capacity as attorney general, said the strike was unlawful -- but that meant that striking teachers could have been punished by disciplinary actions, not criminal charges that could land them in jail. While the disciplinary actions could have had severe consequences in some cases, Manchin’s suggestion that "jail" could have resulted is a significant exaggeration. We rate the statement False.

pomt-02172	"The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-average-minimum-wage-worker-35-y/	It’s become clear that raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 is one of President Barack Obama’s highest-priority proposals at the moment. The rhetoric coming out of his White House certainly supports that notion. On April 26, Obama included this passage in his weekly address: "Right now, there’s a bill that would boost America’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country. 28 million. And we’re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs." It’s pretty transparent that Obama is seeking to counter the notion that a wage hike would simply help teenagers taking a summer job or college students making some extra money slinging hash at the local diner. But is Obama's specific claim that, "The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old" accurate? The White House told us it used a study by the Economic Policy Institute. This is a liberal group that’s in tune with many of Obama’s policies, but for the moment, let’s put that aside. The study looked at anyone earning less than $10.10 an hour, under the logic that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 wouldn’t just raise wages for those earning $7.25 an hour, but rather for everybody earning less than $10.10. In addition, David Cooper, the author of the report, told PolitiFact that his calculations actually included everyone currently earning up to $11.10 -- a dollar more than Obama’s proposed minimum wage level. This decision was made on the assumption that anyone earning slightly above $10.10 at the time of the minimum-wage hike would also get a small boost, in order to keep them nestled correctly in a company’s wage hierarchy. EPI found that the average age of workers earning under $11.10 is 35 years old. If you don’t read Obama’s sentence closely, it would seem that he’s right. But actually, he muffed the talking point. Whereas EPI’s study looked at workers who earned as much as four dollars an hour more than the federal minimum wage, Obama’s words referred to people who are actually being paid the minimum wage today. We ran this by Cooper, the report’s author. He told PolitiFact that if you look at workers "at or near their effective state minimum wage," which he defined as within 3 percent of the minimum-wage level, the average age is 31. That's in the ballpark but lower than the 35-year-old figure Obama cited. In reality, the statistics on this specific point are murky. A different study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 71 percent of minimum-wage workers are younger than 30 -- a starkly different picture of low-wage workers. But the BLS study has an important limitation -- it looked only at workers making exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and below, so it doesn’t include workers from any of the 21 states and the District of Columbia that have enacted higher state minimum wages. A few weeks earlier, the White House used the same EPI statistic correctly. In a tweet, White House spokesman Jay Carney touted an infographic that asked, among other things, "Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? … More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old." Carney’s claim focused on workers who will benefit from a wage hike, which is in line with what the study looked at. We rated that statement Half True, in part because the infographic ignored the different conclusion of the BLS study and relied only on one report from a friendly group. This time, by contrast, Obama didn’t cite the correct number. Our ruling The White House had a point earlier this month when it tweeted that those who would benefit from a $10.10 wage hike average 35 years of age. But Obama’s subsequent comment was less accurate. In his weekly address, the actual statistic using the data from the same report is 31, and partial data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that the average age could be even lower than that. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-04-29T17:26:28	2014-04-26	['None']
pomt-08243	Says Governor-elect Scott Walker’s choice as transition team leader "killed the release of a damaging report on Walker’s record in the days leading up to the election."	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/14/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/state-democratic-party-says-scott-walkers-campaign/	It’s a rare day when the internal workings of the Greater Milwaukee Committee, a powerful and decidedly private civic organization, become the stuff of campaign attack fodder. And post-campaign attack fodder. But that’s exactly what happened in connection with a long-awaited report from the group, which has been looking into ways to rescue financially troubled Milwaukee County. In September, the group decided to wait until after the Nov. 2 election to release the report. The catch: Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker was running as a Republican for governor. And his campaign chairman, Michael Grebe, is chairman of the GMC board. Ultimately, word got out about the report -- which is actually just a set of not-yet-released recommendations, including that the county is in such dire shape state lawmakers should OK legislation allowing it to declare bankruptcy. That was courtesy of the Oct. 9, 2010 No Quarter column, written by Dan Bice, in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The report drew fireworks in the campaign. And now in the transition: When Walker named Grebe as a co-chair of his transition team on Nov. 5, 2010, the state Democratic Party fired off a biting two paragraph news release with the headline: "Walker rewards his ‘Cleaner.’" The release claimed "Grebe killed the release of a damaging report on Walker’s record in the days leading up to the election." It went on to quote party chairman Mike Tate saying Walker had driven the county to the point of bankruptcy and Grebe "did a good job keeping a report that detailed these facts from the public." That’s a lot of punch to pack into two paragraphs. But is it true? Much as in a courtroom, we believe the burden of proof lies with the person making the statement -- in this case the state Democratic Party. Their news release included a link to Bice’s column. PolitiFact Wisconsin asked if there was anything else, but the party did not respond. So we’ll start with the column, but we won’t stop there. In the piece, Grebe said it was Julia Taylor, who is president of the GMC and reports to the board, who recommended delaying the release of the report. Grebe agreed, then presented the idea to the full board -- a 32-member group composed of business, labor and civic leaders with ties to both parties -- and the board agreed. That meeting was Sept. 8, six days before Walker won the GOP nomination. Grebe repeated this account to PolitiFact Wisconsin, saying it was a group decision. Taylor supported this account. So did Sheldon Lubar, who headed the group’s task force on county government. Taylor and Grebe told us they didn’t want the report to get ground up in election partisanship and therefore become irrelevant. They said they also wanted to review what other states have done in similar circumstances. Lubar said the recommendations were not final and needed more vetting by groups in the community. So, it is clear Grebe played a role in the report’s delay. But did he singlehandedly kill it for partisan gain as the Democrats allege? Grebe was deeply involved in the election, beyond just the fancy title of Walker campaign chairman. As president and chief executive officer of the Milwaukee-based Bradley Foundation, Grebe personally gave a total of $50,000 to the Republican Governors Association in the past year -- a group behind a major anti-Barrett TV campaign. After the No Quarter column came out, Grebe didn’t hesitate to mix the two jobs -- he responded to criticism of Walker by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic nominee, and defended Walker’s record on fiscal issues. Grebe told us he did not think it was necessary to recuse himself from discussion on that item: "I'm still the chairman of the organization. I did the right thing to bring it to the board." But getting at whether Grebe personally pushed for the decision -- and whether his motive would have been protecting Walker -- is difficult given the private nature of the group. We talked to various members of the group, including some considered more sympathetic to Democrats. None provided any evidence that Grebe pushed the delay -- and none said there was dissent over the decision to delay. One preferred a mid-campaign release but was not asked for an opinion. Some would not talk on the record, with one citing fear of retribution within the group. Lubar told us more work was needed on the recommendations, but by other accounts the proposals -- initially expected by summer -- were pretty far along by the Sept. 8 meeting. One board member, union leader Candice Owley, said she sent her comments on the recommendations to the board for that meeting. And H. Carl Mueller, a public relations executive and member of the group’s board and its county task force, was starting in mid-September to line up a newspaper story on the bankruptcy recommendation. His firm does work for the board. Mueller told us he was just laying the groundwork for a post-election story on the recommendations (which still have not been formally finalized or released). Mueller said he got no marching orders from Grebe. Lubar, who gave $10,000 to Walker’s campaign and $5,000 to Barrett’s campaign, said the document leaked to Bice was a list of options, not a final set of recommendations, and that Grebe was "not a player" in determining them and had not suggested a timetable for release. "Grebe had zero to do with it," Lubar said. That’s a very different statement than the Democrats’ claim. So, where does that leave us? With no direct evidence, the state Democrats allege Walker rewarded Grebe for burying a damaging report. As Greater Milwaukee Committee chairman, Grebe had the means, motive and opportunity to delay the report -- but in trying to connect the dots, Democrats ignore the most important one: evidence he actually did it. The column they cite raises that as a possibility, but does not state it as fact. Indeed, the column -- and our reporting -- includes people who say the opposite, that it was a group decision, albeit one Grebe acknowledges supporting. If the party or others produce a smoking gun, we would revisit our determination. But we’re left with the facts in evidence and find the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02265	"The Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country."	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/09/bob-beckel/bob-beckel-koch-brothers-are-one-biggest-polluters/	When a billionaire speaks, people listen, especially when that billionaire is Charles Koch. Koch, along with his brother David, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get the low-tax, low-regulation government he wants. He’s backed the tea party-funded campaign ads to topple Democrats and deployed scores of lobbyists. Koch’s spirited defense in the Wall Street Journal of himself and Koch Industries was everything the talking heads on Fox News’ The Five could have asked for. The resident Democrat, Bob Beckel, set out to skewer the Koch brothers. The rest of the panel, like Greg Gutfeld and Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised them for their philanthropy and business success. Beckel was unimpressed. Beckel: "The Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country." Gutfeld: "They pollute us with money." (While this could be taken differently, this was praise.) Beckel: "They pollute this country." Guilfoyle: "You don’t have any evidence to substantiate that." Beckel: "Yes, I do." We tried to reach Beckel to hear about his evidence, but we got no response. What we found in its place was a report from the left-leaning Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Last year, the institute released two lists of the 100 firms with the most significant emissions in the nation. One list is for air and the other is for water. On the first, Koch Industries ranked 14th. On the second, it ranked 30th. Some of the companies ranking high on both lists include ExxonMobil, BASF, Bayer Group and Dow Chemical. Behind these rankings is data reported by companies to the Environmental Protection Agency and compiled in something called the Toxics Release Inventory. The Toxics Release Inventory provides the numbers of pounds of waste chemicals released into the environment by each facility. Every facility operates under a permit from the EPA. The EPA then takes this release information and runs it through a computer model that factors in the toxicity of the chemicals, how they get moved around and how close they are to population centers. What emerges is a score. (The technical name is the Risk Screening Environmental Indicator.) This score is a measure of risk. It doesn’t mean that a facility actually poses a threat to health, but a score that is 10 times higher than another means the "the potential for risk is 10 times higher," according to the EPA. This method has been around since 1991 and been reviewed and refined several times since then. It’s important to remember that this information is just for each particular plant. What the researchers at Amherst do is tie each plant to its corporate owner and come up with a total score for a company. "The match of facilities to the companies that own them is a substantial effort for us," said Michael Ash, chair of the economics department at UMass-Amherst and head of the project. To repeat, it’s by this measure that Koch Industries ranks 14th in the country in terms of companies sending emissions into the air and 30th in sending emissions into the water. The top air polluter, according to the analysis, is Precision Castparts. The top water polluter is Ohio Valley Electric. We wanted to know if there is anything analytically wrong with adding up the scores the way Ash's group does. We found that the business magazine Forbes has reported these results without challenging them. An environmental economist, Nicolaas Bouwes, who helped develop the Risk Screening Environmental Indicator at the EPA, told PunditFact that there is "no problem aggregating the numbers." "The point of the model was to identify problem actors," Bouwes said. "If you are at #14, there are issues to look into." Koch Industries did not dispute the findings. "Koch’s TRI (Toxic Release Inventory) number is what it is because we have a large number of U.S. manufacturing sites and we're a U.S.-based company," said spokesman Rob Tappan. Tappan is correct that Koch Industries has a large number of plants. It operates over 100 facilities that produce everything from plywood, to asphalt, to jet fuel. One of its companies makes Brawny paper towels. That water you bought at the store might come in a bottle made of plastic from a Koch Industries plant. The company runs nearly twice as many sites as the corporation with the next-largest number of plants, Honeywell, which has about 60. You would expect that releases would go up with each additional facility. On the other hand, when we dipped into the EPA’s data (using the database on the Right To Know Network), we found that on average, each Koch plant generated about five times as much as each Honeywell plant. Roughly speaking, the comparison was about 500,000 pounds of chemical releases compared to about 100,000. So the number of plants alone doesn’t explain the Koch brothers’ high numbers. Tappan underscored that the Political Economy Research Institute (the University of Massachusetts-Amherst group) has "radical" roots. Ash, he noted is a member of the Union for Radical Political Economics. That organization's website proclaims that it "presents a continuing critique of the capitalist system and all forms of exploitation and oppression while helping to construct a progressive social policy and create socialist alternatives." While that perspective is not mainstream, that by itself does not invalidate the institute’s findings. Tappan also notes that "our manufacturing emissions meet all EPA standards, and we work hard to exceed them." However, Koch Industries paid a $30 million civil fine in January 2000 for its role in more than 300 spills from oil pipelines and facilities in six states. At the time, the fine was the largest civil fine levied under any environmental law, according to the EPA. And last month, leaks at a Texas chemical plant cost the company a $350,000 fine with the promise to invest $45 million in equipment upgrades. Our ruling Beckel said that the Koch brothers are one of the country’s biggest polluters. In this fact-check, we're talking about the Kochs' company, Koch Industries. Koch Industries operates over 100 plants across the country. According to one ranking, it is not responsible for the most significant releases but it does land within the top 30 on one list and the top 15 on another. Most people would count that as "one of the biggest." Most of those releases are legal under EPA permits. The EPA does not consider this level of pollution to pose a health risk in and of itself. However, it is still pollution. We rate the claim True.	None	Bob Beckel	None	None	None	2014-04-09T13:54:42	2014-04-03	['None']
pomt-09357	"More people are driving under the influence of drugs than are driving under the influence of alcohol. A recent roadside survey showed that 16 percent of the people tested, tested positive for illicit or licit drugs. That's significantly higher than alcohol."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/05/gil-kerlikowske/drug-czar-says-more-people-drive-under-influence-d/	Much has been made of the United States' success in reducing the amount of drinking and driving over the past few decades. But is there a growing problem with drivers on drugs? During a March 31, 2010, interview on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal, Gil Kerlikowske -- the head of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and more commonly known as the drug czar -- seemed to suggest as much. "More people are driving under the influence of drugs than are driving under the influence of alcohol," Kerlikowske said. "A recent roadside survey showed that 16 percent of the people tested, tested positive for illicit or licit drugs. That's significantly higher than alcohol." This surprised us, so we decided to take a closer look. We located the study that Kerlikowske was referring to -- the National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers. It was conducted in 2007 for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- part of the federal Department of Transportation -- through a contract with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. It was the fourth major roadside survey (earlier ones were undertaken in 1973, 1986 and 1996) and was the first to look at drugs as well as alcohol. The 2007 study randomly stopped drivers at 300 U.S. locations on weekend nights (10 p.m. through midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, and 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays) and also made some daytime stops for comparisons. Participation in the survey and its testing was voluntary. The stops targeted private vehicles, including motorcycles, but they excluded commercial vehicles such as semitrailer trucks. In all, 11,000 drivers participated, with 86 percent tested by breathalyzer, 71 percent by oral fluid samples and 39 percent by blood samples. (The blood test was for nighttime drivers only.) Because the nighttime sample provides the most complete data on drug use, we'll stick to the nighttime sample for alcohol use as well. During the nighttime tests, 2.2 percent of drivers registered a blood-alcohol content of at least .08 percent -- the level at which a driver is presumed impaired under Florida law. By contrast, a whopping 16.3 percent of drivers tested positive for drugs, defined in the study as "illegal, prescription, and over-the-counter products, including stimulants, sedatives, antidepressants, marijuana, and narcotic analgesics." The most commonly detected drugs were marijuana (8.6 percent), cocaine (3.9 percent) and methamphetamine (1.3 percent). If that were the end of the story, Kerlikowske's comment would be resoundingly accurate -- 16.3 percent is indeed "significantly higher" than 2.2 percent. But there are two caveats that deserve a mention. • Legal vs. illegal levels of alcohol. The 2.2 percent of drivers registering .08 or above is, by historical standards, impressively low -- that number has steadily declined since the first survey, from 7.5 percent in 1973 to 5.4 percent in 1986 to 4.3 percent in 1996 before dropping to 2.2 percent in 2007. Still, that number underestimates the total percentage of drivers who registered some alcohol in their bloodstream. In all, the survey found that 12.4 percent of drivers had some alcohol in their bloodstream -- 7.9 percent with levels between .005 and .049 and an additional 2.3 percent with levels between .05 and .079. Low, but detectible, blood-alcohol levels do not impair a driver as much as illegal levels do, but they can have an effect. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, such symptoms as "mild euphoria, talkativeness, decreased inhibitions, decreased attention, impaired judgment and increased reaction time" can begin at .03 percent, and numerous countries have set legal thresholds lower than .08. Indeed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles says that blood-alcohol content below .08 percent "does not mean that it is safe or legal to drive." The state calls levels from .01 to .04 a "possible DUI" (driving under the influence) and .05 to .07 a "likely DUI." For drivers under 21, both categories are illegal outright. • We don't know much about how drugs affect the act of driving. Compared to the effects of alcohol, the impact of drugs on driving is not yet well understood. Some of this has to do with the long head start in research on alcohol and driving, and some has to do with the greater chemical complexity of drugs compared to alcohol. The authors of the study were open about the limitations of today's knowledge. "In addition to the prevalence of drug use by drivers," they wrote, "several other questions need to be answered in order to assess the drug-impaired driving problem, including: Which drugs impair driving ability? What drug dose levels are associated with impaired driving? Which drugs are associated with higher crash rates?" They added a strongly worded caveat. "The reader is cautioned that drug presence does not necessarily imply impairment," they wrote. "For many drug types, drug presence can be detected long after any impairment that might affect driving has passed. For example, traces of marijuana can be detected in blood samples several weeks after chronic users stop ingestion. Also, whereas the impairment effects for various concentration levels of alcohol are well understood, little evidence is available to link concentrations of other drug types to driver performance." To offer a more concrete example, it's unclear how much impact a joint of marijuana inhaled two weeks ago may have on a driver today. It could well be that the two-week-old joint is less of an impairment than a legal level of alcohol in the blood -- even though the study would count the marijuana user as part of that 16 percent "under the influence of drugs" yet exclude someone with .07 percent alcohol from the 2.2 percent of alcohol-impaired drivers. Thomas McLellan, deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, told PolitiFact that the sensitivity of the oral swabs makes it "highly unlikely" that marijuana use "even half a day earlier would have shown up" in the survey. Still, in addition to the survey authors' written caution, several independent experts we contacted agreed that the lack of data on drug-use-and-driving interactions suggests that the survey's results be taken with a degree of caution. Barbara Harsha, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, added that there's strong evidence that, regardless of the comparative data on substances in drivers' systems, "drunk driving is still the bigger problem. . . . Alcohol-related crashes were 32 percent of the total in 2008. There’s no comparable data for drug-related crashes, since there are no standards for drug impairment while driving, but the estimates are in the 10 percent to 15 percent range." If you look no further than the outcome of the survey he cites, Kerlikowske's comment are accurate. But the caveats listed above reduce our confidence that, as he puts it, "more people are driving under the influence of drugs than are driving under the influence of alcohol." There's reason to believe that not all of the 16 percent of drivers testing positive for drugs would have been "under the influence of drugs." The survey only reveals who has some level of drugs in their system, and does not provide an accurate measure of who was impaired by drugs when they were surveyed. By the same token, it's quite possible that many more than 2.2 percent of the study participants were indeed "driving under the influence of alcohol" even if they weren't over the .08 legal threshold. Did these two percentages approach each other in the middle, thus undermining Kerlikowske's statement? Maybe -- or maybe he is right after all. Ultimately, the research isn't yet detailed enough to be sure. With this degree of uncertainty, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-05289	Says Jon Runyan voted to "end programs to aid homeless veterans."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/24/shelley-adler/shelley-adler-claims-jon-runyan-voted-end-programs/	A Democrat hoping to oust U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan recently criticized the Republican congressman’s record on supporting homeless veterans. Shelley Adler is vying for Runyan’s seat representing New Jersey’s third congressional district, which includes Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. During an interview on NJTV’s "On the Record" that aired May 4 host Michael Aron asked Adler how her opponent let veterans down if he’s lauded for his representation of that military base. Adler said two issues were at play: active-duty military personnel and veterans. "With respect to veterans who are no longer active duty, they are out of service, we owe much more of a duty to the veterans of our country than we have been showing at all. And I think the disrespect by voting to end programs to aid homeless veterans particularly when that population is increasing," Adler said, before Aron jumped in to ask her whether she was referring to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.)’s budget proposal. She wasn’t. Adler’s campaign spokesman Michael Muller pointed to a budget appropriations bill passed by the Republican-controlled House on Feb. 19, 2011 to back Adler’s claim. Runyan as well as 234 of his fellow Republicans voted for that bill, which did not fund 10,000 new housing vouchers for homeless veterans. But the bill continued funding for roughly 30,000 vouchers issued in previous years. The vouchers, which help homeless veterans by subsidizing a portion of their rent, are part of a program run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Each year from 2008 to 2010, Congress approved $75 million in funding for approximately 10,000 new vouchers for the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, or HUD-VASH. Funding for existing vouchers is renewed every year. The GOP bill in 2011 had no impact on the existing vouchers, according to Donna White, a HUD spokeswoman. "Any future funding would be on the line," White said, but "existing funding would be protected." And ultimately, Congress funded new vouchers that year. A compromise bill provided $50 million, instead of $75 million, in funding for vouchers for the fiscal year. Runyan voted for that bill, which the president signed into law. Muller, Adler’s campaign spokesman, said, "this is still a case that Runyan voted to defund the program with no guarantee that a compromise would bail out his bad vote based on these facts." A Runyan spokesman pointed out that the congressman also voted for an additional $75 million for vouchers in fiscal 2012, which PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed. It’s also worth noting that during the 2011 debate Republicans argued the program had unused vouchers that should be issued before the government funded new ones. Some Democrats disagreed. FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, looked at two claims in the wake of the vote: a Democratic claim that the GOP bill would leave 10,000 homeless veterans out on the streets and a Republican claim that 11,000 vouchers were "waiting" to be used. The fact-checking group found in April 2011 that neither claim was accurate. At that time, the program had about 2,400 unclaimed vouchers, enough, FactCheck.org found, to make it through the rest of the fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2011. Our ruling In a television interview, Adler said her opponent voted to "end programs to aid homeless veterans." Runyan voted for a bill that did not include funding for 10,000 new housing vouchers for homeless veterans. The bill would have had no impact on existing vouchers. The bill wouldn’t have expanded the program, but it wouldn’t have ended it. And Runyan ultimately voted for another bill, which became law, that included funding for new vouchers. We rate Adler's statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Shelley Adler	None	None	None	2012-05-24T07:30:00	2012-05-04	['None']
pomt-07655	Says taxes paid by the poorest residents of Texas are above the national average.	/texas/statements/2011/mar/14/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-says-poorest-40-percent-texans-pay-mo/	New York Times columnist Paul Krugman sees Texas as a model for how things might be going wrong across the nation and in his latest blast, posted online Feb. 27, he pokes at the state’s reputedly low taxes. Texas taxes "are low, at least if you’re in the upper part of the income distribution," Krugman writes. He adds, parenthetically, that "taxes on the bottom 40 percent of the population are actually above the national average." It’s undisputed that the two major Texas state and local taxes--sales and property--impose a greater burden on low-income Texans. According to the Texas State Comptroller’s latest study of tax incidence, issued last month, Texas households earning $29,223 or less are expected to spend 6 percent of their income in general sales taxes and 5.3 percent of their income on school property taxes in 2013. The report says households earning more than $29,223 are likely to spend on average no more than 3.4 percent of their income on each of the two taxes. The left-leaning Austin-based Center on Public Policy Priorities wrote in 2009: "Texas relies on the sales tax for more than half of all state tax revenue – a pattern typical of regressive tax systems. Since low- and moderate-income Texans tend to spend all of their income each year to support their families, the sales tax takes a much greater percentage of their income then it does from higher-income families, who can afford to save some of their income or spend it on services that are not subject to the sales tax." Yet do the state’s poorest residents also pay higher taxes than the national average? By e-mail, Krugman told us he based his statement on an analysis released Nov. 18, 2009 by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research arm of Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice, which says it advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families. The study says the 20 percent of Texas families earning less than $18,000 a year spend 12.2 percent of their income on state and local taxes, while the next-wealthiest 20 percent of families, earning $18,000 to $31,000, spend 10.2 percent of income on the taxes, which largely consist of sales and property taxes. Nationally, the poorest 20 percent and next-poorest 20 percent of families spend an average of 10.9 percent and 10 percent of income, respectively, on state and local taxes, the study says. Conversely, the study says, the 60 percent of Texas families that earned $31,000 or more put less of their income into state and local taxes than the national average. Texas households in the top 20 percent of income, earning $89,000 or more, paid 5.8 percent of their income or less, while such households nationally paid 8.8 percent or less. Texas is among 10 states with "particularly regressive" tax systems, the study says. One result is that low-income families "pay almost six times as much of their earnings in taxes as do the wealthy" and "middle-income families in these states pay up to three-and-a-half times as high a share of their income as the wealthiest families." We reached Matt Gardner, the institute’s director. He said the study drew on data from the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. He said it was methodologically improved from earlier attempts by the institute to gauge who bears the brunt of state and local taxes. Next, we shared the methodological details that Gardner aired with Billy Hamilton, a former deputy state comptroller of Texas. Hamilton, who was involved in the state’s past studies of tax incidence, said: "It sounds like what they did is very logical." Gardner said Krugman’s comparison accurately tracks the study. We noticed that the difference between what the second-poorest 20 percent of Texas households pays and the national average looks small; the Texans paid only .2 percent more. Based on a $30,000 annual income, that’s $60 more. Though measurable, "it’s not a huge difference," Gardner said. Footnote: Krugman’s statement might not have applied to both subsets of lower-income Texans in the past. The institute’s previous studies, based on different methodologies and 1995 and 2002 tax payments, similarly showed the poorest 20 percent of Texans paying more than counterparts nationally. But the next-to-poorest 20 percent of Texans paid less of their incomes to state and local taxes than residents in the same income group nationally, Gardner said. We rate Krugman’s statement True.

pomt-02283	"We’ve dedicated more money from (Washington County’s) transportation budget to bike and ped projects under my watch than at any time in the history of Washington County."	/oregon/statements/2014/apr/04/andy-duyck/has-washington-county-spent-more-bikeped-projects-/	Washington County voters have historically supported road-funding measures, giving road planners a revenue stream that officials in Multnomah and Clackamas counties can only dream of. But in recent years, concerns have grown about how much money to spend on building and maintaining bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The Claim Andy Duyck, elected chairman of the Washington County Board of Commissioners in 2010 and now running for re-election, touted his alternative-transportation credentials at a recent Washington County Public Affairs Forum. "We’ve dedicated more money from (the county’s) transportation budget to bike and ped projects under my watch than at any time in the history of Washington County," he said. Unlike Portland, which routinely is ranked among bike-friendly cities, Washington County isn’t known as a bastion for bikes. So PolitiFact Oregon hit the road to check Duyck’s claim. The Analysis We contacted county spokesman Stephen Roberts, who pointed us to documents that seem to support the assertion. The last budget adopted before Duyck became board chairman in 2011, for instance, contained $6 million less for bicycle and pedestrian improvements than is budgeted in the current fiscal-year cycle. Of that, $3 million comes from Gain Share, a state program that compensates local governments for providing tax breaks to qualifying companies. "This represents new dedicated bike/ped funding that did not exist before," Roberts wrote in an email. An additional $2.7 million for bike/ped projects this year is coming from a special district formed years ago to resurface hundreds of miles of streets in the county’s urban, unincorporated area. If incorporated, it would would be one of the largest cities in the state. In September 2011, the Board of Commissioners approved Duyck’s suggestion to modify the program to allow funding of "safety improvements," including sidewalks. Twelve of 13 projects funded this year have been pedestrian improvements, according to county budget documents. "This also represents new funding available for bike/ped improvements," Roberts wrote. The final chunk of "new" money comes from the county’s Minor Betterments program, an allocation of the county’s road fund. The $500,000 available this year for bike/ped projects compares with $320,000 budgeted the year before Duyck became chairman, according to documents. Together, those numbers show significantly more money is spent now for bike/ped improvements than before Duyck became chairman. But can he fairly say that money is "more than at any time in the history of Washington County"? It’s difficult to say that with authority, Roberts said, because a decade or more ago, total road project costs were the only figures recorded. Bike/ped work done as part of those projects was not broken out, he said. "But the county has only gotten bigger," Roberts said. "And in all typical projects we take on now, we estimate that 25 percent is bike/ped. Based on the numbers, it seems like an accurate statement." For additional historical reference, we reviewed county spending on these projects going back to the boom years of 2004-05. That year’s combined total of the top two sources for bike/ped money was the second-highest ever. Even so, the total still fell about $5 million short of this year’s record-breaking amount. Finally, we called Commissioner Dick Schouten, an outspoken advocate of bike-friendly policies who shows up to most meetings on his bike. Of Duyck’s claim, he said, "I guess that’s true in the sense we have some new programs and access to additional dollars we didn’t have before." He quibbled only with Duyck’s use of the phrase "under my watch." "I’m not sure what that means, ‘under my watch,’" Schouten said. "He’s one vote among five." In addition, unlike in Multnomah County, the Washington County chair does not prepare the annual budget. The Ruling Washington County board Chairman Andy Duyck, now running for re-election, claims that more money has been spent for bicycle and pedestrian improvements during his first term as chairman than at any time in Washington County history. Budget documents show that spending for such projects is now more than $6 million more than it was before Duyck became chairman. Comparable figures from more than a decade ago aren’t available because statistics specific to bike/ped projects weren’t listed separately then. However, spending on bike/ped projects during the building-boom years of 2004-05 was $5 million less than current allotments. A fellow commissioner noted that Duyck didn’t approve the spending allocations alone since it takes at least three votes for a budget proposal to win. We also note that while Duyck voted for the increases, his "watch" doesn’t come with the power to write the proposals. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-09576	The "pay-as-you-go law ... was a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-credits-pay-you-go-rule-producing-1990s-surp/	In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama reiterated his praise for "pay as you go," a budget approach that is supposed to force lawmakers to offset new spending with an equal amount of revenue or budget cuts. The president told a joint session of Congress on Jan. 27, 2010, that the "pay-as-you-go law ... was a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s." We originally analyzed a similar comment he made on May 7, 2009. Back then, he said, "One important step is restoring the 'pay as you go' rule — and I've called on Congress to do exactly that. This rule says, very simply, that Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar elsewhere. This is the principle that guides responsible families managing a budget. This is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s." We wondered then, and now, whether he was correct about the role of 'pay as you go' -- or PAYGO -- in balancing the federal budget in the 1990s. We found that Obama is correct that Congress operated under a PAYGO law that was in effect from 1990 until it expired in 2002. When the Democrats took control of Congress after the 2006 elections, they established a PAYGO rule, but it has been waived for some of the most expensive bills, such as the economic stimulus bill. Fiscal hawks are urging Congress to replace that rule with a new law that would have more impact and be more binding. Obama is also right, of course, that the federal budget was balanced by 1998 and ran four years of surpluses before plunging back into deficits. The question is how much to credit PAYGO for those surpluses. To find the answer, we interviewed budget analysts and examined reports on the deficit and the impact of PAYGO. During our round of interviews, we found a general consensus that PAYGO was a factor that reduced the deficit, but most said it was not as important as the two biggest forces that led to a balanced budget: the increase in tax receipts from the booming economy and defense cuts made possible by the end of the Cold War. Still, there was a range of opinion on how much the rule helped. Alice Rivlin, budget chief under President Bill Clinton, characterized PAYGO as a significant factor. She said in a recent interview on PBS's Frontline that PAYGO and other budget rules "made it easier for the Clinton administration to work on the budget deficit." She said the PAYGO rule provided discipline so policymakers could resist tempting but expensive programs. The rule "meant that the president could say no, and the Congress could say no to a lot of good-sounding ideas, including Medicare prescription drugs" that would have made it difficult to balance the budget. That's backed up by a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that said, "Between 1991 and 1997, most new revenue and mandatory spending laws that were enacted were consistent with the PAYGO requirement to be deficit neutral; end-of-session balances on the PAYGO scorecard consistently showed zero or net reductions in the deficit." Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility and was founded in the midst of the PAYGO movement in 1992, said PAYGO provided some important discipline for members of Congress even if it was not as big a factor as the booming economy and the defense cuts. "There always needs to be a check on irresponsibility in Congress and PAYGO provides that," he said. But Brian Riedl, a budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said PAYGO's importance has been exaggerated. "There is this grand myth that we passed PAYGO and then we got this balanced budget. But we got the balanced budget because the Cold War ended and a bubble temporarily pushed revenues through the roof." He said that PAYGO didn't provide as much discipline as some claim because Congress repeatedly used gimmicks or took steps to ignore it. So back to Obama's claim. He said the "pay-as-you-go law ... was a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s." He is correct that it is a basic principle behind the effort to balance the budget, but his statement somewhat overstates the policy's importance in achieving that goal. Yes, PAYGO rules provided some discipline that might have restrained Congress from adding more spending or new tax cuts, but the economy and the defense cuts were the biggest factors that led to the balanced budget. So we find his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-27T22:25:14	2010-01-27	['None']
pomt-01569	"Wisconsin does not have a deficit. Thanks to Republican reforms, the 2014 budget will begin with a $443 million surplus."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/11/alberta-darling/despite-news-18-billion-shortfall-alberta-darling-/	On Sept. 8, 2014, a Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau report made headlines that said the state budget faces a "shortfall" estimated at nearly $1.8 billion. The same day, state Sen. Alberta Darling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, put out what seemed like a contradictory statement. "Wisconsin does not have a deficit," Darling said in a news release, which was issued with GOP Rep. John Nygren of Marinette. "Thanks to Republican reforms, the 2014 budget will begin with a $443 million surplus." Darling and Nygren are co-chairs of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, which plays a key role in formulating the budget that was signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker. So, Wisconsin taxpayers (and voters in the upcoming election for governor) would like to know: Does state government have a deficit, a surplus, or what? Budget basics Wisconsin’s budget, of course, is a two-year document. So, there isn’t a "2014 budget," as Darling said. But we are more than two months into the fiscal year that runs from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015. This is the second half of the 2013-’15 budget. These points in time are important because, by law, the two-year state budget must be balanced. It can't run an actual deficit. What drew the headlines was the fiscal bureau’s projection that the state’s "out-year commitment" -- often referred to as a shortfall or a "structural" deficit -- is $1.8 billion for the next budget period, 2015-’17. That's an estimate of how much the next biennial budget -- if there are no changes in revenue or spending -- would be out of balance. In other words, the shortfall isn't actual red ink. Now to Darling's claim. A surplus? Darling's office pointed us to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo issued five days before the $1.8 billion memo. The bureau is a nonpartisan agency that both political parties regard as the gold standard on budget matters. That earlier memo says 2014-’15, the second year of the current two-year budget, started on July 1, 2014 with a balance of $443 million. So, it’s true that at this moment in time -- the midpoint of the two-year budget -- the books are in the black. But the same memo also projects the budget picture for the second year of the cycle. That is, it shows what money is expected to come in, and how much is expected to go out. It shows the entire $443 million surplus being swallowed up and the state facing a "revenue shortfall" of nearly $116 million -- since revised to $396 million -- by the end of the fiscal year -- June 30, 2015. That's because tax collections have been lower than expected. As we mentioned, the state cannot run an actual deficit. Accordingly, the fiscal bureau said the state might need a budget repair bill by June 30, 2015 unless revenue comes in higher than currently expected and/or spending is reduced. It’s also possible, depending on how large the revenue shortfall turns out to be, that the Walker administration could reduce spending -- by not filling open positions, for example -- enough to eliminate the need for a budget-repair bill. So, as of now, the state budget has a $443 million surplus, but that is expected to become a $396 million shortfall by next June. Now to the $1.8 billion "out-year commitment" or shortfall estimate for 2015-’17, which is what prompted Darling to make her claim. The $1.8 billion There are two key things to know about the new number from the fiscal bureau: 1. The projected $1.8 billion shortfall -- -- about 5.8% of the spending expected in the 2015-'17 state budget -- is an educated guess about future tax collections and demands for services. Shortfalls occur in large part because of changes in how much money comes in through income and sales tax collections, which are dependent on the economy, among other factors. 2. Again, the projection is not for the current budget cycle, but rather for the 2015-’17 biennium. A budget for 2015-’17 is what the winner of the Nov. 4, 2014 gubernatorial election between Walker and Democrat Mary Burke will have to devise. Rather, the shortfall is an imbalance between ongoing revenues and spending. It assumes no changes in revenue and no changes in spending -- in other words, continuing the operations of state government as they are now. The state has been here before. When Walker took office in January 2011, he faced a $2.5 billion "out-year commitment" or shortfall, plus an increase of roughly $1.1 billion in funding requests from state agencies. That amounted to a $3.6 billion "deficit," which Walker addressed through funding cuts and the Act 10 collective bargaining law. Here’s the current situation in a nutshell: Budget period Dates Budget condition 2013-’15 cycle -- Year 1 July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014 Ended with $443 million surplus 2013-’15 cycle -- Year 2 July 1, 2014-June 30, 2015 Projected to end with $116 million (later revised to $396 million) shortfall 2015-’17 cycle July 1, 2015-June 30, 2017 Projected to start with $1.8 billion shortfall Our rating Darling said: "Wisconsin does not have a deficit. Thanks to Republican reforms, the 2014 budget will begin with a $443 million surplus." The second year of the current 2013-’15 budget -- what Darling refers to as the 2014 budget -- did begin with a $443 million surplus. But the year is expected to end with a $396 million shortfall, and the next biennium -- 2015-’17 -- is projected to start with a $1.8 billion shortfall. Darling’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out a lot of context. Our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-12203	Say Gretchen Carlson said, "The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented."	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/24/blog-posting/no-gretchen-carlson-didnt-say-2nd-amendment-writte/	Clickbait websites love to make up fake quotes for celebrities and controversial politicians, hoping to mislead readers into clicking into their content and seeing their ads. For instance, we recently fact-checked a post accusing former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., of saying something she didn’t say; we rated it Pants on Fire. Now, as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as questionable a post from someone Bachmann used to babysit for -- former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson. (Yes, the babysitting part is actually true.) The claim about Carlson appeared first on a site called therightists.com. It was headlined, "Gretchen Carlson: ‘The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.’ " Within days, the item was picked up and reprinted essentially verbatim on other websites. One version got 31,400 shares through July 24. The accompanying article uses as its launching-off point something that Carlson did actually do -- making an on-air break with conservative orthodoxy by saying, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub mass shooting in 2016, that the assault-weapons ban should be reinstated. "Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?" she asked on air. "Can’t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense?" These comments drew opposition from gun-rights supporters. It’s at this point that the article veers off into fabrication. The article reads, "Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that ‘the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?’ " This would be a ridiculous claim if she’d actually said it. As schoolchildren are taught, muskets were used in the American Revolution. (Here’s an example from the collection of the Museum of the American Revolution.) And the revolution occurred more than a decade before the 1789 drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. ("A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.") Indeed, the history of firearms goes back even further than that -- to the 1300s, more than four centuries before the Second Amendment was written. The first hint that this may be bogus appears elsewhere on therightists.com website. On the site’s "About Us" page, a grammatically challenged warning explains that therightists.com "is independent News platform That allow People and independent Journalist to bring the news directly to the readers. Readers come to us as a source of independent news that not effected from the big channels. This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!" Of course, this warning isn’t noted on the actual page the Carlson story appears on. We also couldn’t find any credible news source reporting Carlson’s words as cited in therightists.com article. Finally, we checked with Carlson’s office. In a statement, her office confirmed that the article was "total B.S." Bottom line: Carlson did not say, "The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented." The accusation that she did rates as Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-07-24T15:17:20	2017-06-15	['None']
pomt-10415	McCain "hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/23/barack-obama/they-were-hired/	In an attempt to wrest the moral high ground on special interest influence, Sen. Barack Obama has gone on the offensive, accusing Republican Sen. John McCain of talking tough on campaign finance reform, but then stocking his campaign with lobbyists. At a rally in Tampa on May 21, 2008, Obama said that despite 10 years ago proposing a bill that would have banned lobbyists from being paid by a campaign, McCain "hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign." The McCain campaign's ties to current or former lobbyists has been well documented in recent weeks. Disclosures about some of those ties — including clients they have served — led to a handful of departures from the campaign. The highest profile casualty was former Rep. Thomas Loeffler, campaign co-chairman and national finance committee co-chairman. Loeffler is a lobbyist and founder of the Loeffler Group, a multimillion-dollar lobbying operation that, according to Houston Chronicle reports last year, has included clients such as AT&T, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Port of Houston, Southwest Airlines and Toyota Motor Co. The firm also has represented the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on trade issues. In response, the McCain campaign on May 15, 2008, instituted a "conflict policy" — the campaign will not keep any federal lobbyists on its payroll. Period. "We are in compliance with that policy," McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers told PolitiFact. But the campaign is still thick with former lobbyists, some who left or took unpaid leave of absences from their lobbying firms just before joining the campaign. One of them is Charlie Black, a senior adviser on the McCain campaign. Described by the Washington Post as a "longtime uber lobbyist," Black retired as chairman of BKSH & Associates in March. He told the New York Times he is not paid by the campaign. Then there's campaign manager Rick Davis, who hasn't been a registered lobbyist for five years and took a leave of absence from his lobbying firm Davis Manafort two years ago. Black defended the use of former lobbyists. "I think you can change professions and unless you did something unethical or criminal, your past profession should not be injected into the candidate's campaign," Black told the New York Times. "It's absurd." Said Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign: "John McCain has an unmatched record of fighting the influence of special interests in Washington. The McCain campaign has implemented the strictest policy against lobbyists in presidential campaign history, and we challenge Sen. Obama to meet our standard." Okay, so McCain has clearly set a policy that forbids current federal lobbyists from drawing a campaign paycheck and campaign officials say they are in full compliance with that. Now. But the policy comes more than a year into the campaign. Current lobbyists hired by the campaign may have now been purged, but the fact is they were hired. We rule Obama's statement True.

pomt-10337	"Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump? O-ba-ma! O-ba-ma!"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/21/john-mccain/sure-and-blame-obama-for-bad-tomatoes-too/	A new television ad by Sen. John McCain's campaign seeks to exploit anger over gas prices by directing it toward his opponent. "Gas prices: four dollars, five dollars, no end in sight," says the narrator in the advertisement , which the McCain campaign released July 21, 2008. "Because some in Washington are still saying no to drilling in America." Oil drilling goes on all the time in America. What Sen. Barack Obama and others oppose is certain new drilling off the coasts. But let's leave that aside. Some in Washington, the ad continues, say "no to independence from foreign oil." Almost no one opposes the notion of independence from foreign oil. The dispute is over how to get there. But let's leave that aside as well. The ad culminates with this question: "Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump?" Then we hear a chant familiar to anyone who has watched a fevered Obama rally: "O-ba-ma! O-ba-ma! O-ba-ma!" So the central claim of the ad, and the one we decided to check, is that Obama is to blame for rising gas prices. In its news release announcing the ad, the McCain campaign cited everything from Obama's criticism of McCain's electric car contest to Obama's reservations about nuclear power. But in our view those things don't sufficiently back up McCain's sweeping contention that the junior senator from Illinois is to blame for rising gas prices. The main implication of the ad is that the ban on some offshore drilling — a ban that McCain has long opposed, more explicitly lately than in the past — has contributed to rising prices, and since Obama supports it, it is fair to blame him for it. The last part is highly dubious. Obama has only been in the U.S. Senate since 2005, and the congressional moratorium prohibiting oil and gas leasing on most of the outer continental shelf dates to 1982. Granted, Congress has renewed it every year since. But there was also a presidential order banning oil exploration off the coasts from 1990, when the first President Bush issued it, until July 14, 2008, when his son lifted it. So even if the ban on offshore drilling contributed to "rising prices at the pump," it would have done so regardless of how Obama felt about it, at least until the very recent past. Now, has the ban in fact contributed to rising prices at the pump? Probably so, though it's impossible to say how much. Currently, drilling is allowed in about 15 percent of federally controlled waters, and those areas are the source of more than one-quarter of the oil produced in the United States, according to Ron Planting, an economist at the American Petroleum Institute. Domestic production accounts for about a quarter of the oil the country consumes, Planting said. It is not likely that all the other offshore areas currently off limits would be as productive as the Gulf of Mexico, where most of today's offshore drilling takes place, Planting said. "The only thing we can say is directional," Planting said. "We'd have more supply (if the moratorium hadn't been in place)] and historically more supply has downward pressure on prices." But that's really a peripheral issue. Regardless of how the moratorium has affected prices over the years, Obama has not been a key force behind it until very recently. True, he vows to be just that in the future. But how lifting the moratorium would affect future prices is a separate question, (and a tricky one, as we explain here ). What the ad pins on Obama — and others who are "saying no to (new offshore) drilling in America" — are the price increases the country is currently enduring. That saddles the Illinois senator with a lot more influence than he has had. If one were to line up all the leaders in Washington who share some responsibility for the offshore drilling moratorium — the first President Bush, the Republican leadership of Congress, the Democratic leadership of Congress, the Florida delegation — there would be quite a few people ahead of Obama. We find McCain's claim to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-21T00:00:00	2008-07-21	['None']
pomt-01628	Says Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad chartered a plane to remove 124 young illegal immigrants from his state and take them back to Honduras.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/27/chain-email/did-iowa-gov-terry-branstad-charter-jet-send-124-i/	The surge in unaccompanied minors coming from Central America to the U.S. border with Mexico may have moved off the front pages in recent weeks, but it’s still a hot topic on the Internet. A reader recently sent us a chain email that lauds Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, for purportedly standing up to President Barack Obama’s decision to send more than 100 unaccompanied minors to Iowa. According to the email, Branstad quickly chartered a jet for the immigrant children and flew them all back to Honduras. Spoiler alert: This adventure story is pure fiction. Here’s the text of the email our reader received, complete with a misspelling of the governor’s name: "Subject: Obama Flies Illegal Teens to Iowa -- Iowa Governor Flies Them Home "Did you know this? "Obama just said ‘Up yours Iowa’ and Iowa shoved it back. Governor of Iowa -- Hurray for you, Governor, who announced: Iowa will not take any illegals kids (most teenagers) in IOWA. "Yesterday Obama overruled him and sent him 124 young kids 13-19, landed the plane in Des Moines. Airport manager called the office of Governor Terry Bransted, who drove to the airport and chartered from Chicago a plane from United. Within 8 hours all the kids were loaded on, got food and drink. The plane left Iowa 8 o'clock Des Moines. Next stop was Honduras. Plane got unloaded, 4 social workers from Iowa made sure they got to the terminal, told the Honduras officials, here are your kids, they have no papers, you let them come illegal to America. Iowa refuses to take them. Iowa has their own laws. No minors who are not with adults. Iowa has not heard one thing from Washington. American states are fed up. "The Governor is a Republican. Kind of makes me wonder if he would like to become a candidate for President in the next election. "Yea for the HAWKEYE State! It is what all states should do in my opinion. "Let’s hear it for Iowa!!!" We asked the governor’s office about the email. "It’s a rumor we have heard about for several weeks now, but it did not happen," said Jimmy Centers, Branstad’s communications director. Moreover, a governor like Branstad wouldn’t have the power to quickly deport dozens of children back to Honduras -- that’s a process governed by federal, not state, law. "Airport travel, as interstate commerce, is governed by federal law and Congress," said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis law school and a specialist in immigration law. "State infringement on interstate commerce has repeatedly been struck down by the Supreme Court. State laws taxing entrants into the state have been struck down for about the last century. The Iowa scenario could never happen lawfully." Under an anti-human-trafficking law signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries (such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the Central American countries fueling the current surge) are guaranteed access to the federal legal system to argue their case for remaining in the United States, rather than being deported outright, as unaccompanied minors from Mexico may be. In the wake of the surge of immigrant children, some lawmakers have called for revising or repealing the provision, but no such action has been taken yet. The Des Moines Register reported that at least 139 unaccompanied immigrant children had entered the state between Jan. 1, 2014, and July 18, 2014. They arrived in a trickle, not in a large group like the one described in the email. They came to the state because relatives who lived in Iowa were able to take them in. The children were told to live with their relatives until an immigration judge can hear their case. A judicial decision on whether they are granted asylum or face deportation can take years, given current dockets and staffing. In mid July -- before the email began circulating -- Branstad offered a mixed reaction to the possibility that some unaccompanied immigrant minors would end up in Iowa. "The first thing we need to do is secure the border. I do have empathy for these kids," Branstad said, according to CBS News. "But I also don’t want to send the signal that (you) send your kids to America illegally. That’s not the right message." Our ruling The chain email said that Branstad chartered a plane to remove 124 young illegal immigrants from his state and take them back to Honduras. Branstad’s office denies this, and there is no credible evidence to undercut the governor’s account. In addition, Branstad would have no authority to make such a move on his own.

pomt-09451	"When Social Security started, age expectancy for the average man was 58. It was 62 -- 62 for women."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/08/glenn-beck/Glenn-Beck-Social-Security-life-expectancy/	To show that Social Security today is not what President Franklin Roosevelt intended when he signed it into law in 1935, talk show host Glenn Beck claimed that its creators may have designed it so many people would not live long enough to receive the benefits. "When Social Security started, age expectancy for the average man was 58. It was 62 for women," said Beck. "Wait a minute, when did benefits come in? At 65." His point was that Social Security was not meant to benefit as many people as it does today. Indeed, Beck went on to say that if Roosevelt had passed the law now, the starting age would be around 80 years old, due to longer life expectancy. We wondered if Beck was right about life expectancy in the 1930s. Indeed, he was correct. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency that tracks birth and death data, says that a man born in 1935, on average, lived until he was 60; a woman typically lived until she was 64. So Beck's claims of 58 and 62 were just off slightly. And Beck was correct that an average person would die before Social Security took effect. What about Beck's implication that the age was chosen purposefully so that the majority of Americans would never recieve their Social Security benefits? Was FDR making this calculation? Probably not, said Edward Berkowitz, a professor on Public Policy at the George Washington University and author of several books on Social Security. "I think that the age was chosen somewhat at random, certainly not to hedge actuarial bets." Berkowitz thought that an alternative explanation for the age choice was that the Germans had a similar program that the Americans used as a model. Berkowitz also pointed out that the median age might not reflect real life expectancy because the number was skewed by a large share of infant deaths. "After you survive infancy, life expectancy goes up." Of course, we can't be sure what FDR was thinking, but for our purposes, Beck's statement is off by just a couple of years and his overall point is right that life expectancy was below the retirement age of 65. That's close enough to earn a True.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2010-03-08T10:03:42	2010-02-16	['None']
pomt-08992	"Most" of the Bush tax cuts went to people "in the top 3 percent of this country."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/14/jim-mcdermott/jim-mcdermott-says-3-percent-got-majority-benefit-/	During an interview with MSNBC host Ed Schultz, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., took aim at a series of tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush -- tax cuts that backers say energized the economy but which critics assailed as a giveaway to the rich. Schultz and McDermott were discussing Republican opposition to extending unemployment benefits without reallocating money already included in the economic stimulus package passed in 2009. McDermott, like other Democrats, decried that rationale for blocking unemployment insurance, saying that Republicans have consistently supported tax cuts that benefit richer Americans. "Those tax cuts, most of it, went to people above -- at the very top, in the top 3 percent of this country, and they simply are unwilling to be even-handed," McDermott said. "Treat the workers like you treat the rich in this country, but they don't. They give to the rich and take it away from the poor, and then cluck their fingers and say, we shouldn't give you an unemployment check because you might sit at home and wait for this little check and not go out and look for a job. You can't find a job today in most parts of this country. You've got six people looking for every job that's out there, and to put the blame on the workers is absolutely wrong." We thought it was worth checking his claim that a majority of the benefits from the Bush tax cuts flowed to the richest 3 percent of Americans. To do this, we looked at figures compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. In one chart, the center compares how big a share different economic groups got from the series of tax cuts enacted under Bush between 2001 and 2008. The center didn't look specifically at the top 3 percent, but it did look at the top 1 percent and the top 5 percent. The top 1 percent took 29.5 percent of the benefits, and the top 5 percent took 44.2 percent. So if the top 5 percent took less than 50 percent of the benefits, the top 3 percent certainly didn't reach that 50 percent threshold. A rough estimate that splits the difference would be that the top 3 percent got 37 percent to 39 percent of the benefits. "They did get a lot of the cuts, but not quite that much," said Bob Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. While McDermott's 3 percent figure is wrong, it's on the right track. While the tax cuts did benefit lower-income taxpayers as well, they benefited wealthier Americans disproportionately, based both on their share of the population and their share of income. In 2009, the top 1 percent earned 16 percent of cash income and the top 5 percent earned 29.5 percent of cash income. Indeed, if McDermott had simply refrained from citing the 3 percent figure, he would have been correct in saying that most of the Bush tax cuts went to "people ... at the very top" -- as long as you define the very top as the top 20 percent of earners. The top 20 percent took roughly two-thirds of the benefits from the tax cuts, according to the center's calculations. Still, McDermott did try to bolster a reasonable argument with an incorrect figure. So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Jim McDermott	None	None	None	2010-07-14T18:35:30	2010-07-13	['None']
pomt-07317	"There are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/15/afl-cio/State-AFL-CIO-head-unions-have-not-been-involved/	In April 2011, the Wisconsin Grocers Association issued an alert to its members warning that protests against Republican Gov. Scott Walker were about to escalate. Store owners were told activists were planning a May 1 campaign to slap stickers on several products to express anti-Walker sentiments. An April 27 Journal Sentinel story about the association’s warning was picked up by other media outlets, including some that took it another step -- saying unions were behind the sticker threat. A day later, Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO responded with a statement that said in part: "We have no knowledge beyond un-evidenced assertions made to the media by the Wisconsin Grocers Association of any such campaign, but let's be crystal clear -- there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations." The second part of that statement caught our attention. Following the collective bargaining law, haven’t unions been turning up the heat on businesses -- including M&I Bank and Kwik Trip -- where executives or political action committees supported Walker or GOP groups? Let’s stop and look at the dictionary definition of boycott: "To abstain from or act together in abstaining from using, buying or dealing with as an expression of protest or disfavor or as a means of coercion," says The Free Dictionary. Others such as Merriam-Webster.com and ethicalconsumer.org have similar definitions. We asked Neuenfeldt about his statement, in light of the anti-Walker activities that have been in the news. His answer: Those aren’t official AFL-CIO boycotts. In fact, there have been very few such boycotts. The reason, Neuenfeldt said, is simple: Such actions by the umbrella labor group are illegal under federal law. "We don’t boycott," he said. "We can’t." That seems pretty cut and dried. But is it really? Indeed, the state AFL-CIO is an umbrella group. But it includes about 1,000 affiliated local unions, which represent 250,000 members in the state. And Neuenfeldt’s statement was "there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations." That sure seems to include member unions, who under law are allowed to participate in boycotts. What’s more, the statement didn’t apply only to organizing boycotts, but "encouraging" them. So, let’s turn to the record. For instance, there is a "Boycott Scott Walker Contributors" page on Facebook, which has more than 23,000 people and businesses -- including some unions representing firefighters, police officers and teachers -- listed as "liking" the page. Neuenfeldt said those are individual actions and not coordinated by the umbrella labor group. Meanwhile, members of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, AFSCME Council 24, have been urging businesses to put signs in their windows supporting workers’ rights. A letter sent to the businesses said in part: "Failure to do so will leave us no choice but (to) do a public boycott of your business." State AFSCME leaders later dismissed that effort as the actions of a "rogue" union local. What about the actions of the state AFL-CIO itself? At a May 5 news conference outside an M&I Bank branch on Milwaukee’s west side, the group said it withdrew $105,000 from the bank and closed its account as part of what it called the "Move Your Money" campaign. The group withdrew its money to protest M&I executives’ contributions to Walker and to underscore the threat to Wisconsin jobs that could come from the upcoming sale of M&I to the Bank of Montreal. M&I is listed among dozens of businesses on the "Boycott Scott Walker Contributors" page on Facebook. Sounds like the state AFL-CIO wants you to take your business elsewhere. Isn’t that a boycott? University of Wisconsin-Madison history professor William Paul Jones, an expert on organized labor, disagrees. He said "technically, a boycott is an organized action," while the withdrawal of money from M&I by the state AFL-CIO is an individual action. Under federal law, he said, the existence of coercion is a key threshold for a protest or action to be considered a boycott. So the state AFL-CIO, for instance, can say: We’re doing this, and we hope you follow suit. They run afoul of federal law if they set up picket lines and try to prevent customers from entering and so forth. Perhaps the most famous boycott was that staged against grape growers from 1965-70, a nationwide effort that led to the creation of the United Farm Workers. That boycott was not deemed illegal and resulted in the signing of a contract with the farm workers. Federal law expressly bans "secondary" boycotts -- such as actions against a parts supplier tied to a strike against an automaker. Indeed in the end, there was no mass stickering, which was what prompted the original warning from the grocers association and the Neuenfeldt response. Grocers association CEO Brandon Scholz said he received word from one store up north where a customer was asked to leave because he was believed to have stickers with him. Scholz said media attention might have dissuaded protesters. But as we have noted, Neuenfeldt’s statement was much broader than about the stickering threat. And making it more sweeping made it more problematic. Neuenfeldt said "there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations." He notes the statewide group is barred under federal law from engaging in boycotts. But his statement also applied to the organizations within the state AFL-CIO and not only to organizing boycotts, but also encouraging them. And unions clearly have been taking actions to support the anti-Walker boycott movement. Indeed, the state AFL-CIO called a news conference to highlight to the public it was taking a step that some of its member groups were withdrawing money from M&I Bank. What’s more, the average person does not view the issue from the legal perspective, but the practical result. They see union members protesting Walker and listing a gas station chain, bratwurst maker and many other businesses on a boycott Facebook page. We rate Neuenfeldt’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08510	Says "the Texas unemployment rate has even grown more than the nation's as a whole."	/texas/statements/2010/oct/07/back-basics/back-basics-pac-says-texas-jobless-rate-has-grown-/	In its latest print advertisement, placed Oct. 5 in 41 newspapers statewide, the Back to Basics PAC angles to turn Gov. Rick Perry's favorite selling point against him: the Texas economy. Perry often touts job gains on his watch; in a recent TV spot, titled "Texas: Open for Business," he says Texas has gained more jobs than all other states combined from January 2001 to June 2010, a statement we recently rated True. Yet the latest Back to Basics ad finds fault, pointing out that Perry fails to acknowledge that lawmakers balanced the latest state budget partly by accepting billions of dollars in federal stimulus money. The ad then lists some economic changes that have occurred since the governor wrote President Barack Obama in February 2009 assuring him that the state would accept the federal dollars. Punch line: "Perry won't tell you that the Texas unemployment rate has even grown more than the nation’s as a whole." Really? On its website, Back to Basics points to statistics from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that the Texas unemployment rate between February 2009 and August 2010 rose from 6.8 percent to 8.3 percent, up 1.5 percentage points. During the same period, the U.S. unemployment rate grew from 8.2 percent to 9.6 percent, up 1.4 percentage points. The number of jobless people in Texas grew by 204,400 during that time — an increase of 26 percent. Meanwhile, the nation as a whole experienced a 17 percent increase. We checked with Cheryl Abbot, a bureau economist in Dallas, who told us that the figures used by Back to Basics were correct. She also told us that there were no statistical or logical problems with comparing the increase in the state's unemployment rate with that of the United States. "I would probably phrase (the statement) more correctly as 'the unemployment rate has increased at a faster rate in Texas,' but saying that it's grown more, there's probably nothing wrong with putting it that way," Abbot said. We asked Abbot how best to interpret the 0.1 percentage point gap between the changes in the national and state unemployment rates. She said "there is very little difference" between 1.5 and 1.4 in this context, noting that one interpretation of the numbers could be that during those 18 months, Texas' job performance was about the same as the nation's. That's part of Back to Basics' point, said Cliff Walker, the group's director. Those numbers show Perry "isn't as good as he says he is," he said. Next, we looked into whether changing the time period for comparing unemployment rates also changes the result. We tried five different starting points -- January 2009, December 2008, November 2008, January 2007 and December 2000 -- and in all those cases, the Texas unemployment rate increased by the same number of percentage points as the national rate, or less. (December 2000 was when Perry entered the governor's office, and January 2007 was the beginning of his current term.) When we asked Walker why Back to Basics started its time period of comparison with the month of Perry's letter to Obama, he told us that the group is "trying to draw attention to the fact that Perry took federal stimulus dollars — a fact that many Texans, more than a year and a half later, still do not know." Our take: Back to Basics' statement accurately recaps a specific time period — the 18 months following Perry's acceptance of federal stimulus aid for Texas in February 2009 — that shows unemployment rising faster in Texas than the nation as a whole. As our analysis shows, though, lengthening the time period often yields a different result, with unemployment in Texas rising more slowly than the nation. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07415	Says "many states" are floundering under crushing deficit spending.	/florida/statements/2011/apr/27/mike-haridopolos/mike-haridopolos-says-many-states-not-florida-are-/	After some bumps and squabbling, Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos and House Speaker Dean Cannon emerged from secret budget negotiations on April 26, 2011, to announce that they had reached the framework of a budget agreement. The framework is just that -- the amounts of general revenue funding allocated to each budget area. The Senate and House must still agree on how, exactly, to spend that money. Still, it was cause for celebration for both Haridopolos and Cannon, who issued a joint press release. "Resolving a budget shortfall of nearly $4 billion is a tall order, but I'm pleased the House and Senate worked through this difficult process," Cannon said. "Our allocations ensure that we preserve our bond ratings by maintaining adequate reserves. Most importantly, we do not take money out of the struggling Florida economy by increasing taxes or fees." Added Haridopolos: "While many states and the federal government are floundering under crushing deficit spending, we kept our promise that we would not raise taxes or fees during these difficult economic times. For months, I've heard over and over again that we would never be able to get this done. Working as a team, the House and Senate reached these budget allocations on behalf of all Floridians." What struck us in the two statements is Haridopolos' claim that governments at the state and federal level are "floundering under crushing deficit spending." We know that the federal government is spending more money than it takes in, meaning it's borrowing money to keep the government running. But we wondered whether other states were in the same fiscal predicament. Make no mistake, states are in a financial pinch. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nearly every state is proposing spending less, after adjusting for inflation, than it did in 2008 when the recession began. The center, which is considered Democratic-leaning, said at least 25 states have proposed health care cuts. At least 21 states are proposing significant cuts to K-12 public education, another 20 states are proposing cuts to higher education, and at least 15 states have proposed government work layoffs and/or benefit cuts for state workers. For the record, only 48 states are proposing budgets this year. Kentucky and Wyoming operate on two-year budget cycles. But are states running deficits? Not really, said two experts we asked -- Jon Shure of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Ron Snell with the National Conference of State Legislatures. Forty-nine of 50 states are required to pass balanced budgets every year, Shure said. States "might borrow for capital improvements and the like, but not for their operating budgets," Shure said. "Vermont is the exception. It has no balanced budget requirement but has still chosen not to borrow for operating expenses." Snell added that Illinois and California can roll forward unpaid bills for one year, but then are required to pay off those debts in the next year. But they are not allowed to carry deficits for multiple years. "States have a requirement to balance their operating budgets," said Snell, whose group says, like Shure’s, that only Vermont is not required to pass balanced budgets. Shure said that because of the financial crisis, every state has had to make cuts, most have used reserves, and more than 30 states also have created additional revenues by increasing either some fees or taxes. Florida has taken a cuts-only approach, Shure said. (Though he noted that the state did raise a host of fees in 2009, and also has raised tuition rates for Florida universities.) Of the $70 billion state budget passed last year, $2.2 billion is directed to pay debt service for capital projects, according to John Kuczwanski, communications manager at the State Board of Administration. Haridopolos spokesman David Bishop said Haridopolos was trying to note that many states chose to raise taxes, while Florida did not. "The wording was meant to infer that states are facing tough economic decision(s) and have deficits when compared to last year's (current year) budget," Bishop said. "Many states like California and Illinois have chosen to raise taxes." Here's what Haridopolos said, in praising the framework of Florida's 2011-12 budget: "While many states and the federal government are floundering under crushing deficit spending, we kept our promise that we would not raise taxes or fees during these difficult economic times." Haridopolos might have been trying to say that many states raised taxes to balance their budget, but we're sticking to his actual words.

pomt-04615	Says President Obama promised "he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent" if the stimulus passed.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/romney-repeats-claim-obama-promised-unemployment-w/	Grainy video of Mitt Romney talking to big-dollar donors in Florida has the political world in a tizzy. Romney’s remarks in the secretly recorded video that 47 percent of Americans believe they are victims entitled to government help prompted a swift response from the Barack Obama campaign and a late-night explanation from Romney himself. We’ll be checking several claims from Romney’s remarks at the May 17, 2012, fundraiser in Boca Raton, Fla. Here we’ll examine one we’ve heard before. It was tucked into Romney’s description of how he can win over voters who supported Obama four years ago but are disappointed now. "Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase that he's ‘over his head.’ … The best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below 8 percent since," Romney said. Did Obama promise to keep unemployment below 8 percent? Not exactly. Projection or promise? The source for Romney’s statement -- and others like it -- is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the economic stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn’t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart stating: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." Of course, we now know the unemployment rate did exceed 8 percent. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and has decreased very slowly. In August 2012, it was 8.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our ruling Romney told donors he could win over wavering voters by reminding them that Obama said "he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent." Obama didn’t say that. Rather, his Council of Economic Advisers predicted that the stimulus would hold it to that level. Their report included heavy disclaimers that the projections had "significant margins of error" and a high degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." The sub-8 percent prediction did not hold true, but it’s still incorrect to characterize it as a promise or guarantee. We rate Romney’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-03344	Says an investigative report concluded Ken Cuccinelli "should have been prosecuted" for disclosure violations, but Virginia's law was too weak.	/virginia/statements/2013/jul/20/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-investigation-concluded-cuccinelli-/	A special prosecutor’s report concluding that Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli did not violate state disclosure laws by neglecting to report political gifts was hotly contested on July 20 during the first debate between Virginia’s gubernatorial candidates. Democrat nominee Terry McAuliffe said that Cuccinelli, the GOP nominee, was not vindicated by the findings. "If you read the report, which I have done, it says the attorney general should have been prosecuted, but Virginia laws are insufficient," McAuliffe said. "That’s absolutely wrong," Cuccinelli injected. A minute later, Cuccinelli got his turn to respond fully. "So much of it is inaccurate, where do I begin? he said of McAuliffe’s claim. "I’ll let the fact checkers take care of it." So, let’s begin. At the center of the disclosure controversy is Jonnie Williams, chief executive of troubled dietary supplement company Star Scientific. Williams gave at least $140,000 in gifts and loans to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s family, many of which were not reported on state disclosure forms filed by McDonnell. Cuccinelli announced this spring that he had omitted $12,000 in gifts on disclosure forms he filed between 2009 and 2012, saying it was an oversight. Of the gifts, about $5,000 came from Williams, who gave the attorney general a trip to New York aboard his private jet, a catered Thanksgiving dinner and vacations at Williams’ Smith Mountain Lake home. Amid criticism from Democrats, Cuccinelli in April appointed Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring to investigate whether Cuccinelli had violated state disclosure laws. Herring, in a nine-page report released on July 18, wrote "our investigation finds no evidence" that Cuccinelli violated any laws or intentionally failed to disclose the gifts. Contrary to McAuliffe’s statement, the report does not say Cuccinelli "should have been prosecuted but Virginia laws are insufficient." The report does not mention the word "prosecute" and it offers no opinion on the strength or weakness of the state's disclosure laws. McAuliffe, after the debate, was asked to pinpoint language in the report verifying his claim. He offered nothing specific. "Well, that’s my analysis of the report," he said. Our ruling McAuliffe said the ethics report said Cuccinelli "should have been prosecuted, but Virginia laws are insufficient." There is nothing in the report that remotely supports McAuliffe’s claim. To the contrary, the report concludes Cuccinelli did not violate any laws. McAuliffe’s hyperbolic statement is not only wrong, it defies any reasonable reading of the report.

pomt-03378	Most Americans want "traditional marriage," as defined by the Defense of Marriage Act.	/ohio/statements/2013/jul/10/bill-johnson/rep-bill-johnson-says-most-americans-want-traditio/	Public reaction was fairly predictable when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, as unconstitutional. Many Republicans said marriage should between one man and one woman, and they supported the federal government’s refusal to recognize gay marriage or grant federal benefits to same-sex spouses. Most Democrats said the opposite, and they hailed the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision striking down DOMA as a gay-rights breakthrough. And then there was Bill Johnson, a congressman from Ohio, who sent an email statement that made us snap to attention. "Americans of faith are under attack," Johnson, a Republican from Marietta, said in his June 27 statement. "First, the President refused to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, despite his legal, constitutional responsibility to do so. Then, liberals on the Supreme Court refused to defend traditional marriage itself, even though that's what most Americans want. I will defend traditional marriage, because it's not a government's job to define it -- it was already defined by God." PolitiFact Ohio has no desire to debate theology and no need to address whether Obama had an obligation to defend DOMA in court. The point is widely debated, but many of his predecessors from both parties also refused to defend laws they thought were unconstitutional. But another part of Johnson’s claim caught our interest -- that the traditional definition of marriage is "what most Americans want." We asked Johnson’s communications director, Mollie Riester, how Johnson knows that. She pointed to two things: A recent poll commissioned by the Huffington Post, and the fact that "in most cases, when Americans are given a direct choice, they have chosen to defend traditional marriage. The basis for that is the total number of times a proposition has been on a ballot." Let’s examine those in reverse order. It is accurate that voters in a majority of states have acted to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying. Even counting a handful whose legislatures have carved out exceptions for domestic partnerships or civil unions, 30 states including Ohio have passed constitutional bans on gay marriage, and five more have done so through statutory laws, according to a review by the Washington Post. But the other part of Riester’s answer -- current public opinion -- makes it problematic to use voter-passed bans as a measure to gauge gay-marriage opposition. That is, we looked at the date each state passed its ban, using a state-by-state search tool maintained by Freedom to Marry, a group favoring gay-marriage rights, and found that the majority passed their bans between 2004 and 2006, with a few earlier and a few later. A CNN timeline confirms this as well. In fact, when Texas became the 19th state to adopt a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, the year was 2005. Ohio voters passed their ban in 2004, as did voters in 10 other states, That doesn’t seem very long ago. But a wide array of public opinion polls show that views have shifted dramatically since then. Support for gay marriage has climbed steadily. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in March found that 58 percent of Americans believe it should be legal for gay couples to marry, and only 36 percent believe it should be illegal. More recently, a Pew Research Center poll after the Supreme Court ruling on DOMA -- and a related one that allowed California to overturn its gay-marriage ban -- found that 45 percent of people said they approved of the decisions, while 40 percent disapproved. On the related question of whether gays and lesbians should be allowed to wed legally, Pew said in May that 52 percent said yes and 42 percent said no. That would suggest exactly the opposite of what Johnson claimed when he said the "Supreme Court refused to defend traditional marriage itself, even though that's what most Americans want." But Riester, Johnson’s spokeswoman, cited a Huffington Post poll, so we took a look. That poll said that 43 percent of Americans said the government should recognize same-sex marriage and 45 percent said the government should not. The "should not" had the lead, in other words. But rather than indicating a majority opinion, this actually was a statistical toss-up, because the poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. What about all those states -- a majority of the nation -- that supported gay-marriage bans? Consider how much has changed since then. There is consistency in the polling, but we’ll give you two specific examples. From Pew, tracking the issue since 1996: In 2004, the year Ohio voters decided that gay marriage should not be legally recognized, 64 percent of Americans agreed with that sentiment. By February 2012, the figure had dropped to 43 percent, and a larger share -- 48 percent -- favored same-sex marriage rights. Or to quote a USA Today story from July 1: "By an unprecedented 55 percent - 40 percent, Americans say marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by law as valid, with the same rights of traditional marriage. That's the highest level of support since Gallup began asking the question in 1996. Then, fewer than half that number, 27%, backed the idea." Whether state voters will change their constitutions to support this shift is to be seen. Still, attitudes are a-changin’, to borrow a Bob Dylan line from another era of social shifts. Johnson would have been correct in 2004 and 2006, when voters throughout the country passed state constitutional bans on gay marriage. But in 2013, his statement has only an element of truth. It is dated. His claim rates Mostly False.	None	Bill Johnson	None	None	None	2013-07-10T09:59:36	2013-06-27	['None']
pomt-06668	Says "Every time the Legislature 'suspended' the kicker, most recently the corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues."	/oregon/statements/2011/sep/10/matt-wand/rep-matt-wand-says-using-kicker-money-has-failed-s/	Correction appended: An earlier version of this item used the word "economy" instead of the word "revenue." The error does not change the ruling. The state’s surplus refund law, better known as the "kicker," requires a refund to taxpayers if actual revenues exceed projections by at least 2 percent. The idea is to force the state to stick to a budget, but some people argue the law makes it harder to save money for bad economic times. Last month, former state Rep. Brent Barton, a Democrat, argued we should repeal the "kicker" and build savings in order to improve the state’s bond rating. In response, current state Rep. Matt Wand, a Republican, argued that Oregon should leave the kicker alone and, instead, require state government to save 1 percent of its general fund dollars if it craves a piggy bank. "Repealing the kicker may impress some Wall Street bankers, but it'll do little to stabilize state finances and absolutely nothing to improve our economy and put people back to work," Wand wrote, adding: "Every time the Legislature ‘suspended’ the kicker, most recently the corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues." Every time? PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know how many times the kicker had been tapped, and under what circumstances. As for stabilizing revenues, we wanted to know whether kicker money was meant to do that and in how much time, especially when Oregon relies so heavily on income taxes that go up and down with the economy. The kicker has been suspended three times since the law was approved in 1979. Legislators voted to suspend the law authorizing the personal kicker for tax year 1991 and the corporate kicker for 1993. Both times, they needed to plug financial holes due to lost revenue from 1990’s Ballot Measure 5, which curbed property taxes. Measure 5 required state replacement of lost local school revenue at $362 million in 1991-93. That grew to $1.6 billion in 1993-95 budget. Then Salem left the kicker alone, for the most part, until 2007, when the economy was pretty plush. Legislators, with backing from business, voted to start a "rainy day fund" to shelter the state should the economy sour going forward. They started with a one-time suspension of the corporate kicker, totalling $319 million. But they didn’t get a chance to let that kicker money grow. In 2008, the recession hit. Lawmakers withdrew $225 million to balance the 2007-09 budget (which had grown to $338 million, including interest and leftovers from the previous budget period). Then they took $116 million to balance the 2009-11 budget, leaving a paltry $10 million in the pot. (Paul Warner, Oregon’s legislative revenue officer, said he expects the fund will grow to $46 million for the 2011-13 budget.) So Wand’s not technically right about spending it all down, but we get what he’s saying. In 2007, legislators took the corporate kicker and they used most of it in the following years even while increasing taxes and fees for other state needs. Not very fiscally conscious of Salem. Yet the "failed to stabilize the state’s revenues" continued to bug us. Wand dings lawmakers for taking some kicker money -- not all of it, mind you -- in times of emergency, as was the case with Measure 5. Furthermore, he criticizes the Legislature for taking corporate kicker money to start a rainy day fund, only to have the fund brutalized by a recession that continues to hurt. He was leaving out context. After all, the bigger reason for Oregon’s revenue instability has to do with our heavy reliance on income taxes. The kicker law just exacerbates the swings, say some economists. In a 2009 guest column in The Oregonian, University of Oregon adjunct professor and economist Tim Duy wrote that: "(W)e have a ridiculous fiscal system that accentuates the peaks and troughs of the business cycle. When the economy is growing, we return hundreds of millions of dollars to taxpayers, but then find it necessary to raise taxes or reduce spending when recession hits --exactly the opposite of good policy, but the only option available under Oregon's unique ‘kicker’ law. We need to move forward with the development of a more aggressive rainy day fund. Optimally, but perhaps politically impossible, we would also reform tax policy to reduce dependence on the income tax." We asked Wand what he meant by his statement. Did he blame the state’s instability on the kicker? Did he think we should never use the kicker? Did he really think the kicker was supposed to stabilize the budget? It turns out he was responding specifically to claims that Democrats have made, that if we suspend Oregon’s kicker, "magically the state budget will be stable and everything will be fine. And nothing could be further from the truth." He said, "I’m calling foul on the other side for pretending that they’re serious about savings, and my proof of that is look at what’s happened in the past when we have suspended the kicker. The unicorns and rainbows have not appeared." (For the record, Wand is not opposed to taking kicker money for savings -- so long as state government also puts aside money every year.) Wand is right that taking away the kicker isn’t the only way for state government to save money. Nothing has prevented the state from socking away dollars on its own. But the assertion that suspending the kicker should have stabilized revenues -- but didn’t -- is flawed. "These examples of when the kicker was spent are not good examples," said Duy, the economist. Ultimately, "you'd want to be saving money when the economy is doing well and using that savings when the economy is doing poorly. It’s very hard to accomplish the savings when you're in a recession." It’s true that the state has suspended the kicker three times, although it’s not true that the state has spent "every penny" in those instances. Using the kicker did not stabilize the state’s budget, but that’s largely due to an unreliable revenue base as well as extenuating circumstances: loss of revenue from a ballot measure and a recession. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10941	ABC News recently banned reporters from wearing American flag lapel pins on air.	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/25/blog-posting/no-abc-news-did-not-recently-ban-american-flag-pin/	A misleading claim that circulated online after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has been retrofitted for the Trump era. The claim is that ABC News recently banned reporters from wearing American flag lapel pins on air in response to the current political climate. "Yesterday the brass at ABC News issued orders forbidding reporters to wear lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia," reads an article on a website called Politifeed. "Their reasoning was that ABC should remain neutral about ‘causes.’ " This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no credible evidence to back up the headline. Old claim, updated for Trump era Here’s a sliver of accuracy contained in the article: ABC News has had a longstanding policy that forbids reporters from wearing any lapel pins, according to top executives. However, virtually everything else about the claim is wrong. The policy applies to "any lapel pins of any sort," not just American flags, former ABC News president David Westin told CNN. The policy was also in place prior to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to Westin’s description of the policy (hat tip to our friends at Snopes for flagging the 2012 interview): "We’d long had a policy at ABC News that we wouldn’t let people wear any lapel pins of any sort," Westin said. "The theory being that when you’re reporting the news, you should be reporting the news, not taking a position. I said quickly (after the 9/11 attacks), ‘We’re going to stick with our policy and stand by that.’ I believe to this day that was the right decision." According to a Snopes fact-check from October 2001, ABC News was singled out because a nationally syndicated article suggested the network’s policy made it an outlier among news networks at a time of heightened patriotism. Thus spawned the false claim about ABC News enacting a new policy banning lapel pins in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people. Now the claim has been updated to make it appear the ABC News’ "ban" (in truth, a longstanding policy) is a response to Donald Trump’s presidency. The political conditions may have changed since the claim was first born, but it is still untrue. As an aside, we’d note that the older claim that President Barack Obama sought to ban American flag pins is an extreme distortion of reality. We rate this False.

pomt-10329	Says Obama has flip-flopped on public campaign financing.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/24/let-freedom-ring/obama-said-hed-pursue-it-but-opted-out/	"If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." Barack Obama, fall 2007 "We've made the decision not to participate in the public-financing system for the general election." Barack Obama, June 19, 2008 Sen. Barack Obama's decision to opt out of the public financing system marked a milestone in modern presidential politics: the first time a major nominee has declined public financing since the system was created after Watergate. Obama's announcement on June 19, 2008, prompted swift criticism from Sen. John McCain's campaign that Obama had flip-flopped. "The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people," said McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker. "Barack Obama has failed that test today, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics." The group Let Freedom Ring made a similar charge in July 2008 with a TV ad. We explore the group's other claims in the ad in this story. Here, we'll examine the allegation about public financing. When we talk about public financing, we're talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who direct $3 to the fund on their tax returns. The upside is that candidates don't have to spend time seeking contributions, but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount set by the Federal Election Commission. This year's general election limit is $84.1-million per candidate, but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September, and the Nov. 4 election. To explore whether Obama made a full flip-flop, let's go back a year to 2007 shortly before he announced his candidacy. On Feb. 1, 2007, Obama requested an opinion of the FEC on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised. A month later, the FEC issued an advisory opinion that said it was okay as long as his campaign kept the contributions separate. The day of the FEC decision, McCain's campaign said he would commit to public financing. "Should John McCain win the Republican nomination, we will agree to accept public financing in the general election, if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same," Terry Nelson, McCain's campaign manager, told the New York Times. Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying: "If Senator Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." In the fall of 2007, Obama elaborated on his position when he answered a questionnaire sent by the Midwest Democracy Network, which asked the candidates if they would participate in public financing." "Yes," Obama said in his response. "In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election. My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election. ... The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal, and Sen. John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge. If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." The message seemed clear: Obama and McCain wanted a publicly funded general election. But then both campaigns saw tactical advantages to getting out of the public financing system. McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 6, 2008, saying he wanted to withdraw from public funding for the primaries. McCain's private fundraising had improved after his early primary victories, and his strategists were concerned that they would be hamstrung by spending limits if they stayed in the public system. But that effort stalled because of vacancies on the FEC. Chairman David M. Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb. 19, 2008, saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling. Obama repeated his commitment in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Ohio, when moderators pushed him to explain why voters shouldn't consider his position on public financing to have changed. "What I've said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody." In the meantime, Obama's campaign had benefited from an unprecedented tidal wave of private contributions, especially from donors who gave less than $200. The small contributions not only fueled the campaign in the early primaries, but the donors could be tapped again (and again) before they hit the $2,300 limit for individuals. As they considered their plans for the general election, a factor for both campaigns was the money spent by independent groups known as 527s, named after the section of the tax code that governs them. Groups on both sides were expected to spend tens of millions of dollars, but if those contributions were lopsided, a candidate who had accepted public financing could be at a disadvantage because of the spending limits. So as the money flowed in, Obama campaign strategists made a calculation: They decided they could raise so much from private contributions that they were better off avoiding the private system. "It's not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections," Obama said in a video to supporters. "But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system." He said McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee are largely bankrolled by "Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs. And we've already seen that (McCain is) not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations." Asked whether they pursued an agreement with McCain, the Obama campaign pointed us to a news account that said Bob Bauer, an attorney for Obama, met with McCain lawyers to discuss how both campaigns could operate in the public financing system. But that account was sketchy and didn't sound to us like the "aggressive pursuit" that Obama had promised. The fact is that Obama said he would pursue public financing, but decided it wasn't in the campaign's tactical interest. So we find the ad's claim to be True.

pomt-06278	"When you sanction the Iranian central bank, that will shut down (Iran's) economy."	/texas/statements/2011/nov/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-united-states-sanction-iran/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry suggested in a debate with fellow Republican presidential hopefuls that sanctioning Iran's central bank would be a "powerful way" to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. At the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN debate in Washington, D.C., Perry said, "When you sanction the Iranian central bank, that will shut down that economy." We wondered if his claim holds. Since we were already checking a similar claim he made at the Nov. 12, 2011, Commander-in-Chief Republican presidential debate, we had a head start. As described by congressional advocates and others, sanctions against the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran -- which describes itself as responsible for maintaining the value of the nation’s national currency, keeping equilibrium in its balance of payments, facilitating trade-related transactions and helping the country grow -- would bar financial institutions involved with the bank from doing business with U.S. institutions. A Perry campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said by e-mail after the Nov. 12 debate that a U.S. Treasury ban on transactions with Iran’s central bank "would have devastating consequences for the Iranian economy because any third party that did business with Iran's central bank would be cut off from the American financial system. "Among other things, this would make it extremely difficult for Iran to continue to sell crude oil, by and large the government's top source of revenue," Frazier said. "More broadly, it would present Iran's trade partners with a stark decision: Continue to do business with Iran, or continue to do business with America." Advocates say U.S.-imposed restrictions could hammer Iran’s economy such that its government stops developing the technologies needed to produce nuclear weapons, activities reported this month by a United Nations agency. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on Iran off and on since the Tehran hostage crisis when President Jimmy Carter imposed an embargo on oil imports from Iran and froze $12 billion in Iranian bank deposits, as noted in a July 2009 paper by John Tirman of MIT’s Center for International Studies. Tirman wrote that all exports, except food and medicine, were also banned, though those restrictions were lifted in 1982. In 1995, Reuters has reported, President Bill Clinton issued executive orders preventing U.S. companies from investing in Iranian oil and gas and trading with Iran. The same year, Congress required the U.S. government to impose sanctions on foreign firms investing more than $20 million a year in Iran's energy sector. A dozen years later, Reuters reported, Washington imposed sanctions on three Iranian banks and branded Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. The Treasury later added numerous other Iranian banks to its blacklist and identified about 20 petroleum and petrochemical companies as being under Iranian government control, an action that put them off-limits to U.S. businesses under the trade embargo, Reuters said. Last year, Congress approved tough unilateral sanctions aimed at squeezing Iran's energy and banking sectors, which could also hurt companies from other countries doing business with Tehran, Reuters said. The 2010 law imposed penalties on firms that supply Iran with refined petroleum products worth more than $5 million over 12 months and effectively deprived foreign banks of access to the U.S. financial system if they also were doing business with Iranian banks or the Revolutionary Guards, Reuters said. In May 2011, the United States blacklisted a 21st Iranian state bank, the Bank of Industry and Mine, for handling transactions on behalf of two previously sanctioned institutions, Bank Mellat and Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank, Reuters said. A month later, the government announced sanctions applicable to the Guard Corps, the Basij Resistance Force and Iran's Law Enforcement Forces. Those sanctions froze any of the targets' assets under U.S. jurisdiction and barred U.S. persons and institutions from dealing with them, Reuters said. Separately, the United Nations has agreed to global sanctions against Iran, including a ban on the export from Iran of arms and related materiel and the supply to Iran of conventional weapons and materiel, according to a UN summary page. Such steps have squeezed Iran, according to David Cohen, the U.S. Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who told the Senate Banking Committee in October 2011: "Iran is now facing unprecedented levels of financial and commercial isolation. The number and quality of foreign banks willing to transact with designated Iranian financial institutions has dropped precipitously over the last year. Iran’s shrinking access to financial services and trade finance has made it extremely difficult for Iran to pay for imports and receive payment for exports. Iran’s Central Bank has been unable to halt the steady erosion in the value of its currency. "And," Cohen testified, "Iran has been increasingly unable to attract foreign investment, especially in its oil fields, leading to a projected loss of $14 billion a year in oil revenues through 2016. We are making progress, but there is still much to be done to prevent Iran from evading sanctions already in place and to apply sufficient additional pressure on Iran. In this regard, we continue to focus on the" central bank, he said. After noting that U.S. financial institutions are "already generally prohibited from doing business with any bank in Iran," including the central bank, Cohen said all options to increase financial pressure remain — including more sanctions on the central bank. This month, a U.S. House committee approved and a senator proposed similar amendments requiring Obama to take steps that could lead to sanctions against the bank. U.S. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., described his amendment as sanctioning the bank "if it is found to be engaged in facilitating (weapons of mass destruction) development, terrorism, or any type of support" for the Revolutionary Guards Corps. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., proposes similar administration review before action, potentially resulting in "any foreign financial institution involved with the Central Bank of Iran also being blocked from the U.S. economy." Per Perry’s claim, experts are skeptical the United States could unilaterally succeed in sanctioning the central bank. Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said it’s unlikely that countries dependent on Iranian oil, including China and India, would bow to the sanctions. "They might well continue to do business with the" bank, Hufbauer told us. "To be blunt, they don't agree with U.S. sanctions against Iran. What could the U.S. do to interrupt these financial flows?" U.N. involvement might be needed to make the sanctions work, Hufbauer said, meaning cooperation from Russia and China, which do not yet agree with such a course of action. Besides, he said, sanctions affecting Iran’s ability to sell oil for dollars would be difficult to enforce. "If somehow the sanctions were imposed," Hufbauer said, disruptions to Iran would be severe. "It would be a devil to transact sales of oil if you didn’t have banking facilities." While Iran’s elites and its military would take care of their own economic needs, he speculated, the rest of the country would grind down, while the price of oil on the international market could burst past $150 a barrel. Michael Malloy, a University of the Pacific expert in banking law and economic sanctions, said the bank could be sanctioned but the U.S. move would not shut down Iran’s economy. "First, international economies are too complex and too varied for there to be a direct cause and effect of the kind (Perry’s) talking about. It would never be like flipping a switch," Malloy said. "Most troubling, the U.S. probably does not have sufficient connection to the Iranian economy to have that happen. It just would not happen that way." Besides, Malloy said, U.S. influence would extend only to entities using facilities over which the United States held sway: "If a Jamaican wanted to buy Iranian pistachios financed by an Iranian bank, and they were going to be delivered in a Dutch cruiser, we basically have no control over that transaction," he said. Speculating on the effect of sanctions on the flow of dollars spent to buy Iranian oil, Malloy said that presumably, those dollars would at some point flow through the U.S. banking system and if the U.S. government figured out which dollars were related to Iran’s oil sales, then that flow might be blocked. Even then, he said, that would only have an effect on a particular oil refiner somewhere in the chain of distribution. "Once it happens, I guess it causes a stir," Malloy said, "but finding that transaction in the first place, (and) properly identifying it as related to the Iranian sale, is very hard to do." Summing up, Malloy said sanctioning the bank would increase economic pressure on Iran, but it’s a "silly" stretch to say it would shut down the economy Similarly, economist Hadi Salehi Esfahani of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said it’s not realistic to suggest the United States could by itself sanction the bank. Even if somehow such sanctions were achieved, he said, and the economy were stalled, the price of oil might reach $200 a barrel. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently announced the government was designating Iran’s financial sector, including the central bank, as a "money-laundering" concern. As recapped in a Nov. 21, 2011, Christian Science Monitor news article, this designation stopped short of sanctioning the bank but was expected to hinder the bank’s operations. "Similar steps taken in the past against North Korean and Lebanese banks caused other countries and international businesses to sever ties," the Monitor reported. Writing on the Atlantic’s website Nov. 22, 2011, Yochi J. Dreazen, a national security correspondent for the National Journal, said sanctioning the bank "could spark chaos in the world oil market and push prices higher, threatening the fragile economic recoveries underway in the U.S. and many European countries. ... Other U.S. officials and Middle East experts also fear that Tehran would view the measures as an act of war and retaliate by directly or indirectly striking Israel or other U.S. allies throughout the Middle East." Our ruling It’s clear that the United States could unilaterally sanction the bank -- or try. Yet the move would have uncertain effects; other countries might not join in. It’s not proven that Iran’s economy would shut down. We rate Perry’s statement Half True. CORRECTION, 2:03 p.m., Nov. 28, 2011: A paragraph originally in this article misstated what's now permitted to be imported from Iran to the United States, an error that was brought to our attention by a reader.

pomt-00766	This year’s state budget and my spending proposal for Fiscal Year 2016 represent an infusion of more than $1 billion in additional money for K-12 education.	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/14/nathan-deal/deals-statement-education-funding-missing-critical/	Gov. Nathan Deal has promised financially strapped local school districts that better days are ahead. He started down that road last year. When running for re-election, he won legislative approval of a 2015 state budget that reduced the education austerity cut to $747 million, the lowest since 2009. In his latest State of the State address, Deal said public education remains a budget priority. "This year’s budget, coupled with my proposal for next year’s budget, represents an infusion of over one billion additional dollars for K-12 education," he told a joint session of the state House and Senate on Jan. 14. Those were sweet-sounding words to educators. But do they ring true? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check now that state lawmakers have met for their annual 40-day session and approved a 2015 revised state budget, as well as a budget of about $21.8 billion for 2016. We began our fact-check by contacting Jen Talaber, a Deal spokeswoman. Talaber said the governor put more than $1.2 billion in additional money into K-12 education in the two budget cycles. Specifically, the state Department of Education received $535,118,581 in the Fiscal 2015 budget, $139,242,817 in the 2015 amended budget and $557,647,889 in the 2016 budget, for a total of $1,232,009,287, she said. A majority of the money is going to two big-ticket items: reducing the austerity cuts and covering annual student enrollment growth, state records show. An austerity cut is the gap between what a district needs to provide a quality education to all its students, as determined by the Quality Basic Education (QBE) formula, and the amount of money the General Assembly and governor approve. The first austerity cut was implemented in 2003, pre-Great Recession. In the years that have followed, the state’s 180 local districts have collectively been shortchanged about $8 billion, based on the formula. As a result, many districts have raised class sizes, abandoned the traditional 180-day school calendar, dropped electives and furloughed staff in recent years. Deal last year reduced the annual austerity cut -- which had hovered around $1 billion -- to $747 million by sending the districts collectively an additional $314 million. For the upcoming fiscal year, he proposed and lawmakers approved giving them an additional $280 million to reduce the austerity cut to about $460 million. Those back-to-back austerity reductions absorbed about $594 million -- or nearly half of the $1.2 billion. Student enrollment growth took another big share. For example, the 2015 amended state budget included $128.5 million to send to school districts for new students who enrolled last August. "That doesn’t enable us to provide new services," said Claire Suggs an education policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said of the enrollment payments. "We’re just keeping up." In the recent General Assembly session, lawmakers agreed that 22,000 part-time school employees and their dependents should be able to remain on the State Health Benefit Plan, the state's health insurance program for teachers, retirees and state workers. Deal had proposed booting part-time school bus drivers and cafeteria workers off the coverage. But both chambers said local school districts need to come up with $103 million more in the upcoming year to pay for coverage for the so-called non-certified school employees. Our Ruling: The governor said in his State of the State address that the 2015 and 2016 state budgets represent an infusion of $1 billion in additional money for K-12 education. To districts that, in 2014, collectively were living with $1 billion in austerity cuts and next year will see those reduced to about $460 billion, that probably does seem rejuvenating. Deal’s statement is accurate, but also misleading. A billion-plus additional dollars will be in the budget, but most of the money is going to cover routine growth in student enrollment and to reduce austerity cuts. We rate the governor’s statement Half True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2015-04-14T00:00:00	2015-01-14	['None']
pomt-06212	"99% of NJ voters do NOT support hunting."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/08/bear-education-and-resource-group/black-bear-advocacy-group-claims-99-percent-new-je/	One of the animal rights groups that took the state to court in a failed bid to stop this year’s bear hunt claims it has a powerful force on its side: New Jersey voters. A six-day season that ends Saturday opens the woods of northwestern New Jersey to black bear hunters. On its website, the Bear Education and Resource Group accuses the state Division of Fish and Wildlife of "promoting recreational trophy hunting against public opinion." When PolitiFact New Jersey viewed the website on Dec. 6, it read "99% of NJ voters do NOT support hunting. And over 70% of comments submitted to F&W’s public hearing on their Black Bear Management Policy were AGAINST bear hunting. But they were ignored in favor of the 1% of residents who enjoy killing for fun." Can that many New Jerseyans -- 99 percent of residents in the Garden State -- agree on anything? If bear hunting is an example, probably not. Before last year’s bear hunt, Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind Poll conducted a survey of New Jersey voters that asked two questions. The first asked whether residents agreed or disagreed with allowing bear hunting in New Jersey "if wildlife scientists conclude that bears are exceeding their recommended habitat limits and are destroying private property?" Fifty-three percent of respondents agreed, 36 percent disagreed and 11 percent said they were unsure. The other question asked voters if they approved or disapproved of "allowing a bear hunting season in New Jersey." For that question, 49 percent of respondents said they approved, 33 percent disapproved and 18 percent said they were unsure. The results from either question had a margin of error of five percentage points. "In general, people think [hunting]’s more benign than not. But you certainly find currents of sympathy running in different directions," said Peter Woolley, the director of Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind Poll, noting differences in opinion between men and women, as well as urban and nonurban areas. The Humane Society of the United States, which opposes bear hunts, commissioned a poll before last year’s bear hunt that was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, Inc. One of the poll questions asked New Jersey voters: "The state of New Jersey has protected black bears since 1970 with only two trophy hunts permitted in the past forty years. The state is now considering allowing hunters to kill up to 400 black bears. Do you support or oppose the hunting of black bears in New Jersey?" That poll found 45 percent of respondents opposed the hunting of black bears, 35 percent supported it and 20 percent were unsure. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percent. Although the polls results differ, both show that opposition to bear hunting in New Jersey does not begin to approach the black bear advocacy group’s claim of 99 percent. Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said, "99 percent is absurd." Dale Jones, vice president of merchandise for the Bear Education and Resource Group, said "the statement is wrong," noting that it meant to say "99 percent of New Jersey voters don’t hunt." State data generally supports that claim, but the group’s website says 99 percent of New Jersey voters do not support hunting -- not that they don’t hunt. That’s a significant difference. Our ruling A black bear advocacy group claimed on its website that 99 percent of New Jersey voters oppose hunting. That number is way off. The organization acknowledges it’s wrong, but late in the afternoon on Dec. 7, more than a day after PolitiFact New Jersey initially contacted the group, the statement was still on the website -- even after Jones said a webmaster would be notified to change it.* The statement drops to the ridiculous level for that reason, earning a Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. *Editor's Note: When PolitiFact New Jersey viewed the website on Dec. 8, the group had changed the statement. Our ruling still stands.

pomt-12508	"Trump wants to deport American Indians to India."	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/26/blog-posting/trump-wants-send-native-americans-india-fake-news-/	A fake news story contended that President Donald Trump conflated Native Americans with people actually from India, and wanted to deport them to the South Asian subcontinent. "Trump wants to deport American Indians to India," read the headline on an April 25, 2017, post on ILoveNativeAmericans.us. The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from users’ feeds. ILoveNativeAmericans.us ostensibly is a site filled with stories about or of interest to Native Americans. But there’s evidence it’s a fake news outlet however, not the least of which is that the site insisted to a commenter questioning the story that "this is real, it was on TV." We received no response when we tried to contact the administrator via the Gmail address the site provided. The site is registered to someone in Kosovo. The story falsely quoted Trump in a bogus Fox News interview as saying, "I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians." Also included are two images of tweets, allegedly from Feb. 13. The tweets are actually fakes. As all devoted PolitiFacters know, it’s quite easy to fake a tweet from any account, and Trump is a popular target. There’s no record of Trump actually tweeting such things about Native Americans. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Moreover, the story itself came from a parody site called The-Postillon.com, which first posted the article on Feb. 13. The-Postillon.com calls itself "honest news" on its banner, but its FAQ section notes that "everything you can read here is satire and therefore all made-up." Unlike many parody sites, the FAQ also lists several staffers, and gives readers explicit permission to repost edited articles with attribution. The site is registered in Roubaix, France. The story has made it onto other suspect aggregators similar to I LoveNativeAmericans.us. One version appeared on WeLoveNative.com on Feb. 28, while it showed up (and was then removed) on NativeAmericans.news on March 4. Both websites also are registered to addresses in Kosovo. There has been some concern that Trump’s immigration efforts may affect Indians in the United States — some 300,000 illegal immigrants are Indians, according to the Times of India. Possible changes in the H-1B temporary visa program also are likely to affect Indians here. But Trump didn’t make these statements, and there’s no executive order deporting Native Americans to another country. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-13352	"Not one penny of (California’s Prop 67) bag ban tax goes to the environment."	/california/statements/2016/oct/03/no-67/whats-bag-fee-environment-opponents-not-one-penny/	A ‘Yes’ vote on California’s Proposition 67 would ban thin plastic carryout bags at grocery and convenience stores statewide. The ban is supported by environmental groups that argue the bags choke wildlife and cause problems for recycling centers when they wrap around machinery. Along with imposing the ban, Prop 67 would also mandate that stores charge customers a minimum 10 cent fee on the other carry-out options they supply, such as paper or heavy duty plastic bags. The No on 67 campaign has seized on this 10 cent charge, calling it a tax and claiming it does nothing to fund environmental protections. "Don’t be fooled: Not one penny of the bag ban tax goes to the environment," the No on 67 campaign claimed in its official ballot argument against the proposition. No on 67 is led by a plastics industry trade association. The same group introduced a competing ballot measure, Proposition 65, which would redirect the bag fee money to an environmental fund administered by the state Wildlife Conservation Board. We wondered if the No on 67 claim is accurate. Does any money from the charge go to environmental causes? California's Prop 67 would ban thin plastic grocery carryout bags statewide and impose a 10 cent fee on other store options such as paper or heavy duty plastic. Photo by Jae C. Hong / Associated Press Our research Prop 67 is a referendum on a law Gov. Jerry Brown signed two years ago banning plastic carryout bags statewide. The plastics industry challenged it, placing the law on hold. The measure is also known as the "California Plastic Bag Ban Veto Referendum." It would apply to grocery and convenience stores, large pharmacies and liquor stores. Notably, the No on 67 campaign uses the word "tax" rather than charge or fee in its claim. The term doesn’t fit, as the revenue goes to stores, not a government agency. A spokeswoman for the No on 67 campaign said its claim is backed up by the text of the ballot measure, which says the 10 cent charge (it doesn’t use the term ‘tax’) would be "retained by the store and … used only for specified purposes." The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office examined Prop 67 and found "stores would retain the revenue from the sale of the bags." It went on to say: "They could use the proceeds to cover the costs of providing carryout bags, complying with the measure, and educational efforts to encourage the use of reusable bags." Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for the Yes on 67 campaign, acknowledged there’s no requirement for stores to fund beach cleanups, land preservation or similar environmental efforts. That doesn’t mean there’s no environmental upside to the 10 cent charge, he said. "The environmental benefit of charging for the actual average cost of bags (versus) giving those bags for free, is that consumers use substantially fewer bags," Maviglio said in an email. "Fewer bags, even fewer recycled paper bags, means a smaller environmental footprint." He pointed to a 2012 report by the city of San Jose to back up that statement. San Jose is among the more than 100 cities or counties in California that already ban plastic grocery bags. The city’s plastic bag ordinance includes a 10 cent charge on paper bags retained by stores. Comparing periods before and after the ban, the report found an 89 percent reduction in bag litter in San Jose’s storm drain system; and about a 60 percent reduction in the city’s creeks, rivers, streets and neighborhoods. In Santa Cruz County, Laura Kasa of Save our Shores told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in 2013 her group has witnessed a reduction of bags collected during cleanups "because of the four bans which took effect (in the county) in 2012." Our ruling The No on 67 campaign claims "Not one penny of the bag ban tax goes to the environment." A large portion of this is correct: Nothing requires the bag fee revenue be spent directly on environmental causes, as found by the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. But the claim ignores the indirect benefit the fee could have on the environment. Supporters make a fair point that the fee will persuade customers to use reusable bags, thus cutting down on river- and creek-choking plastic bags. Finally, the No on 67 statement describes the fee as a "tax," a wrong and misleading description. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: After this fact check was published, a spokeswoman for the city of San Jose told us that the city's estimate of 89 percent litter reduction was later determined to be miscalculated. The corrected estimate is 62 percent. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bdcb9c8a-1a47-4ed7-8204-61e175e619ec	None	No on 67	None	None	None	2016-10-03T06:00:00	2016-08-15	['California']
pomt-08493	Says James Langevin voted to spend "$3 billion for a jet engine no one wants."	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/10/mark-zaccaria/zaccaria-says-langevin-voted-spend-3-billion-jet-e/	In a news release arguing that Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin is wasting taxpayer money, his Republican challenger, Mark Zaccaria, cites the case of a "blatantly bogus project" involving a jet engine proposed for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. "While countless Rhode Islanders are struggling to put food on their tables and find employment, Representative Jim Langevin has voted for billions in wasteful spending. One particularly appalling boondoggle is $3 billion for a jet engine no one wants. Even Secretary of Defense [Robert] Gates and President Obama oppose this expenditure," Zaccaria said in the news release, which carried the headline "Zaccaria Criticizes Langevin on Billions in Pork-Barrel Spending." The engine that Langevin voted for is called the F136. General Electric and Rolls-Royce want to jointly build it for the Pentagon's new multi-purpose jet fighter, which is still being flight-tested by Lockheed. The stealth aircraft is designed to be used by the Air Force, Navy and Marines because it can hover, land on aircraft carriers and take off from conventional airfields. The problem is, the F-35 already has an engine, called the F135. It's manufactured by Pratt & Whitney, which assembles the engines in Middletown, Conn. Ten engines have already been produced. General Electric and Rolls-Royce want the government to buy their engine -- which is still in the developmental stage -- as a backup. Gates, who has been trying to trim defense spending, has said the F136 is not necessary and a waste of money. Supporters of the F136 argue that having a second manufacturer forces defense contractors to compete. In addition, Langevin "felt strongly that having 95 percent of our fleet rely on one engine was too costly and too risky," said the congressman's spokeswoman, Joy Fox, referring to Langevin's support for a second engine. Zaccaria, a former military aviator, said it's ridiculous to have two different engines for the same jet fighter, with two different specifications, two sets of parts and two repair manuals. We're not going to assess the wisdom of having an alternative manufacturer for the F-35's engine. That's too subjective. We decided to focus instead on Zaccaria's assertion that Langevin voted to spend $3 billion for the engine when "no one" wants it. The issue came to a key vote in the House in May as part of a $568-billion defense bill. It called for appropriating $485 million for the controversial engine to continue development. So Zaccaria's $3-billion figure is six times too high. (The Pentagon has estimated it would cost $2.9 billion to finish developing the engine, a figure GE and Rolls-Royce dispute. The highest figure we could find regarding how much Congress has already earmarked for the program is $1.2 billion.) Langevin, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, backed the F136 in the May vote, opposing an amendment that would have cut the engine from the defense bill. But Langevin wasn't alone; 230 other congressmen joined him, including 116 Republicans and 114 Democrats. One other point. Pork barrel spending, by definition, refers to projects designed to bring money or jobs into a politician's home turf. As far as we could tell, nothing about manufacturing the F136 engine would directly benefit Rhode Island, a point on which Zaccaria and Langevin agree. We asked Zaccaria why he used that term. "This is pork barrel in that it has no real redeeming value to the budget of the United States of America," he said. "It's probably pork barrel for somebody." It's true that many oppose the F136 engine, including Gates and President Obama. And it's true that Langevin voted to support it. But Zaccaria went further, inflating the price tag associated with the vote and asserting that "no one" wants it, when a majority of House members were in favor of keeping it. His statement is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Mark S.

pomt-09524	The Bush administration prosecuted 190 suspected terrorists in federal courts.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/12/barack-obama/obama-claims-bush-administration-got-190-terrorism/	As the debate rages over whether Guantanamo detainees ought to be tried in federal court, a lot of numbers are flying around that may appear confusing or conflicting. Often, the numbers are attached to one of two positions: You've got the Obama administration arguing that many of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ought to be tried in federal courts on American soil; while Republicans generally argue that the detainees ought to be treated as enemy combatants and tried in military courts in Guantanamo. The debate has put one statistic front and center: Just how many terrorists have been tried and successfully convicted in federal courts in recent years? It's a more difficult number to track than you might think. Consider these citations: • "We know that we can prosecute terrorists in our federal courts safely and securely because we have been doing so for years. There are more than 300 convicted international and domestic terrorists currently in Bureau of Prisons custody including those responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the attacks on embassies in Africa." -- Attorney General Eric Holder before a Senate Judiciary Committee on Nov. 18, 2009. • "Since the Sept. 11 attacks, and as of Aug. 31, 2006, 288 defendants have been convicted or have pleaded guilty in terrorism or terrorism-related cases arising from investigations conducted primarily after Sept. 11, 2001." -- a September 2006 Justice Department "Terror Fact Sheet." • "Since 9/11, more than two dozen terrorists and supporters have been convicted in the United States of terrorism-related crimes." -- "Fact Sheet" issued by President George W. Bush on Sept. 10, 2008. And then this from President Barack Obama in a Feb. 7, 2010, pre-Super Bowl interview with Katie Couric, who asked if he had ruled out trying confessed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Muhammad in New York City. "I have not ruled it out, but I think it's important for us to take into account the practical, logistical issues involved," Obama said. "I mean, if you've got a city that is saying no, and a police department that's saying no, and a mayor that's saying no, that makes it difficult. But I think that the most important thing for the public to understand is we're not handling any of these cases any different than the Bush administration handled them all through 9/11. "They prosecuted the 190 folks in these Article III (federal) courts," Obama said. "Got convictions. And those folks are in maximum security prisons right now." So 300, "two dozen," 190. How many Islamic-extremist terrorists have been convicted in federal courts? "Everyone is cherry-picking their numbers," said Karen Greenberg, executive director of New York University's Center on Law and Security, which has compiled a comprehensive study of terrorism-related cases. It depends, for example, if you are talking about domestic and international terrorists; whether terrorism-related cases should include only charges of terrorism or also terrorism-related crimes that might include financing a terrorist organization or immigration fraud; or whether you're talking only about Islamic jihadist terrorists. In other words, there are a lot of ways to slice the numbers. For the purposes of this fact-check, we are specifically looking at Obama's statement. And while there are several organizations that track terrorism cases, administration officials said Obama got his 190 figure from a report by Human Rights First, a nonpartisan international human rights organization based in New York and Washington, D.C. The report, issued in July 2009, analyzes "criminal cases arising from terrorism that is associated — organizationally, financially, or ideologically — with self-described 'jihadist' or Islamic-extremist groups like al-Qaida" and concludes that 195 people who fit that description have been convicted in federal courts since 9/11. The report concludes that "federal courts, while not perfect, are a fit and flexible resource that should be used along with other government resources — including military force, intelligence gathering, diplomatic efforts and cultural and economic initiatives — as an important part of a multipronged counter-terrorism strategy." That figure of 195 jihadist terrorism convictions has been vociferously challenged as overinflated — particularly when compared to Guantanamo detainees — by Dana M. Perino, a former press secretary to President George W. Bush, and Bill Burck, a former federal prosecutor and deputy counsel to President Bush. It has also been picked apart in a series of stories from Andrew McCarthy of National Review. The Human Rights First report explains that it includes "prosecutions that seek criminal sanctions for acts of terrorism, attempts or conspiracies to commit terrorism, or providing aid and support to those engaged in terrorism. We have also sought to identify and include prosecutions intended to disrupt and deter terrorism through other means, for example, through charges under 'alternative' statutes such as false statements, financial fraud and immigration fraud." Those kinds of parameters, McCarthy notes, take in a lot of cases that aren't international terrorists, but often are would-be terrorists who have, for example, been convicted of relatively minor offenses such as immigration fraud or giving false information to federal authorities, or who have helped to finance a terrorist organization. Those may be important prosecutions in combating terrorism, but they aren't on the order of Guantanamo detainees. Human Rights First isn't the only group tracking terrorism cases. New York University's Center on Law and Security has been tracking such cases for years and throws a wide net. In its "Terrorist Trial Report Card: September 11, 2001-September 11, 2009," it finds that the Department of Justice has indicted 828 defendants on terrorism-related charges. Of the 593 that have been resolved, 523 were convicted on some charge either at trial or by plea. Terrorism-related can be a broad definition, though, and can include immigration violations, giving false statements and other relatively minor charges. And so the report breaks out cases in which defendants are charged under core terrorism or national security statutes. Those are bona fide, serious charges. Now you're talking about 174 people convicted under those statutes; plus another 24 charged with those statutes, but convicted on lesser crimes. That also gets to the president's figure. But it's misleading for Obama to cite that 190 number as if the cases are equivalent to those faced by Guantanamo detainees, said Greenberg, editor of the report. There are probably less than a dozen cases against people in the Islamic jihadist framework who have been convicted in federal court of serious terrorism-related crimes comparable to many of the Guantanamo detainees, Greenberg said. Nonetheless, there are some, she said, including Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber"; Bryant Neal Vinas, an American convicted of supporting al-Qaida plots in Afghanistan and the United States; Mohammed Jabarah, a Canadian who was active in al-Qaida and convicted of terrorism-related offenses; Shahawar Matin Siraj, a Pakistani-American who plotted to bomb Herald Square in New York; and Mohammed Junaid Babar, a Pakistani-American convicted of terrorist-related offenses in New York, and who testified in 2006 against a group of men accused of plotting bomb attacks in London. These cases, although far fewer than those cited by Obama, provide powerful evidence that federal courts can appropriately handle many cases involving Guantanamo detainees, Greenberg said. "The trend lines demonstrate convincingly that federal courts are capable of trying alleged terrorists and securing high rates of conviction," Greenberg wrote in the report. "Federal prosecution has demonstrably become a powerful tool in many hundreds of cases, not only for incapacitating terrorists but also for intelligence gathering. Much of the government’s knowledge of terrorist groups has come from testimony and evidence produced in grand jury investigations, including information provided by cooperators, and in the resulting trials." In summary, Obama cited a legitimate figure for terrorism-related convictions in federal court. And we note that Bush administration officials cited even bigger numbers in some of their reports at the time. But when Obama cites this number in the same breath as Guantanamo detainees, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. We agree with Greenberg that only a fraction of those 190 cases cited by Obama could rightly be equated to the Guantanamo detainees. And while even that much smaller number might provide a powerful argument for Obama, that's not the number he used. And so we rate his statement Barely True. Update, Feb. 18, 2010: This story was updated, removing an inaccurately paraphrased quote attributed to Karen Greenberg. The Center on Law and Security report is comprised of mostly Islamic terrorism cases, but includes other groups as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a group of Marxist guerrillas. The Human Rights First report focuses specifically on radical Islamic or Jihadist terrorist organizations. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-02-12T19:36:50	2010-02-07	['George_W._Bush']
pomt-03960	"Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol."	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/16/edith-ajello/rhode-island-state-rep-edith-ajello-says-studies-i/	State Rep. Edith H. Ajello, D-Providence, recently said legalizing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island would make it tougher for young people to get the drug, in part by cutting off the underground market that sells to minors and flourishes while marijuana is outlawed. In a Feb. 6, 2013, Providence Journal story about her bill to legalize marijuana, Ajello said that after years of making marijuana illegal, "Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol." Ajello’s proposal calls for allowing people 21 or older to carry an ounce or less of marijuana and would require regulations for selling, growing and taxation of the drug. We wondered if it’s really true, as Ajello says, that it’s easier for young people to get marijuana than alcohol. After we contacted Ajello, we heard from Mason Tvert, an advocate for regulating the use of marijuana rather than prohibiting it. He referred us to various studies. But we had already found the annual National Survey of American Attitudes on Substance Abuse, which reports that in each of the past three years, young people reported that it was in fact easier to get alcohol than to get marijuana -- the opposite of what Ajello said. The most recent edition of that survey, which is conducted by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, and released in August 2012, said "teens have readier access to alcohol than prescription drugs or marijuana within an hour and within a day." Tvert mentioned the same study, noting that from 2002 through 2009 it found that teens thought it was easier to buy marijuana than beer. But, in 2010, the survey changed the wording of the question, asking teenagers whether it was easier to get marijuana than alcohol -- the wording Ajello used. From 2010 through 2012, the survey states, 26 to 27 percent of teenagers said they could get beer within an hour while 13 to 15 percent of teens said they could get marijuana within an hour. During the same three-year period, the range for teens who said they could get beer within a day was 46 to 50 percent, while for marijuana within a day it was 29 to 31 percent. (More teens also said they could illegally get prescription drugs within an hour or a day than marijuana). Why did the wording change? "Research suggested that teens frequently get substances including tobacco, alcohol and drugs from friends and families," rather than buying them, said Emily Feinstein, program director, Policy to Practice, at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. Indeed, another study, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, states that 7.7 percent of people ages 12 to 20 in 2011 said that they purchased the alcohol themselves the last time they drank. A little more than 30 percent of that age group said they paid for the the last alcohol they drank. (The study didn’t ask teens about the ease of purchasing marijuana.) And the Monitoring the Future study, which is conducted at the University of Michigan and has surveyed about 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th graders in the United States yearly since the 1970s, has found that alcohol access is consistently reported by students in all three grades to be the number-one substance that is "fairly easy" or "very easy" to get. Monitoring the Future’s 2012 survey found: * Nearly 58 percent of 8th graders said it was fairly easy or very easy to get alcohol compared with 37 percent saying the same of marijuana * More than 78 percent of 10th graders said alcohol was fairly easy or very easy to get while just shy of 69 percent said the same of marijuana. * Almost 91 percent of 12th graders said alcohol was fairly easy or very easy to get compared with nearly 82 percent saying the same for marijuana. Monitoring the Future found that students in the three grade levels said every year that alcohol was more easily available than marijuana. According to the Monitoring the Future survey figures, availability of alcohol has decreased since the 1990s -- but so has marijuana availability. Other studies suggested by Tvert did not address directly teens’ ease of access to marijuana or alcohol. Those studies did say that in the past few years there has been an increase in marijuana use among teenagers, after a period in which use had declined. Our ruling Rep. Edith H. Ajello said, "Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol." The verb choice and timing of Ajello’s comment proved crucial here. If she’d referred to how easily young people could purchase one or the other, and she’d said it in 2009, there would be more support. But all the most recent, credible, national studies we found showed that teenagers report it’s easier to get alcohol than marijuana. We rate the claim as False.

pomt-09308	New financial regulation "actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/20/mitch-mcconnell/bank-bailouts-not-bill-liquidation/	Sen. Mitch McConnell said that new financial regulations under consideration in the Senate could lead to only one thing: bailouts. "In fact, if you look at it carefully, it will lead to endless taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street banks," McConnell said at a press conference on April 14, adding that it "actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks" and that it sets up "in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions." Those comments must have sounded like fighting words to President Barack Obama. He directly rebutted McConnell, the leader of the Senate Republicans, in his weekly address. McConnell has "made the cynical and deceptive assertion that reform would somehow enable future bailouts – when he knows that it would do just the opposite," Obama said. The debate is critical because voters hate bailouts. In fact, Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised opponents of regulation that "the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout." We wanted to check McConnell's claim that the new financial regulation "actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks" and that it would be at taxpayer expense. The financial regulations under consideration in the Senate do a number of things: The government receives additional authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds. A new consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve will regulate financial products. And the bill creates a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse. It's that last item that seems to be attracting McConnell's ire. He said the bill was "taking that experience in the fall of 2008 and institutionalizing it, setting up in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions." The official name of that part of the bill is "Orderly Resolution Authority." It sets up a panel of three bankruptcy judges who convene and agree within 24 hours about whether a large financial company is insolvent. If a "systematically significant" firm is teetering on collapse, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm, using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms. The FDIC "shall impose assessments on a graduated basis, with financial companies having greater assets being assessed at a higher rate," according to the legislation. We should clarify that there will be no change for small, mid-sized and even fairly large banks. When they're in trouble, there's already a well-established mechanism, under FDIC authority, that is not considered a bailout. Instead, the "bailouts" at issue are those for the small number of very large, highly interconnected institutions -- those sometimes called "too big to fail" because their collapse would severely impact the rest of the economy. The legislative language says that the money must be used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says: "In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary." We spoke with several experts specifically about the fund in a previous report, where we fact-checked Republican Sen. Richard Shelby's statement that the fund is "available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit." The consensus of the experts was that the legislation put forward numerous rules on how the fund is to be used, with the express purpose of liquidating -- that is, shutting down -- failing firms. We rated Shelby's statement False. McConnell said that the bill "actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks." One of the sticking points here, of course, is the word bailout. We should acknowledge that free-market purists might see any intervention of the government into the financial sector as a "bailout." However, we think the more common understanding of the word means that the federal government gives or lends a company money to help it stay in business. Merriam-Webster, for example, defines a bailout as "a rescue from financial distress." We don't see how the liquidation of a company could constitute a "rescue." In fact, the bill pays for the so-called "orderly liquidation" by assessing a fine on the firms themselves, not general revenues, a situation somewhat similar to the way the FDIC has handled failing banks for many years now, using fees it collects from other banks to pay for orderly shutdowns. On the question of bailouts, we spoke to a variety of financial-services experts, and most (though not all) agreed that the bill would be a step in the right direction, in all likelihood reducing the risk of having the government having to undertake another bailout. That's the case in part because the bill aims to heighten regulation in advance so that problems don't emerge in the first place. Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican, helped draft the orderly liquidation measures in the bill, and he has been arguing against McConnell's assertions that the bill allows bailouts. He was asked about the bill on MSNBC's Morning Joe on April 20. "Does it ensure future bailouts as Mitch McConnell suggests?" asked host Joe Scarborough. "There are some loopholes in the bill, no question," Corker replied. "But generally speaking, the central elements of the bill absolutely do the opposite." Corker gave an extended speech on the floor of the Senate the day before, discussing many details of the bill, including the $50 billion fund. "This fund that has been set up is anything but a bailout," Corker said. "It has been set up in essence to provide upfront funding by the industry so that when these companies are seized, there is money available to make payroll and to wind it down while the pieces are being sold off." (By the way, Corker has asked both Democrats and Republicans to cool down some of their rhetoric on financial reform.) The experts we spoke with, however, said they believed a $50 billion fund might not be enough to wind down a large failing firm with a global reach. For a truly large and interconnected institution, several sources said, $50 billion probably won't be enough to do an "orderly liquidation." Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, said that given past history, that figure is "laughable" and that "$300 billion would be the minimum reasonable starting point." We should add here that the bill is something of a moving target. There is speculation that the fund might be dropped from the bill, since it wasn't in the White House's original proposal. The Senate version will have to work out differences with the bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives if it's to become law. In ruling on McConnell's statement, that financial reform "actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks," we base our ruling primarily on the legislation. It clearly states that the intention is to liquidate failing companies, not bail them out. To do that, it creates a fund with contributions from financial firms, not from taxpayer funds. We do not see any element of the bill that expressly permits ongoing, "endless" outlays from the federal treasury. Is it possible that liquidation may cost the government money, potentially more money than is allowed for in the bill? Yes. But even so, McConnell is using seriously overheated rhetoric. Nothing in the bill "guarantees" future bailouts of Wall Street banks. We rate his statement False.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2010-04-20T17:22:56	2010-04-14	['None']
pomt-06283	Says the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction proposal urged raising $2 trillion in new revenue.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/21/john-kerry/john-kerry-says-simpson-bowles-proposal-raised-2-t/	On the Nov. 20, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., was grilled about the congressional "supercommittee" of which he’s a member. At the time the show aired, a deadline was looming for the supercommittee, which was created by the August 2011 deal to increase the debt ceiling. Host David Gregory asked Kerry about some of the negotiations over handling the growth of Social Security and Medicare -- programs dear to the hearts of many Democratic lawmakers, just as low taxes are dear to many Republicans. Kerry said that "a whole bunch of things were on the table for the right amount. If people wanted to do a $4 trillion deal, there were discussions about dealing with the major sacred cows of our side. I'm just telling you, every one of them was on the table, and they know it. And it will be documented, ultimately, in papers that I know will come out of this. But I don't want to get stuck there right now. The answer is, every one of them are on the table." The problem, Kerry said, is that Republicans "would not do the revenue." To draw a contrast, Kerry cited details from a few other deficit-reduction proposals, including one known as Simpson-Bowles, after the panel’s co-chairs, former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. The Simpson-Bowles commission was a bipartisan panel convened by the White House that produced a final recommendation in December 2010. "Look, put it in a perspective," Kerry told Gregory. "Simpson-Bowles worked for thousands of hours. Bipartisan, Republican, Democrat, people outside of the Senate and elected politics. They came out and said, in order to do a deal you need $4 trillion, and you need $2 trillion of it as revenue." By making this point, Kerry was attacking Republicans for their unwillingness to join with a bipartisan group in accepting significant tax increases. But is Kerry right that the Simpson-Bowles plan would have raised $2 trillion as revenue? We turned to the group’s final report to find out. The panel’s summary table shows that the plan’s total deficit reduction between 2012 and 2020 would be $3,885 trillion. That’s slightly lower than the $4 trillion Kerry cited, but the Simpson-Bowles report itself rounded that up "nearly $4 trillion" in its summary, so we think Kerry is on safe ground for that figure. But Kerry is off-base on the revenue side. Of the $3.885 trillion in total deficit reduction, the panel proposed cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending totaling $2.217 trillion and estimated interest savings of $673 billion. The remainder of the deficit reduction total involves new revenues -- a combination of closing tax loopholes and increasing in certain types of taxes and other revenue streams. The new tax revenues work out to $995 billion over that period -- slightly less than half of the level Kerry said and, in absolute terms, a difference of more than $1 trillion, which isn’t pocket change. We asked Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, if we were missing anything with our analysis. He cited two caveats. The first is that the commission proposed changes to the Social Security system, including payroll taxation of 90 percent of wages by 2050. That’s more than the 86 percent of wages subject to the payroll tax in 2009 and the estimated 83 percent that would be subject to the tax by 2020. The report recommends that the Social Security changes be made for their own sake, and not for the explicit purpose of deficit reduction, so the panel didn’t include these changes in its deficit-reduction math. But we can extrapolate how much additional revenue would come from Social Security by reverse-engineering from data elsewhere in the report. The maximum of all net changes from Social Security reforms is $229 billion through 2020. This figure actually includes more than just the payroll tax provision we cited above. But even if all of the $229 billion represented revenue increases, it would still not bump up the total revenue increases under Simpson-Bowles close to the $2 trillion that Kerry cited. The second caveat, Ellis said, is that other analyses based on the Simpson-Bowles proposal suggest that tax revenues could indeed reach $2 trillion by 2020. One was published by the Republican majority on the House Budget Committee, and another was published by the conservative Heritage Foundation. They get to this alternative number by using a different baseline. A "baseline" is the current budgetary level to which future deficit savings are compared. We asked Kerry’s office to clarify what he meant, but we did not hear back. Ellis, for what it’s worth, said he thinks it’s unlikely that Kerry was basing his comment on either of the two alternative analyses by the House Budget Committee Republicans and by the Heritage Foundation, both of which are Kerry’s ideological opposites. Our ruling While it’s possible to get to $2 trillion using the alternative baselines, we think the best way to analyze Kerry’s comment is to use the commission’s own math. After all, in Kerry’s words, Simpson-Bowles "came out and said, in order to do a deal you need $4 trillion, and you need $2 trillion of it as revenue." But the Simpson-Bowles report didn’t come close to suggesting $2 trillion in new revenue. The actual figure is slightly less than half of that. We rate his statement Mostly False. EDITOR’S NOTE: After our story was posted, Kerry’s office got back to us. Press secretary Whitney Smith confirmed that the senator understood that the choice of baseline determines how much revenue the proposal generates, as our story indicated. However, we stand by our position that the best number to use in this context is the one the Simpson-Bowles commission used itself, so we’re sticking with our ruling of Mostly False. SECOND EDITOR’S NOTE: A few days after our story appeared, we received a letter from Ed Lorenzen, executive director of the Moment of Truth Project, a project co-chaired by Simpson and Bowles to carry on the work of their commission. Lorenzen argued that even though the committee did not use the $2 trillion figure in its report, it was fair for Kerry to have used it in the context of comparing Simpson-Bowles to subsequent deficit-reduction proposals. His comments are detailed, so we’ve provided them separately here. However, we’ve decided to stick to prior our ruling of Mostly False, based on another point Lorenzen made — that if Kerry were to use the $2 trillion figure, then applying the same counting methodology to the total deficit reduction figure would result in a reduction of $5 trillion. That would have made incorrect the other half of Kerry’s statement, in which he said Simpson Bowles would have produced $4 trillion in deficit reduction.

pomt-10632	The church Barack Obama belongs to has a "nonnegotiable commitment to Africa."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/11/chain-email/church-claims-commitment-as-ethnic-heritage/	An anonymous chain e-mail warns its readers that the church Barack Obama belongs to has a "nonnegotiable commitment to Africa." That is an accurate statement from the church's Web site. But the e-mail implies that that commitment is anti-American, which we find is not the case. (Read our story about the whole e-mail here .) Obama belongs to Trinity United Church of Christ, which is considered among the larger black megachurches in the United States. The presidential race has kept him away from the church recently, but he typically attends when he's in Chicago, according to his campaign. Trinity preaches a Bible-based message of black self-reliance. Its motto is "Unashamedly Black and Unapologetically Christian." Trinity's commitment to Africa appears to be more a statement of philosophical orientation than of political support for any particular African country. The church offers classes about the continent and sponsors trips there. Its Web site, www.tucc.org, says it seeks to represent the concerns of Africa in the United States and compares its allegiance with other mainstream immigrant groups: "Just as those of Jewish heritage advocate on behalf of the state of Israel, and those of Irish heritage advocate on behalf of Ireland, and those of Polish descent for Poland, so must we of African descent care about the land of our heritage — the continent of Africa." Obama's father is from the nation of Kenya on the continent of Africa. Trinity defended its teachings in a statement responding to the recent attacks: "There is no anti-American sentiment in the theology or the practice of Trinity United Church of Christ. To be sure, there is prophetic preaching against oppression, racism and other evils that would deny the American ideal," it said. The e-mail is correct that the Web site espouses a "nonnegotiable commitment to Africa," and a nonnegotiable commitment is pretty strong language. But the e-mail implies there's something politically sinister about this and that it somehow supersedes a commitment to America. We find no evidence for that contention. For these reasons, we rate the claim Mostly True. UPDATE: Barack Obama resigned from Trinity United Church of Christ on May 31, 2008, after church pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. made controversial remarks about U.S. foreign policy and other matters. Obama said he intends to join another church after the election.

pomt-12056	"ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry’s Impassioned Plea To ‘Like, Just Co-Exist’"	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/08/babylon-bee/no-isis-didnt-lay-down-its-arms-after-katy-perry-e/	Just about everyone wants to see world peace. But the idea that the bad guys are just going to lay down their weapons has long been a powerful source of ridicule. In a post dated May 24, 2017, but which seemed to gain steam on social media in early September, the website Babylon Bee said that the terrorist group variously known as ISIS or the Islamic State had given up its fight just because American singer Katy Perry had called for co-existence in an interview. In an article headlined, "ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry’s Impassioned Plea To ‘Like, Just Co-Exist,’" the website wrote, "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, ‘The greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.’ " The article raised red flags at Facebook, and we’re fact-checking it here as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news. It’s not so obvious on the page showing the ISIS-Katy Perry article, but the Babylon Bee is a satire site. At the bottom of its home page, there’s a line that reads: "The Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire." A glance through other headlines on the site does confirm that the site runs fairly obvious satirical articles that often have religious themes. For instance, the site ran one article about Texas-based megachurch pastor Joel Osteen headlined, "Lakewood Church Issues Eclipse Glasses For Gazing At Joel Osteen’s Teeth." Another article was headlined, "Heaven Department Of Tourism Advises 2018 Round-Trip Tickets Selling Out Fast" So the Babylon Bee is more openly satirical than some other examples we’ve been forwarded by Facebook, but we’ll still confirm for the record that ISIS did not, after all, stop fighting for an Islamic caliphate just because Katy Perry suggested it. The genesis of the joke, as Snopes.com has noted, comes from comments Perry made on the Elvis Duran Morning Show on May 23, 2017, one day after a suicide bombing inspired by ISIS killed 22 people at the Manchester Arena in England during a concert by pop star Ariana Grande. In the interview, Perry said: "I think the greatest thing that we can do now is just unite as people, as fan bases, all of it, you know? Whatever we say behind people’s backs – because the Internet can be a little bit ruthless as far as fan bases go – but I think that the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other. And no barriers, no borders – we all need to just co-exist." (Footnote: Perry later performed with Grande at a benefit concert for the Manchester victims.) Some conservative commentators on social media mocked Perry’s remarks as geopolitically naive, though they often did so without noting that Perry had been seeking to promote unity and respect between the fans of different singers, not trying to ideologically reconcile extreme Islamism with advanced democracy. For instance, a Fox & Friends tweet touted commentator Michelle Malkin’s remark that Perry's call for "no barriers, no borders" typifies the "liberal mindset of celebs who don't operate in reality." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Perry responded to Malkin through a pair of tweets. "@michellemalkin The media has edited my words out of context, I was talking about online fan culture and how we must unite now. ... Maybe didn't say it perfectly but, I don't always get it right. Would love to speak with you in the future." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Either way, the story in the Babylon Bee reflects pretty obvious satire, not reality. For anyone who failed to catch the snark the first time around or saw the headline out of context, we rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-07016	Housing prices dropped for the 30 months prior to Barack Obama taking office, "and they have stabilized, they've been about flat since the president came in."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/06/shaun-donovan/hud-secretary-shaun-donovan-says-house-prices-stab/	The July 3, 2011, edition of CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley featured an interview with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan. Crowley quickly turned to the troubles in the housing market. She said, "By the numbers, when you came into office with the president, when he nominated you, 844,000 homes roughly were in foreclosure. 1.3 million right now are in foreclosure, and it's down a bit. Only 36 percent of people at this point, according to polls, approve of the way this administration has handled the housing crisis. Is there something more you can do?" Donovan responded, "Well first of all, Candy, we have to recognize, this is the most serious crisis we've had in housing since the Depression. Housing prices have been dropping for 30 straight months when the president walked into the Oval Office, and they have stabilized, they've been about flat since the president came in." He added, "So we've made a real difference. … But, rightly, the American people recognize we are not where we need to be. We still have a ways to go." We were most interested in Donovan’s recap of housing price trends, so we checked to see whether housing prices did indeed drop "for 30 straight months when the president walked into the Oval Office, and they have stabilized, they've been about flat since the president came in." We’ll start by saying that there’s no shortage of housing-price measurements. We found at least five that are conducted either monthly or quarterly, and because of varying methodologies, they all give slightly different snapshots of the housing-price market. Here’s a rundown: • S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. This seasonally adjusted index looks at 20 major metropolitan areas, so it provides a limited -- though important -- assessment of the housing-price market. Between July 2006 and January 2009, there were some modest (and temporary) upticks, but on the whole, the index fell by a significant amount -- a whopping 28 percent in the 30-month period, or nearly 1 percentage point per month on average. During the Obama presidency, the index has continued to drop, though at a slower rate. Between January 2009 and April 2011, the index has fallen by about 4 percent, with drops in exactly half the months and increases in exactly half the months. The most recent trendline, however, is negative: Prices have fallen for 11 straight months since June 2010. • National Association of Realtors. This index, published by the trade association representing Realtors, tracks median prices for existing home sales on a national basis. The numbers are not seasonally adjusted, so month-to-month comparisons are subject to caution. As with the Case-Shiller index, there were some modest upticks for the 30 months prior to the Obama presidency, but the general trendline was downward. The index dropped by 29 percent over the 30 months before Obama took office. Since Obama has been in the Oval Office, prices have risen slightly -- 2.5 percent over the subsequent 28 months. But as with Case-Shiller, the numbers most recently have been heading south: The index has fallen for six consecutive months. • Federal Housing Finance Agency. This federal agency calculates its own price indexes, including a quarterly index that’s seasonally adjusted. It’s based on transactions backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, federally chartered companies that purchase mortgages on the secondary market. That means this index measures a subgroup of all transactions, but a significant one. This index fell 11 percent between the third quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2008. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, the index has fallen an additional 8 percent, including declines in every single quarter of the Obama presidency. • Freddie Mac House Price Index. Freddie Mac produces its own index as well. The Freddie Mac index blipped upward occasionally between July 2006 and January 2009, but overall, this index fell by a combined 20 percent before Obama entered the White House. Then, between Obama’s January 2009 inauguration and March 2011, the index fell an additional 9 percent. The index has fallen for each of the most recent 11 months. • CoreLogic Home Price Index. This index showed a 27 percent decline in the 30 months before Obama entered the Oval Office and a 6 percent decline since he took office. The index fell for nine straight months before recovering slightly in April and May of 2011. Using these measures, then, Donovan overstated the case when he said that housing prices dropped "for 30 straight months when the president walked into the Oval Office." That’s not literally true by any of these indexes, though his underlying point -- that it was a rough 30 months for the housing market -- is confirmed by each of the indexes. In addition, Donovan’s implication that the president deserves a significant amount of credit also holds some water, with the National Association of Realtors estimating that a homebuyers’ tax credit backed by Obama encouraged an additional 1 million home sales. Less convincing is Donovan’s description of what has happened since Obama has entered office. If one uses a generous definition of "stabilized" -- performing better than previously -- then Donovan has a point. Since the start of 2009, housing prices have indeed avoided their historic declines of 2006, 2007 and 2008, However, a more stringent definition of "stabilized" -- and a greater focus on Donovan’s wording "flat" -- would suggest a different conclusion. If you look at the five indexes, the overall change in housing prices since Obama took office are a 2.5 percent increase, a decline of 4 percent, a decline of 6 percent, a decline of 8 percent and a decline of 9 percent. And in four of those indexes, prices have been declining for between six to 11 months with no sign of a reversal. When we contacted HUD with our findings, officials offered some explanations for the differences. One difference is that HUD used three specific measures, rather than the five we looked at -- and two of those were variations on the ones we had looked at. When using the Case-Shiller index, HUD used the non-seasonally adjusted version, even though that would not be considered the most appropriate way to make month-to-month comparisons. We checked their numbers, and, using this number, HUD is right that home prices declined for more than 30 consecutive months prior to Obama taking office. Using the seasonally adjusted numbers, as we did, it’s not the case. When using the CoreLogic data, HUD relied on a separate measure of house prices that excludes distressed sales -- that is, it excluded urgent sales of houses due to negative conditions, such as a foreclosure. How to count distressed sales is an important question when evaluating housing prices in the current market. As distressed homes work their way through the market, they will continue to be a drag on prices, which in turn will make it harder for the market to -- in Donovan’s word -- "stabilize." The National Association of Realtors expects distressed-home sales to exert negative pressure on the housing market for months to come. We won’t judge whether HUD is justified in excluding distressed sales, but we do think it’s important to note that it does and, in doing so, reduces the impact of one factor holding back a rise in home prices. The second difference between our research and HUD’s is that HUD started the clock in April 2009 -- not January 2009 -- under the argument that Obama could not have had an impact on the housing market until a few months into his presidency. This may sound like a small difference, but moving the starting date even three months actually changes the result significantly. Using the three statistics HUD tracked, a switch from starting in January to starting April means that the decline in prices under CoreLogic decreases from 3.5 percent to 0.8 percent; the decline under Case-Shiller decreases from 5.1 percent to 0.3 percent; and the decline under FHFA decreases from 8.3 percent to 7.1 percent. It’s certainly easier to call the CoreLogic and Case-Shiller numbers that start in April "stabilized" or "flat" than the ones starting in January. Then again, Donovan was pretty clear in his comment that he was starting the clock "when the president walked into the Oval Office," which would mean January. So where does this leave us? Donovan is right that things aren’t as bad as they were during the worst of the housing downturn, but we think he’s overstating the case when he says that housing prices are "stabilized" and "flat." The statistics HUD offered support that conclusion, but those numbers require starting the clock in April 2009 (which conflicts with Donovan’s statement); using a factor that helps the administration’s case (namely, excluding distressed sales); and using a non-seasonally-adjusted figure when a seasonally adjusted figure is available. The reality is that there are a wide range of statistics one could use to analyze housing prices, each with advantages and shortcomings. Most of the statistics we looked at show that housing prices have continued to decline -- though at a slower rate -- since Obama took office, and the decline is especially clear over the last six months to a year. That is at odds with Donovan’s conclusion that they had stabilized and were "flat." On balance, we rate Donovan’s statement Half True.

pomt-04932	"What I look at every month is how many more New Jerseyans are back to work. You have another 9,900 last month that are back to work and over almost 90,000 that are back to work now since I became governor."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/30/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-almost-90000-new-jerseyans-are/	Optimism about New Jersey’s economy abounds with Gov. Chris Christie. The Republican governor said regardless of a growing unemployment rate in New Jersey, which he argued is climbing because more people are actively seeking work, the numbers show more New Jersey residents are finding jobs. "What I look at every month is how many more New Jerseyans are back to work. You have another 9,900 last month that are back to work and over almost 90,000 that are back to work now since I became governor," Christie said during a July 23 news conference. "That's a positive for the state." Christie repeated part of the claim during a radio interview the next day. "So I absolutely believe the New Jersey comeback has begun. It hasn't arrived completely. It's begun. And ask the 90,000 people who are employed today in New Jersey who were not employed when I became governor whether the comeback [has] begun for them," Christie said on New Jersey 101.5 FM’s "Ask the Governor" program. During the press conference and radio interview the governor cited job numbers prior to the statements we’re fact-checking here. But he then characterizes those jobs gains as residents going back to work and that’s not accurate. Jobs do not equal people. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics counts jobs by a different method than it counts employed residents. So it’s possible for a state to gain jobs, but still have fewer employed residents That’s what happened in June. The state gained 9,900 jobs overall last month, including public- and private-sector employment. But 17,000 fewer New Jersey residents were employed in June than May. More people have found work since Christie took office, but not as many as the governor claimed. Christie said 90,000 people found work during his time in Trenton. That figure actually represents the number of private-sector jobs -- 89,700 -- New Jersey has added since February 2010, Christie’s first full month in office. Over the same time frame, nearly 39,000 New Jersey residents found employment, less than half the figure Christie cited. So what gives? A job created in a state does not mean an unemployed resident returned to work. The federal labor department counts jobs through a survey of employers called the payroll survey. "We don't know how many people that represents," said Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, because a person may hold more than one job. To count the number of employed residents, the federal labor department relies on a survey of households. In that survey, individuals are classified as employed, unemployed or not in the labor force by their place of residence, even if their job is in another state. And by that measure, Christie’s figures for the number of New Jersey residents who have returned to work are off. Brian Murray, a spokesman for the state labor department, said: "On every other occasion for the past week during which the Governor has addressed this topic in public, he has correctly stated that we gained 9,900 jobs in June and nearly 90,000 jobs since his first full month in office. To pounce on this is ridiculous and petty." Our ruling Christie said that 9,900 New Jerseyans returned to work in June and almost 90,000 residents are "back to work now since I became governor." Christie wrongly represents job gains as individuals returning to work. The federal labor department counts jobs and employed people in separate surveys. It’s possible for jobs to go up while the number of employed people goes down. Some 17,000 fewer New Jersey residents were employed in May than June, despite 9,900 new jobs created last month. Since February 2010, the first full month Christie was in office, nearly 39,000 -- not 90,000 -- people found employment in New Jersey. We rate this claim False.

pomt-12386	Says Pat Robertson said, "We must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/31/uspoln/pat-robertson-gays-special-colored-clothes/	The website USPOLN, already flagged as a fake news site on our handy guide, recycled an evocative bit of fakery about television evangelist Pat Robertson that dates from 2015. Allegedly drawing on an installment of Robertson’s show The 700 Club, the post begins with Robertson warning that legal rights of gays and lesbians will draw down God’s wrath upon America. It then goes off the rails. The article says a caller asks if this disaster can be averted. To which Robertson replies, "The only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people. I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official." Facebook readers flagged this as likely fake news, and in fact, the article provides a link to its source, an item from the fake news site Newslo that was debunked by Snopes in early November 2015. Robertson never said those words, but if the goal is to drive traffic, passing them off as real seems to work. The 2015 version drew snarky comments from a website in the United Kingdom, and the latest verbatim copy pulled in angry responses from those who also took it as real. One commenter said, "I think God will go after him and his fortune for being close-minded and prejudiced. The Bible teaches us to love each other no matter who they are." President Donald Trump’s White House win seems to have increased the popularity of false news items that fuel the ire of liberals. So far the evidence is anecdotal, but the standard rule to stem the spread of faux news applies: If the headline alone inspires outrage, pause before sharing. Then look for the tell-tale signs of fake news, such as a lack of sources, no date of publication and the presence of click-bait ads all around the page. USPOLN describes itself as a hybrid news/satire site. The article gives no indication that its content is hokum. Our ruling The USPOLN website posted an article alleging that Robertson called for a law to require gays and lesbians to wear specially colored clothes. Robertson never said those words.

pomt-06105	"Santorum also voted for a teapot museum in North Carolina."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/03/rick-perry/says-rick-santorum-voted-teapot-museum/	Heading into the Iowa Caucus, Texas Gov. Rick Perry was working to stir a tempest in Rick Santorum’s teapot. Perry’s campaign released a Web ad, taking Santorum, the former Pennsylvania Senator, to task for supporting a string of earmarks during his time in Washington. The ad, launched Jan. 2, 2012, on Perry’s Website, accuses Santorum, who had surged in Iowa polls, of voting to spend taxpayer money on a teapot museum in North Carolina, among other earmarked projects. "Why are these pigs so happy? … Because Rick Santorum is a porker’s best friend," reads the ad, titled "Rick Santorum - Unelectable," which depicts a herd of pigs. "Santorum voted to spend millions on the Bridge to Nowhere," the ad reads. "Santorum also voted for a teapot museum in North Carolina." PolitiFact looked into Perry’s claim about the "Bridge to Nowhere" earlier this week, ruling it Mostly True. But is Perry right that Santorum voted in favor of the teapot museum, as well? In the advertisement, the Perry campaign cites Senate Roll Call vote 264 of 2005, in which the U.S. Senate passed the related appropriations bill by a 93-1 vote. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., included $450,000 in funding for the New River Community Partners Museum Development Project, which was responsible for the Sparta Teapot Museum of Craft & Design in North Carolina. Museum Managers started working in 2003 to raise funds for a new building to house a private collection of more than 6,000 teapots. In October 2005, Santorum voted in favor of the Senate appropriations bill, along with each of his Republican colleagues present at the time. And he reaffirmed his support the next month when he allowed the legislation, which had been combined with the House version, to pass by unanimous consent. The only other current presidential candidate serving in Congress at the time, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, did not vote either on the House bill or the combined proposal. But does Santorum’s vote indicate support for the museum itself? Analysts say maybe not. Representatives from the Santorum campaign didn’t return requests Tuesday for comment about the teapot museum. But, last week, he defended his support for earmarks to a crowd at an Iowa town hall meeting. "Go and look at the Constitution. Who has the responsibility to spend money? Clearly, in the Constitution it is the Congress," Santorum said, according to the Des Moines Register. "Now what has happened is that the system was abused, and it got a bad name, and as a result of that, I have said, ‘Look. the Congress has lost the public trust, and (earmarks) have to be suspended.’" Relating specifically to the 2005 appropriations bill, Santorum’s positive vote does not necessarily indicate support for the teapot museum, according to some analysts. In total, the bill included billions of dollars in funding for more than 1,100 earmarks, according to the House report. Among the thousands of earmarks, the final version of the bill directed funding to nearly 70 projects in Santorum’s native Pennsylvania, including $750,000 for a Sept.11 memorial garden in Lower Makefield Township; $250,000 for the YWCA in Chester; and $200,000 for the Pittsburgh zoo, according to the bill report. "(The teapot museum) became a very symbolic needle, but it's a needle in the haystack nonetheless," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a non-partisan group that tracks federal earmarks. "Did he vote for it? Yeah. He voted for funding the Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and everything else," Ellis said. "That said, don't vote for things if you don't want to be called out for supporting them." As a side note: the federal money for the Sparta Teapot Museum was returned in 2009 after the museum board disbanded and the facility closed due to lack of funding, according to the museum website. Our ruling: The 2005 appropriations bill did fund the teapot museum, along with more than 1,100 other earmarked projects. But, Santorum didn’t vote for the museum in particular. He voted for the total appropriations bill, which provided billions in funding for federal transportation and housing projects, among others. Perry is right about the vote, but he leaves out important detail, which fits our definition of Half True.

pomt-11364	The census "for years and years and years, decades, has asked, ‘Are you a citizen of the United States of America?’"	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/03/ronna-mcdaniel/rnc-chair-ronna-mcdaniel-says-us-census-bureau-ask/	The debate over including a citizenship question on the 2020 census has been heating up since the March 26, 2018, U.S. Commerce Department announcement of its census plans. Officials said the question -- which asks respondents whether they are citizens -- will be included for all respondents at the request of the Justice Department. The department said the purpose of the question is to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. Meanwhile, immigrant-rights advocates and Democrats argue that the question instills fear in immigrant communities and will lead to an undercount of the population. The population count, taken every 10 years, is required by the U.S. Constitution and used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House as well as how federal money is distributed to local communities. Since undocumented immigrants are more heavily concentrated in some states and areas, an undercount would mean less money and could change how legislative districts are drawn. California, which has a large immigrant population, has filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Commerce Department and census bureau seeking to block the question. During a March 28, 2018, interview with host John Muir on the "Restoring Reason" program on Green Bay’s WTAQ radio, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel slammed the opposition to the census question. "When you talk about the Democrats, too, look at what they are fighting for. They are now mad that our census, which for years and years and years, decades, has asked, ‘Are you a citizen of the United States of America?’ – they are mad that the census asks that simple question." Is McDaniel correct? Has the citizenship question that is now at the center of a debate already been asked for "years and years and years"? The evidence The history section of the U.S. Census Bureau’s web page notes that the first U.S. census was taken in 1790. At that time the questions asked for the name of the head of the family and the number of persons in each household, including slaves. As part of its announcement, the Commerce Department said that citizenship questions have been included on prior censuses: Between 1820 and 1950, almost every decennial census asked a question on citizenship in some form. Today, surveys of sample populations, such as the Current Population Survey and the ACS (American Community Survey), continue to ask a question on citizenship. According to our colleagues at PolitiFact National, the last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the 1950 Census. That census questioned where individuals were born, and "if foreign-born — is he naturalized?" In 1960, the census only asked about place of birth. From 1970 to 2000, the Census Bureau used two questionnaires: a long-form and short-form. Most households received the short-form questionnaire, which covered basic questions, while about 1 in 6 households received a long-form questionnaire that included a question on citizenship. The 2010 Census, the most recent one, only used a short-form questionnaire with 10 questions. None of those related to citizenship. However, in the mid-2000s the Census Bureau began gathering demographic and socioeconomic information through the American Community Survey, or ACS. The survey collects information from about 3.5 million households a year and asks about citizenship status. The ACS asks such questions as "In what U.S. state, territory, commonwealth or foreign country was this person born?" Another question is "Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?" The idea with both the now-defunct long-form and the ongoing ACS survey is to use a large sample of responses to draw conclusions about the population as whole, much as a poll does not need to contact every voter to be considered valid. Our rating McDaniel said the census "for years and years and years, decades, has asked, ‘Are you a citizen of the United States of America?’" The last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the 1950 census. But in the decades since, some version of the question has been asked in nearly every census -- either through the now-defunct "long form" or the ongoing annual surveys. The 2020 census calls for asking all households the citizenship question. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate McDaniel’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-08077	Once people become citizens under the DREAM Act "and turn 21, they can sponsor their illegal immigrant parents for legalization."	/texas/statements/2010/dec/20/lamar-smith/us-rep-lamar-smith-says-under-dream-act-new-citize/	In a recent op-ed, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, called an immigration bill that would allow undocumented residents brought to the United States as minors to qualify for citizenship "a nightmare for the American people." Among other arguments against the bill, Smith says in his piece published in The Hill Nov. 30 that "once the DREAM Act's amnesty recipients become citizens and turn 21, they can sponsor their illegal immigrant parents for legalization." The U.S. House subsequently voted 216-198 in favor of the the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, known as the DREAM Act. But the measure didn't make it through the Senate, where proponents fell five votes short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and usher the legislation to the floor. We're not getting into whether providing a path for undocumented minors to become citizens is the same thing as amnesty. Yet we waded into the family issue earlier this month when we rated Barely True a statement by Smith's Texas colleague, Rep. Ted-Poe, R-Humble, who said that "after you complete two years of post high school education or two years of military service you are eligible for citizenship. Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of their extended family to the United States." Poe skipped several stipulations that an undocumented citizen must satisfy before becoming a citizen, and he went too far when he said undocumented-residents-turned-citizens can sponsor their extended family to come here. According to the U.S. State Department, citizens cannot sponsor grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or in-laws to come legally to the United States. Smith's statement reflects accurately on provisions in federal law permitting a citizen to sponsor immediate family members — a spouse, unmarried children or adopted children under 21 — to enter the country with an "immediate relative immigrant visa." Citizens 21 and older can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residence as well, according to the State Department. We identified a wrinkle, though, not acknowledged in Smith's statement. Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, which is generally pro-immigration, said in an e-mail: "It is incredibly unlikely that DREAM Act beneficiaries would have citizenship by the age of 21. Even if someone completed every requirement (including higher education) on the date of enactment of the legislation, they would still need to spend 10 years in non-immigrant status and then another three years as a legal permanent resident before they would be eligible for citizenship. With high school graduation at 18, you could assume that many people would be 31 before they would gain citizenship under DREAM." There have been various versions of the DREAM Act, but according to recent legislation, an undocumented resident must be younger than 30, have been brought to the United States at age 15 or younger and have lived here for at least five years prior to the measure becoming law to become eligible for the act's benefits. Such a resident must spend 10 years in the United States as a "conditional non-immigrant," during which he or she must complete two years of higher education or serve in the military and be of "good moral character," among other requirements, before qualifying for a permanent resident card, also known as a green card. After three more years, he or she is eligible to become a naturalized citizen. So, while Smith is correct that a U.S. citizen must be 21 to sponsor his or her parents for legal residence, it's unlikely that anyone who becomes a U.S. citizen under the DREAM Act would be younger than 21. We rate Smith's statement as Mostly True.	None	Lamar Smith	None	None	None	2010-12-20T06:00:00	2010-11-30	['None']
pomt-04355	"Latin America’s economy is almost as big as the economy of China."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-latin-americas-economy-almost-big/	During the third presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Mitt Romney touted Latin America as a region that’s ripe for expanding trade with the United States. "Trade grows about 12 percent year," Romney said. "It doubles about five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America, we have just not taken advantage (of them) of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin America’s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We’re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us — time zone, language opportunities." We won’t judge whether Latin America is a "huge opportunity" for the U.S., but we were curious whether it’s true that "Latin America’s economy is almost as big as the economy of China." We turned to data on gross domestic product collected by the International Monetary Fund. For Latin America, we combined the GDP for 20 nations: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. For China, we added up the GDP for China and, using World Bank data, its two "special administrative regions," Hong Kong and Macau. In 2011, the 20 Latin American nations had a combined nominal GDP of $5.6 trillion, while China, Hong Kong and Macau had a combined GDP of $7.6 trillion. So, China’s GDP was about one-third larger than Latin America’s, meaning the two are hardly neck and neck. Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas and an aide in the White House Office of the Special Envoy for the Americas under President Bill Clinton, said you can’t close the gap between Latin America and China without broadening the definition to "the Americas" by adding Canada, something we don’t think was suggested by Romney’s claim. But even then, the combination of Latin America and Canada still wouldn't get you to the GDP level of China. In addition, the growth in China's economy has been outpacing Latin America's, putting Latin America even further behind as time goes on. Between 2010 and 2011, Latin America’s GDP expanded by 14 percent -- an impressive growth rate -- but China’s grew by an even more impressive 23 percent. "China growth has been extraordinary; Latin America’s has not," said Barry Bosworth, an international economics scholar at the Brookings Institution. This growth pattern further weakens Romney’s argument that Latin America’s economy is "almost as big." Our ruling Romney said that "Latin America’s economy is almost as big as the economy of China." It's a stretch to characterize an economy that's about one-third bigger as "almost as big," especially since China’s lead over Latin America is actually increasing. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-23T16:21:23	2012-10-22	['China', 'Latin_America']
pomt-00132	Says Tammy Baldwin’s "Medicare for All" plan means senior citizens would "no longer have" Medicare.	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/26/leah-vukmir/leah-vukmirs-attack-tammy-baldwin-ignores-medicare/	Would the Bernie Sanders Medicare for All plan, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., really mean no more Medicare for senior citizens? It’s an attack on Baldwin made by Leah Vukmir, her Republican challenger — who even goes so far as to say the bill would "literally throw grandma off the cliff." That’s a reference to PolitiFact National’s Lie of the Year for 2011 — a false claim that Republicans had -- via a plan from Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan -- to end Medicare. (A web video produced by a liberal group showed a Ryan look-alike pushing an old woman in a wheelchair off a cliff.) Vukmir is essentially repeating a claim President Donald Trump made in an opinion article he wrote for USA Today. Let’s dig into what she said. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Vukmir’s claim In the third and final debate before the Nov. 6, 2018 election, Vukmir turned a discussion about pre-existing medical conditions to Medicare for All. In the Oct. 19, 2018 debate in Milwaukee, she said: Senator Baldwin wants to talk about going backwards. Going backwards is telling seniors that you no longer have your Medicare and your Medicare Advantage. I can’t believe that Senator Baldwin wants to literally throw grandma off the cliff. That’s exactly what she’s doing. This would create chaos of epic proportions. She doesn’t understand her own bill. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. So, what Vukmir is claiming is that the Medicare for All plan supported by Baldwin means senior citizens would "no longer have" Medicare. What is Medicare for All? Medicare is the federal government’s health insurance program that is primarily for people age 65 and over older, but also for some younger people with disabilities. As PolitiFact National reported in a recent explainer about Medicare, the financially stressed $600 billion-a-year program serves 58 million people -- almost one out of six Americans. Sanders, the independent U.S. Senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat in 2016, introduced his Medicare for All bill in September 2017. It’s been referred to a Senate committee, but nothing more has been done with it. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. As New York Times news articles reported at the time that the bill would expand Medicare so that every American would eventually get insurance from Medicare instead of from private companies or other public programs. In other words, a "single payer" -- the government -- would pay everyone’s medical bills. To be clear, Medicare for All would replace Medicare and Medicare Advantage. (Medicare Advantage, which is run by private companies and is optional, offers the services Medicare does as well as other servicess, such as dental or vision coverage.) But, after a four-year transition period, it would replace the current Medicare program with a new and more comprehensive one. Indeed, under the plan, those currently with Medicare would get more generous coverage -- something that has been noted by PolitiFact National and the Washington Post Fact Checker. According to the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation, a top source on health care, Medicare for All would cover not only all medically necessary services, but also dental and vision services. There would be no premiums or cost-sharing requirements, other than limited cost sharing (up to $200 per year) on prescription drugs. Patients would be allowed to go to any provider, not be limited by a network. So, that’s enhanced coverage for seniors -- not taking coverage away. Vukmir’s evidence To back Vukmir’s claim, her campaign cited an opinion column in the New York Post published three days before the debate. The column is by Betsy McCaughey, a senior fellow at the conservative London Center for Policy Research and a former lieutenant governor of New York state. (She earned a Pants on Fire for making a statement that was part of PolitiFact’s 2009 Lie of the Year on "death panels.") McCaughey writes that Sanders’ Medicare for All "abolishes Medicare," a point Vukmir has trumpeted. She argues that the program would not be financially viable, saying: On paper, the new program guarantees hospital care, doctors’ visits, even dental, vision and long-term care, all paid for by Uncle Sam. Here’s the hitch: Hospitals will be forced to operate under conditions of extreme scarcity, with too little revenue and more patients than ever. Right now, Medicare shortchanges hospitals, paying them less than the full cost of caring for seniors. But hospitals accept the low payments, because they can shift the unmet costs to younger patients who have private insurance that pays more. But in the new scheme, hospitals will be paid at Medicare rates for all their patients, not just seniors (Sec. 611). With everyone on Medicare for All, no cost-shifting will be possible. What would ultimately happen if Medicare for All ever became law, of course, is unknown, though there are plenty of questions. For example, health care policy expert Robert Moffit at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that with Medicare, "the addition of new benefits, procedures and the availability of new medical technologies has traditionally lagged behind private (insurance) plans." But as proposed -- as even the expert cited by Vukmir acknowledges -- Medicare for All would offer senior citizens more coverage. Our rating Vukmir says Baldwin’s "Medicare for All" means senior citizens would "no longer have" Medicare. Medicare, along with other government and private health insurance programs, would be replaced if Medicare for All ever became law. But it’s not as though senior citizens would lose Medicare and be left with nothing. In fact, as proposed, Medicare for All would provide them more benefits than they get with current Medicare. Vukmir’s statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression — our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-14203	"In 2009 … Hillary Clinton was at the State Department working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents."	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/21/lee-camp/did-hillary-clintons-state-department-help-suppres/	Hillary Clinton colluded with big business to maintain slave wages for workers in one of the world’s poorest countries, according to the host of an RT American comedy news show. Comedian and activist Lee Camp of RT’s Redacted Tonight mocked Clinton’s efforts to "keep 37 cents per hour out of the hands of destitute Haitians." "In 2009, while Bill Clinton was setting up one of the family’s shell companies in New York, in that same year Hillary Clinton was at the State Department working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents," Camp said April 17. "Seriously." Seriously? Sort of. Memos from 2008 and 2009 obtained by Wikileaks strongly suggest, but don’t prove without a doubt, that the State Department helped block the proposed minimum wage increase. The memos show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage hike and met multiple times with factory owners who directly lobbied against it to the Haitian president. The Clinton campaign refuted the claim, and the State Department didn't comment. HOPE, not change In 2011, Wikileaks made nearly 2,000 cables available to the progressive magazine, The Nation, and Haiti Liberté, a weekly newspaper in Port-au-Prince. The two media outlets assessed the cables and found, among many other revelations, that the "U.S. Embassy in Haiti worked closely with factory owners contracted by Levi’s, Hanes, and Fruit of the Loom to aggressively block a paltry minimum wage increase" for workers in apparel factories. The Wikileaks cables show U.S. Embassy officials began monitoring the minimum wage issue as early as 2008, when the Haitian Parliament began discussing doubling or tripling the daily minimum wage of 70 Haitian gourdes to keep up with inflation. That’s roughly equal to $1.75 a day, or about 22 cents per hour. (Some context here: Three quarters of Haitians live on less than $2 a day, according to the United Nations’ World Food Program, while garments constitute about 90 percent of Haiti’s exports, according to the Guardian. Haiti increased the daily minimum wage to the equivalent of $5.11 in 2014.) But back in 2008 and 2009, embassy officials repeatedly told Washington that a hike would hurt the economy and undermine U.S. trade preference legislation known as HOPE. The program, shorthand for the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006, gives garments manufactured on the island duty free access to U.S. markets. Levi Strauss, Haneswear, Nautica, and Dockers are just some of the American companies that benefit from HOPE. Congress passed HOPE II in 2008, extending the program for another 10 years. In January 2008, Ambassador Janet Sanderson wrote that representatives of the business community — including the man tasked with implementing HOPE — had met with embassy officials and criticized Haitian President René Préval’s efforts to raise the minimum wage as the wrong medicine for the ailing economy. An unsigned embassy cable sent to Washington in December 2008 echoed the private sector’s assessment and reported that increasing the minimum wage would "have significant impact" on business. The State Department continued to promote HOPE as an economic boon for the island. In memos prepping U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and Clinton for their visits to Haiti, chargé d'affaires Thomas Tighe told the diplomats to "urge" the Haitian government take advantage of HOPE and HOPE II. After advising a congressional delegation to Haiti almost exactly the same thing, Sanderson told Washington that Haitian Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis was onboard with HOPE, "although pending legislation to nearly triple the minimum wage would likely set back those efforts in the short term." Deputy Chief of Mission David Lindwall put it most bluntly, when he said the minimum wage law "did not take economic reality into account but that appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses." Préval as proxy Nonetheless, the Haitian Parliament voted to triple the daily minimum wage to 200 gourdes ($5 a day, or about 62 cents per hour) in May 2009. As the bill awaited President Préval’s signature, students protested over the delay while factory owners criticized the legislation. The U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, continued to lament the hike and raised concerns about the stability of the region that they hoped Préval would help address, according to the cables. Préval, as they say, leaned in. Sanderson, in a June 10 memo, cited a study by the Haitian Association of Industry (ADIH) stating that the new minimum wage "would result in the loss of 10,000 workers in the sector" and noted that ADIH has met with Préval three times. "A more visible and active engagement by Préval may be critical to resolving the issue of the minimum wage and its protest ‘spin-off' — or risk the political environment spiraling out of control," she wrote. A few days later, Préval seemed to be on board with the embassy and industry position on the minimum wage issue. On June 17, Tighe told Washington that industry and USAID studies found that a 200 gourdes minimum wage "would make the sector economically unviable and consequently force factories to shut down." He also noted that ADIH members and HOPE factory owners told U.S. officials that in lieu of greenlighting the legislation as is, Préval would instead propose a lower, phased-in minimum wage for the textiles sector (100 gourdes in 2009, 125 gourdes in 2010, and 150 gourdes in 2011). Protesters continued to call for Préval to sign the original bill, with some demonstrations escalating into violence, as parliament considered the president’s amendments. In a June 24 cable to a congressional delegation, Tighe said the demonstrations added uncertainty to the political and security situation in Haiti and "job creation under HOPE II may be threatened by a bill Parliament passed May 5 to nearly triple the minimum wage." When the delegation met with Préval the next day, the president parroted this line and encouraged the congressmen "to write to Haitian members of Parliament to express concern about the devastating impact a sector-wide increase in wages would have on job security and job creation," according to a memo from Tighe. By July, Préval was a formal and vocal opponent of the 200 gourds wage, warning of the consequences for jobs and emphasizing the importance of the assembly sector for exports, according to cables. "This is the only issue in recent memory where the president has made a strong effort, by negotiating with stakeholders and using the media, to effect a legislative outcome," Tighe said. In the fall of 2009, Préval and Parliament agreed to enact the $5 daily wage for all sectors except textiles, which got a $3 wage. But was the State Department right in opposing the increase? "I have no idea what would happen if Haiti did have a $5-a-day minimum wage," Adam Davidson of NPR’s Planet Money said in 2011. "But I do think it's reasonable to assume that some factories would close and far fewer new ones would be built. Far fewer Haitians would be allowed to take that first tentative step on to the ladder of industrial development." Our ruling Camp said, "In 2009 ... Hillary Clinton was at the State Dept working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents." Leaked cables show that the U.S. Embassy in Haiti opposed the minimum wage hike that the Haitian parliament passed in 2009, and discussed the issue with business groups. However, the cables do not contain conclusive evidence that the State Department actively pressured Haiti to block the increase nor do they prove that Clinton personally played a role. We rate Camp’s claim Half True. Update, April 21, 2016: After we published this fact-check, the State Department told us it had no public, official position in the Haitian minimum wage debate. "The U.S. Department of State did not officially oppose or support the three-step proposed minimum wage increases in Haiti – in 2009, 2010, and 2012 – as this was an internal matter," a spokesperson said. The State Department’s public stance does not alter the content of the memos, however. They show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage increase. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/38510339-e97d-475a-a62f-77b0e757b589	None	Lee Camp	None	None	None	2016-04-21T11:00:00	2016-04-17	['United_States', 'United_States_Department_of_State', 'Haiti', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-07865	If you tried to pay out $1 trillion by handing it out at $1 per second, it would take more than 31,000 years.	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/09/johnny-isakson/sen-isakson-says-counting-1-trillion-takes-thousan/	The AJC Truth-O-Meter gets no love from politicians, be they Democrat or Republican. But it’s more than pleased to settle for a little attention now and then. Two months after his failed bid to reclaim the governor’s seat, former Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes, in an essay presented at a Jan. 28 panel at the State Bar Association, weighed in on his dim view of the state of investigative reporting. "We now have Truth-O-Meters, whatever that means," Barnes said. And just a few days before Barnes spoke, Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson brought up our gutsy gizmo as he explained the magnitude of the national debt during a Jan. 24 talk at the Atlanta Press Club. Isakson said he was at a campaign stop when a farmer asked, "How much is a trillion?" The senator didn’t have an answer, so he wrestled with the numbers and concluded that if you tried to pay out $1 trillion at a rate of $1 per second, it would take you more than 31,000 years. "Given the Truth-O-Meters out there, I put an asterisk by that," he said. "I didn't account for leap years." We couldn’t resist. Would counting out $1 trillion at $1 per second really take more than 31,000 years? And what about those leap years? Before we proceed, it’s useful to note that the national debt eclipsed $1 trillion years ago. As of Feb. 2, it totaled $14.1 trillion. About $4.6 trillion is what’s called "intragovernmental" debt, or money the government loaned to itself. It does this by transferring money from the Social Security trust funds and other government divisions. About $9.5 trillion is what’s called "public" debt, or money that the government borrows from domestic and foreign investors by issuing things such as bonds or treasury bills. This debt is what worries economists because it has to be paid back in cash. Too large a debt could be a drag on the economy. Interest rates and tax rates might rise as government services and entitlement payouts shrink. Isakson wants to rein in federal spending, and on Jan. 27 he introduced the Biennial Budget Appropriations Act with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. It would change the budget cycle so one year of the two-year congressional session would be devoted to figuring out whether federal programs deserve funding. Isakson is also a co-sponsor of the Commitment to American Prosperity Act, which would create a federal spending limit that would gradually decrease over 10 years, based on the U.S. gross domestic product. He is also co-sponsor of a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget. Now, back to our fact check. We called Georgia Tech, which is renowned for its prowess in math and science. It put us in the capable hands of math professor Douglas Ulmer, who is chairman of the School of Mathematics. This is how Ulmer did the math: Since leap years take place every four years, Ulmer counted a year as 365.25 days. He then converted years to seconds using the following equation: (365.25 days) x (24 hours/day) x (60 minutes/hour) x (60 seconds/minute) = 31,557,600 seconds Ulmer divided those seconds into a trillion, which showed that 1 trillion seconds equals more than 31,688 years. He then converted the remainder into days, hours and seconds to conclude that 1 trillion seconds is 31,688 years, 32 days, 1 hour, 46 minutes and 40 seconds. "Over 31,000" is therefore close enough for all practical purposes, Ulmer said. We wholeheartedly agree. Isakson gets an A in arithmetic. We rule his statement True. And we hope he continues to tout the Truth-O-Meter in all his speeches.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2011-02-09T06:00:00	2011-01-24	['None']
pomt-00973	On climate change, "the temperature readings have been fabricated, and it's all blowing up in their (scientists') faces."	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/13/dana-perino/fox-news-host-climate-scientists-fabricated-temper/	The U.S. Senate may have voted 98-1 that "climate change is real and not a hoax," but the accusation that government scientists have cooked the books and invented a warming trend is as robust as ever. Fox News host Dana Perino joined several of her colleagues this week in casting doubt on the data scientists use to track temperature changes over time. Perino’s comments came on Feb. 9, 2015, as she and her co-hosts on The Five somewhat sarcastically discussed how the fight against Islamic State or ISIS drew attention away from other issues, such as climate change. "They're (the White House) actually kind of lucky that we don't cover climate change as much as we should," Perino said. "Because yesterday, it was reported that the temperature readings have been fabricated and it's all blowing up in their faces." Co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle interjected that it was "fraud science" and Perino said, "Yes, I agree." We have checked this sort of claim before and found it wrong, but some time has passed, and Perino referenced new reporting. So we wanted to fact-check her claim that temperature readings "have been fabricated." We reached out to Perino to find the source of her statement and did not hear back. However, a couple of days before she spoke, the British paper The Telegraph carried an opinion piece entitled, "The fiddling with temperature data is the biggest science scandal ever." The article drew on the work of a well-known climate change skeptic, Paul Homewood, who on Feb. 4, 2015, blogged about alterations in the temperature records in Paraguay and some arctic locations. The Telegraph article concluded that these changes were part of the "greatest and most costly scare the world has known." But when we reached Homewood, he offered a more nuanced summary of his findings. "I make no claims about the effect of (temperature) adjustments globally," Homewood said. "I feel that by identifying specific examples, we have moved the debate forward by challenging how adjustments work in practice, and whether we can always rely on them." Homewood’s concerns center on something most of us don’t think about too often: the massive data files used by climate scientists worldwide to track changes globally and in different regions of the earth. Raw data vs. adjusted data Every month, readings from thousands of land-based weather stations around the world are shared through the Global Historical Climatology Network. To measure ocean temperatures, there is a flow of data from buoys and ships. Climate trends play out over long periods of time, and the challenge has been to deal with changes in the way temperature is measured that have nothing to do with the weather itself. For instance, local officials might move a station from a valley to a nearby hilltop. They might change the time of day when they record their measurements from sunrise to sunset. They might change the kind of thermometer they use. In the ocean, the practice once was to haul up a bucket of water. Later, the standard practice was to measure the temperature from the engine’s intake valve. Researchers at the National Climatic Data Center, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have to then come up with a way to work with the temperature readings so they can make apples-to-apples comparisons. What they do is take the raw temperature readings and apply a boatload of statistical techniques to pick out the most reliable data. Where necessary, they adjust the readings to account for the human factors that would skew the data regardless of what happened with actual temperatures. The controversy voiced by Homewood and others is that they don’t accept those adjustments. NOAA says the adjustments -- as was the case in Paraguay -- are necessary to make valid comparisons. "Such changes in observing systems cause false shifts in temperature readings. Paraguay is one example of where these false shifts artificially lower the true station temperature trend," the agency said. Homewood is right that the Paraguay adjustments raised the temperature reported for that station. But what Homewood leaves out, NOAA says, is that nearly half the time the adjustments made by researchers lower the temperature below what was actually recorded. No change in the big picture Perino said that researchers’ theories of climate change were "blowing up in their faces." That is not the view of the researchers we reached. Judith Curry is chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Curry believes the issues with the adjusted data are "greater than have been portrayed." On the other hand, she told PunditFact that the concerns in the Telegraph op-ed were "overblown" and that the basic conclusion remains the same. "The adjustments aren't of such a magnitude that they throw into question the overall increase in global temperature for the past 100-plus years," Curry said. An independent group of researchers called Berkeley Earth have the sole goal of working with the raw data and analyzing it for themselves. Zeke Hausfather is a data scientist with the group. Hausfather told PunditFact that the warning flag raised by The Telegraph article and bloggers amounts to cherry-picking the data. That’s because while some adjustments might make it seem like scientists are artificially raising temperatures, some adjustments at other stations actually would lead you to the opposite conclusion. "(They) look through all those thousands of stations, find a few that show big adjustments, and tell everyone that they are evidence of fraud," Hausfather said. "You will rarely see them pick out stations like Reno, Paris, London, Tokyo, or many others where the adjustments dramatically lower the warming trend." Hausfather and his colleagues traced how the adjustment methods changed the temperature data differently around the world since 1850. In the graph below, zero is the baseline. Above zero, temperatures have been adjusted upward, below it temperatures have been adjusted downward. In the United States, with about 5 percent of Earth’s land area, the official data file raised temperatures compared to the original readings. But the same methods lowered the data records in Africa, and for all land-based readings taken together, the adjustments basically made no change at all (the black line). With ocean temperature trends, the efforts to compensate for the human factor lower the numbers dramatically. "The net effect of adjustments is to actually reduce the amount of global warming we've observed since 1880 by about 20 percent," Hausfather said. "Folks skeptical of temperature adjustments are welcome not to use them if they'd like, but you end up with more global warming, not less." Mark Serreze is professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Serreze said over the years, many people have vetted the statistical methods that lead to the adjusted data files. "The features of the global temperature records have been verified by comparisons between analyses from different centers and sensitivities to different ways of treating the data," Serreze said. "The peer reviewed literature is extensive. This is why there is consensus that the data are correct." For the record, the author of the The Telegraph opinion piece made the same point about eight months ago. Back then, it inspired a similar flurry of claims that government scientists intentionally engaged in fraud. Our ruling Perino said that disclosures of fabricated temperature readings have upended theories of climate change. The source we believe she relied on, The Telegraph opinion piece, in turn relied on the work of a climate change skeptic and blogger. He told us that he was not challenging the overall trends of global warming, but instead wanted to draw attention to anomalies in the data. The researchers we contacted, who have no ties to the government agencies that produce the data Perino questioned, said that while the raw temperature readings are adjusted, the result is a record that more closely matches what has actually taken place. The greater mistake would be to take the raw data as somehow perfect and unblemished. The allegations raised by skeptics like the author of The Telegraph item have had no effect on the consensus that the Earth has seen an increase in temperatures over the past 100 years. This claim has been debunked before. To continue to repeat it moves it into the realm of the ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-07044	Georgia’s illegal immigration crackdown laws should be called the "Brown Codes" because of their similarity to the "Black Codes" governing blacks after the Civil War.	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/01/robert-brown/lawmaker-compares-immigration-law-black-codes/	Opponents of Georgia’s new immigration crackdown law are drawing ugly comparisons between it and infamous chapters of civil rights history. Some are comparing the effects of House Bill 87 to segregation, saying it will turn Hispanics into second-class citizens. Former state Senate Minority Leader Robert Brown, a Democrat who recently resigned to run for mayor of Macon, hearkened back to Reconstruction in a June 2 news release. "Georgia leaders should not attempt to satisfy Agribusiness interests by finding ways to selectively enforce what I am now calling the Brown Codes (HB 87), because of its similarity to the Black Codes passed in the 1800s," Brown said. Southern states passed the "Black Codes" after the Civil War to force freed slaves back to the plantations. Is Georgia’s HB 87 similar to them? PolitiFact has ruled on race-tinged analogies before. Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said that Republican support for requirements that voters show ID cards at the polls means they "want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws." False, we ruled. Although the law could disenfranchise a fraction of minority voters, it would not return the U.S. to Jim Crow. Closer to home, HB 87’s more controversial provisions give law enforcement officers more leeway to check the immigration status of people they think violated the law. They also prohibit citizens from harboring, transporting or encouraging illegal immigrants to come into the state under certain circumstances. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash granted a request for a preliminary injunction that keeps key parts of HB 87 from going into effect. We asked Brown to explain his "Brown Codes" remark. He said workers toil in punishing heat for "subminimum wages" in conditions amounting to "indentured servitude." (These claims are outside the scope of our inquiry.) HB 87 intensifies this inequality, Brown said. It allows Hispanics to be singled out for their ethnicity and scares workers from complaining about poor working conditions for fear of deportation. "Obviously, it’s not exactly the same [as the Black Codes]. It’s just as harsh, relative to the times. This is the 21st century," Brown said. We consulted a half-dozen historians to check Brown’s claim. The Black Codes are different from Jim Crow legislation, which segregated blacks and whites. Enacted in former slave states right after the Civil War, the Black Codes tried to force ex-slaves back to their masters. Unemployed blacks could be arrested as vagrants and hired out to people willing to pay their criminal fines. Blacks who quit their jobs could be arrested and returned to their old bosses, much like runaway slaves. Orphans or children whose parents could not support them could be apprenticed to a master. All the experts we interviewed found big holes in Brown’s analogy. The biggest was this one: The Black Codes aimed to keep freed slaves on their plantations. Georgia’s immigration law pressures illegal immigrants to leave the state. Many of the state’s farmers say illegal immigrants are fleeing in droves. This result appears to match HB 87’s apparent intent, which is "to create such a climate of hostility, fear, mistrust and insecurity that all illegal aliens will leave Georgia," Thrash ruled. There are other glaring differences between the Black Codes and Georgia’s law. Immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally to work are here by choice. Obviously, former slaves had no choice. Swarthmore College professor Richard M. Valelly, an expert on Reconstruction, noted that illegal immigrants aren’t in danger of being re-enslaved. They’re at risk of deportation. "That's draconian ... but there's a big difference between de facto re-enslavement ... and being sucked into a system that regulates movement across borders," Valelly said. Although scholars agree that the Black Codes and Georgia’s new immigration law are very different, each one we interviewed saw one similarity. The Black Codes stigmatized blacks. Georgia’s law stigmatizes illegal immigrants, Columbia University professor Eric Foner said. He is the author of "Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877," a well-regarded history of the era. "These laws will probably tend to further solidify an underclass who exist outside of the protection of the law," said Michael W. Fitzgerald, a history professor at St. Olaf College in Minnesota who has written about the Reconstruction. University of Georgia professor James C. Cobb, an expert on Southern history, was equally critical. He said HB 87, like the Black Codes, allows for discrimination. "Under the new immigration bill, people who are, in fact, citizens or eligible for certain legal protections are now subject to having their rights violated simply on the basis of their racial appearance," Cobb said. Still, we think Brown’s comparison between Georgia’s new immigration crackdown and the Black Codes is fatally flawed. The Black Codes forced freed slaves back to the fields of their masters. HB 87 chases illegal immigrants out of the state. Illegal immigrant workers come here by choice. Slaves were forced here. And the deportation illegal immigrants face is a far cry from the cruelty of re-enslavement. Both laws do single out groups for stigmatization, but that won’t improve Brown’s rating by much. The difference between the Black Codes and Georgia’s new immigration law is so vast it gives an inaccurate impression. We therefore rule Brown’s statement False.

pomt-07721	"For every $10,000 invested in business incubators, up to nearly 70 local jobs are generated."	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/03/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-touts-business-incubators-job-cr/	Business incubators, known as business "accelerators" in Europe, serve as homes and training grounds for new companies, providing them an affordable start-up environment and a variety of administrative, consulting and networking services. When President Obama came to Cleveland on Feb. 22 to talk about ways to help small businesses, Sen. Sherrod Brown used the opportunity to tout legislation he has written called the Business Incubation Promotion Act, which would help create more business incubators in hard-hit regions of the country. In an opinion piece he penned for The Plain Dealer, Brown said: "For every $10,000 invested in business incubators, up to nearly 70 local jobs are generated." An impressive success rate, we thought, and a potentially worthwhile investment -- if true. So we decided to put Brown’s claims through the Truth-O-Meter. Brown spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak directed us to an independent 2008 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration. In its report, titled "Construction Grants Program Impact Assessment Report," Grant Thornton LLP, an audit, tax and advisory organization based in Chicago, updated and improved on a 1997 EDA study performed by a team of Rutgers and Princeton university economists. The study concluded that "EDA's strategic focus on innovation and entrepreneurship makes sense, in that investments in business incubators generate significantly greater impacts in the communities in which they are made than do other project types." The majority of the literature we found on the subject supported the Grant Thornton study’s conclusions, and the field of business incubator press clippings are ripe with success stories. In 2000, for instance, The Los Angeles Business Journal reported that companies launched in incubators remained in business after five years 87 percent of the time, compared to only 20 percent of all new business start-ups reaching the five-year mark. The advantages of incubators includes shared operating costs, consulting and administrative assistance, improved access to capital, legitimacy in the community, and the support of fellow entrepreneurs, according to the Reference for Business, the Encyclopedia of Small Business. Conveniently, the National Business Incubation Association is headquartered in Athens, Ohio. Over the past year, Brown has trumpeted EDA grants of more than $12 million for Ohio start-up businesses and incubators, including JumpStart Inc. of Cleveland, Kent State University and the Community Improvement Corp. in Tuscarawas County, the city of Twinsburg, and the Barberton Community Development Corp. Such local support for business incubators is vital, based on the Grant Thornton study’s findings that about 84 percent of incubator graduates establish their businesses within 20 miles of the incubator facility. The study’s findings support Brown’s claims of "nearly 70 local jobs" generated per $10,000 EDA investment in business incubators. The exact range is 46.3 to 69.4 jobs per $10,000, which far out-distances jobs generated by other federal projects such as commercial structures (9.6 to 13.4 jobs generated), roads and other transportation (4.4 to 7.8), industrial park structures (5 to 7.3) and community infrastructure (1.5 to 3.4). The study concludes that money spent on business incubators appears to have the largest correlation with future economic growth.

pomt-06956	The $290 million structural surplus in the 2011-’13 Wisconsin budget is not real because it is based on the assumption that Congress will reinstate the estate tax.	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/17/donna-seidel/wisconsin-rep-donna-seidel-says-290-million-struct/	Wisconsin Republicans have made much of the fact that their 2011-’13 budget eliminates the state’s long-standing structural deficit. Indeed, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau says the budget would result in a surplus of $292 million. It’s the first time the fiscal bureau has determined that a budget would result in such a surplus since the agency began the calculations for the 1997-’99 budget. Republican Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers argued that previous administrations used one-time fixes, such as tapping special funds and the state’s settlement in lawsuits against tobacco companies, to balance the budget. Now, Democrats say the Republicans are making a big assumption -- that their counterparts in Washington will allow a tax increase -- to make the budget picture look better than it really is. And therefore, that the claim of the structural surplus is bogus. At issue is how the fiscal bureau handled one piece of its projection: The future reinstatement of the federal estate tax, which -- based on a formula -- brings some additional money to state coffers. Under current law, the estate tax is to kick in again in 2013. If that happens, the fiscal bureau estimates it would mean $219 million more for the state over the course of the two-year budget. Assistant Minority Leader Donna Seidel, D-Wausau, argues the "$219 million is contingent on Congress reinstating the estate tax, which clearly is a top platform point for the Republicans and is not going to happen." "So clearly that’s another piece of misinformation," Seidel told the Journal Sentinel editorial board July 5, 2011, arguing the structural surplus is closer to $75 million. We’ve tackled several recent statements on the structural deficit. The first thing to remember is this: The two-year budget itself -- by law -- must be balanced when passed. The structural deficit measures the future imbalance between spending and tax revenue as laid out in state law. So you can have a balanced budget, but one built upon assumptions that are projected to result in a deficit later on. That’s part of what happened in the past, leading to structural deficits reaching as high as $2.8 billion for the 2003-’05 budget. We rated a statement by Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, that the budget eliminated the structural deficit for the "first time in decades" as Mostly True. A statement on national TV by Walker that the worst structural deficit was two years ago was False. The Fiscal Bureau bases its estimate on factors including expected costs (the spending side), projections of how much the state will collect in sales and income taxes (the revenue side) and other sources of money. In this case, that includes what federal law says about the estate tax. It’s true that Republicans will push to keep the tax cuts in place -- they already won one extension of the Bush-era tax cuts under President Barack Obama in December of 2010. But Seidel argues it was wrong to include the return of them in the Fiscal Bureau’s calculation. Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, who was with Seidel during the Journal Sentinel visit, agreed with the argument that the surplus isn’t real. "There is no surplus," he said. Indeed, as Seidel criticizes the inclusion as an assumption improperly made by the bureau, she is making her own assumption: That the extension of the tax cuts will continue. How does the process work? As a rule, the fiscal bureau does its calculations based on current law, according to Rob Reinhardt, a program supervisor with the agency. The report on the structural surplus did note the assumption as a footnote. Indeed, a similar estate tax assumption was used when the fiscal bureau calculated the structural deficit for the 2009-’11 budget prepared by Democrat Gov. Jim Doyle. The bureau’s analysis put that budget’s structural deficit at $2.511 billion. Applying Seidel’s logic to that budget, estate tax revenue should have been subtracted -- and the deficit would have been even larger. Indeed, even if the federal estate tax return was removed from the state’s 2011-’13 budget, there still would be a surplus, just a smaller one. Seidel noted this herself. So where does this leave us? As the GOP touts passage of a budget that doesn’t include a structural deficit, Seidel claims the number is bogus because it is puffed up by $219 million -- based on current law that calls for the estate tax to go back into effect in 2010. But the Legislative Fiscal Bureau calculated the budget the way it always has. They even footnoted the issue for clarity. The bureau’s calculations are a picture in time -- where the budget stands today. With her own assumption, Seidel wants to jump to the future to undermine the nonpartisan calculation. We rate Seidel’s claim False.	None	Donna Seidel	None	None	None	2011-07-17T09:00:00	2011-07-05	['United_States_Congress', 'Wisconsin']
pomt-04479	On sequestration	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/08/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-he-never-backed-sequestration/	During a recent debate for the 7th District House seat, Democrat challenger Wayne Powell accused Republican Rep. Eric Cantor of flip-flopping on $1 trillion in automatic federal spending cuts that are slated to begin on Jan. 2. Powell noted Cantor voted for a bill in August 2011 that set up the possibility of the cuts, which would be split evenly between defense and social program over nine years. The reductions -- called sequestration -- would kick in if Congress and the White House failed to agree on a debt-reduction deal. Powell noted Cantor has been distancing himself from the sequester now that it is nearing and denouncing the automatic military cuts as harmful to the nation’s security. "For you to stand here and say you did not vote for the sequester when you voted for the sequester. This is not magical thinking. This is reality," Powell told Cantor during the debate. "You supported it, and now you don’t." The House majority leader replied, "Mr. Powell keeps saying that I support the sequester. As he knows good and well, that’s not true." Has Cantor changed his position on the sequester? We decided to submit the question to our Flip-O-Meter. We’ll start with a trip back to the summer of 2011. Debate over raising the U.S. debt ceiling dominated headlines with the approach of an August 2 deadline when the U.S. would start defaulting on payments if it could not borrow more money. Republicans, led in part by Cantor, insisted on tying an increase in the borrowing cap to passage of a debt reduction plan. Negotiations between Congress and the White House stalemated, with Republicans demanding that all of the debt reductions come from spending cuts and Democrats insisting that a portion come from tax increases. Cantor supported a last-second compromise passed the House by a 269-161 vote on August 1 and, a day later, cleared the Senate on a 74-26 vote. It took a two-step approach to lowering debt. The first part called for an initial $900 billion in deficit reductions over 10 years through a mix of national security and domestic spending cuts. The second part created a bipartisan congressional super committee assigned to come up with an additional $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions over nine years through spending cuts, tax revenues or both. If the panel deadlocked, $1 trillion in automatic cuts would be triggered at the start of 2013. Cantor, in a statement released after House vote, gave a qualified endorsement of the debt-limit deal with no specific mention of the sequester. "Tonight, the House prevented default and boosted economic certainty by ensuring America pays its bills while we start getting our fiscal house in order," he said. "This measure is not perfect or the way we would have done it if we were in charge, but it will finally begin to change the way Washington spends tax dollars.... This is the first significant move -- of many to come -- to turn Washington around." But the partisan debate over whether increased taxes should be part of the debt-reduction plan did not end, and super committee deadlocked. Cantor, during a Nov. 14 news conference, was repeatedly asked if he was bound to allowing the automatic cuts to occur. "I’m not going to comment," he said. "I don’t think the sequester will be applicable because I believe they will reach an agreement by the deadline." On Nov. 21, the super committee announced it failed meet its deadline for reaching an agreement, triggering the sequester. This year, on May 10, Cantor and other House Republicans passed a debt reduction plan that held the line on taxes. It offered deep reductions to domestic programs that would replace across-the-board in sequester for a year. The measure died in the Democrat-controlled Senate. During a June 6 news conference, Cantor said "we’re not going to allow tax rates to go up on anyone." He said he and other Republicans were willing to broaden the tax base by eliminating some income tax deductions, although he did not specify which ones. On July 18, Cantor denounced the sequestration. "These cuts will harm important domestic priorities such as education, medical research and law enforcement," he said in a written statement. "And perhaps most notably, these cuts threaten our national security and jobs...including (those of) over 100,000 Virginians who make their living in our military, or by ensuring that our men and women in uniform have the very best equipment and support available." On Sept. 11, Cantor told the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce that he supported the 2011 debt deal to "stave off any other kind of calamity." Of the sequester, he said, "It was never intended to be something that went into effect," according to an article in The Free Lance-Star. On Sept. 20, Cantor told Fox News: "This president has failed to put a solution on the table that would avoid these defense cuts. The House has taken action to say we don’t want these defense cuts, we want to act in a fiscally responsible way and make sure we are beginning to slim down federal spending, but don’t do so in a way that disproportionately impacts our defense-related jobs." Our rating Congress was faced with a stark choice in August 2011: Either agree to a deal that could trigger the sequester or place the nation in default. Cantor chose the deal. As we have written before, it is possible to have voted for the compromise out of a desire to keep Washington solvent and hope that the automatic cuts never occur. We couldn’t find any record Cantor saying he supported having the sequester. But the majority leader helped set the clock ticking on the cuts by voting for a measure that included their possibility. And he’s maintained a hard line against the compromise Democrats say is necessary to avoid the sequester: mixing in some tax increases with spending cuts to reduce deficits. Cantor is now distancing himself from a situation he helped create. We rate that a Full Flop.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2012-10-08T06:00:00	2012-10-01	['None']
pomt-08148	"Barack Obama's health care bill is nothing new. Mitt Romney signed one just like it four years before."	/texas/statements/2010/dec/05/howard-dean/dean-howard-says-health-care-bill-prseident-barack/	During a wide-ranging interview at Austin's KLRU last month, Texas Tribune editor Evan Smith talked health care with Howard Dean, a physician and the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "Barack Obama's health care bill is nothing new," Dean said during the Nov. 12 interview. "Mitt Romney signed one just like it four years before." That's a view Dean, the former governor of Vermont, shares with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, though their opinions of said plans diverge. Speaking at the Heritage Foundation Nov. 8, Perry said: "The health care plan out of Massachusetts, I would suggest to you, is too much like the health care plan passed out of Washington." We wondered whether Dean correctly compared the 2010 federal overhaul to Massachusetts' 2006 health care law. Karen Finney, a Dean spokeswoman, shared two news articles to support his statement. According to an April 1 story posted on Talking Points Memo, during an appearance at Emory University in March, "Romney acknowledged that there are 'a number of similarities'" between the Massachusetts health care plan and the legislation Obama signed into law March 23. "If you lose a job or change a job, you won't lose your insurance," the Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted Romney saying. "Everybody is able to keep insurance throughout their life. It's not taken away from them... you can't be canceled if you have a pre-existing condition or if you become ill once you're insured. So in that respect, it's very similar." According to a March 31 Christian Science-Monitor news story, Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who advised Obama and Romney on health-insurance programs, told the Boston Globe that Romney "is in many ways the intellectual father of national reform." The plan Romney signed included an expansion of the state's Medicaid program to children in households whose incomes are less than or equal to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The plan also subsidized coverage for eligible residents and created an exchange system, a state-overseen marketplace enabling individuals and small businesses to purchase health coverage. Also, the plan requires most adults to have coverage at the risk of facing penalties for not complying. The 2010 federal law has similar features. It likewise expands Medicaid (to all individuals whose incomes are less than or equal to 133 percent of the federal poverty level), and makes government subsidies available to low-income individuals and families to help them pay health insurance premiums. The federal law also creates voluntary exchanges that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase health insurance. And it requires most folks to purchase coverage, though the plans' penalty structures differ. In February, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True economist Paul Krugman's charge that the health care bill that passed the Senate "is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan — the same thing." Except for some modifications made by the House (such as implementation dates and how the plan is funded), the legislation that Obama signed into law was basically the bill that passed the Senate. Other similarities between the federal law and the Massachusetts plan: -In Massachusetts, companies with more than 10 employees must offer health insurance or pay a penalty. The federal approach imposes the requirement on companies with 50 employees or more. -Both plans restructure the insurance market. In Massachusetts, the reform law merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan and the market serving smaller employers). The federal law placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. -In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan. The federal law allows dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the federal law creates a similar type of plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage. -Both plans put limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums, but in different ways. For the most part in Massachusetts, the highest premiums can only cost twice as much as the lowest premiums. The federal plan allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchanges to vary based on age, geographic area, family composition and tobacco use. And the differences? Financing and cost containment. The Massachusetts plan has been criticized for its lack of cost-containment provisions, while the federal law makes changes to Medicare, health insurance that the government offers to senior citizens, that are intended to lower program costs. (Being that Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address it.) Both plans are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the federal plan taps cost savings from levying new taxes on, for example, high-cost health care plans. Upshot: the federal law is similar to the Massachusetts law, but not an exact copy. We rate Dean's statement as Mostly True.

pomt-03684	The Boston Marathon bombing "is the fifth case" in which U.S. government officials examined individuals potentially involved in terrorism "and felt they were no threat and they went on to carry out terrorist murders."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/23/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-alleged-boston-bombers-are-fif/	Several days after the capture of Dzokhar Tsarnaev, one of two brothers suspected in the Boston Marathon bombing, U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., cited a pattern in which the U.S. government looks into suspicious individuals who later are charged with terrorist acts. According to media reports, the FBI has acknowledged interviewing Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- Dzokhar’s older brother, who died while fleeing the police -- at the request of Russian officials in 2011. "After looking at his phone records, websites he visited and associates, the FBI found he had no ties to terror," ABC News reported. (We should note for the record that Dzokhar Tsarnaev has yet to face trial in the bombing case, so a court has not yet ruled on his guilt or innocence.) In an April 22, 2013, interview on MSNBC, King -- a senior Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee and the House Intelligence Committee -- said that pattern sounded familiar. The Boston Marathon bombing "is the fifth case I'm aware of where a person was brought to the attention of the FBI. ... The FBI examined them and felt they were no threat and they went on to carry out terrorist murders." We checked with King’s office, and a spokesman confirmed the four previous examples he was referring to: Anwar al-Awlaki, David Headley, Abdulhakim Muhammed and Nidal Hasan. Here’s a summary of their cases. • Anwar al-Awlaki. Al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born citizen of Yemeni descent, was hunted by the U.S. and killed in a drone strike in September 2011. He was reportedly a key adviser, and even an instigator, in several terrorist incidents involving U.S. targets, including the 2009 killing of 13 and wounding of more than 30 by a shooter at Fort Hood, Texas; the 2009 plot to explode a plane in Detroit using an "underwear" bomb; and the foiled attempt to plant a bomb in New York City’s Times Square in 2010. By the time of his death, Al-Awlaki "had been under the scrutiny of American officials for more than a decade," the New York Times reported. "He first came under FBI investigation in 1999 because of associations with militants and was questioned after the 2001 terrorist attacks about his contacts with three of the hijackers at his mosques in San Diego and Virginia." • David Headley. Headley, a Pakistani-American born as Daood Gilani, is serving a 35-year sentence for helping organize scouting missions for a 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India, that left 160 dead. In the late 1990s, Headley had served as a confidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency and was sent on one mission to Lahore, Pakistan, in which he infiltrated heroin trafficking networks. But later, his actions raised questions among friends and acquaintances. "A former girlfriend of Headley’s told a bartender named Terry O’Donnell that he wanted to go to Pakistan to fight alongside Islamic militants," ProPublica reported, adding that O’Donnell subsequently contacted an FBI-led task force that was investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. On Oct. 4, 2001, "two Defense Department agents working for the task force questioned him in front of his DEA handlers at the drug agency’s office." • Abdulhakim Muhammed. Muhammed, a convert to Islam who was born Carlos Bledsoe, pled guilty to killing Pvt. William Long and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula outside a U.S. Army recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark., in 2009. He is now serving life in prison. Muhammed had been under investigation by the FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force. "The investigation was in its preliminary stages, authorities said, and was based on the suspect's travel to Yemen and his arrest there for using a Somali passport," ABC News reported. ABC also reported that his "travel within the United States had also come under scrutiny by the Terrorist Task Force, including travel to Columbus, Ohio – an area of domestic concern for authorities who have observed a number of Somali Americans traveling from there to Somali to wage jihad." • Nidal Hasan. Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect in the Fort Hood shootings and is awaiting a military trial that could bring the death penalty. Prior to the shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and al-Awlaki. They were "passed along to two Joint Terrorism Task Force cells led by the FBI, but a senior defense official said no one at the Defense Department knew about the messages until after the shootings," the Associated Press reported. The FBI and military officials offered divergent reasons for the failure to pass along the messages. "FBI officials have said a military investigator on the task force saw the emails and looked up Hasan's record, but finding nothing particularly worrisome, the investigator neither sought nor got permission to pass the emails on to other military officials," the AP reported. A senior defense official countered that "the rules of the task force prevented that military representative from passing the records on without approval from other members of the task force." One additional case shares some aspects of the pattern King laid out -- that of Umar Farook Abdulmutallab, the "underwear bomber." But since his plot was foiled and he did not go on to "carry out terrorist murders," his case doesn’t make King’s list. (In Abdulmutallab’s case, the National Security Agency had intercepted a discussion in Yemen that referenced the plot, but analysts did not link these intercepts with a separate piece of information, that Adbulmutallab’s father "visited the United States Embassy in Nigeria to express concerns about his son’s radicalization," according to the New York Times.) We asked Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert who is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, for his thoughts on King’s list. He agreed that Hasan’s case qualified as a good example of government officials determining (misguidedly, as it turned out) that an individual was "no threat." He added that he thought Al-Awlaki and Muhammed fit the pattern to a significant degree, but not entirely. In their cases, while the U.S. government did not immediately step in to arrest either man, it’s not clear that the U.S. government went so far as to determine that they were "no threat," Gartenstein-Ross said. The weakest example, Gartenstein-Ross said, is Headley, whose case is murky for several reasons, including his role as a U.S. government informant. Seven years elapsed between his interview in 2001 and the Mumbai attack in 2008 -- a long enough time to raise questions about whether he was sufficiently radicalized to have given government officials reason to believe he was on a path to terrorism. Our ruling King said the Boston Marathon bombing "is the fifth case" in which U.S. government officials examined individuals potentially involved in terrorism "and felt they were no threat and they went on to carry out terrorist murders." It’s clear that there are at least four prior instances -- Anwar al-Awlaki, David Headley, Abdulhakim Muhammed and Nidal Hasan -- that fit the pattern of someone being on the government’s radar screen and later allegedly committing terrorist acts. But in at least one of these cases, and to a lesser extent two others, it’s not clear that the government determined that the individuals "were no threat" based on the initial round of scrutiny. On balance, we rate King’s statement Mostly True.	None	Peter King	None	None	None	2013-04-23T10:49:03	2013-04-22	['United_States', 'Boston_Marathon']
pomt-13520	Democrats "are cutting our school funding. Four times in the last 10 years before we came into office."	/illinois/statements/2016/sep/01/bruce-rauner/bruce-rauner-resurrects-school-funding-cut-charge-/	In August 2014, as the race between former Gov. Pat Quinn and Bruce Rauner hit full throttle, no issue was more hotly contested than Rauner’s charge that Quinn had reduced spending on K-12 education as state finances spiraled ever-downward under his leadership. Specifically, the Rauner campaign cited Illinois State Board of Education data that showed school funding going from $7.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2009 to $6.8 billion in FY 2015. Rauner said that amounted to a $600 million reduction. Quinn, however, said his administration actually increased state-level funding during that time by $442 million. Whether school funding increased or decreased from FY 2009 to FY 2015 depended on whether you counted $1.8 billion in federal economic stimulus money in your calculation. Rauner did, Quinn didn’t. The issue never was settled, and seemed to disappear after Rauner defeated Quinn in the 2014 election. Then came Governor’s Day at the Illinois State Fair on Aug. 17. Rauner is not up for election this year, but his legislative agenda is. His campaign fund in recent weeks has given $10 million to the Illinois Republican Party to support GOP candidates who are running against what Rauner describes as a "corrupt machine" run by Democrats. Throughout the summer, Rauner has revived some of the themes that were a big part of his own, successful campaign two years ago. As he rallied the Republican faithful at the fairgrounds for the final charge to Election Day, Rauner reached back into his 2014 campaign quiver for another shot at Democrats’ stewardship of school funding in Illinois. "They are strangling our state. They are driving jobs away. They are raising your taxes to the highest property taxes in America. They are building massive government bureaucracy everywhere, crushing our economy," Rauner told an enthusiastic crowd. "They are cutting our school funding. Four times in the last 10 years before we came into office." So here we are again, almost exactly two years from when this debate first erupted, only this time the argument is expanded to include all Illinois Democrats and narrowed to "four times" that they cut school funding. We decided to dig back in and find out if it’s true. Stimulus stigma Rauner’s office provided us with figures from the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget from FY 2000 to FY 2015 (the last year in which Illinois had a state budget) to illustrate the trend, and said the years referred to in the speech were FY 2010-FY 2013. During those years, elementary and secondary education funding went from $7.32 billion to $6.55 billion. Clearly there’s a decline in school funding over that period. But was it the result of "cutting," as Rauner claims, or because federal stimulus money ended? The Civic Federation, the respected government fiscal watchdog organization, took on the question through its Institute for Illinois’ Fiscal Sustainability in a report in October 2014: "General Funds spending on education in FY2010 is shown in budget documents as $7.3 billion. But that number includes $790.8 million in federal stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Some analysts might deduct that amount to maximize comparability, which would reduce the General Funds figure for FY2010 to $6.5 billion. Based on that calculation, General Funds spending on education increases by $358 million to $6.8 billion in FY2015. Similarly, budget documents in FY2009 show education spending at $7.4 billion, but that amount includes $1.0 billion of stimulus funding. Deducting that amount results in General Funds spending of $6.3 billion in FY2009 and an increase of $522 million to $6.8 billion in FY2015." The Civic Federation’s analysis is impartial and it offers no opinion on which version -- including stimulus funding or excluding it -- is preferred. Thus it scrupulously avoids making a "cut or no cut" judgment. But it affirms the credibility of assessing state-level school funding in the post-recession years without the emergency federal money, which was designed to offset the Great Recession’s economic downturn for school budgets. By that measure, the FY2010-FY2013 span we’re examining would see school funding go from $6.541 billion in 2010 to $6.55 billion in 2013. Not robust growth, but not the precipitous $772 million decline shown when the federal money from 2010 is included. There’s also a piece of evidence that both supports Quinn’s claim in 2014 that he increased school funding and bolsters Rauner’s argument about overall mismanagement of the state budget by Quinn as governor and, today, by the Democrats who control the General Assembly. Midway through FY 2011, Quinn and the Democratic majority passed a controversial, four-year income tax increase that raised the personal income tax from 3 to 5 percent and the corporate tax rate from 4.8 to 7 percent. The increase was intended to pay down the state’s $6.5 billion in unpaid bills and prevent cuts to core services, including education. "The governor led that fight to raise revenue in 2011 and allowed us to avoid radical cuts to education," Quinn campaign spokeswoman Brooke Anderson told the Associated Press in October 2014 as debate raged over whether Quinn had cut or increased education funding. Debate over that tax increase was a major component of the 2014 gubernatorial campaign. To Rauner, it was yet another dagger to the heart of Illinois’ struggling economy, and a symptom of a Democratic party bereft of ideas to get Illinois back on track. To Quinn, it was a necessary if unpopular move to, among other things, preserve school funding. Two former state budget directors we contacted -- Steve Schnorf, who was Gov. George Ryan’s budget director from 1997-2002, and Joan Walters, who worked under Gov. Jim Edgar from 1991 to 1997 -- declined an invitation to weigh in on the main question here. But both said an important clue in making a ruling would come from examining how the stimulus money was used. If used to replace state funding missing due to the bad economy, as it was intended, then its loss should not be interpreted as a cut. If the state used it to fund programs or projects that would prove unsustainable when the money went away, Rauner’s assessment would be accurate. But improper use of the funding never was at issue. Rauner’s statements during the campaign two years ago and again this year dealt strictly with the numbers. Our ruling Rauner said of Democrats, "They are cutting our school funding. Four times in the last 10 years before we came into office." Rauner’s office said the years referred to in the speech were FY 2010-2013. While school funding did decline in fiscal years 2010-2013, it’s inaccurate to say it happened because of "cutting." In fact, as noted by the Civic Federation and in state budgets from the years in question, state-level funding -- which is controlled by the General Assembly and the governor -- increased slightly during those four years. Expand the years to FY 2009-2015 and the increase in state funding came to $522 million. Quinn’s record tax increase of 2011 is perhaps the greatest piece of evidence in support of Quinn’s aversion to cutting and in support of his claim that he boosted school funding. Illinois for two years has been a philosophical battleground in which Republicans, led by Rauner, have argued that Illinois’ abysmal unemployment rate is the product of 12 years of Democratic control of state government. Much of their argument has involved Democratic policies that they believe have made Illinois an unfriendly state for business. But in claiming that Democrats cut school spending in the final years of their hold on the governor’s office, Rauner resurrects an allegation that should have stayed buried after he won the election. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4fc284a6-23fd-49e2-9b9a-639afcdc6723	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2016-09-01T16:14:31	2016-08-17	['None']
pomt-04274	Gubernatorial candidate Maggie Hassan supported 33 tax and fee increases as Senate Majority Leader.	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/nov/03/republican-governors-association/democrat-maggie-hassan-votes-tax-increases-targete/	With the election now days away, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ovide Lamontagne has been busy trying to paint challenger Maggie Hassan as a serial tax-and-spender. This month, he found some help from the Republican Governors Association, which joined the fight for New Hampshire’s corner office by airing a series of ads that highlight Hassan’s spending history during her time in the Senate. "After pushing 33 tax and fee increases as Majority Leader, (Maggie Hassan) was voted out of office," a narrator charges in the ad, "Hiding," released this month on New Hampshire airwaves. "She likes high taxes for us," the ad concludes. "New Hampshire doesn’t." Throughout the campaign, Lamontagne has cited a higher number. In daily emails to the press, he accuses Hassan of supporting "nearly 100 taxes and fees to help pay for her massive 24 percent increase in state spending.". Last month, we looked into the 24 percent claim, ruling it Half True. So, we decided this time to look into the taxes and fees. Lamontagne campaign officials declined to release their list of nearly 100 increases, which covered Hassan’s three two-year terms in office. Instead we looked at the governors association figure, which targeted her two years as Senate Majority Leader. We approached the association, which pointed us to the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy in Concord, N.H. In July 2009, the Bartlett Center, a conservative-leaning think tank, released an analysis of the state’s 2010-11 biennium budget. Hassan served as Senate Majority Leader at the time, during which the effects of the recession set in around New Hampshire. And, under her guidance, the Senate approved the $11.5 billion spending bill in June 2009, sending it on to the governor’s desk. According to the Bartlett Center analysis, the budget, which went into effect July 1, 2009, included 35 new or increased taxes and fees, projecting to raise state revenues by about $306.4 million over the two-year budget. Bartlett Center researchers didn’t develop the numbers themselves, but instead based them on research from the Office of the Legislative Budget Assistant, Arlinghaus said this week. The nonpartisan budget assistant, charged with aiding the Legislature in its budget process, tracked the numbers in its review of the 2010-11 spending plan, and though the state numbers differ slightly from Bartlett Center, they remain in the ballpark. In its assessment, the budget assistant reported that the 2010-11 spending plan, supported by Hassan both in its initial form and in the final version, included 33 total tax and fee hikes, the same number cited by the governor’s association ad. But it also contained some big cuts, which the ad neglects to mention. At the time the 2010-2011 budget was being written, Hassan and other legislators were warned state revenues were going to come in at 2005-2006 levels, leaving a gaping financial hole that needed to be covered through a blend of cuts and tax increases. The cuts contained in the budget included millions in reductions to state aid to communities, a freeze on out-of-state travel, a freeze on equipment purchases, and the elimination of 1,000 jobs-- 200 of which were occupied, among others. On top of the loss in revenue, there was also an increase in expenses facing the state as more people sought government assistance. Budget writers also looked to tax and fee increases, some of which were sizeable. For example, the increase to the state rooms and meals tax was projected to raise $62.4 million for the state over the two years, and the increase to the tobacco tax projected to add $59.2 million. Meanwhile, other increases were much less impactful. An increase to the driving records fees projected to add about $240,000, and an increase to the license fees for pilots, engineers and captains, among others, projected about $8,500. Even Arlinghaus acknowledged in the Bartlett Center report, "Using just the number of increases is an imperfect measure." Supporters of the 2010-11 budget applauded it for keeping state spending in line in the face of the struggling economy. But, as the recession continued to hit and state revenues came in lower than projected, legislators re-opened the spending plan to find further savings. Over the coming months, legislators voted twice to amend the budget, reducing government spending by a total of $233 million. The budget adjustments included several increased taxes. They amended the tobacco tax to include smokeless tobacco products, and they increased the marriage license fee, as well as the charge for selling animals and birds, which were projected to raise about $3 million between the three, according to Jeffry Pattison, the state budget assistant. But, they also voted to close a state prison and cut other state programs on the way to the $233 million savings, Hassan campaign manager Matt Burgess wrote in an email to PolitiFact NH. PolitiFact noted previously that although total state spending increased about 20 percent during Hassan’s time in office, the funds spent from taxes and fees, which legislators have the most control over, actually went down slightly. Our ruling As the lead Democrat in the Senate, Hassan voted twice in 2009 in favor of the 2010-11 budget -- a spending plan shown by the nonpartisan budget assistant to include 33 tax and fee hikes, as claimed in the governors association ad. The statement is numerically accurate, but it ignores all of the major cuts Hassan and other Democrats made to the budget, like eliminating state jobs and reducing state aid to communities. The state was facing a huge hole in its budget due to the sputtering economy, which simultaneously lowered revenues and increased the need for expenditures. On top of that, the ad fails to acknowledge that Democrats reopened the budget and further reduced government spending by $233 million. And to say Hassan "likes high taxes" is a gross oversimplification that ignores the financial realities facing the state at the time. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13411	Says Mike Gallagher’s plan "would cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/23/tom-nelson/us-house-race-republican-accused-backing-cuts-two-/	According to one conservative columnist, the race for an open seat in a competitive congressional district in central Wisconsin could be telling. If Republican Mike Gallagher defeats Democrat Tom Nelson, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Christian Schneider says, "it would be a signal that traditional Republicans might be able to insulate themselves from Donald Trump's record-level unpopularity. But if things head south for Republicans, even their record-high majority in the House of Representatives could be in jeopardy." Gallagher, a former U.S. Marine, and Nelson, the Outagamie County executive, are running in the Nov. 8, 2016 election to succeed Republican Reid Ribble, who decided not to run for a fourth term. On Sept. 1, 2016, Nelson hit Gallagher with a TV ad with a popular line of attack: Social Security. After images of senior citizens appear on the screen, the narrator declares: "Mike Gallagher’s plan would cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors." So, has Gallager proposed a plan that would make those cuts? Not exactly. The Biggs plan When the claim is made in the ad, a notation on the screen refers to a Nov. 4, 2015 article in the conservative National Review. In a news release announcing the ad, the Nelson campaign said the reference was to an article on Social Security by Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Biggs proposed changes in benefits, saying: Beginning immediately, Social Security would pay every long-term U.S. resident a minimum benefit pegged at the poverty threshold of $950 a month, regardless of the retiree’s work history or earnings. This minimum benefit would take the place of both the redistributive aspects of Social Security and the Supplemental Security Income program, but do so with greater protections against poverty and no prohibition on work and saving. In fact, the Social Security payroll tax would be eliminated at age 62 to encourage longer work lives. But over several decades, the maximum Social Security benefit would be scaled down so that eventually every retiree will receive the same flat dollar benefit from the government. For the bottom third of retirees, benefits would increase, but for middle and upper income Americans, benefits would decline relative to currently promised levels. This makes sense. At any given time, higher-income Americans are less dependent upon government than lower-income households. As incomes rise over time, Americans should gradually become less dependent on the government for income in retirement and more able to build their own savings. So, under Biggs’ proposal, Social Security benefits would decline for the two-thirds of recipients who have higher incomes, though it’s important to note the changes would take place over several decades. Is the Biggs plan Gallagher’s plan? To back the second part of Nelson’s claim, campaign aides cited an answer Gallagher gave to a question about Social Security on the campaign trail on July 9, 2016. Gallagher said he would favor changes such as means testing for people earning above $250,000 and gradually raising the retirement age. Then he added that on Social Security he is "most influenced" by Biggs, saying: And he talks about a two-part payment structure where you simplify the program. One would be like a thrift savings plan where your employer matches your contributions and it's what people who work for the federal government get to have access to, but the rest of us don't. And the other would be a flat universal payment to everyone at the poverty line to bring the program back to its original limits. But the bad part about all of this is that it's going to be up to people like you and I, 34-year-olds and below, to do that and to bear the brunt of it. But my argument is that nobody expects it to be there, so I'd rather have a program that's there and more efficient and effective, even if my benefits are slightly reduced by the time I can actually collect Social Security. That’s support for Biggs’ approach to Social Security, but it’s short of Gallagher proposing a plan to change Social Security that explicitly cuts benefits for two-thirds of the beneficiaries. Our rating Nelson said: "Mike Gallagher’s plan would cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors." Gallagher has not made a proposal on Social Security that would cut the benefits of two-thirds of the recipients. However, he has praised a proposal that would make those cuts, saying he is most influenced on Social Security by the proposal’s author.

pomt-10432	"Clinton's former pastor convicted of child molestation."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/14/blog-posting/oops-wrong-clinton/	A month ago, the editors of the Utica (N.Y.) Observer-Dispatch saw a sudden spike in Web readership for stories about the Rev. William Procanick, pastor of a local church who had been convicted of sexually abusing a child. A story about Procanick was the upstate New York newspaper's No. 1 story in April, with 10 times the readership of the second-highest story. The paper's editors wouldn't expect such a story to generate so much interest, but Procanick's church was in a little-known town with a well-known name: Clinton. In headlines and stories, Procanick was identified simply as "Clinton pastor." For some supporters of Barack Obama, including one who posted an item on an official Obama campaign blog, that was an easy recipe for outrage. After seeing their candidate battered over his connection with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the phrase "Clinton pastor" was all they needed to conclude that Bill and Hillary Clinton's pastor was a convicted sex offender. Never mind that Bill and Hillary don't attend Procanick's church, which is 225 miles from their home in Chappaqua, N.Y. And never mind that the Observer-Dispatch's stories never suggested any connection between the Clinton pastor and the political Clintons. In the lightning-fast world of the blogosphere, emotions often outrun the facts. "Okay, so now that Bill and Hillary Clinton's pastor has been convicted of child molestation, will we see the same furor directed at Hillary that Obama has had to endure these last few weeks? I don't think so!!!!" said a chain e-mail that was sent to PolitiFact and pasted on blogs. Similar postings have appeared a blog called "Black Love is Alive," in a comment on the National Journal blog "Hotline on Call," and even on a motorcycle blog called "The Sportbike Network," under the headline "Billary's preacher is now a convicted pedophile." On My.BarackObama.com, the Obama campaign's official blog, Shemora Singletary of Columbus, Ohio, posted an item April 25, 2008, that was headlined "Clinton's former pastor convicted of child molestation." Singletary, a volunteer blogger on the site with the nickname "Knowledge Seeker," groused that the media hasn't paid enough attention to the episode involving the Clinton pastor. "Will this story get the press that Rev. Wright is getting?? And will the Clinton's have to answer for the character of this man??" she wrote. She posted an article from the Utica paper and this postscript: "Now that Obama's lynching has gone off as planned, think the MSM (mainstream media) will run this story about Clinton's former pastor? Or would that upset the planned election of either Israeli-firster Hillary vs. Israeli-firster McCain?" Singletary's posting drew two comments that said she was wrong. She acknowledged one of those comments but did nothing to correct or retract the inaccurate posting. Singletary could not be reached for comment. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said that the posting was not authorized by the campaign and that it was removed Wednesday morning after PolitiFact inquired about it. But it had been on the Obama site for nearly three weeks. "This is one of more than 800,000 user-generated pages. It's like a comment on your blog," Vietor said. "And it's been taken down." The posting was on a campaign blog created by volunteers who support Obama, but it's not always clear where an official Web site ends and the blog begins. The Obama blog has the same logo, candidate photo and quotation ("I'm asking you to believe . . .") as the regular campaign site. The only thing to distinguish it from the rest of the site is a headline that says "Community Blogs." It has no disclaimer to indicate the messages may not be authorized by the campaign. To the contrary, at the bottom of the page it says "PAID FOR BY OBAMA FOR AMERICA." (Since the campaign removed the page, we have preserved the original posting here. ) Academic experts who study politics on the Internet say having the message about the Clinton pastor on the Obama site gives it extra credibility. "You assume that those things are representing statements the campaign believes are true," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a new book on presidential rhetoric called Presidents Creating the Presidency. Julie Germany, Director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy and the Internet, said sophisticated Web users might understand the distinctions between a campaign site and its blog, but many readers don't. "To somebody who doesn't know the blogosophere very well, (having it on an Obama site) could actually validate what the post is saying," she said. The experts said campaigns need to police their sites more carefully. Jamieson said the campaigns should be "vigilantly policing their own blogs – or making them freestanding blogs unassociated with the campaign – so the campaign isn't perceived to be attaching its credibility to the information." Vietor, the Obama spokesman, said the Obama blog is so large that the campaign must rely on the "community" – the people who post on the blog – to do the policing. "Users help police the page," Vietor said. "Obviously we can't monitor all 800,000 pages in real time. So users help us flag and take down inappropriate content." Apart from the policing issues, the tale about the Clinton pastor shows that some bloggers don't spend a lot of time on research. Indeed, it doesn't take much Internet searching to find that there's no connection with the political Clinton, a fact that the Obama campaign was quick to acknowledge. Mike Kilian, managing editor of the Observer-Dispatch, said he was amazed that so many people could have such a big misunderstanding with so few facts. He said, "Any fourth grader could read those stories and know there is nothing to do with Bill or Hillary." As for the claim by the bloggers and the chain e-mails, we find it isn't just false. It's Pants-on-Fire wrong.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2008-05-14T00:00:00	2008-04-25	['Bill_Clinton']

That might have something to do with a longtime claim that’s again making the rounds on social media. "Did you know?" says a Sept. 10 Facebook post showing photographs of three statues. "If a statue of a person in the park on a horse has both front legs in the air, the person died in battle. If the horse has one front leg in the air, the person died as a result of wounds received in battle. If the horse has a (sic) all four legs on the ground, the person died of natural causes." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post has been shared more than 89,000 times as of Oct. 25. The original poster attributed the information to A-Z Facts, but a web search for that source only turned up websites for children with facts about animals and the state of Arizona. The first of the three images used in the Facebook post appears to be of the Bronze Horseman, a monument in St. Petersburg, Russia, to Peter the Great. The horse has its front legs in the air but Peter the Great died of gangrene, not in battle. The second image appears to be of the Virginia Washington Monument, showing George Washington on a horse with one leg aloft. But Washington didn’t die from battle wounds—he fell ill after working in cold, wet weather. The final image appears to be a statue of King George IV on a horse with all four feet on the ground in Trafalgar Square in London. It’s true that George didn’t die in battle, or afterward from wounds. He consumed "prodigious amounts of drugs" and cherry brandy before his death, according to the BBC. As Snopes has noted, most of Gettysburg’s equestrian statues abide by this alleged horse hoof pattern with James Longstreet being an exception. Still, there are plenty of other statues that buck it. Among them: Simon Bolivar, Andrew Jackson and Stonewall Jackson. We rate this statement as False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-10-26T11:02:57	2018-09-10	['None']
pomt-05251	Candidate Bill Byrne used campaign funds for work on his "personal car."	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/01/tim-lee/car-repair-bill-catches-eye-cobb-chairmans-race/	Cobb County politics is much like the onetime hit television sitcom "Cheers." Everyone knows your name in the Boston bar, and there are few things that occur that go unnoticed. For example, the county government’s commission chairman, Tim Lee, seemed to have the scoop on Bill Byrne, the man who once had that job and wants it back. In a recent Marietta Daily Journal "Around Town" political column, Lee appeared to question Byrne’s campaign ethics. "I have not paid to have my personal car worked on with campaign funds like some other candidates," Lee said. Lee didn’t refer to Byrne by name, but the inference seemed obvious. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to see if Lee was engaging in some campaign fact twisting or did he deserve a toast for telling the truth? Cobb is Georgia’s fourth highest-populated county. The Cobb chairman is an influential perch for deciding policy on public safety, transportation and water resources. Cobb is also a treasure-trove of Republican votes. Lee’s predecessor, Sam Olens, a Republican, is now Georgia’s attorney general. As the headline to the article suggested, the race for county chairman -- arguably one of the most powerful local government posts in Georgia -- is heating up. Earlier in the column, Byrne suggested that Lee would not achieve his fundraising goals. Lee countered that he was on track to raise his previously stated target of at least $200,000 and said he spent money on legitimate campaign expenses -- unlike an unnamed opponent. We tried to contact Lee a couple of times in recent weeks, leaving messages on a telephone number the chairman listed on his candidate campaign disclosure forms filed with the state. We received no reply. PolitiFact Georgia also called the county government’s communications director and explained the article we were reporting. No reply. PolitiFact Georgia caught up with Lee at a candidate forum Wednesday organized by the East Cobb Civic Association at the East Cobb Library. The chairman told PolitiFact Georgia that he read Byrne’s most recent candidate disclosure report, which mentioned money spent on a vehicle, and decided to talk about it to The Marietta Daily Journal. Lee said he considered it an old matter in a brief interview before Wednesday’s forum and declined further comment. So what did the report show? On Jan. 31, 2012, Byrne reported he spent $209.78 on "servicing campaign truck." Byrne told PolitiFact Georgia he used the money to pay for a tuneup and repair a brake line. Byrne said he uses a 2008 red GMC pickup truck that he owns for campaign purposes. Byrne is an old-school campaigner, who said he drives around the county to spread his message. Byrne sent PolitiFact Georgia a photo of the vehicle, which had a campaign sign attached to the passenger’s door and a large campaign sign in the truck bed. The vehicle was parked in front of Byrne’s campaign office in Marietta. The truck was parked in the lot outside the East Cobb Library on Wednesday. "It’s a campaign vehicle," Byrne said in one telephone interview. We asked Byrne what he thought about Lee’s initial comment. "He has the right to say anything he wants, and I have the right to respond," Byrne told us. Georgia’s campaign finance act has no specific language about funding vehicle repairs with campaign funds. The law advises candidates to spend on necessary campaign purposes. William Perry, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, an ethics watchdog group, said the law is vague on such spending. Perry told us the repairs could be legitimate if Byrne needs the vehicle for campaign purposes, and if the candidate is not attempting to get reimbursed for the mileage he is driving for the campaign. Otherwise, Perry said it could be "double-dipping" by Byrne. It is true that the vehicle belongs to Byrne. It is also true that Byrne used campaign funds to pay for repairs on the truck. Byrne does seem to be using the vehicle for campaign purposes, which the candidate said in his disclosure report. Lee did not mention that when he was quoted in the column. That context is critical for readers to fully understand the chairman’s statement. We give this one a rating of Half True.	None	Tim Lee	None	None	None	2012-06-01T06:00:00	2012-04-10	['None']
pomt-03695	Says "If you compare the Portland Metro area to the CDC’s statewide cavity rates ... the Portland Metro area would actually rank as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the U.S."	/oregon/statements/2013/apr/20/clean-water-portland/do-numbers-put-multnomah-co-par-15th-lowest-cavity/	Portland residents will vote in May on whether to add fluoride to the city’s drinking water. This is a long-running, divisive and emotional issue for people on both sides. Supporters say fluoridated water is the best way to strengthen teeth, especially for vulnerable children who lack access to regular dental care. Opponents say we should leave the city’s pristine drinking water alone. Opponents claim supporters are using misleading figures to make a case for fluoridating water in Portland. For example, the percentage of children who had or have a cavity is much higher in the rest of Oregon than it is in the Portland-metro area -- 70 percent compared with 54 percent among children, according to a 2007 state survey. "In fact, if you compare the Portland Metro area to the CDC’s statewide cavity rates fluoridation supporters rely upon, the Portland Metro area would actually rank as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the U.S," reads a yellow flier distributed by Clean Water Portland, the key campaign opposed to Measure 26-151. Obviously, a metro region is not a state, and it feels sloppy to mix the two in ranking anything. Still, we were surprised enough by the claim to want to dig deeper. Does the Portland area already boast enviable oral health statistics? Are the numbers cited even comparable? The Clean Water Portland campaign cites Oregon’s 2007 Smile Survey in part to back up its claim. The percentage of first-, second- and third-graders in Multnomah County, which includes Portland, who had or have a cavity was 56.3. The percentage in Clackamas and Washington counties was 52.5. Combined, the percentage was 54, as shown on page 12 of the report. Statewide, the percentage was 64 and outside the tri-county area, 70 percent. Now, how does the Clean Water Campaign determine that Multnomah County is comparable to the No. 15 spot nationally? Here, we turn to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as does the campaign. The CDC posts all sorts of statistics related to dental health, including what the organization calls "experience with caries," also known as having had a cavity. The percentages for children are broken down by elementary grades, and by participating state. Opponents say that the Portland-metro percentage of 54 is close to the percentage in New York state, which is 54.1. Opponents say since New York has the 15th lowest "experience with caries," the tri-county area must do pretty well on the cavity front, too. Here’s the problem with that kind of thinking. In 2007, Multnomah County was at 56.3 percent, counting three grades of students. The New York number comes from 2001-2003, and it’s limited to third-graders. Even more important than all of that is this: Seven states do not report the information and of the remaining ones that do, the years cited are all over the map, some as dated as 1998-99. In other words, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not rank New York as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the United States. There’s no baseline year. Subsequently, it’s even more unlikely that anyone could describe the Portland-metro area as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the United States. "You cannot directly compare state data to city data," unless it’s contained within a state, wrote CDC spokeswoman Linda S. Orgain in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. "We also do not generally compare states to other states in (the oral health surveillance system) because we have different time periods for each state." Shanie Mason, oral health unit manager for the Oregon Health Authority, echoed the sentiment. "We have never compared to other cities. We have only compared ourselves against neighboring states with a similar methodology," she said. We understand, however, that voters may want to get at the larger point behind the claim: How does Portland and Multnomah County fare when assessing cavities in children? Again, in 2007, about 56.3 percent of Multnomah County children in grades 1, 2 and 3 had a cavity, compared with 64 percent statewide. Preliminary figures for 2011-13 show numbers have dropped. The percentage of students in all three grades who had a cavity is 52. In Multnomah County for all three grades, it is 50.8. (For third-graders only, the new percentage statewide is 57.5 percent, down from 66.3 in 2006. We offer the various numbers to give readers a sense of how they differ based on the grade or grades included.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not aware of city-specific data for comparison purposes, said Orgain. She also said the most recent national statistic for cavities in children is from 1999-2004, and it was 53.2 percent for children ages 6 to 8 years old. That provides a national statistic by which readers could measure the county’s more recent percentage, but keep in mind it is old. Mason, who hopes to release the 2012 survey before the May 21 election, said one of the reasons the tri-county area does better than the rest of the state is that "Multnomah County has a pretty strong oral health infrastructure, and has for a much longer period of time than any other areas of the state." Physical therapist Kellie Barnes, a parent and volunteer with the Clean Water Campaign, defends the statement, saying that they were utterly transparent in telling voters the comparison was of the county to another state. Barnes also said fluoride supporters have repeatedly used the CDC state figures to rank Oregon, even with the varying years and ages tested. The larger point, Barnes said, is that fluoride advocates should not use statewide cavity statistics to indicate a dental crisis in Multnomah County or in Portland. But her arguments don’t make the statement any more correct. It’s certainly accurate to say that Multnomah County generally has better cavity numbers than the rest of the state. However, fluoride opponents went further, and said the Portland-metro area "would actually rank as having the 15th lowest cavity rate in the U.S." The numbers relied on by fluoride opponents do not show that New York has the 15th lowest cavity rate in the country. There is no national ranking of state cavity statistics because not all states have reported numbers, states may differ on sampling, and states report numbers for different years. Oregon’s numbers for Multnomah County include three grades, compared with one grade for the aged New York statistic cited. Public health experts we interviewed say it is not appropriate to compare a county percentage to the percentage of another state. We rule the statement False.

pomt-04622	Says Sherrod Brown’s campaign attacked Josh Mandel’s military service	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/17/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-claims-sherrod-browns-campaign-attacke/	It’s insult time. Let’s start with this one -- that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s actions were "un-American." That leads to another -- that Brown, the Democratic senator from Ohio, has stooped so outrageously, desperately low that he attacked the military service of his opponent, Marine Corps and Iraq War veteran Josh Mandel. My gosh, you might say, is this a nasty campaign or what? Well, yes. Still, to understand these related insults, you must follow some twists, turns and contortions, the likes of which did not end with the Olympics in London. In an election year, gymnastics continue until the polls close. The claim we are examining today is that Brown’s campaign attacked the service of Mandel, a Republican who is currently Ohio’s treasurer -- and a Marine Corps reservist who served two tours in Iraq. Mandel’s campaign sent out a fund-raising email saying as much on Aug. 31 and referred to Brown using "scummy smear tactics" to attack Mandel’s military service. "It is outrageous for Sherrod Brown’s campaign to say that enlisted military service with infantry battalions in Iraq doesn’t prepare you for leadership… that risking your life in defense of your country somehow disqualifies you from serving your country back home," the email said. The subject line on the email was "Mandel Marine service under attack." Let’s take the episode chronologically: On Aug. 24, 2012, Mandel and Brown were interviewed together at The Columbus Dispatch. The candidates were asked about the federal government’s auto industry bailout, which Brown supported. Mandel called one aspect of the bailout "un-American." He was speaking of the manner in which General Motors, with government money and input, agreed to guarantee the full pensions of unionized workers at Delphi Corp., a former GM subsidiary. Delphi’s salaried workers got no such guarantee. Many salaried Delphi workers will see dramatic cuts in their pensions, and they say back-room negotiations involving President Barack Obama’s administration and GM resulted in unequal treatment. Meantime, as The Dispatch reported: "In their first head-to-head meeting of this election season, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel described Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown as "un-American." The newspaper quoted Mandel: "I don’t toss around the word un-American very often — it’s a dangerous word to use. But stripping ... Delphi employees of their pensions with that vote — that is un-American." The Plain Dealer, in an Aug. 26 interview, asked Mandel to elaborate on whether he thought Brown was anti-American, or whether he was strictly referring to the Delphi matter. "I think Sherrod Brown’s a proud American," Mandel said. "Just because I served in the Marines and did a couple tours of Iraq doesn’t mean I love my country any more than he loves his country. We just have a different vision for where we want to take it, and different ideas for what we think grows an economy and creates jobs. And the thousands of Delphi employees who were depending on having pensions and were all of a sudden stripped of them are now baby boomers and senior citizens who are struggling to make ends meet." Brown’s campaign held a news conference Aug 30 in Columbus to denounce the "un-American" claim. As reported by an NBC affiliate, "local veterans, including two retired Army Generals, denounced Mandel’s choice of words. Ret. Major General Dennis Laich said, ‘Having spent 35 years in the military, I have a sense of what un-American looks like in terms of words and deeds and I can tell you that the vote that Senator Brown took, in no way, represents an un-American act.’" During that news conference, a reporter asked the retired generals if they thought Mandel’s use of his military service would work in earning votes from the military or veterans bloc. Here is Laich’s answer, which we got from news accounts, partial transcripts from the Brown and Mandel campaigns, and online video of the news conference: "It’s not a matter of it working or not. The fact of the matter is that Josh Mandel has served in the military. We applaud that. As a matter of fact, Gen. (Sam) Kindred and I would both hope that thousands of other young Ohioans would choose to serve in the military. But the fact of the matter is, that the meaning that we’re trying to do today is not in Iraq or Afghanistan at the tactical level. It is at the national strategic level, its national security level, where Sen. Sherrod Brown is the veteran." Laich continued, saying, "The experience that Josh Mandel had in the military is at the tactical level. Decisions that are made by those hundred Americans who serve in the United States Senate (are) at the strategic level and the national security level. We applaud it, we recognize it, and we wish that others would continue to serve or choose to serve. But the fact of the matter is that these are two different sets of criterion that are at play here and the experienced veteran in the wars on Capitol Hill is Sherrod Brown -- who has, by the way, I hate to disagree with my colleague here, but he characterized Senator Brown’s record for veterans and their families as outstanding, I characterize it as perfect." There you have it. Did you hear an attack on Mandel’s Marine Corps service? The Mandel campaign says it did. Travis Considine, Mandel’s communications director, told PolitiFact Ohio that Brown’s campaign "is essentially attacking Josh’s military service by suggesting that because his time in the Marine Corps was spent at the ‘tactical level’ he is not as prepared to fight for Ohio’s veterans as Sherrod Brown, who they call ‘the experienced veteran in the wars on Capitol Hill.’ Their logic illustrates exactly what is wrong with Washington, the belief that career politician experience supersedes actual experience." That brings us back to the Mandel camp’s Aug. 31 fundraising email. The email did not quote Mandel directly. Rather, it included a statement from a Mandel supporter and fellow Marine. The email said: "Did you see what fellow Marine Mark DePhillips wrote below about Sherrod Brown's campaign attacking Josh's Marine Corps service? Take a look, and I bet you will be as disgusted as I was." The email asked supporters to help Mandel "fight back and defend not only his own military service, but the honorable service of the thousands of brave men and women who risked everything to protect this great country." It provided a link to a television commercial that Mandel wanted to air. The commercial begins with this line: "Sherrod Brown’s cowardly attacks on Josh Mandel’s character are shameful. Just ask the Marines who put their lives on the line with him." It’s not unusual to insult a political opponent. But attacking his military service is something else. Laich, however, said he did no such thing. "For someone to draw from those comments that I insulted his military service is a stretch," he told us in a telephone interview. "You’d have to do some magical thinking there." He said that in the military, service members are tasked with different levels of duty: tactical, operational or strategic. Each is invaluable, he said, repeating his praise for Mandel’s military service. But each is different, he said. Was Laich on firm ground here? We turned to military materials to see. It turns out that Laich’s descriptions are consistent with Marine Corps and Pentagon manuals, including the Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Related Terms. The strategic level refers to establishing national or multi-national objectives and developing resources to accomplish them. Think of this as the 20,000-foot view -- or in Washington, the duties of policy makers. The operational level refers to the level at which military operations are planned and sustained. The tactical level is where battles and engagements are planned and executed. Says a Marine Corps manual called, simply, Tactics: "Winning in combat depends upon tactical leaders who can think creatively and act decisively." And says a Marine Corps intelligence manual, which we mention because Mandel’s specialty in the Corps was intelligence: "Tactical intelligence concerns itself primarily with the location, capabilities, and possible intentions of enemy units on the battlefield and with the tactical aspects of terrain and weather ... Marine Corps intelligence focuses on tactical intelligence, which is the level of intelligence Marines need, generate, and use most often." None of this sounded outrageous. Yet there is an element of truth in Mandel’s complaint. Though couched in laudatory phrases, Laich's remarks could be interpreted as dismissive. While Laich, speaking on behalf of Brown’s campaign, applauded Mandel for serving, he also distinguished Mandel’s experience at the tactical level from experience in the Senate. In order to praise Brown’s Senate service, he spoke of a Marine’s military service as not only requiring a different skill set, but also as subordinate to the skills in the United States Senate: "The experience that Josh Mandel had in the military is at the tactical level. Decisions that are made by those hundred Americans who serve in the United States Senate (are) at the strategic level and the national security level." That said, there was no attempt to describe Mandel as someone who disobeyed orders or who was derelict in his duty or anything other than an exemplary Marine. And we don’t see, from reading the general’s remarks, that he ever conveyed the message that "risking your life in defense of your country somehow disqualifies you from serving your country back home," as the email from Mandel’s camp implied. Knowing those critical facts would give a different impression of the claim that Brown’s campaign attacked Mandel’s military service. On the Truth-O-Meter, the Mandel claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-09587	"We lowered the business tax from 4 percent down to 1 percent."	/texas/statements/2010/jan/22/rick-perry/perry-says-he-cut-business-tax/	A "he said, she said" exchange between U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Gov. Rick Perry during the Jan. 14 gubernatorial debate may have left Texans scratching their heads. When the senator accused Perry of raising taxes on businesses, one of the things she pointed to was legislation that the governor signed in 2006 restructuring the state’s franchise tax on businesses. Perry responded several times by saying that "we lowered the business tax from 4 percent down to 1 percent." The mixed messages put forth by the two candidates -- higher taxes, lower taxes? -- made us wonder who was right. In a companion item, we examined Hutchison’s claim about the business tax. Now, we’ll look at Perry’s. The centerpiece of a 2006 tax overhaul was a reduction in the property tax rate that local school districts use to generate money for operations. The Legislature revamped the franchise tax and increased the cigarette tax to help districts offset the loss of revenue from the rate cut. Strictly speaking, Perry's statement about the franchise tax rate is correct: As part of the changes, it was cut from about 4 percent to 1 percent. But another major revision -- widening the tax base -- was so significant that tax experts told us that simply comparing the before-and after rates doesn't give the true picture. Before 2006, the franchise tax was essentially a 4.5 percent tax on a company’s profit. The new version, often called the margins tax, reduced the rate to 1 percent while broadening its application. Now, the tax is applied to the annual revenue of qualifying companies minus one of three options: the cost of goods sold, employee compensation or 30 percent of total revenue. "The earlier tax was mainly on profits," said Billy Hamilton, who served as deputy comptroller under state Comptrollers John Sharp and Carole Keeton Strayhorn. "The new tax is on the broader margin base. It is a different tax, and comparing the two rates is an apples and oranges comparison." As anticipated, Texas businesses paid more in franchise taxes after the overhaul than they did before: In 2006 and 2007, franchise tax revenue was $5.75 billion. In 2008 and 2009, the first two years of the revised tax, total revenue rose to $8.7 billion. However, one expected consequence of the legislation didn't pan out. Before the restructuring, a frequent criticism of the franchise tax was that it had become virtually voluntary, paid by only about 1 in 16 Texas businesses. The revision was designed to apply the tax to more businesses. However, because of exemptions that the Legislature gave small businesses, the number of companies that pay the franchise tax is lower than before the law was signed, said Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. "The tax has become more concentrated on larger businesses," he said. It's also important to note that the 2006 tax changes didn't affect all businesses the same way. Because of the property tax reductions, some saw their taxes drop. Others did not. Summing up, Perry was correct when he said the business tax rate was cut. But he failed to point out that the change in the tax base essentially transformed the franchise tax into a new levy, one that generated more money from businesses. In our book, an otherwise accurate statement that leaves out important details or takes things out of context is Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-01-22T16:17:58	2010-01-14	['None']
pomt-11453	"Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month."	/new-york/statements/2018/mar/09/chris-collins/are-americans-already-benefiting-new-tax-law/	U.S. Rep. Chris Collins said many Americans are already benefiting from the tax law Republicans in Congress passed in December. Collins used the claim to attack House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in a tweet. "Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month," Collins tweeted. "Despite what @NancyPelosi may say, this isn’t "crumbs" for hardworking families in #WNY." Pelosi had previously called the tax benefits for middle- and low-income earners "crumbs" compared to what wealthy earners would receive. Republicans who support the tax plan disagree. They believe the tax bill provides significant relief for those workers. Collins, a Republican from suburban Buffalo, says those benefits have already started. Is he right? ‘4 million American workers’ President Donald Trump claimed 3 million workers in the U.S. had already received a pay increase or bonus thanks to the tax bill at the end of January. PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly True. PolitiFact checked Trump’s claim using data from Americans for Tax Reform, a group that advocates for lower taxes. The group supported the Republican tax bill. The group has a running list of companies that have announced bonuses or other benefits based on press releases and media reports since the tax law passed. At the end of January, at least 286 companies had announced benefits for more than 3 million workers. That number has since grown to more than 4 million workers from 408 companies, according to the group. Those workers have gotten a bonus, pay increase, 401(k) hike, or utility rate cut because of the new tax law, according to reports. That’s not a small number of workers, but it accounts for less than 3 percent of the total employed population in the U.S. Experts also told PolitiFact that some of the bonuses may have already been planned before the tax law to retain workers in a tight labor market. Larger paychecks The second part of Collins’ claim is based on a prediction from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The agency said in January that 90 percent of working Americans would have less federal tax withheld from their paychecks by the middle of February. Employers had until Feb. 15 to implement the lower federal tax rates. "We’re estimating that 90 percent of workers are going to see an increase in take-home pay because of the Tax Cuts [and Jobs] Act," U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said. We reached out to the agency to see if its prediction panned out for February. We did not hear back. The actual share of workers with more take-home pay may be lower than 90 percent, according to Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. "It is true that roughly 90 percent of Americans will get a tax cut this year as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," Gleckman said. But many Americans will not see higher take-home pay because of other factors, like higher health insurance premiums. Higher premiums could exceed any increase in take-home pay. Premiums for individual and employer-sponsored health plans are expected to rise again this year. An argument could be made that without the new tax rates, employees would have less money to pay for the higher premiums. More benefits from the law will be available during next year’s tax filing period. That’s when other provisions begin, like a higher standard deduction for filers. Our ruling Collins said "Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month." The first part of Collins’ claim is correct based on a compilation of companies from a tax cut advocacy group. PolitiFact used the same list when fact-checking Trump on a similar claim. The second part of Collins’ claim is less clear. The Treasury Department predicted 90 percent of workers would have lower federal taxes in February. We don’t know how many had higher take-home pay, Gleckman said. The statement is accurate but needed additional information. We rate it Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What do you think? PolitiFact Republican guest columnist and former U.S. Rep. David Jolly said PolitiFact’s fact-checking of this statement "reveals the challenges confronted by disciplined fact-checkers to confine themselves only to a politician’s specific comment, and the challenges equally faced by readers of PolitiFact whose opinions may often be arrived at through a broader analysis of additional facts not addressed in a single fact-checking column. Whether Rep. Collins’ assertion represents the full policy implications of the new law or whether it intentionally avoids the additional complexities of its impact, the fact is his statement was accurate."

pomt-02738	Greg Abbott defended more than $5 billion in public school funding cuts in fighting hundreds of school districts in court.	/texas/statements/2013/dec/18/wendy-davis/abbott-defended-school-funding-system-and-legislat/	When Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott visited a Dallas-area school district, the leading Democratic aspirant cried foul. "As Greg Abbott visits a Plano ISD school today it’s unlikely that he will apologize to students for defending school budget cuts and fighting against their school district in court," state Sen. Wendy Davis said in a Dec. 3, 2013, post on her campaign website. "Greg Abbott’s actions speak louder than his words. While I fought against over $5 billion in unconstitutional budget cuts to our public schools," Davis said, Abbott "wasted taxpayer funds to defend those cuts in court." Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, helped force a special legislative session in 2011 by filibustering, and temporarily delaying, a decision by the revenue-strapped Republican-majority Legislature to reduce education funding by more than $5 billion through 2012-13. And did Abbott, the state’s attorney general, defend the cuts in court? That’s been acknowledged. Abbott was quoted during his Dec. 3, 2013, Plano visit as telling the Dallas Morning News the reason he’s defending the cuts is because the Legislature passed them and it’s his job to defend them. "The attorney general in Texas takes an oath of office to defend the laws passed by the legislature," Abbott said, according to the News. "I’m fulfilling that duty." That news story came to our attention in an email from Davis’ campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña, who responded to our request for the basis of Davis’ statement with a document listing web links to additional news stories as well as legal filings by Abbott’s office in defending the school funding system in the latest round of litigation likely headed to the Texas Supreme Court. In February 2013, a Travis County state district judge, John Dietz, ruled the system unconstitutional, though he later reacted to legislative actions restoring $3.4 billion in spending cuts and easing mandated high-school tests by scheduling fresh hearings for early 2014, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a news story posted online June 19, 2013. A vital issue in the original trial, the Statesman said in a news story posted online Oct. 20, 2012, was the charge by two-thirds of the state’s school districts accounting for three-quarters of Texas students that the state was failing to ensure that districts had adequate resources to bring students up to what lawmakers handed down in tougher academic expectations. Texas districts have litigated how the state funds the schools for decades. Each time, expert lawyers told us, the state attorney general has defended the existing law just as Abbott has in the latest legal battle, which is expected to resume in early 2014. That’s in keeping with the duties of the attorney general as specified in the Texas Constitution, which says the attorney general "shall represent the state in all suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the state in which the state may be a party." Lawyers representing groups of districts in the latest lawsuits each said it would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a state law and related legislative decisions. Buck Wood of Austin, who has long represented property-poor districts in school finance suits, said deputies to Abbott "vigorously defended" the law during the latest trial before Dietz. Austin lawyer Rick Gray, representing some 400 districts in the latest litigation, said he could not recall any attorney general backing down from defending the school finance system through the decades of court battles. David Thompson of Houston, who represents districts (including the Austin one) serving more than 1.8 million children, stressed that Abbott’s office has defended the constitutionality of the funding system and the legislated cuts, not necessarily speaking to whether the spending reductions were good policy. "The attorney general’s office is actively and I would say vigorously defending the state’s actions," Thompson said. "That would include specifically the cuts to funding as well as just the overall design and structure of the (funding) system." The lawyers each added that while it’s an attorney general’s duty to defend the state and actions taken on behalf of the state, he or she also has discretion to settle cases. Our search of news stories and Abbott-issued press releases yielded no sign of Abbott personally appearing in the courtroom during the latest school funding trial. At our request, Catherine Clark, an administrator for the Texas Association of School Boards, reviewed her notes from the trial. By telephone, Clark said she found no instances of state attorneys defending the 2011 cuts in education aid except to elicit testimony that the reductions were less dramatic than other state budget cuts that year. "I don’t see them standing up there and saying, gosh, we needed to" make those cuts, Clark said. "But they did admit there were cuts." We asked a spokeswoman for the attorney general, Lauren Bean, if Davis is correct that Abbott has defended the 2011 cuts in the school funding lawsuits. By email, Bean said yes, Abbott’s "office defended the law in court." In a follow-up email, she listed court rulings specifying the attorney general has an exclusive role in representing state agencies. Our ruling Davis said Abbott defended more than $5 billion in cuts in public school funding in fighting hundreds of school districts in court. That’s factually correct as far as it goes, but this claim is missing important details and context in that the state attorney general has a legal duty to represent the state in challenges reaching the Texas Supreme Court, which the latest school finance lawsuits are expected to do. It would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a law and legislative actions in such a suit. We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True.

pomt-00658	"Florida sends $135 billion and D.C. returns $150 billion."	/florida/statements/2015/may/14/debbie-mayfield/florida-takes-billions-more-washington-it-gives-re/	Florida House members left the 2015 legislative session early over health care funding, but they’ve kept on railing against Medicaid expansion while waiting to reconvene to discuss a state budget. Rep. Debbie Mayfield, R-Vero Beach, argued against taking federal money to expand Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for the very poor, saying it wasn’t Florida’s money to take. "FL is NOT a donor state. Get the facts on federal spending and Medicaid expansion in FL," she tweeted. The tweet included an infographic that read, "Florida sends $135 billion and D.C. returns $150 billion. It's not your hard-earned tax dollars! It's borrowed against your children’s future!" Other House Republicans shared the same infographic, including Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island. We wondered where they were getting their numbers. Tax totals House communications director Michael Williams said the amount Florida sends comes from Internal Revenue Service gross tax collections in the state ($154 billion in 2014) minus average tax refunds, ending up at $135 billion. The amount Washington sent back came from USASpending.gov, a website that tracks federal contracts, loans, grants and public assistance. The site says the federal government spent $150 billion in Florida in fiscal year 2014. Subtract $135 billion from $150 billion, and that accounts for Florida getting $15 billion more than it puts in. But tax policy experts told us there are different ways to calculate the numbers, so it’s not as cut and dried as the House makes it out to be. Steve Ellis, vice president of watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the House’s methodology is generally sound, but he would suggest using actual tax refunds instead of average refunds. He said that would push Florida’s payout total even lower than $135 billion. On the spending side, National Priorities Project research director Lindsay Koshgarian points out that data from USASpending.gov does not give the most reliable picture available. Koshgarian said that among the site’s issues is that it does not include all grants or federal employees and operations in state spending totals. She suggested using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau would yield a more accurate total. So federal tax totals paid out of Florida may be lower than what the House is saying, while federal spending could be even higher. But our experts said that comparison still doesn’t paint a good picture of the state’s nuances. For example, Social Security and Medicare costs are disproportionately high in Florida because of the retiree population, which already paid into the system, but likely in another state. Florida has the third-largest uninsured pool in the country, with a public assistance budget to match. Also, there’s a lot of that $150 billion in Washington cash that isn’t as controversial in the House as Medicaid spending, like money for infrastructure or federal contracts for businesses like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. "I doubt these folks are saying the state should not be taking federal highway money, just because they are taking in more than they spend," said Paul Van De Water, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Differences between states make it difficult to make direct comparisons, Koshgarian said. She cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to illustrate her point. "We all need one CDC, but we don't need one in every state, so the dollars have to go somewhere," she said. Koshgarian said that in 2013, the last year with complete Census data, Florida received the fourth-highest total of federal grants to state government with $23.5 billion (the bulk of which was Medicaid), but was 48th among states for federal grant dollars per resident -- only Nevada and Virginia ranked lower. Those numbers mostly reflect Florida’s status as one of the more populous states. Ellis added that there’s one other thing to keep in mind to put Mayfield’s point in context: The U.S. government is always in the red these days. "In my opinion, no state is a donor state when you consider that the budget deficit is nearly half a trillion dollars, so no one is paying their way," he said. Our ruling Mayfield said, "Florida sends $135 billion and D.C. returns $150 billion." Tax policy experts told us the House’s numbers were one way to look at it, but different data sources could yield different totals. They also said such a comparison really doesn’t illustrate the nuances of what federal money is used for in Florida or why. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-03801	"If you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/26/michael-bloomberg/michael-bloomberg-nra-used-support-more-background/	In back-to-back appearances on Meet the Press, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre went another round in their duel over proposed gun legislation. Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases. LaPierre opposes expanded background checks. Both are working hard to discredit the other. During Bloomberg’s segment, he told host David Gregory that once upon a time, LaPierre was in favor of the background checks he’s now fighting. "In fact, if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done," Bloomberg said. We’re fact-checking statements by both Bloomberg and LaPierre from Meet the Press. Here, we’ll examine the New York mayor’s characterization of what LaPierre said back in 1999. ‘We think it’s reasonable’ On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier. To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy. First on that list: "We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone," he said. "That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances." He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows and keeping schools gun-free. Other evidence New York magazine, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled "Be reasonable," the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, "We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun." We contacted the NRA for this story but did not receive a response about Bloomberg’s claim. In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, "The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work." LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting. "I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working," he said. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, "I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?" LaPierre responded: "I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law." The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks: "The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system." Our ruling Bloomberg said that in 1999, "Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done." In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it "reasonable" to conduct a background check "for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone." Subsequent statements by NRA officials acknowledge that the group’s position has since changed to opposition to more background checks. We rate Bloomberg’s statement True.	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2013-03-26T13:49:45	2013-03-24	['None']
pomt-04973	A proposed tax to fund transportation projects would spend $90,000 to take a single vehicle off the road during the morning and afternoon commute.	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/24/steve-brown/Transportation-tax-foes-number-crunching-flawed/	Opponents of a sales tax to fund transportation projects across metro Atlanta have no shortage of ways to say the plan is a waste of your money. They say you can’t trust the government to manage the billions of dollars that the 10-year, penny-per-dollar sales tax would raise. They say the tax plan, otherwise known as T-SPLOST, is bloated with projects that won’t ease the region’s notoriously bad traffic. This statement by Fayette County Commissioner Steve Brown was especially alarming: "If you take the cost of all of the T-SPLOST transit projects combined, the transportation referendum would spend $90,000 to take a single vehicle off the road during the a.m.-p.m. commute," Brown said during a July 12 forum hosted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ninety thousand dollars? Heck, who needs the tax? Pay us PolitiFact Georgia scribes $90,000 each, and we’ll walk up the Connector to work. Brown and Bob Ross, a tax foe who was not on the panel, explained their estimate. First, they tallied the combined cost of all of the transit projects that the tax would fund: $3.16 billion. Next, they calculated how many cars these transit expansions would take off the road. The Atlanta Regional Commission, the region’s planning authority, projects that the additional transit capacity will increase boardings by 74,800 per day. Brown and Ross divided this number by two. Commuters need to board a bus or train at least twice a day: Once to get there, and once to get back. That’s 37,400 cars off the road -- a conservative estimate, Brown and Ross said. If a rider has to transfer trains or buses, the daily commute may take four or more boardings. The per-car cost is therefore $3.16 billion divided by 37,400 cars. That’s about $84,500, less than the $90,000 that Brown used in his claim. Still, pretty close. Brown and Ross also sent us calculations they say demonstrate that $90,000 is far too low. The true cost of taking one car off the road is $105,000, they said. (They used a similar method but added in certain maintenance costs.) Brown’s approach has flaws. Brown arguably cherry-picked favorable data to prove his point. Of the $3.16 billion the tax would spend on transit projects, only $2.4 billion would fund the expansions that would increase boardings by nearly 75,000 per day. Much of the rest is to maintain current service, such as commuter bus run by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, ARC spokeswoman Julie Ralston said. The ARC projects that service will go out of business without the tax, forcing riders to take to the roads. The money also funds system maintenance. Experts told us it's possible that If commuters think the trains are unsafe or break down too often, they might retreat to their cars. Brown thinks such an argument is absurd. Others pointed out that Brown’s calculation has worse problems. Tallying the costs and benefits of a transportation project is a complex process. There are many different approaches, but experts often take into account impacts on the economy, the environment, traffic flow, safety and even noise. We found Brown’s more simple approach may vastly overstate and understate the problem at the same time. One reason is that the transit infrastructure will last for generations. Brown’s calculation uses a single day of boardings. A more fair one would count the boardings over the next few decades. The Federal Transit Administration’s rule of thumb is that rail facilities last at least 50 years, according to data on its website, while trains last about 25 years. Factor in those future boardings, and the cost for transit to keep a car off the road could be lower than $5 or greater than $13 per day. That may be too high for voters to stomach, but it’s a far less alarming figure than $90,000. Even then, such a calculation ignores crucial factors that planners consider when they perform a cost-benefit analysis of transit, such as more commerce and less air pollution, said Robert Cervero, a professor of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley. "Any numbers based on anything less than a full benefit and cost accounting is, in my view, mostly ideologically driven and propaganda," Cervero said. Another weakness of Brown’s claim is that over the long term, the transit expansion might not reduce congestion at all. Decades of research also shows that neither transit nor more highway lanes end gridlock, either, PolitiFact Georgia found in a previous story. Over time, drivers fill up the new lanes. Once again, they’re stuck in traffic. In sum: Brown based his calculation on a transit cost estimate that’s open to accusations of cherry-picking. Furthermore, even Brown and Ross think their own number falls short. The claim is so simplistic that it may overstate and understate the cost at the same time. Brown’s claim is wrong on various levels. It earns a False.	None	Steve Brown	None	None	None	2012-07-24T06:00:00	2012-07-12	['None']
pomt-00819	"If you took every penny of the 1 percent, including their dog, you wouldn't even begin to balance the budget."	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/mar/27/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-says-taking-every-penny-wealthiest-/	For years, politicians have insisted on the importance of balancing the federal budget. Recurring budget deficits -- with hardly any intervening surpluses -- have created a national debt of $18.2 trillion, and federal spending continues to outpace tax receipts. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., recently came to New Hampshire to test the waters for a presidential bid, talking about the deficit at a Politics and Pies appearance in Concord. During a question-and-answer session, he said the country needed to simplify the tax code and reform entitlements. To put in perspective just how much money he was talking about, he said, "If you took every penny of the (richest) 1 percent, including their dog, you wouldn't even begin to balance the budget." Really? Politifact New Hampshire decided to check it out. We first checked with Graham’s Senate office. His spokesman, Kevin Bishop, sent along a piece from the Wall Street Journal opinion section that talks about the difficulty of balancing the budget solely by taxing the income of the country’s richest people. That may be true, but it’s also not the way Graham phrased it. Graham didn’t single out the income taxes of the richest 1 percent; he said "every penny of the 1 percent" (while throwing in their pets for good measure). There’s enough wiggle room in Graham’s statement to allow for three plausible ways to define "every penny" -- total wealth, total income and total taxes for the richest 1 percent. We’ll look at each. Wealth Figuring out how much wealth -- stocks, bonds, income, real estate, and the like -- is held by the nation’s richest 1 percent holds is somewhat tricky because some of those elements are hard to measure. But there have been several estimates. On the low end, the Boston Consulting Group puts the amount of privately held wealth in the United States at $39 trillion for 2012. The group’s figure is based on a proprietary formula and excludes real estate, businesses owned by investors and luxury goods. On the upper end, the U.S. Federal Reserve cited the net worth of all U.S. households and nonprofits at $69.5 trillion for 2012. That number includes the value of real estate and of nonprofit organizations, some of which are closely held by individuals. A middle ground can be found in data compiled for the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Their definition of national wealth excludes nonprofits, and comes in at $55.2 trillion for 2012. These estimates all look at the entire nation’s holdings. What about the share owned by the richest 1 percent? In a paper, Saez and Zucman found that the top 1 percent own 41.8 percent of the country’s wealth. Estimates from other researchers showed a somewhat lower percentage -- 35.6 percent and 35.4 percent, depending on the year. Using their own data set, that means the richest 1 percent have holdings worth about $23 trillion. If you apply their 41.8 percentage to the other two estimates, the amount ranges from $16 trillion to $29 trillion. Each figure is easily enough to balance the U.S. budget, which ran a $483 billion deficit last year and which is projected to be $486 billion in the red this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Even adding up deficits for the next decade gives us $7.7 trillion -- a total easily covered by that $26.2 trillion that could (at least in this example) be confiscated from our nation’s richest residents. Another way to look at it: All federal spending in 2012 totaled $3.5 trillion. So the richest 1 percent’s wealth could also pay off the year’s entire budget -- six-and-a-half times over. In fact, even the lowest of the three wealth estimates would come close to wiping out the country’s current level of accumulated debt, which stands in excess of $18 trillion. Income Even if you use the income of the 1 percent, it’s still a number far greater than you would need to balance the budget. The data collected by Saez and Zucman show a national income of $14 trillion for 2012. The Federal Reserve reports the same number for the same year. On the low end, the IRS reported $9 trillion in adjusted gross income for 2012. The richest 1 percent’s share of the income for 2012, according to the Paris School of Economics’ interactive database, is 22.8 percent (including capital gains). That means taking the entirety of the group’s income that year would net us somewhere between $2 trillion and $3.2 trillion. In other words, if you use total income of the 1 percent, you don’t even have to raid Fido’s food bowl to do what Graham suggests. Taxes And what of the actual tax burden of the 1 percent? According to estimates from the independent Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, the richest 1 percent paid 27 percent of all federal income taxes in 2012. They had an average income of $1.8 million apiece that year and paid an average of $489,437 in taxes. That works out, roughly, to some $563 billion in taxes collected from the richest in 2012. A tidy sum, to be sure, but it has already been applied to offset our government’s costs. One would have to double the taxes collected from the group to cover current deficits. This is the one scenario in which Graham has a point. Our ruling Graham said, "If you took every penny of the (richest) 1 percent, including their dog, you wouldn't even begin to balance the budget." Graham has a point if you take it the way his staff suggests he meant to say it. But the talking point (which, to be clear, no one is suggesting as a real policy) came out more broadly. If you use either total wealth or total income -- interpretations we think are at least as plausible given his "every penny" remarks -- Graham is off base. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-01135	"My wife is going to be the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas."	/texas/statements/2014/dec/22/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-my-wife-going-be-first-hispanic-first-/	In a limelight interview, the governor-elect of Texas responded to a question about beefing up security near the Texas-Mexico border by bringing up his wife. When Abbott appeared on the Dec. 7, 2014, broadcast of NBC’s "Meet the Press" to discuss immigration and border security, host Chuck Todd played a January 2005 video clip of President George W. Bush, the former Texas governor, saying "family values do not stop at the Rio Grande… People are coming to our country to do jobs that Americans won’t do to be able to feed their families. And I think there’s a humane way to recognize that, at the same time protect our borders," Bush said, "and at the same way to make sure we don’t disadvantage those who have stood in line for years to become a legal citizen." Todd asked: "Do you agree with that statement?" Abbott replied: "In a way I understand this even more powerfully because my wife is going to be the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas. And Texas has had a long tradition of uniting the Hispanic culture with Texas values." Abbott, the state attorney general, talked up his wife making history for months on the campaign trail in 2014, perhaps to good effect. In July 2014, PolitiFact Texas found the state’s population was 38.4 percent Hispanic, the second biggest demographic after whites, who make up 40 percent. Notably too, the flags that have flown over Texas include the banners of Spain and Mexico. And has there previously not been a Hispanic first lady of Texas? Not since statehood, it appears. But we started our look into Abbott's claim by looking into the next first lady’s roots. The next First Lady Abbott aides didn’t respond to our inquiries into how Abbott decided his wife was breaking ground. We looked for clues on Ancestry.com, the online genealogy database, which led us to information credited to the 1940 United States Federal Census indicating Cecilia Phalen Abbott, the governor-elect’s wife, is the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants--Leonara and Augustine Segura--who settled in San Antonio before 1935. We shortly confirmed the validity of those census records on a federal website that included a chart showing Maria de la Luz Segura, Cecilia Abbott’s mother, was born in 1935 in San Antonio, where she lived with her parents, grandparents and siblings. We also uncovered census data for Cecilia Abbott’s father, William Joseph Phalen--born in Michigan in 1933 to parents from Ohio and New York and then raised in Houston. According to Ancestry.com, Phalen is an Irish family name, most common in the state of New York. Next, we turned to how best to define an Hispanic first lady. What’s Hispanic? By phone, Erika Arredondo-Haskins of the Hispanic Heritage Center of Texas in San Antonio, told us the word "Hispanic" describes anyone who can trace ancestry to Spanish culture, including through the Spanish colonies in the Americas that once stretched from California to the southern tip of South America. Also, Haskins suggested, Texas history predates statehood and its earlier status as as a free-standing republic to when the region was ruled by Mexico and, before that, Spain and there were numerous Hispanic first ladies. She singled out Maria Perez Cassiano, wife of the governor of the Spanish province Coahuila and Texas from 1814 to 1823. Cassiano was born in San Antonio in 1790, descended from Spanish immigrants who arrived in San Antonio in 1731, and was known for performing the governor’s duties in his absence, Haskins said. Haskins’ comments reminded us of a complicating detail: Texas fell under various successive governments since Europeans arrived in the 1500s--it’s been a province of New Spain, a Mexican province, a republic, a U.S. state and a Confederate state. According to Texas A&M University’s "Sons of DeWitt Colony Texas," a Texas history research group, there were 29 governors of Texas from 1691 to 1821. Among first ladies in that period, Augustina Cantú was the wife of Alonso de Leon, the first governor of Texas who established the state’s modern eastern border at the Sabine River, according to the Handbook of Texas, a project of the Texas State Historical Association. Also, the handbook says, Ignacia Xaviera was the wife of Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo, Texas governor from 1719-1722, who drove the French from East Texas. First Ladies since Texas won independence from Mexico More Hispanic women were first ladies in the period following the Texas Revolution, when immigrants from the United States broke away from Mexico. Laurie Jasinski, research editor at The Handbook of Texas, said by phone she reviewed a list of first ladies since the Republic of Texas’s independence from Mexico in 1836 and did not find mention of anyone with Hispanic roots. She also recommended we visit the Legislative Reference Library at the Texas Capitol for a full answer. At the library, we reviewed the book First Ladies of Texas, which includes biographies of Texas first ladies, born between 1836 and 1936, of the Republic of Texas, the state of Texas, and the Confederate state of Texas. (Texas became a state in 1845.) None of the 37 first ladies listed in the book had roots in former Spanish colonies. Most came from southeastern states of the United States (interestingly, less than half were born in Texas). Four recent first ladies dwelt in the governor’s mansion after the book’s publication in 1976--Rita Crocker Clements, Linda Gale White, Laura Welch Bush and Anita Thigpen Perry. Online biographical sketches for each first lady, published by Texas A&M University, Texas Woman’s University, The White House and the website of Gov. Rick Perry, respectively, revealed no Hispanic roots among them. Drawing from our research, we’ve listed Texas first ladies here. Our ruling Greg Abbott said his wife would be "the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas." Cecilia Abbott, with Hispanic roots through her mother and grandmother, will be the first Hispanic first lady since statehood, which we take Abbott to be saying. Other Hispanic women were first ladies only before Texas was a state. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-02779	"We pay among the highest tolls in the nation for the privilege of crossing that bridge."	/new-jersey/statements/2013/dec/08/loretta-weinberg/loretta-weinberg-says-george-washington-bridge-tol/	Commuters who use the George Washington Bridge have followed with interest the recent political dustup about the closing of several access lanes in Fort Lee for a few days in September. Sen. Loretta Weinberg, among others, has questioned whether the closures were political retribution against Fort Lee’s Democratic mayor for failing to endorse Republican Gov. Chris Christie for re-election last month. In a Nov. 14 radio interview on the John Gambling program on WOR 710 AM, she let fly a statement on how much the bridge costs to use. "We pay among the highest tolls in the nation for the privilege of crossing that bridge," Weinberg (D-Bergen), the Senate’s majority leader, told Gambling as they discussed the closure controversy, which has since led to the Assembly subpoenaing Port Authority executives to testify about the matter. Weinberg is correct, dollars-wise. Before we get to bridge toll costs, let’s note that bridges in the New York and New Jersey region are run by either the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, or the Metropolitan Transit Authority. It’s worth noting that for every bridge we mention, we’re using the peak toll cost for a standard two-axle vehicle. The most expensive bridge in the region is the MTA-run Verrazano-Narrows, which connects Brooklyn and Staten Island. A $15 toll is collected only on the side going from Brooklyn to Staten Island. The most expensive bridges after the Verrazano-Narrows are the George Washington, Goethals and Bayonne bridges, and the Outerbridge Crossing. The $13 toll for each bridge is collected on one side. The George Washington Bridge connects upper Manhattan with Fort Lee. Now let’s look at toll costs for some other major bridges in the nation. The 17-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, which connects the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas with Virginia’s Eastern Shore, is $13 and also collected in one direction. That toll will rise to $15 on Jan. 1. California’s Golden Gate Bridge, which connects San Francisco to the state’s northern counties, is $6. And the Mackinac Bridge, connecting Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas, is $4. So Weinberg is correct that the George Washington Bridge has among the highest tolls in the nation. But some experts told us there’s more to the toll cost for that bridge and others in this region than perhaps in other parts of the country. Dr. Robert Paaswell, distinguished professor of Civil Engineering for the City College of New York, agreed that the George Washington Bridge toll is likely among the higher-cost tolls, but said it’s critical to note why. Paaswell explained that the bridge is important to the regional economy because of the truck and freight traffic that brings goods and services to the area from other parts of the country. The toll cost also helps maintain the structure, he said. And Martin Robins, director emeritus of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, said toll costs in the New York/New Jersey region pay for far more than the bridges operated by both the Port Authority and MTA. He said Weinberg’s claim is "probably true." "The Port Authority not only supports (those toll bridges) but the PATH system and the Port Authority bus system," Robins said. "It wraps them up all in one package and supports that system. The MTA is similar. They support the New York City subway and bus system." Rod Diridon, executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose, Calif., also noted tolls in this region of the country are higher "primarily because of the vitality of industry and the consequential cost of living." "In the heartland, our industries, our businesses have not been so robust as on the coasts," Diridon added. "As a consequence, the cost of everyting is less in the central part of the nation. The cost of tolls is less and the cost of construction is less as well." Our ruling Weinberg said recently about the George Washington Bridge, "We pay among the highest tolls in the nation for the privilege of crossing that bridge." The highest bridge toll in the region belongs to the MTA-operated Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, at $15, but the George Washington span and three others are close behind, at $13. Major toll bridges elsewhere in the country aren’t even close, save for the 17-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, whose $13 toll will jump to $15 on Jan. 1. Experts we spoke with cite varying factors for why the George Washington Bridge’s toll costs what it does, but the bottom line is that Weinberg’s assessment about where the cost ranks nationwide is accurate. We rate her claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Loretta Weinberg	None	None	None	2013-12-08T07:30:00	2013-11-14	['None']
pomt-00843	"The average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year" in grant money.	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/23/peter-barca/does-average-uw-madison-faculty-member-bring-close/	A leading Democrat predicts devastation if Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed $300 million cut over two years to the University of Wisconsin System is adopted. "For UW-Madison it’s a major issue," Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, said in a March 12, 2015 Wisconsin Eye interview. "It’s penny wise and pound foolish there." Barca added: "The average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year. So you cut them and they’re leaving. They have plenty of opportunities to go to Harvard or Princeton or Stanford." Barca was joined on the Wisconsin Eye program by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester. He thinks the university cut is too large, but says Democrats are overreacting. "Let’s remember that the cut that’s happening under Gov. Walker is about the size of the one that happened under (former Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat), and I didn’t hear Democrats complaining about the loss of the university and how the world was going to come to an end." We’ll test Vos’ claim soon. For now, let’s examine Barca’s statement about the prowess of the Madison faculty in attracting research grants. Researching the research When we asked Barca to back up the claim, spokeswoman Laura Smith pointed to a page on the UW-Madison website that answers frequently asked questions about the 2015-’17 budget -- at least from the UW System’s perspective. The page asserts that asking professors to teach more classes -- as Walker suggested -- would cut into critical functions of the university: "Research is central to their jobs. According to university statistics, each faculty member is bringing in approximately $242,000 on average to support their research in a highly competitive national environment. Faculty and staff brought in more than $500 million in federal research awards in 2012-13, money that would not otherwise come to Wisconsin." So there’s Barca’s "close to a quarter million" figure. We asked UW-Madison about the numbers. They are from 2012-13, and were published in March 2014 in the university’s "Data Digest". The document provides a detailed look at various aspects of the campus and is put together by three offices: Academic Planning & Institutional Research, Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Finance & Administration. UW-Madison is one of the leading research institutions in the country as measured by total grants from outside sources, mostly the federal government. Out of its 2,173 faculty members, 1,275 (or 59 percent) secured research grants in 2012-13, the latest year available. So there’s a point of clarification: Barca frames his claim around the idea that any cuts will hurt the university’s ability to bring in research money. But in the year examined, 41 percent did not bring in grants. The university says it uses the total number of faculty when calculating the per-professor grant haul because all faculty members are expected to do research. In all, professors pulled in a total of $525.7 million in grants from outside sources. The grants are in these areas: biological sciences, humanities, physical sciences, social sciences. Spread over 2,173 faculty, that’s the $242,000 figure. If you spread it out over just the faculty receiving grants, the average is $412,000. Jocelyn Milner, a UW official who helps prepare the "Data Digest," told us that grant productivity is calculated in another way as well. There’s another $355 million in grants that are not awarded to individual professors, but to a dean or other official even though professors end up doing the research. When you add those in the per-faculty grant figure rises to $399,000 per year, Milner said. UW prefers the more conservative methodology that is behind the $241,935 figure, Milner said. We found that ranking universities on research prowess often turns on how much money they pull in. There are other factors that can help judge research prominence, such as journal articles published, endowment assets, faculty awards, and so on. Our rating Barca said, "The average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year." He referred to research grants won. UW-Madison figures back up the claim, but there’s one point of clarification, in that not all faculty get grants. We rate Barca’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13349	Even our attorney general who is a strong Democrat, she has said that we need causation in our workers’ comp system. That’s the No. 1 thing pushing our manufacturing jobs out of Illinois.	/illinois/statements/2016/oct/03/bruce-rauner/bruce-rauner-pits-father-against-daughter-illinois/	For more than a year, Illinois has been gripped by political gridlock that’s left it operating with no state budget and on pace to finish 2016 in the worst financial condition in state history. Fueling the standoff is a dispute between Gov. Bruce Rauner -- a Republican serving his first term in any elected office -- and House Speaker Michael Madigan -- a Democrat and the state’s most powerful and longest-serving politician -- over how to revive the state’s economy. One of the biggest points of contention is Rauner’s complaint that the state’s workers’ compensation insurance rates are among the highest in the nation and are chasing manufacturing jobs out of Illinois. Indeed, the latest numbers from the Illinois Department of Employment Security show the state lost 11,800 manufacturing jobs from August 2015 to August 2016. In addition to being Rauner’s political nemesis, Madigan also is the father of Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan. That’s why one statement Rauner made during a press conference on Sept. 19 struck us as noteworthy: "Even our attorney general who is a strong Democrat, she has said that we need causation in our workers’ comp system. That’s the No. 1 thing pushing our manufacturing jobs out of Illinois," Rauner said. Is Attorney General Lisa Madigan, who is a Democrat and also the daughter of Rauner’s arch political rival, on the Republican governor’s side on this issue? We decided to check. ‘Causation’ clash Rauner believes the current system for compensating workers who are injured on the job is too lenient, and gives businesses no way to defend themselves against claims of workplace injuries that may be only minimally work-related or not at all. Under Illinois law, if the workplace is involved in any way with an injury, even indirectly, the employer -- usually through its insurance -- bears responsibility for the workers’ compensation claim. Rauner wants Illinois to adopt a law in which the workplace must be at least 50 percent responsible for the injury for the employee to qualify for a workers’ compensation claim. In legal terms, he wants to increase the standard of "causation." Speaker Madigan has said, repeatedly, that Rauner’s system would "send injured workers to welfare and the emergency room." The evidence The basis for Rauner’s claim is a 2012 opinion from the Attorney General’s Office with the catchy title, "Background on Workers’ Compensation Claims Filed by State Employees and Reforms Proposed by the Office of the Attorney General." The administration did not respond to three requests for verification that Rauner based his statement on this document. This opinion has been cited for years by advocates of a stricter standard. Issued in March 2012, the 23-page document provides an exhaustive look at problems in the workers’ compensation system from the perspective of the attorney general -- who acts as the defense attorney for the state when state employees file on-the-job injury claims. "In defending against workers’ compensation claims, the State is in a position similar to private employers," the opinion says in its introduction. The document is chock full of incidents in which employees are awarded workers’ compensation benefits after suffering injuries in ridiculous circumstances. (One example: A Circuit City employee "was injured when he threw himself up against a vending machine in an attempt to dislodge a bag of Fritos.") The opinion came out at a time when a bill in the General Assembly proposed a reform similar to what Rauner calls for in his turnaround plan. "To protect taxpayer dollars, the legislature must address and change the causation standard that is currently applied by the (Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission) and the courts," the opinion states. "Senate Bill 2521 addresses the causation standard and provides an opportunity to discuss the appropriate language to make this needed change." That’s not an out-and-out endorsement of every detail within the bill in question (which died quietly in committee without ever being voted upon), but it certainly encourages lawmakers to take up the issue. Then and now But that was in early 2012, when Illinois was in another political epoch. Rauner was an unknown to most Illinoisans, and Democrats were in their 10th year of controlling both the governor’s office and both chambers of the General Assembly. Rauner’s 2014 election hit the political landscape like a tsunami, and partisan tension never has been higher than it is now. Does Lisa Madigan still believe "we need causation in our workers’ comp system," as Rauner claims? "We do support changing the standard and strengthening it, but we have not laid out a new standard," said Ann Spillane, Lisa Madigan’s chief of staff. "From our perspective, there ought to be reasonable ways to change the standard that would not damage the purpose of workers’ compensation to ensure that employees who are injured on the job can fully recover." So far, though, there’s been no discussion between Rauner and the General Assembly about "reasonable ways." Our ruling Rauner said, "Even our attorney general who is a strong Democrat, she has said that we need causation in our workers’ comp system." In 2012, Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s office went on record in considerable detail about the problems caused by Illinois’ lenient burden of proof for workers claiming workplace injury. The attorney general didn’t explicitly endorse the causation standard contained in a bill before the General Assembly at that time, but said the bill "provides an opportunity to discuss the appropriate language to make this needed change." Today, even as this issue has become a focal point in Rauner’s deadlock with Speaker Madigan, Attorney General Madigan’s office maintains that the state should find "reasonable ways" to protect the rights of injured workers and employers. We rate Rauner’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4d40d9ba-0159-4404-a764-69d792bbe061	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2016-10-03T15:43:28	2016-09-19	['Illinois', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-10505	"I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/26/mike-gravel/hes-in-the-race/	Former U.S. Sen. Mike Gravel, 77, returned from oblivion to a momentary spot on the national stage when he announced March 26, 2008, that he had joined the Libertarian Party. But the central question of his candidacy — is it one? — remained. Earlier that month he put a video on YouTube complaining that the site's YouChoose page no longer featured him. "Apparently I've been relegated to a footnote at YouTube," Gravel says in the video. "I'm one of three candidates in the presidential race, Obama, Hillary and myself. I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn." PolitiFact set out to confirm Gravel's status. We started by checking to see if Gravel was on the ballot in any of the upcoming Democratic nominating contests. Some state officials had no idea who we were asking about. "Could you spell that?" asked Bowen Greenwood, communications director for the secretary of state of Montana (primary, June 3). Greenwood went to check and came back with: "The elections folks tell me they've never heard of him. I confess, I've never heard of him either." West Virginia (May 13) had not heard from him. Neither had South Dakota (June 3). Puerto Rico (June 1) was finalizing its candidate list, but didn't expect Gravel to be on it. And in Guam (May 3), Tony Charfauros, chairman of the Democratic Party, said: "Are you talking about Mike Gravel who used to be a candidate for president?" Gravel told us he's on the ballot in North Carolina (May 6) and Oregon (May 20). Turns out he is confirmed for the North Carolina primary, but not Oregon. Scott Moore, chief of communications for the Oregon secretary of state, told us they would have been happy to put Gravel on the ballot, but his campaign never filed the paperwork. He's also not on the ballot in Pennsylvania (April 22), Indiana (May 6) or Kentucky (May 20). Adding it all up, Gravel is on the ballot in just one of the 10 remaining contests. We also determined that Gravel has zero delegates, virtually no fundraising and a campaign staff that amounts to "the better part of about a half dozen people," according to deputy campaign manager Jon Kraus. So, is Gravel still a candidate? He is. Just not for the Democrats. Gravel said he "has pretty much had it" with the Democrats and thinks they have cut their ties to him.

pomt-02386	Says Ronald Reagan "got the Saudis to flood the market with cheap oil."	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/13/michael-reagan/ronald-reagans-son-says-his-father-got-saudis-pump/	The Cold War is back. Or at least, some version of it has returned, with Russian troops on the move across the Crimean Peninsula with the oddsmakers predicting it will once again be Russian territory. For critics of President Barack Obama, this is a prime opportunity to demonstrate how poorly he stacks up compared with the man who did all he could to topple the Soviet Union, President Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s son, Michael Reagan, offered this advice for Obama on the Townhall.com website: "I suggest that President Obama might want to study how Ronald Reagan defeated the Soviet Union. "He did it without firing a shot, as we know, but he had a super weapon -- oil. "Oil was the only thing the Soviets had in the 1980s that anyone in the rest of the world wanted to buy, besides ICBMs and H-bombs, and they weren't for sale. "Since selling oil was the source of the Kremlin's wealth, my father got the Saudis to flood the market with cheap oil. "Lower oil prices devalued the ruble, causing the USSR to go bankrupt, which led to perestroika and Mikhail Gorbachev and the collapse of the Soviet Empire." It seems like a reasonable narrative, but as we’ll see in this fact-check, the record isn’t quite as robust as Reagan fils might like. We made several efforts to reach Reagan for official records that would back up his claim, and we did not hear back. The basic oil market numbers We can see what happened with oil markets during Reagan's time in office by looking at volume -- how much was pumped out of the ground -- and price. The U.S. Energy Information Administration provides the production numbers, and what we see partly backs up Reagan’s point and partly does not. Total Oil Supply (Thousand Barrels Per Day) For the first five years of Reagan’s administration, Saudi production fell steeply. Then in 1986 it popped up, followed by a dip the next year, and ending with another rise. The Energy Information Administration also provides pricing data and it too both supports and undercuts Reagan’s statement. Prices fall in 1986, then recover in 1987 followed by a decline in 1988. Prices remained below what they had been in 1985. Spot price: Cushing OK WTI By several estimates, the drop in prices cost the USSR $20 billion a year. If the plan was to hurt the Soviet Union, it succeeded. What is unclear is whether the Saudis ramped up production at Reagan’s request. We look at what the record shows on that front. The evidence in support of Reagan intervention Paul Kengor is a Reagan biographer who believes the Gipper has not received the credit he is due for waging economic warfare against the USSR. Kengor told PunditFact that Michael Reagan is correct when he says his father was behind the Saudi’s decision. "They did this strictly to help us hurt the Soviets and as payback for us helping them in the past," Kengor said. "It was a big risk for them." Kengor pointed us to the book Victory: The Reagan administration’s secret strategy that hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union, by Peter Schweizer. In that book, Schweizer describes a 1981 meeting between CIA director William Casey and his Saudi counterpart. At that meeting, Casey shared CIA reports on Soviet oil production. "By raising the issues of oil prices and the U.S.-Saudi Arabia security relationship in the same conversation," Casey was in effect saying the two were related," Schweizer wrote. Schweizer cites an unnamed U.S. official for this information. A former National Security Council official referred to Casey’s contacts with Saudi Arabia during a recent panel discussion but in less detail than in Schweizer’s book. But move forward to 1985, when the Saudis actually made their production hike, and Schweizer wrote, "What factor lay most heavily on the mind of the Saudis when they made this decision is anybody’s guess." We asked Kengor for the best documentation they could find to support the claim of Reagan’s direct intervention. We have yet to receive that. However, there is an ample public record on the factors within OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, that shaped the Saudi Arabian production strategy. Plus, the Reagan administration made efforts to push prices back up. We turn now to the information that tends to undermine Reagan’s assertion. The evidence against James Williams is an Arkansas-based consulting economist in the oil and gas industry who worked with producers in West Texas in the 1980s. Williams told us that in the first half of the decade, OPEC had an agreement to keep prices high through a system of production quotas. Members promised to limit the number of barrels they would pump. With less supply, prices would be higher. "The Saudi Arabians were dropping production faster than the rest of OPEC," Williams said. "They bore a disproportionate share of the effort to prop up prices." The problem was, not every member followed the rules. There are many references in the public record of Saudi resentment. Economist Darwin Hall at the California State University at Long Beach described it in a 1992 article in Energy Policy. "At the OPEC meetings in Geneva during the period from 1982 to 1985, Sheikh Yamani, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia at the time, repeatedly threatened to expand output unless Iraq and Iran stopped cheating on their agreed quotas," Hall wrote. (Iran and Iraq were at war and needed foreign currency to finance their militaries.) While OPEC wielded considerable clout on world energy markets, internally, it had no way to enforce the terms among its signatories. Philip Verlager, an energy consultant, said Saudi Arabia had more oil capacity than anyone and so had more power. "From 1981 to the end of 1985, Saudi Arabia took on the swing producer role in OPEC," Verleger told PunditFact. "Then in 1986, they threw in the towel and prices collapsed." In six months, the spot price for oil was cut in half. Verleger said Michael Reagan "is wrong." He and many other writers say the Saudis boosted production to send a message to other OPEC members. Another bit of information from Saudi Arabia also undercuts the Reagan claim. Dick Combs, a foreign service officer and author of Inside the Soviet Alternate Universe, noted that Saudi King Fahd was not a strong supporter of the shift in 1986. He fired his oil minister and cut back "domestic oil production to enhance Saudi revenues." If the Reagan doctrine was to keep prices as low as possible, U.S. actions weren’t always consistent with that goal. As prices fell, the U.S. oil industry collapsed. "In April 1986, Reagan sent (Vice President George H.W.) Bush to Saudi Arabia to get the Saudis to cut production to bring prices up," Verlager said. According to newspapers at the time, Bush told King Fahd that the United States saw the hit on the domestic oil market as "a threat to national security." Our ruling Michael Reagan said his father got Saudi Arabia to flood the market with oil in order to drive down prices and undermine the Soviet economy. The numbers on production and pricing show that Saudi production rose, then fell, and then rose again. In the middle of 1987, prices were close to what they had been at the beginning of 1986, although they fell again and never went as high as they had been in 1985. The pattern of production and prices do not fit neatly with Reagan’s statement. We have no public documents to confirm that Reagan asked the Saudis to use oil as an economic weapon against the USSR. On the other hand, we have an extensive public record that Saudi Arabia was fighting with its OPEC partners and had warned them for years that it would raise production to make them pay a price for cheating on their quotas. We also see that Saudi Arabia charted its own course in setting oil prices and the consensus view among oil experts is OPEC, not Reagan, shaped their production decisions. Finally, we have Bush calling on the Saudis to help send prices back up. This is exactly counter to the Reagan strategy in the statement. There might be an element of truth in the claim, but the public record strongly points the other way. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-12871	"My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/donald-trump/why-comparing-trumps-and-obamas-immigration-restri/	After a weekend of nationwide demonstrations in protest of immigration restrictions on entry from seven nations, President Donald Trump blamed the media for misreporting his controversial executive order and said it was an extension of former President Barack Obama’s policies. "My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror," Trump wrote in a Jan. 29 statement. "To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting." To refresh, Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27 barring citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days. It also puts Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. (We go over some of the key issues in this explainer.) In 2011, Obama’s state department stopped processing Iraqi refugee requests for six months, though it didn’t disclose the policy like Trump did, ABC reported in 2013. So, are the policies similar as Trump claimed? In the most superficial of ways, yes. They both limit immigration into the United States on a temporary basis. But there are two significant differences that Trump omits. In 2011, there was a specific threat First, Obama’s suspension was in direct response to a failed plot by Iraqi nationals living in Bowling Green, Ky., to send money, explosives and weapons to al-Qaida. The two men were arrested by the FBI in May 2011 for actions committed in Iraq and trying to assist overseas terrorist groups. Both had entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork. One man worked as a bombmaker in Iraq, and the FBI even matched his fingerprints to an unexploded IED discovered in 2005 in Iraq, raising questions about the thoroughness of the vetting process. Trump’s ban, meanwhile, is more preemptive. As PolitiFact reported, no refugee or immigrant from any of the seven countries targeted by the ban has been implicated in any fatal terrorist attack in the United States, though perpetrators of at least three non-deadly cases were connected to Iran or Somalia. Obama’s order was narrower in scope Second, the scope of the two policies is slightly different. Obama’s 2011 order put a pause on refugee processing, whereas Trump’s halt in entries applies to all non-U.S. visitors. It should also be noted that Iraqi refugees were still admitted to the United States every month in 2011, though there was a significant drop after May of that year. Here’s a chart with data from the state department: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com According to the New York Times, the Obama administration also required new background checks for visa applicants from Iraq after the Bowling Green incident. Lawmakers at a 2012 congressional hearing also indicated that the Department of Homeland Security expanded screening to the Iraqi refugees already settled in the United States. But again, these are different from a blanket ban on visitors. Obama, speaking through a spokesperson, disagreed with the comparison in a statement. There are other precedents for temporary halts in immigration. A 2016 Congressional Research Service report notes that refugee admissions were also briefly suspended after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack to review the security procedures, leading to an overhaul of the system. A special subset of refugee admissions for reuniting families was suspended in 2008 in certain locations in Africa after higher rates of fraud. So like Obama’s 2011 suspension, both the post-9/11 and African cases were in reaction to immediate issues and limited to refugees. Trump’s order is broader, and his administration has provided no evidence it is in response to any particular event. The seven countries on Trump’s list While not necessarily part of this fact-check, Trump’s suggestion that he selected the seven countries as a continuation of Obama’s policy is imprecise. According to the executive order, Trump’s action applies to "countries designated pursuant to Division O, Title II, Section 203 of the 2016 consolidated Appropriations Act." That refers to a 2015 act, signed into law by Obama, revising the United States’ visa waiver program. The visa waiver program allows citizens from 38 countries to enter the United States without a visa for up to 90 days. Under the legislation, citizens of those 38 countries who had traveled to Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan after March 2011 were no longer eligible for the visa waiver. Libya, Yemen, and Somalia were later added to the list. In other words, Obama’s actions dealt with people who had visited Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, not citizens of those countries, and it did not prohibit them from entering the United States. Our ruling Trump said, "My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months." The Obama administration in 2011 delayed processing Iraqi refugees for six months following evidence of a failed plot by two Iraqi refugees. Trump’s executive order temporarily bars travel to the United States for all citizens from seven countries, and it is not in direct response to actions from citizens of those countries. Furthermore, Iraqi refugees were nonetheless admitted to the United States during the 2011 suspension while Trump has put an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-14311	"Florida is investing record amounts of funding for HIV/AIDS prevention."	/florida/statements/2016/mar/31/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-makes-misleading-claim-about-record/	Asked to explain a discrepancy in the state's number of new HIV cases, Florida Gov. Rick Scott only crowed about how much is being spent on prevention programs. Florida had the dubious distinction of leading the nation in new HIV cases a few months ago, even as the country’s overall trend was declining. Then the Department of Health’s division of disease control revised the numbers, which is a routine practice to get rid of duplicate entries and so forth. But the Tampa Bay Times found that the adjusted total showed only a slight increase in the number of new cases reported since Scott took office in 2011, putting Florida behind California and Texas. The revisions erased one in four cases in 2014, an unprecedented drop that led experts to question the extent of the changes. When the Times asked Scott’s office why the figures were revised so drastically, spokesman John Tupps said only that Scott is "proud that Florida is investing record amounts of funding for HIV/AIDS prevention." For this fact-check, we are putting Scott to the Truth-O-Meter, and not his spokesman, because this has become a talking point of his administration. Scott made a similar claim in a news release after he signed the 2016-17 budget, saying that "last year, Florida invested a record $34 million in HIV/AIDS prevention." Leaving alone the health department’s self-editing for a moment, could it be that the state has spent a record amount combatting HIV/AIDS? Well, the state health department did get more funding for prevention programs in 2015 than ever before. But almost all of that money came from the federal government, not Florida. Federal aid for AIDS prevention Scott is pretty uneven in his distaste for using federal taxpayer money. He has refused $2.4 billion to build a high-speed rail line between Tampa and Orlando and opposed Medicaid expansion under Obamacare because he thought it was too expensive for the state. Meanwhile, he has pleaded for federal disaster declarations and sued Washington for not renewing the Low Income Pool, a temporary pot of federal money used mostly to pay for indigent hospital patients. That brings us to his boast of record prevention program spending. His office directed us to the health department, which cited the same amount. The word choice is interesting, because "investing" makes it sound like the state of Florida is spending tens of millions of its own dollars to address a public health crisis. That $34 million, however, is all from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not state coffers. The money is part of an awards process that gives cash to state health departments and some cities that apply for help with curbing HIV/AIDS cases. The CDC awards are for programs like HIV testing, services for HIV-positive patients and their partners, condom distribution and more. It’s not unusual for Florida to be getting money from the federal government for this purpose. The CDC provides most of this funding because the agency is in charge of monitoring and fighting infectious diseases, according to Emily McCloskey, senior manager for policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors. The CDC is the primary source of money to deal with HIV and AIDS, but also other STDs and conditions like hepatitis, tuberculosis, diabetes, arthritis and obesity. Technically, the pot of money at issue is split between prevention programs and testing. Other awards for different programs not included in the total can be obtained in different ways, including directly through county health departments and community based organizations. But as you can see, the amount Scott is touting has indeed gone up: Year Amount awarded by CDC 2011 $19.4 million 2012 $28.3 million 2013 $30.6 million 2014 $33 million 2015 $34 million 2016 $34.8 million Sources: CDC, Florida Department of Health, National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors Florida does add some of its own money to assist with these services. Health department spokeswoman Mara Gambineri told us that an additional $1.4 million in state funding for 2015 was meant "for a prevention program that includes a public awareness campaign, to operate the HIV hotline and for four targeted outreach coordinators." When Scott signed the 2016-17 budget just passed by the Legislature, he noted the state contribution for HIV/AIDS services was upped to $1.65 million — out of a total state budget of $82 billion. Of course, a higher total from the CDC isn’t necessarily because the state showed more commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention. As one of the most populous states, it received more CDC funding than any other state except New York and California in 2015. Florida also has a pronounced problem with HIV infections, as the controversy with the state health department’s revisions shows. McCloskey said the CDC overhauled how it awarded grants for the 2012 fiscal year. That accounted not only for the big jump between 2011 and 2012, but affected subsequent years as well. (This particular grant process is due to be revised for 2017.) "CDC reviewed their funding allocations and formulas and redid the formulas to allocate more funding to states with the largest impact," she said. "That is why Florida has received more funding." The cash Scott is talking about is awarded based on need, taking into account infection rates and patient population, among other factors. The state does have to apply, but the CDC calculates how much Florida gets. In short, the state has been getting (and spending) more money from the federal government because Florida has needed the help. Our ruling Scott said, "Florida is investing record amounts of funding for HIV/AIDS prevention." There is more money than ever being provided for HIV/AIDS prevention programs, but it’s not because the state has been focused on appropriating millions. The funding to which he is referring is almost entirely coming from the CDC. The state kicks in a little cash, but it’s less than 5 percent of what the federal government supplies. Scott also neglects to mention that the primary reason the amount has increased is because HIV infection rates have gone up in Florida. There’s a grain of truth in the soundbite, but Scott ignores context and obscures facts that would lead to a very different impression about an important public health issue. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2016-03-31T14:57:43	2016-03-26	['HIV/AIDS']
pomt-00161	Democrats pledged to "force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme" that would cost $72 billion.	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/23/north-carolina-republican-party/nc-gop-falsely-ties-dozens-democrats-single-payer-/	No matter where you live in North Carolina, you’re likely to receive a political mailer about health care. Democratic candidates in North Carolina say the GOP-controlled state legislature hasn’t done enough to improve health care. They say Republicans should at the very least expand Medicaid, which experts have said could help cover up to 500,000 people in the state. Republicans’ main defense is that expanding Medicaid is too expensive and that Democrats want to go several steps further than that. An ad campaign by the state Republican Party says Democrats have a "radical" health care agenda that will "destroy our economy, kill our jobs, take more of your hard-earned dollars in taxes, and infringe on your personal freedoms." The NC GOP attack on Democrats, which includes digital ads and mailers in districts across the state, is summarized on RadicalDemAgenda.com. The party has purchased internet domain names of Democratic candidates — such as JulieVonHaefen.com — to reach voters. Republican candidates are using the same messaging in ads they pay for. The GOP claim is two-pronged. First, that "55 liberal members and candidates of the North Carolina Democratic House Caucus signed a pledge to enact an extreme, far-left healthcare agenda." Second, that "part of their health care agenda is to force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme. The non-partisan North Carolina General Assembly Fiscal Research staff calculated it would cost North Carolina $72 billion and force all residents to give up their current health care plan." Did Democrats "pledge" to "force" North Carolinians into a single-payer health system that would cost $72 billion? Let’s break it down. Single-payer health care The term "single-payer" refers to a health insurance system in which the federal government, rather than private insurers, pays all medical expenses. The NC GOP’s claim about a single-payer plan refers to a bill, HB 916, introduced last year that would have studied the cost of creating a single-payer health system. Bill sponsors included House Democrats Cecil Brockman, Verla Insko, Larry Bell, Jean Farmer-Butterfield, Susan Fisher, Charles Graham, Pricey Harrison, Yvonne Holley, Garland Pierce and Bobbie Richardson. It was ignored until this June, when Republican leaders moved it into a committee. Rep. David Lewis, a Republican from Harnett County, then asked the nonpartisan fiscal research staff to calculate the cost of a single-payer health care system in North Carolina. That’s when Insko moved to kill it, saying any analysis of the bill should’ve been completed by the end of last year. It’s also when Richardson took her name off the bill because she didn’t want to be a part of the GOP’s "political game," according to her campaign manager, Taylor Grady-Daly. The cost of a single-payer plan would likely exceed $72 billion per year, according to legislative staff. About $30.1 billion could be paid for with federal dollars, but North Carolina would be responsible for $41.89 billion — nearly double the current general fund budget, The N&O reported. The two-page bill merely directs the legislature to study a single-payer system that its sponsors would like to implement, but the bill doesn’t implement that system on its own. PolitiFact asked the fiscal research staff whether such a system would "force" North Carolinians into a single-payer plan. "The Plan described in the bill does not seem to kick anyone off their current insurance, but it also says ‘all residents shall be covered so I would expect most people would voluntarily drop their existing coverage rather than pay for double coverage," said David Vanderweide, a fiscal researcher for the N.C. legislature. While the bill was introduced by nine Democrats, a single-payer health care plan isn’t in the N.C. Democratic Party platform, spokesman Robert Howard noted. Neither is the pledge Republicans reference, Howard added. A pledge: ‘Universal, affordable health care’ The GOP ad refers to a platform pushed by Future Now, a left-leaning advocacy group. The group has seven main goals, which are listed at FutureNow.org and AmericasGoals.org. One of the goals is "affordable, quality healthcare." As part of this goal, the group wants to see "universal, affordable health coverage with a cap on out-of-pocket expenses." The group thinks reaching this goal could ultimately end hunger and boost life expectancy rates to 84 years. The GOP ad mentions 55 people who signed the pledge to work toward the Future Now goals. The true number is even higher, according to Future Now spokeswoman Alyssa Cass. More than 65 House members are listed on the Future Now website. As for the pledge, there’s an important distinction to be made between single-payer health care and universal health care, said Daniel Squadron, Future Now executive director. One refers to who’s paying for the coverage, while the other refers to how many people are covered. It’s not fair to equate Future Now’s goals with a bill exploring single-payer health care, Squadron said. Future Now supports expanding Medicaid in North Carolina but hasn’t endorsed any specific legislation, Squadron said, adding that the GOP is distorting the truth about his group to scare North Carolinians out of voting for Democrats. "I would’ve thought that the idea of people across the country having access to health care wouldn’t be controversial," he said. "Apparently for the GOP attacking it, that’s not a valuable goal worth working towards, so that’s surprising and disturbing." Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, pushed back at the notion that Future Now doesn’t or wouldn’t support a single-payer health care system. Future Now’s founder, Jeffrey Sachs, wrote an op-ed for CNN advocating for a "Medicare for All" system along the lines of what Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed — a single payer plan. "The economics of Medicare for All championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders are actually quite straightforward," Sachs wrote. "Under what advocates call ‘M4A,’ health care coverage would expand while total spending on health care — by companies, individuals and the government — would decline because of lower costs. More would be paid through the government and less through private insurers." Woodhouse noted that Squadron, for his part, praised a single-payer health care proposal when he was a state senator in New York and chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Group. Those statements by Sachs and Squadron, Woodhouse said in an email, show that Democrats "have signed a pledge to enact universal health care coverage, which by the founders’ own stated opinion would be a single-payer system. All North Carolinians would be forced through massive tax increases to pay into Insko’s radical single-payer proposal." While Woodhouse argues the terms "single-payer," "Medicare for all" and "universal health care" all mean the same thing, each term can have a different meaning. The Vox.com news site noted that public support varies for each term. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found a majority of respondents have favorable views of "Medicare for all" and "universal health care." The term "single-payer," which appears most often in the GOP ads, got far less support. Our ruling The N.C. GOP says part of the Democrats’ agenda is to "force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme" that would cost $72 billion. As for implementing a single-payer healthcare system, the GOP is right about the potential cost. But they’re misleading voters about what the bill would do, who supported it and what the Future Now pledge represents. The bill directed a study — not implementation of a single-payer health system. It was sponsored by 10 Democrats and hasn’t been pushed by the party as a whole. The Future Now pledge, meanwhile, doesn’t specifically endorse a single-payer health care system. We rate this claim False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

pomt-14645	Says Cresent Hardy agreed with Mitt Romney "about the 47 percent" and said that "people with disabilities are, and I quote him, ‘a drain on society.’ "	/nevada/statements/2016/jan/25/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-partially-accurate-campaiging-agai/	For a first-term congressman, U.S. Rep. Cresent Hardy seems to constantly be in hot water. Part of the reason is that as a Republican representative of a district that leans Democratic, Hardy holds a seat considered likely to flip in 2016, with a competitive four-person Democratic primary currently underway. The other reason? Hardy, a former state Assemblyman, has gained a reputation for stumbling when speaking off the cuff. Several of Hardy’s comments resurfaced during former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s stump speech during a Democratic event in Las Vegas on Jan. 6. Here’s what Clinton said in full: "You even have a Republican Congressman, Mr. Hardy, who says that Mitt Romney was right about the 47 percent and that people with disabilities are, and I quote him, 'a drain on society.' " Because challengers to Hardy and now Clinton have repeatedly slammed him for this, we thought it was worth revisiting his comments. Let’s break this claim into two parts -- the "47 percent" claim and the disabilities claim. Clinton’s claims connecting Hardy with 2012 Republican front runner Mitt Romney’s infamous "47 percent" comments are largely accurate. Hardy made the comments during a September 2014 campaign meet-and-greet with voters at a private golf club in rural Mesquite. Video from the event shows Hardy responding to a question about the comparable sizes of the federal and private sectors by referring back to Romney’s "47 percent" remarks. "Can I say that without getting in trouble like Gov. Romney?" Hardy said. "The 47 percent is true. It’s bigger now." Hardy at the time refused to back down from the statement, saying "Nevada has a long history of politicians willing to speak their mind, and if these comments lead Nevada voters to throw out everyone who has ever made a gaffe, I will proudly mark my calendar for Harry Reid’s retirement." So it’s accurate to say that Hardy and Romney match up on the "47 percent" comment. But Clinton’s claim becomes much more convoluted over Hardy’s comments on people with disabilities. A Democratic campaign tracker recorded audio of Hardy making the comments in question on May 30, 2015, during a Libertarian Party event at the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel casino. The video quality is rather poor, and coupled with Hardy’s tendency to trip over words, it’s difficult to clearly understand. Here’s our transcription: "I had three children: One was summa cum laude and two were magnum cum laude, and the other didn’t need an education, he works for Raytheon and is smarter than all the rest because he works hard. He builds things that are genius, and some people have that ability and I’m grateful [inaudible] I don’t know where that came from. But they all work hard. They’re raising their own families. They’re doing their own thing. They will not be a drain on society, the best they can. Hopefully they never have some disability that causes them to have to utilize that." Clearly, nobody is going to mistake Hardy for Shakespeare. And it does seem that Hardy is insinuating having a disability might cause them to be a "drain on society,’ but his wording is unclear enough to pin down what he exactly means. But Clinton’s line makes it appear that Hardy is directly saying that people with disabilities are a drain on society, which certainly isn’t the case as he never directly states that. Hardy’s campaign consultant told PolitiFact in an email that the Congressman is a strident supporter of people with disabilities, and scolded Clinton for taking the remarks out of context. "The fact that anyone, let alone a candidate for the highest office in the land, would suggest that someone else was actually against the disabled -- just to get some cheap applause from a partisan crowd -- is sickening and sad," campaign consultant Ryan Erwin said in an email. Clinton’s campaign in Nevada declined to comment further than referring to Hardy’s full remarks. Hardy, both before and after the event, has a history of supporting programs for people with disabilities. His office funded a pool day for children with autism in August, after the comments were published, and his campaign released several letters to PolitiFact supportive of Hardy. Hardy has also been a longtime supporter of the Las Vegas-based Opportunity Village, a nonprofit groups dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities find job training and work. The group’s former CEO, Ed Guthrie, said Hardy has attended events and helped facilitate contracts between the nonprofit and businesses in his district. "He’s always been supportive," Guthrie said. "We have no issue with the congressman. If he was misunderstood or if something was taken out of context or if he misspoke, the overwhelming body of evidence as a congressman and Assembly member shows he really does support people with intellectual disabilities and organizations like Opportunity Village." Clinton is spot on in linking Hardy and Romney on the 47 percent comments, yet she’s off in criticizing him over supposed comments on people with disabilities. Because there are so many issues with the second part of Clinton’s claim, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-01-25T13:57:23	2016-01-06	['None']
pomt-07874	"I lowered taxes over the last two years."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-he-lowered-taxes-over-past-two-y/	In an interview on Super Bowl Sunday, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked President Barack Obama to react to a Wall Street Journal editorial that accused Obama of being "a determined man of the left whose goal is to redistribute much larger levels of income across society." "Do you deny that you are a man who wants to redistribute wealth?" O'Reilly asked. Obama first noted the robust conservatism of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, then denied the charge "absolutely." "I didn't raise taxes once. I lowered taxes over the last two years," Obama said. We wanted to fact-check that statement, and we'll begin by saying Obama boils down an awful lot of complexity about federal tax policy into a short sound bite. Looking at the whole statement, he's both right and wrong. For clarity's sake, we're going to take Obama's statement in two parts. Here, we'll look at his statement, "I lowered taxes over the last two years." In a separate report, we checked the statement, "I didn't raise taxes once" and rated it False. Obama has raised taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning, and the health care law includes a tax penalty on the uninsured. The health care law also includes new taxes on the wealthy, increasing the rates they pay on Medicare hospital taxes starting in 2013. For this one, we'll begin by noting that Obama has not raised income tax rates. Obama and Senate Republicans compromised on tax legislation at the end of 2010, leaving in place the same income tax rates for all tax brackets. (The extensions were necessary because the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush would otherwise have increased last month.) It's also true that Obama has successfully supported tax reductions for workers who make less than $200,000 a year or couples who make less than $250,000. Obama kicked off his tax cuts for workers with the economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. He asked for tax cuts of $500 per worker per year; Congress agreed to $400. The tax cuts -- called Making Work Pay -- were implemented in early 2009 and people saw small increases in their paychecks. The Obama administration liked giving people the money in their paychecks every week or two -- as opposed to mailing one big check -- because administration economists thought people would be more likely to spend the money and stimulate the economy. But the increases were small enough that a lot of people didn't notice them. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in September showed that fewer than one in 10 people knew that the Obama administration had lowered taxes for American workers. Those tax cuts expired at the end of 2010. But as part of last fall's tax compromise with Republicans, Obama won a different type of tax cut for workers: a 2 percent reduction in payroll taxes that go to Social Security. Keep in mind that normally workers pay 6.2 percent in payroll taxes on up to $106,800 of their earnings. (Employers pay another 6.2 percent, while the self-employed are generally on the hook for the full 12.4 percent.) The new tax cut means workers will pay only 4.2 percent of their earnings. So that lowered taxes for workers. Generally speaking, people who make more than $20,000 will get an even bigger tax cut than they did under Making Work Pay. (Workers who makes less than $20,000 will likely be worse off, but they'll still be paying lower taxes than in 2008.) The tax compromise was a complicated piece of legislation, and not everybody ended up better off. Nevertheless, about 80 percent of tax payers end up with a tax cut under the deal, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. And the broad-based tax cuts on income are significantly larger than the new excise taxes, said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center. So yes, a majority of Americans have seen reduced taxes under President Obama. But he's also taken steps to increase a few taxes like cigarettes and tanning over the past two years. Overall, we find his statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-02-07T16:38:47	2011-02-06	['None']
pomt-01818	On immigration reform	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/21/ed-gillespie/ed-gillespies-immigration-reform-position-remains-/	Republican Ed Gillespie was gung-ho about comprehensive immigration reform in June 2013 -- just days before the U.S. Senate passed the so-called "Gang of Eight" bill that would bolster border security and provide a pathway to citizenship for 12 million people who entered the country illegally. "I don’t think that the Gang of Eight bill is a perfect bill, no one does," Gillespie said during an interview with Larry Kudlow on CNBC. "But it is the right approach, and it can be perfected. This amendment on the border surge will help to do that. But at the end of the day, it’s good policy and it is good politics." Now, let’s fast-forward to this year as Gillespie revs up his campaign to unseat Democrat Mark Warner in the U.S. Senate. The Republican-led House has refused to take up the immigration bill and Gillespie says that’s fine with him. "It’s unlikely that it’s going to occur during an election year and, frankly, I don’t think it should at this point," he said in April. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, went a step further in a June 13 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. He said Gillespie opposes the bill and opposes citizenship for illegal immigrants. Warner’s campaign sent us the statements with a suggestion that his opponent’s position on comprehensive immigration reform has changed. That thought has been echoed by Bloomberg.com, which has written that Gillespie is taking "a different stand" on immigration this year. Logan says Gillespie’s stance has remained constant. So we decided to roll out the Flip-O-Meter and take a look. Gillespie in 2006 Immigration reform has long been impeded by a central debate: Many conservatives say the U.S. should focus on border control and enforcement of deportation laws; many liberals say policies should include a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who otherwise have exemplary records obeying U.S. laws. Gillespie for years has endorsed a compromise. Records shown that since at least 2006, he’s called for strong border control combined with a path toward legal U.S. residency -- not citizenship -- for immigrants who have obeyed laws since entering the country and are self-sufficient. Gillespie, in a 2006 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, wrote that those who came to the U.S. illegally "should not be rewarded with citizenship," but added that "a rational immigration policy that allows workers to enter and exit this country for temporary employment will make us more secure." He wrote that an expanded visa program would ease the workload of law enforcement officials, expand tax rolls and provide needed workers in agriculture and technology. Gillespie, who had recently stepped down as chairman of the Republican National Committee, said a GOP compromise on immigration would be politically wise. "The Republican Party cannot become an anti-immigration party," he wrote. "Our majority rests too heavily on white voters, given that current demographic voting percentages will not allow us to hold our majority in the future." Gillespie in 2013 Now, let’s analyze what Gillespie told CNBC’s Kudlow in 2013 about the Gang of Eight bill, which Warner supported. The legislation -- sponsored by four Democratic and four Republican senators -- would give $3 billion to the Department of Homeland Security to improve border protection through drones, more fencing and additional customs agents. DHS would be required to achieve complete surveillance of the southwest border with Mexico and apprehend 90 percent of the people trying to cross illegally through major entry areas. Once those goals and a few others were met, most illegal immigrants would be eligible to start a 13-year path to citizenship. They could immediately seek "Registered Provisional Immigrant Status" that would allow them to legally stay in the country. After 10 years, they could seek a Green Card and, three years later, be eligible to apply for citizenship. The path would be shorter for people brought here illegally as children, known as "Dreamers." Gillespie was complimentary of an amendment in the bill that prioritized border control. He spoke again of the need for comprehensive immigration reform on policy and on political grounds. But Gillespie never endorsed the citizenship provisions in the bill. Kudlow did not bring up the subject, and Gillespie did not offer an opinion about it. While Gillespie said the bill was "the right approach," he also offered hope "it can be perfected" without specifying how. So Gillespie did not contradict the position he laid out in greater detail years earlier. Gillespie 2014 Finally, let’s consider what Gillespie is saying this year. "I do not support amnesty, and oppose granting citizenship to them, which would be unfair to those who have come here legally and played by the rules," he wrote on his website. "And I don’t believe we should give one of the greatest privileges in the world—American citizenship—to those who are here by virtue of having broken our laws. "At the same time, I do not believe that our nation will implement the mass deportation of 10-12 million people, so we need to come to terms with those who are here illegally now. It would be in the interest of both American citizens and those here illegally to be able to come forward and, after a series of processes (i.e., criminal background checks, payment of back taxes, assimilation, demonstration of self sufficiency), be issued new visas to be here legally." Although Gillespie’s position remains steady, his enthusiasm for passing the Gang of Eight bill appears to have diminished. Last year, he said the legislation was "good policy" that should be "perfected" and approved. This year, Gillespie says though a spokesman that he would not have voted for the bill and thinks Congress should delay consideration of immigration reform until after the mid-term elections. Our ruling Gillespie has remained steady in his longtime principles for immigration reform. They’re stated on his campaign website: increased border security and a creation of a system that would allow most illegal immigrants to obtain legal residency -- but not citizenship. There’s been a shift in Gillespie’s rhetoric on the sweeping Gang of Eight bill that’s become the lightning rod for immigration debate. Last year, he described the bill as "good policy" that should be amended and passed. This year, he says he would have voted against the legislation and that consideration of comprehensive reform should be delayed until after the elections. But the changed language doesn’t equate to a changed position. It’s not surprising that Gillespie says he would have voted against the Gang of Eight bill. The legislation, when it came up for vote on the Senate floor, hadn’t been amended. It contained a pathway to citizenship that Gillespie has consistently opposed. We rate this No Flip.

pomt-09629	"Most of the people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/07/michael-bloomberg/nyc-mayor-bloomberg-claims-most-people-finance-ear/	In a time of public anger over salaries and bonuses on Wall Street, it is a rare public figure who stands up for the financial sector. But New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- who, not coincidentally, is the founder of a financial news service -- did just that on Meet the Press on Jan. 3, 2010. Discussing what's happened on Wall Street since the sector's near-collapse in 2008, Bloomberg said, "You know, we have -- everybody is bashing Wall Street. (But Wall Street) is one of the big revenue generators for New York and New York City. That's how we pay our teachers, that's how we pay our cops, that's how we pay our firefighters. And I've always thought, if the elected officials in Michigan bashed the automobile industry, or in California, (information technology), or in Texas, oil, they'd be run out of town on a rail. And yet, every day I pick up the paper and everybody, it's kind of hard to find anybody that's not saying -- well, look, there are some excesses. But overall, most of the people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year. They're hardworking, and we want those industries to be here and not overseas." The part that caught our eye was that "people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year." Many of us have the impression from the media that people who work on Wall Street earn much more than that. So we talked to experts and looked at the data. The mayor's office referred us to the New York City Economic Development Corp., whose head is appointed by the mayor. A spokesman said that office came up with that figure by using the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey data. We consulted with the Census Bureau on retracing their steps and found that Bloomberg's comment on Meet the Press was indeed accurate. The American Community Survey data -- which can be broken down by city, employer sector and employee earnings -- showed that for the "finance and insurance" sector in New York City, the median earnings in 2008 were $78,451. That figure includes both salary and bonuses -- an important factor in Wall Street compensation, where bonuses often dwarf base salary. A key factor to note is that this is a median number -- that is, the number exactly halfway between the highest earnings and the lowest -- and not an average. In many contexts, calculating the median can be more reliable than calculating the average (or mean), because the median is less likely to be swayed by a small number of very high or very low examples. In this case, using the median rather than the average for the sector minimizes the importance of the very highest paid executives on Wall Street, whose salaries are big enough to skew the entire results. Indeed, if you calculate the average earnings for the sector, rather than the median, the numbers look quite different. Using a separate data set from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks earnings for industries and localities on a quarterly basis, reveals that the average annual earnings for workers in New York City's "financial activities" sector was more than $331,000. (This amount, as large as it sounds, was actually extrapolated from data reflecting the first quarter of 2009, which was Wall Street's low point; it reflects a decline of 35 percent from a year earlier.) In other contexts, the New York City Economic Development Corp. isn't averse to citing the average rather than the median. On its Web site, the office offers a pair of charts that detail average annual wages by sector and borough, based on federal statistics. One chart shows the average wages for 2007 in the the finance-and-insurance sector at $286,158 citywide and $315,481 in Manhattan. Another chart reports an average for the "financial services" sector citywide at $288,213 for 2007. A spokesman for the corporation said it was valid for the office to cite median figures in one context and average figures in another, asserting that the mayor was correct when he said that "most of the people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year." "When the question is, 'What do most people who work in finance make,' the most appropriate data is the median, which literally represents the 50th percentile in the distribution," said the spokesman, David Lombino. "An average would make no sense here. If you ate zero eggs, and I ate two eggs, the average is one egg -- but that is not what 'most' people ate." The other key question is whether the data sets the mayor used are justified or misleading. The census data (as well as BLS data) count anyone who works for a financial firm, regardless of what their job is. A receptionist, an IT staffer, a janitor -- as long as they're employed in-house by a financial services firm, they get mixed in with the high-rollers that author Tom Wolfe called the Masters of the Universe. The receptionists and janitors tend to decrease both the median and average earnings figures for the industry. We had trouble finding specific compensation data for professionals on Wall Street. The Options Group, which publishes an influential compensation survey on the financial services sector, declined to provide data to us. But included in the publicly available pages posted on the firm's Web site is data showing that average salaries for a first-year associate -- a very junior position -- at "global investment banks" in 2009 was $80,000 to $90,000 -- which exceeds Bloomberg's figure right off the bat. Yet those same associates, according to the survey, also get bonuses on top of their base pay that average $65,000 to $75,000. Information on more senior positions was blacked out, but it's safe to assume the numbers go up from there. A lot of professionals on Wall Street "make three-quarters of their pay in annual bonuses," said Michael S. Melbinger, an employee-benefits and executive compensation lawyer with the firm Winston & Strawn. Where professionals are concerned, "I would say [Bloomberg's] figure is the bottom, not the average, even for a boutique firm." But Lombino sees no problem in Bloomberg including the entire spectrum of financial services employees in his statistic. Indeed, that was part of the point that the mayor was trying to make -- that Wall Street supports the livelihoods of ordinary people as well as the super-rich. "It is likely that (janitors and receptionists) enjoy other benefits associated with working for a large financial institution, just like traditional traders and bankers," he said. "It would seem remiss to include them in any other category, and they have to fall in somewhere. If the mayor had said 'bankers,' or 'traders' -- those are occupations within the finance industry and [they would have produced] a different and higher figure. But he specifically said 'people who work in finance,' and that is the whole industry." Bloomberg's artful wording -- "Most of the people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year" -- was broad enough to include lower-paid employees. And because of that, it is backed up by a credible federal statistic. But we believe a reasonable person hearing his comment would think he was saying that professionals such as bond traders and brokers earn $70,000 to $80,000 per year. So while he may be technically accurate, we find his statement misleading. It's also worth noting that other statistics more fully reflect that Wall Street professionals, even the most junior ones, earn much higher incomes than the amounts that Bloomberg cited. That's enough in our book to lower his statement to a Half True.	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2010-01-07T18:53:45	2010-01-03	['None']
pomt-02239	In Rhode Island, "Nearly 9 percent of covered employees go out on short term disability every year, with an average outage from work of almost 12 weeks each."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/15/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-9-percent-ri-workers-go-short-term-/	Ken Block, Republican candidate for governor, is taking aim at Rhode Island’s temporary disability insurance program, saying it’s poorly run and too expensive. As an example, Block cites what he says is a high percentage of workers who go on disability. "Nearly 9 percent of covered employees go out on short term disability every year, with an average outage from work of almost 12 weeks each," he says on his campaign website. "These are very high utilization rates, and would either indicate that Rhode Island has a very sick workforce or that the program has some systemic problems [that] need to be addressed." Whether the system is well-run or not is a matter of opinion. But we decided to see if his statement about how many workers go out on disability is accurate. We looked at some of this back in July, when we checked a claim by state Rep. Patricia Morgan that used Block’s numbers to compare Rhode Island and New Jersey’s TDI usage rates. Block’s campaign said his source for the 9-percent figure is the 2011 annual report of the state Department of Labor and Training, which administers the temporary disability program. According to the department’s website, Rhode Island’s TDI system was the first in the nation. It collects taxes, 1.2 percent on the first $61,400 a worker earns, and uses that money to pay benefits to others who miss at least seven consecutive days of work because of a medical condition, certified by a doctor. TDI benefits aren’t taxable. The DLT’s annual report lists the number of eligible claims filed with the program each year, the net amount paid and the number of employees in the state who were supporting the program by paying TDI taxes. Block took the total number of 2011 eligible claims, 35,836, and divided it by the number of workers paying TDI taxes, 393,000, which produces a result of 9.1 percent. When we checked with the DLT, spokeswoman Nikki Armstrong said the number of claims represents how many requests for payment the program received. But that doesn’t tell you how many people filed for TDI benefits, because individual employees sometimes make more than one claim in a year. The figure that does is the new claims number, which tells how many people made a first claim on the system in that year. In 2011, that number was 30,953, which was 7.9 percent of the 393,000 people paying into the system, not the "nearly 9 percent" Block cited. According to the agency’s 2011 report, the average length of a claim was 11.2 weeks, Block’s "almost 12 weeks" claim. But there are more recent numbers than those Block cited. For 2013, slight increases in the number of people paying into the system and slight decreases in the number of new claims dropped that year’s new claims percentage to 7.4 percent, according to the Department of Labor and Training. The average duration of a claim in 2013 went up to 12.2 weeks. Block said his claim was a good-faith calculation based on the best-publicly available data that the Department of Labor and Training had released. The agency’s online report made no distinction between number of claims and number of claimants, he said. "When we use data to do policy research, we use the data that is made available directly by the appropriate state agency," he said. The first-claim number wasn’t in the posted report, he said. Our ruling Ken Block said nearly 9 percent of eligible employees go out on temporary disability each year, for an average of 12 weeks. He fell short on the first part of the claim, which he based on 2011 numbers. As we reported in our item last July, 7.9 percent of covered employees went out on disability in 2011. In 2013, it was 7.4 percent. He was closer on the second part of his claim. In both 2011 and 2013, the average duration of a claim was close to 12 weeks. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-13983	Says Ron Johnson voted to turn Medicare "into a voucher program."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/10/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/sen-ron-johnson-voted-paul-ryan-plans-make-medicar/	In 2011, after the U.S. House of Representatives approved a federal budget pushed by Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, Democrats repeatedly claimed that Republicans had "voted to end Medicare." That became PolitiFact National’s Lie of the Year. Ryan, now the House speaker, has continued to advance Medicare reform proposals. And now the Wisconsin Democratic Party is making an attack -- though with a claim that doesn’t go nearly as far as the lie of the year. In a radio ad released May 4, 2016, the party said GOP U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "went after Medicare, voting to turn it into a voucher program." It’s an attack that is likely to be repeated as Democrat Russ Feingold seeks to take back the Senate seat from Johnson in the November 2016 election. So, did Johnson vote to make Medicare "a voucher program"? There’s some argument over semantics between voucher and premium supports, a term preferred by Republicans. But the answer is: Pretty much. Paul Ryan budgets To back its claim, the state Democratic party cited Johnson’s votes for Ryan’s budget proposals, which included the Medicare reforms. Those budgets, which did not become law, prompted Democrats to charge that Ryan wanted to turn Medicare into a voucher program. Our colleagues have consistently rated those claims Mostly True. As PolitiFact National has explained: The initial Ryan plan using the term premium supports was released in early 2011. Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. It would have affected people who at the time were under 55. Ryan then updated versions of the plan, including one as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. That newer version would have allowed beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they could use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. So, the main point is that Medicare would change from paying fees to doctors and hospitals, and instead beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy toward their coverage. That’s a big change. Johnson’s campaign argues that the change wouldn’t be a voucher and emphasizes that what Republicans call premium support payments would be made to insurance companies, not to Medicare beneficiaries themselves. Our colleagues concluded that, although there are technical differences between voucher and premium supports that may matter to health policy professionals, the two definitions have become almost indistinguishable and voucher program is a fair description for what Ryan proposed. Our rating The state Democratic Party says Johnson voted to turn Medicare "into a voucher program." To some health policy experts, there are technical differences between voucher and premium supports -- the latter term being preferred by Johnson and other Republicans when it comes to Medicare changes. But under Ryan’s proposals, Medicare would no longer pay fees to health care providers -- instead, Medicare beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy to use toward their health care.

pomt-10272	"Joe Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act ... the rate of domestic violence went down dramatically."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/24/barack-obama/cause-and-effect-possible-but-not-clear/	As he introduced his new running mate, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama lauded Delaware Sen. Joe Biden's legislative achievements, highlighting one that matters to a key voting group: women. "Joe Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act, so every woman would have a place to turn for support," Obama said in Springfield, Ill. "The rate of domestic violence went down dramatically, and countless women got a second chance at life." As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden shepherded a major crime bill through Congress in 1993 and 1994. One key piece was the Violence Against Women Act, a bill that Biden had been pushing for years. VAWA, as it's known in Washington, included provisions that authorized $1.6-billion in grants for programs to fight domestic violence, established a toll-free national hotline on family violence and created federal penalties for interstate stalking or domestic abuse. Congress has since renewed it twice. Since VAWA became law, domestic violence rates have dropped dramatically, according to the U.S. Justice Department. In 1993, 5.8 out of every 1,000 people age 12 or older reported being victims of nonfatal intimate partner violence. By 2005, that rate had dropped to 2.3 per 1,000, a decline that fits Obama's description: "went down dramatically." Okay, so both of Obama's statements are true. Biden wrote an anti-domestic violence law, and domestic violence rates dropped dramatically. But did one cause the other? Although Obama doesn't say it directly, that's the clear implication in his statement, and that's where things get a bit murkier. As we discussed back in 2007, when Biden was gunning for the top spot on the Democratic ticket, figuring out the reasons for changes in crime statistics can be tricky. Multiple factors, including economic prosperity and demographic changes, contributed to an overall decline in violent crime throughout the 1990s and into this decade. "There's still generally no consensus about why any crime in general has dropped," Shannan Catalano, author of the Justice Department study, told the Associated Press in 2006. "It's safe to say it's more than one factor that went into it." In fact, the same federal crime statistics that show domestic violence rates dropping, also show the trends were similar in overall violent crime and in murder rates. A case can be made that domestic violence rates might have dropped without passage of the VAWA. There are, however, some solid reasons to think Biden's law made a difference. A study by the University of Arkansas, for instance, concluded in 2000 that the law's increased funding for civil legal assistance for victims contributed to the decline. Though that study also said economic and demographic factors mattered. Obama never said the law caused all of the decrease, but he implied it, so we will rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-14606	As part of legislative fights over abortion rights, "Mike Coffman co-sponsored a bill to redefine rape."	/colorado/statements/2016/feb/02/emilys-list/emilys-list-attacks-coffman-forcible-rape-and-abor/	Emily's List is stoking the abortion debate in Colorado's 6th Congressional District race with a fundraising email saying Republican incumbent Mike Coffman "co-sponsored a bill to redefine rape." Emily's List -- a political organization that supports the election of Democratic women who support abortion rights -- has endorsed Coffman's opponent, state Sen. Morgan Carroll, an Aurora Democrat. Its mailer focused on reproductive rights, abortion and Roe v. Wade. In the email, titled "2016 goal: A Congress that fights for women and families," Emily's List said, "We wish Congress was less like this" -- citing Mike Coffman's co-sponsorship of the 2011 bill -- "and more like this … Morgan Carroll sponsored a bill to make emergency contraception available to sexual assault survivors." We wanted to check the accuracy of Emily's List's characterization of Coffman's role in the legislation. Coffman did co-sponsor the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act, which attempted to redefine a ban on federal funding for abortions to exempt "forcible rape" -- and not rape in broader terms. Critics said the "forcible rape" language could rule out other forms of sexual assault that are considered rape, including statutory rape, attacks where women are drugged or threatened, and date rapes. Facing a backlash from women's groups, Republicans amended the bill in committee to remove the word "forcible" and make the exemption for "rape." Coffman wasn't on this committee and didn't vote on the removal. "The bill was amended in committee, and Congressman Coffman supported the amended bill on the floor," a Coffman campaign spokesman later said. Congressional records show that Coffman voted for the amended bill in a floor vote, which passed the House but not the Senate. In recent years, Coffman has tempered his position on abortion in one of the country's most competitive "swing" districts, which is nearly evenly divided among Democrats, Republicans and independents. In 2012, he said, "I am against all abortions, except when it is necessary to protect the life of the mother." But a year later, Coffman said that while he supported a House bill to limit late-term abortions, "I strongly support the exceptions for rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother that have been included in this legislation." Coffman's Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, had blunt criticism of his co-sponsoring the 2011 bill's original "forcible rape" language. "Rape is about the lack of consent -- not the degree of force -- and this definition takes us backwards," Carroll told Denver7. "I unequivocally support a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body, including her health care," she said. Coffman's spokeswoman complained that political opponents have repeatedly raised the 2011 bill and "will twist the facts any way they can in an attempt to mischaracterize and demonize Rep. Coffman." Our ruling Emily’s List said that Coffman "co-sponsored a bill to redefine rape." The record shows Coffman did co-sponsor the bill to redefine a ban on federal funding for abortions to exempt "forcible rape." Yet he later voted on the floor for an amended version that had removed the "forcible" modifier from the bill. Given the totality of his actions on the legislation, we're rating this claim Mostly True. Correction: This story has been corrected to note that Coffman did not serve on the committee that removed the word "forcible" from the bill.

pomt-00827	Dallas "African-American and Hispanic students pass AP exams at a higher rate than any other place in America."	/texas/statements/2015/mar/26/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-dallas-minority-students-fare-bet/	Gov. Greg Abbott, who’s vowed to make the Texas education system No. 1 in the country, told lawmakers that some Dallas students already lead the pack. In his February 2015 State of the State address, Abbott hammered his goal again, saying: "As we look to some of these challenges, the way I see is that our journey begins with striving to create the best education system in America. "We’ve seen that we can do it," Abbott said. "In Dallas, for example, African-American and Hispanic students pass AP exams at a higher rate than any other place in America." AP, as in advanced placement, tests are offered through the nonprofit College Board. Exam scores of thre or higher, on a five-point scale, qualify students for college credit. We sought to learn the basis of Abbott’s Dallas declaration. Abbott's office did not engage. But responding by email, a spokesman for the Dallas school district, André Riley, referred us to research by the Dallas-based National Math and Science Initiative based on data provided by the district. Riley noted an October 2014 initiative press release stating that according to AP test results in 2013-14, "a minority student in Dallas is more than twice as likely to earn a qualifying score on an AP math or science exam than in any other large urban school district in the country." That’s not any other place, which is what Abbott said, though it’s close to any comparably populous place. It’s also not a ranking that takes into account all the AP subject-matter exams, unlike what Abbott said. According to the release, the Dallas district was the first in the nation to partner with the initiative "in its effort to raise academic rigor and increase the number of students who graduate from high school college-ready." Since 2008, the release said, the initiative’s College Readiness Program has been implemented in more than 620 schools across 26 states. The release said the initiative’s funding, which covers stipends for teacher training plus AP-related equipment and supplies, was provided by the Texas Instruments Foundation and the O’Donnell Foundation. Separately, a January 2015 news story by KERA, a Dallas public radio station, said the initiative, which has worked with Dallas students since 1996, "offers Saturday study sessions, pays the hefty exam fees for students, gathers teachers together for professional development and even gives teachers better books or lesson plans if they need them." And, the story said, the initiative offers cash for success, giving $100 to each student who passes a math, science or English exam, and $100 to the teacher for each passing student. Generally, the story said, the intent was to prime students for jobs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Seeking elaboration, we contacted the initiative; spokeswoman Tara Marathe said by email the initiative reached its conclusion about Dallas minority students by comparing 2013-14 results for African American and Hispanic students in Dallas to results on the math, science and English AP exams for such students in similarly large districts with comparable shares of low-income and African American and Hispanic students. Marathe said the upshot was that an African American or Hispanic student in Dallas appeared twice as likely to earn a qualifying score on an AP math or science exam as a minority student in similar large urban districts. Specifically, Marathe said, districts chosen for the comparisons had to have at least half the Dallas district’s total African-American and Hispanic high school juniors and seniors (about 7,500 or more); be at least 75 percent Hispanic and African-American as a whole; and have 75 percent of students qualifying for free- and reduced-price lunches. "There were 15,194 junior and senior African-American and Hispanic students in Dallas in 2013-14, who earned 948 passing AP math and science scores," Marathe wrote. "This rate of 62 minority passing exams per 1,000 minority juniors and seniors is more than twice what we see in similar urban districts." Marathe said the initiative’s agreements with the College Board "prevent us" from sharing detailed data for other districts. But she said the comparison swept in public schools in Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Chicago, Miami, Baltimore, San Diego, Louisville and San Antonio. Next, we asked the College Board if it had confirmed the Dallas-above-all ranking. By email, spokesman Zach Goldberg said the initiative is a partner with the board "and we have no reason to doubt what they have provided." Wondering if Abbott’s mention of the Dallas students outscoring peers from "any place in America" might hold up just for math and science results, we applied the initiative’s methodology to a couple other Texas districts, drawing enrollment data from a Texas Education Agency website. By our calculations, the Dallas district’s result of 62 minority passing exams per 1,000 minority juniors and seniors ran behind the 83 passing exams per 1,000 minority juniors and seniors in the Round Rock school district. The Dallas result ran ahead of the 34 passing exams per 1,000 minority juniors and seniors in the Austin district. Our ruling Abbott said Dallas "African-American and Hispanic students pass AP exams at a higher rate than any other place in America." That’s an overly broad recap of research indicating that such students in Dallas passed math and science AP exams at a better clip than peers in more than 15 districts nationally with like demographics. This conclusion, that is, didn’t sweep in every AP test nor did it extend to the Dallas students outpacing students everywhere else. On balance, we rate Abbott’s statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-11780	"President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees."	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/27/reaganwasright/fake-news-says-trump-sending-stimulus-money-retire/	Christmas has arrived early for retirees thanks to President Donald Trump, at least according to an article making the rounds on Facebook. "President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees," read a Nov. 24, 2017, headline on the website Reaganwasright.com. The story claimed that millions of retirees will get letters from the IRS "informing them that President Trump has declared them the recipients of a Christmas stimulus to offset the horrible performance of this year’s Black Friday." If this story seems too good to be true, it is. The story comes from a website associated with a self-described liberal troll who says he tries to fool conservatives with fake stories most people would find absurd. We found the story about a senior stimulus after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake story says that to qualify for the stimulus, recipients must be over 65, retired, receive Social Security and have an income under $40,000 per year. "The letter will also come with an offer to pledge support for President Trump, a requirement the Attorney General says is perfectly legal and patriotic, though not fully enforceable," stated the article. The article then directed readers to call the White House switchboard if they don’t receive the letter. (The number printed in the article and it is indeed the switchboard.) Reaganwasright.com describes itself as a satirical website that uses "humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people’s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues." The about us page links to the Facebook page of America’s Last Line of Defense, which is run by Christopher Blair, a Maine man behind who we’ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are carefully curated social experiment designed to "feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama." They’re also a vehicle to make money. The point, of course, is to get someone on Facebook to click on the post thinking it is real. "I discovered that Facebook following plus blog plus ads equals income," Blair told us previously. In this case, the Reaganwasright Facebook post includes an innocuous headline, "President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees," and a caption that asks people to share the post 1,000 times to show appreciation for Trump. As of this writing, it had been shared 768 times. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05747	All travelers -- even babies -- arriving in the U.S. by air must have a passport.	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/02/john-axford/milwaukee-brewers-pitcher-john-axford-says-even-ba/	For the third year in a row, the Milwaukee Brewers’ lights-out closer John Axford faced a challenge when it came to getting to spring training on time. In 2010, it was an auto accident; in 2011 a case of food poisoning. This season it was red tape involving his 8-month-old son, J.B., also known to Axford’s Twitter followers as "Little Ax." The boy was born in Milwaukee, and is a U.S. citizen. The elder Axford, however, is a Canadian. And his trip to Arizona was delayed because he didn’t have a passport for the baby when he was planning to fly from Canada into the United States. His Twitter followers (@JohnAxford) got a play-by-play of his travel travails. Among the offerings: "Thank you Homeland Security for not letting my AMERICAN son into AMERICA! #3YearValentinesCurse #WontBeSeeingYouTodayWarmWeatherInPhoenix" He was more expansive in an interview with the Journal Sentinel, which is what prompted us to turn our version of the radar gun -- the Truth-O-Meter -- on Axford. "Homeland Security requires passports for every age, no matter what," Axford said in the interview. "You can arrive by land or sea if you're under the age of 15 with a birth certificate, but if you go by air Homeland Security requires passports for everybody, no matter what the age." Is he right? Passports only by air, though birth certificates suffice by car or boat? Now, it’s true Axford is a sports figure. But his statement touches squarely on U.S. policy. So we checked with the State Department, Homeland Security, border control and several federal government websites. Turns out the rules are different for border-crossing babies, depending on the mode of travel. If you’re traveling by air, you need a passport. Period. And, yes, you have to get a photograph of the kid. A kid passport costs $105. However, if you’re coming by land -- such as the border crossing in Detroit -- the rules are less strict, and less expensive. "U.S. children ages 15 and under arriving by land or sea from a contiguous territory may present an original or copy of his or her birth certificate (issued by the Vital Records Department in the state where he or she was born), a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or a Naturalization Certificate. If the child is a newborn and the actual birth certificate has not arrived from the Vital Records Department, we will accept a Hospital issued birth certificate." Each year, the federal government issues about 450,000 passports to infants, a spokeswoman for the State Department said in an email. The department even provides helpful hints for how to take a passport picture of your little one. Kiddie passports are valid for five years. In the end, Axford got to spring training the hard way, again. His father drove the family across the border to Detroit and they caught a flight from there to Arizona. Our conclusion Axford’s trip back to the mound took a detour. He said it was because of travel delays and said federal law required his baby to have a passport to fly back into the country. He learned a valuable lesson about border crossing: The feds are always right. We rate Axford’s statement True.	None	John Axford	None	None	None	2012-03-02T09:00:00	2012-02-14	['United_States']
pomt-11471	"ALERT: Massive Easter Egg Recall Leaves MILLIONS Of Children In Danger- THROW THEM AWAY- They WILL Kill Your Kids."	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/06/blog-posting/website-recycles-2017-information-claim-target-rec/	It is true that Target issued a recall for certain Easter egg toys, as claimed by a blog, however, the recall was for toys sold last year. "ALERT: Massive Easter Egg Recall Leaves MILLIONS Of Children In Danger- THROW THEM AWAY- They WILL Kill Your Kids," said the headline for a story posted Feb. 8 on news24fresh.info. The story claims Target "has issued a massive recall for water-absorbing egg toys ahead of Easter Sunday after discovering the object can expand inside a child’s body, causing life-threatening conditions if ingested." Even though the story correctly identifies the toys and associated complications if ingested, it fails to mention that the toys were sold February 2017 through March 2017, with an April 13, 2017, recall date. The toys were recalled ahead of Easter Sunday 2017. Not Easter 2018. Facebook users flagged news24fresh.info’s story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. News24fresh.info’s website does not list any information identifying its mission statement, who runs it or who’s behind it. However, the website does accurately note that the recall involves Hatch & Grow Easter Eggs, Easter Grow Toys (with model number 234-25-1200 on the back of the packaging) and Hatch Your Own Dino (with model number 234-09-0016 on a label inserted in the packaging). The website also has the right description of the potential health problems and complications that can happen if a child ingests the toy; that surgery may be required to retrieve it from the body; and that it may not show up on an X-ray. The approximate amount of toys sold — 560,000 — its estimated $1 price tag and Target’s offering of a full refund due to the recall is also accurate, matching announcements posted by Target and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Target also told PolitiFact that the recalls in the news24fresh.info post were all from last year. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission told PolitiFact that generally there’s no end date to recalls, unless there’s an update about a company no longer being in business. Consumers can still follow up on Target’s 2017 recall for the described Easter egg toys, the commission said. Target did issue a recall for Easter egg toys. But it did so last year. While recalls generally don’t expire, it seems clear to us that by reposting this story, news24fresh.info is trying to trick people into thinking the recall is new. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00893	On the status of illegal immigrants	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/06/scott-walker/scott-walker-disavows-support-path-citizenship/	On Feb. 4, 2015 we awarded Gov. Scott Walker a Half Flip for inconsistencies in how he framed his views on what to do about millions of illegal immigrants currently in the United States. Our focus was on Walker’s comments in light of a 2013 Wausau Daily Herald interview in which he clearly agreed "it makes sense" that people could not only stay here but get citizenship with the right mix of penalties and waiting periods and other requirements. Walker had muddied the waters in a Feb. 1, 2015 interview on ABC’s "This Week" program by declaring he was not for "amnesty" for those residents. Critics opposed to a "pathway" to legal citizenship disagreed, calling his position just that. In assigning Walker a Half Flip, which is defined by a partial change in position or inconsistent statements on an issue, we noted "the truth is that we don’t really know whether he has a completely new position, because he wasn’t asked to clarify his views in detail." (Worth noting: Two days after we issued the Half Flip, Walker in a Fox interview accused the Wausau newspaper of misquoting him despite video proving otherwise.) Walker’s position became a whole lot clearer in a March 1, 2015 interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Faced with the public perception that he was equivocating on the issue as he weighs a 2016 presidential run, Walker tried to better define his position. That prompted us to return to the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. Pressed by Wallace in the interview, Walker at first continued to say he didn’t believe in amnesty, while not disavowing his endorsement of a path to citizenship in the 2013 Wausau interview. Wallace: The question was, can you envision a world where if these people paid a penalty, that they would have a path to citizenship? And you said, sure, that makes sense. Walker: I believe there's a way that you can do that... But Walker switched course when Wallace persisted: Wallace: But you said you supported it. Walker: And my view has changed. I'm flat out saying it. I'm -- candidates can say that. Sometimes they don't. I'm saying my -- Wallace: So, you've changed from 2013? Walker: Absolutely. I look at the problems we've experienced for the last few years. I've talked to governors on the border and others out there. I've talked to people all across America. And the concerns I have is that we need to secure the border. We ultimately need to put in place a system that works. A legal immigration system that works. And part of doing this is put the onus on employers, getting them E-Verify and tools to do that. But I don't think you do it through amnesty. So, Walker now says he’s changed his mind since agreeing that some pathway to citizenship makes sense. There may still be a bit of wiggle room in his position. But in our view Walker’s declarations now make this a Full Flop, which we define as a complete change in position. Indeed, he agreed he had "absolutely" changed his position. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-15157	"In the year 2013, the Obama administration released 104,000 criminal illegal aliens. They released 196 murderers – people with homicide convictions, who are here illegally."	/texas/statements/2015/aug/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-obama-administration-released-104000-crim/	Stumping for president in Iowa, Sen. Ted Cruz charged President Barack Obama with releasing thousands of violent criminals living in the U.S. without legal authorization, the Dallas Morning News noted in a news blog post. The Texas Republican, who was visiting the Iowa State Fair, told reporters: "The Obama administration is releasing violent criminal illegal aliens. In the year 2013, the Obama administration released 104,000 criminal illegal aliens. They released 196 murderers – people with homicide convictions, who are here illegally. That’s what I find objectionable." A moment later, Cruz said that as president, he would secure the U.S. borders and "stop releasing violent criminal illegal aliens." Cruz didn’t assert the administration doesn’t deport criminals. That claim, by Republican candidate Jeb Bush, was recently rated False by PolitiFact Florida, which concluded that while some individuals with criminal convictions weren’t deported, tens of thousands of people have been sent out of the country. In fiscal 2014, through September 2014, 86,923 convicted criminals were deported for a crime beyond breaking an immigration law. Cruz came to his count, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email, by drawing on a 2014 report by a think tank and testimony seemingly endorsing his tally by Sarah Saldaña, director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is responsible for enforcing U.S. immigration laws. ICE director’s testimony At a July 21, 2015, hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Cruz asked Saldaña how many murderers the administration had released "yesterday." The director said she didn’t know. But generally, Saldaña said, "we don’t release people willy-nilly. We release people pursuant to these statutes and regulations," a reference to two thick paperback volumes she’d waved. "There are only a limited number of crimes that we are required to detain people," she said, including ones related to drug distribution. In 2013, Cruz replied, ICE agents chose not to begin deportation proceedings against 68,000 people with criminal convictions and separately had released from detention 36,000 people with criminal convictions, including 193 homicide convictions, he said. To get the full picture, he said, "you’ve got to add both" tallies. "Yes, sir," Saldaña said, "that’s absolutely right." She also went on to say the agency actions had taken place pursuant to federal law. At that moment, there seemed to be agreement the agency in 2013 had chosen not to detain or had released 104,000 people with criminal convictions who also were living in the country without legal permission. Frazier told us Cruz also drew on a May 2014 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. That report said that from October 2012 through September 2013, ICE "freed 36,007 convicted criminal aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings," according to an agency document obtained by the center. The report’s author, Jessica Vaughan, previously told us the document came from someone she declined to identify who fielded it in connection with congressional inquiries. Report: 68,000 "aliens" with criminal convictions not detained by ICE And what of the other 68,000 individuals Cruz described in Iowa as released? Such a figure came to light in a March 2014 center report, which also made it clear the count did not reflect individuals freed from detention. Rather, the report said ICE agents in fiscal 2013 chose not to act against that many "aliens with criminal convictions, or 35 percent of all criminal aliens they reported encountering. The criminal alien releases typically occur without formal notice to local law enforcement agencies and victims," the report said. The "vast majority of these releases occurred because of the Obama administration's prosecutorial discretion policies, not because the aliens were not deportable." "Under current policies," the report said, "an alien generally must have serious criminal convictions, prior deportations, or immigration violations before an officer can move to deport them." That may have been a reference to a 2011 memo issued by the then-director of ICE, John Morton, urging agency officials to use discretion in deciding which apprehended violators of immigration law should be removed with particular care taken with veterans, longtime legal permanent residents, minors, elderly individuals, pregnant or nursing women and individuals here since childhood. Negative factors also should be weighed, the memo said, including whether individuals pose a risk to national security, are serious felons or known gang members or have egregious records of immigration law violations. By email, Carl Rusnok, a Dallas-based ICE spokesman, sent us an ICE response to the center’s March 2014 report noting the government had removed 216,000 convicted criminals in 2013. "The removal of criminal individuals is and will remain ICE’s highest priority," the statement said. In addition, ICE said the center’s report showcased "flawed math." Vaughan, standing by the research, posted her objections to the agency’s criticisms on April 1, 2014. By email, Vaughan told us she had no quibble with Cruz’s decision to add the 36,007 individuals released by ICE in fiscal 2013 to the 68,000 "aliens with criminal convictions" whom ICE agents otherwise chose not to detain that year for violating immigration laws. Government: Releases driven by federal laws Figures aside, we wondered why ICE freed convicts lacking legal permission to live here. When we previously looked into a similar claim, the government said ICE was mostly just complying with judicial rulings and federal law. In 2014, we rated Half True this claim by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio: "Last year," Obama "administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions. The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping and thousands of drug-related crimes." Smith recited accurate figures, but his claim didn’t acknowledge administration explanations. A May 16, 2014, Associated Press news story said that according to ICE, the individuals let go had completed their criminal jail sentences. Also, the story said, nearly all the released individuals still faced deportation along with required check-ins with authorities while immigration cases were pending. Moreover, the story quoted an ICE spokeswoman saying that in many cases, the agency was required by law to release the immigrants while their deportation cases were pending. "The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report," the spokeswoman said. For example, she said, mandatory releases accounted for over 72 percent of the immigrants convicted of homicide, the AP reported. At the time, Rusnok emailed us similar information. Also, he said, once "in ICE custody, many of the individuals described in the report were released under restrictions such as GPS monitoring, telephone monitoring, supervision or bond." Individuals convicted of less serious offenses, Rusnok said, "were released as a discretionary matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding the priority of holding the individual, given ICE’s resources, and prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to public safety or national security." Cruz’s claim in mind, we reached Rusnok afresh. By email, he pointed out a March 2015 ICE press release stating that in fiscal 2014, the agency had released 30,558 individuals with criminal convictions--about a 15 percent decrease from the year before. In April 2015, Vaughan pointed out to us, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said that according to ICE information, the 2014 releases included individuals accounting for 86 homicide convictions, 186 kidnapping convictions, 373 sexual assault convictions, 449 commercialized sexual offenses, 1,194 battery convictions, 1,346 domestic violence convictions and 13,636 convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol. ICE’s 2015 press release also said that at the request of Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, the agency was instituting more administrative filters over the release of certain individuals with criminal convictions including "a panel of senior managers," which meets monthly, "to review discretionary release decisions for individuals convicted of crimes of violence." The release said: "Notably, in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 the majority of releases of serious criminal offenders were made pursuant to federal court decisions or bond decisions by immigration judges. In a leading court case on immigration detention, Zadvydas v. Davis, the Supreme Court ruled that ICE generally could not detain an individual ordered removed in immigration detention beyond six months, unless the individual would be repatriated in the reasonably foreseeable future. This detention limit can be triggered when a country simply refuses to accept repatriation of its national, irrespective of the individual’s criminal history." Rusnok also provided a department statement stating that in fiscal 2013, ICE released 169 homicide convicts (not 196) and most releases occurred due to factors not controlled by the agency. For instance, the statement said, 24,851 releases occurred either in accord with court restrictions on the agency or under an ICE "order of supervision" issued "because there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future." Another 10,532 individuals were released after an immigration judge granted a bond, the statement said. "The small number of remaining releases are attributed to prosecutorial discretion, parole and the agency’s inability to obtain a travel document," the statement said. Vaughan, asked to comment on the latest ICE analysis of the 36,007 releases, suggested the agency still had sway in instances it characterized as not under its discretion. For instance, she emailed, the agency may, but often does not, contest grants of bond. Law professors: Detainee releases affected by legal rights Next, we asked several expert professors about the government’s contention it didn’t entirely control which individuals it released from detention. Anyone detained by ICE, the experts said, has constitutional rights that play into judges deciding if a release is appropriate. Kari Hong, a Boston College Law School assistant professor, reminded us immigration cases are civil and not criminal matters. And under U.S. law, she and Ingrid Eagly, a UCLA assistant professor, each advised by phone, a person held longer than six months on an immigration matter has a right to ask for a hearing that could lead to release. Before such a release, the professors said, a judge decides the person wouldn’t be a danger to the community or a flight risk. Also, Hong said, a person let go on bond still might have to check in with ICE every month. Broadly, Hong opined by email, ICE detains far too many individuals. "For the first 100 years of our history, we did not detain immigrants. From 1917 to 1988--a period of 70 years---we detained a total of 55,000 non-citizens with criminal convictions," Hong said. "Since 2009, that number grew to 400,000 each year. There is no reason to detain that many people," she said, especially because the "vast majority are not violent. Many are elderly, families and children." Denise Gilman, who directs an immigration law clinic at the University of Texas, said by email that it’s also possible that released individuals win their immigration cases in court, meaning they won't be deported and must be released. Our ruling Cruz said: "In the year 2013, the Obama administration released 104,000 criminal illegal aliens. They released 196 murderers – people with homicide convictions, who are here illegally." We see how Cruz reached his figures. But ICE says 169 individuals with murder convictions were released and 72 percent of those releases were mandatory—out of its control. Also, 68,000 of the people Cruz described as released were never actually detained by the agency. In addition, this statement is missing vital context. Just as we said in reviewing Smith’s declaration, it’s simplistic to suggest the administration has full decision-making authority. Court decisions and federal laws play important roles. We rate the statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-12825	Says President Donald Trump "signs a visa-free travel policy" for Ghana and Malawi.	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/09/blog-posting/fake-news-dangles-visa-free-travel-ghanamalawi/	As President Donald Trump’s travel ban upended many people’s plans to come to America, fake news perpetrators saw opportunities to cash in on the news. A few days after Trump signed his executive order, a website called USA Television put up two stories. One said "Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Ghana" and the other "Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Malawi." The website claimed that "the United States President, Donald Trump, has signed an executive order to allow all Ghana nationals travel to the United States without visas." Substitute Malawi for Ghana and the two articles were identical. They even included "news" that Trump was on the verge of revoking Australia's visa waiver status. This is, however, nonsense. The U.S. State Department oversees the visa waiver program, and lists the eligible nations. Neither Ghana nor Malawi is on that list. In order to qualify, the visa refusal rate for a given country (meaning how often the U.S. refuses a visa request) has to be under 3 percent. The latest refusal rates for Ghana and Malawi are about 62 and 14 percent respectively. USA Television not only gets zero points for accuracy, it ranks low for creativity. The theme of Trump lifting visa requirements created a cottage industry of sorts. The earliest version we found was on a website called MetroWorlds. On Jan. 25, 2017, the site reported that Trump had signed a bill that granted waivers for Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia. The website Lead Story flagged that as fake news. It is. As we went down the rabbit hole debunking this claim, it rapidly became hard to see who was copying whom, as USA Television churned out more versions and other sites did their own, all with the same message for citizens of Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Africa and Nigeria. The U.S. embassies in Ghana, Kenya and Zimbabwe warned people to ignore the bogus reports. "That story ab/ change in visa policy for Ghanaians? Still fake," the embassy in Ghana tweeted. Our ruling The USA Television website reported that people from Ghana and Malawi could travel to the United States without a visa. Both countries are missing from the State Department’s visa waiver list. There were many versions of this story, naming different countries. None of them were true and in the case of Ghana, the American embassy warned people not to believe these reports. So don’t believe them. We rate these claims Pants on Fire. Update Feb. 15, 2017: Sorry residents of Mauritius, Gambia, Sri Lanka and Botswana. Your pathway to visiting the United States has not gotten any easier, despite what you might have read. The fake news mill that is "USA Television" and "CNN Channel" has been churning out versions of its debunked headline "Donald Trump signs visa-free policy for (insert country here.)" We first flagged similar invented claims for Ghana and Malawi on Feb. 9, 2017, as part of our partnership with Facebook to quash fake news. The articles are virtually word-for-word copies of each other. They all say that "the United States President, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to allow all [country] nationals travel to the United States without visas." They all say this is about fostering trade between the two nations. The U.S. State Department is the final authority on which countries enjoy visa-free status. The purveyors of bunk might say that Mauritius, Gambia, Sri Lanka and Botswana are on the State Department’s list, but they aren’t.

pomt-01796	"With Rick Scott, there are more funds for preschool education."	/florida/statements/2014/jul/24/republican-party-florida/rick-scott-increased-preschool-funding-republican/	On the campaign trail, Gov. Rick Scott has appeared in a charming video alongside his toddler grandson and a darling photo with Florida preschoolers. So we know he likes cute little kids. But does he invest in them? A new ad by the Republican Party of Florida portrays him as generously funding preschool education. The Spanish-language ad "Dedicación" shows teachers warmly talking about their profession -- and Scott. "I like being a special education teacher because many people don’t see the potential of those students," says one teacher. "It's a profession of great dedication," says another. The teachers continue: "With Rick Scott, there are more funds for preschool education and that’s very important to me. Florida students are better off due to Scott. They can repeat all the falsehoods they want, the facts don’t lie." Under Scott, are there more funds for preschool education? We decided to do some homework. VPK funding under Scott The Republican Party’s backup for the ad cited a press release distributed by Scott’s office in March about his proposal for a $100 per child increase for voluntary pre-kindergarten, called VPK. VPK is a program for 4-year-olds launched in 2005 after voters approved it in a referendum and is free for all participants regardless of income. The purpose of VPK is to prepare children for kindergarten -- they learn how to identify shapes and colors, write their own name, recognize letters and recognize patterns, among other skills. The program is offered at public schools and private day care centers. Children can enroll in a VPK school-year program that typically translates to three hours a day -- though many parents pay for additional "wrap-around" hours. (A smaller group of children use a version in the summer.) Though Scott requested a $100 per student increase this year, the Legislature settled on a $54 increase. The Republicans arrived at their claim that "there are more funds for preschool education" based on the amount the state appropriated each year. For 2010-11 -- the last budget set under Crist -- the Legislature appropriated about $404 million -- including $73 million in federal stimulus dollars. (Crist was a champion of the federal stimulus, while Scott campaigned against it.) The amount of state money appropriated would later peak under Scott at $413 million. But the total amount appropriated tells us nothing about the key dollar figure for parents: what is spent per child. The Legislature and the governor set the per-pupil amount each session and appropriate a total based on an estimate of enrollment. But Florida will spend the amount necessary to pay the per-pupil amount for all children who enroll. "The per-pupil is probably the fairest way to compare years -- the (total) dollar amount depends on how many kids" enroll, Bill Ammons, Office of Early Learning budget director told PolitiFact Florida. Ammons’ office sent us the amount of state money spent on VPK under Crist and Scott. The per-pupil amount fell during Scott’s first budget -- 2011-12 -- but that was after the federal stimulus ran out. Then per-pupil funding remained stagnant for three years followed by a small increase. Year Appropriated Expended Per-pupil school year 2010-11 $404 million* $399 million $2,562 2011-12 $385 million $392 million $2,383 2012-13 $413 million $390 million $2,383 2013-14 $405 million $378 million** $2,383 2014-15 $396 million Not known yet $2,437 * This included $332 million in state money and $73 million in federal stimulus dollars ** Entire amount won’t be known until after September. The drop in per-pupil funding followed by stagnant funding didn’t impact every school the same way. Some schools that served wealthier students who paid for day care were able to absorb the state funding drop more easily than schools that serve primarily poor children and rely on state money. "The VPK decrease is miniscule but so many are at the brink, every dollar counts," said David McGerald, CEO of the Early Learning Coalition of Hillsborough County, which oversees VPK. "Providers who serve ‘private pay’ parents are much more likely to thrive and provide a quality program." Florida ranks 35th in state spending for preschool, according to The National Institute for Early Education Research’s report about the 2012-13 school year. (We previously fact-checked a claim by Scott about access to VPK based on the prior year’s report.) Our ruling A Republican Party ad said that Scott has overseen "more funds for preschool education." The Republicans point to the fact that the Legislature approved slightly higher overall appropriations in some years. But per-pupil spending fell during Scott's first year, after federal stimulus funds ran out. Then, for the next few years, the per-pupil amount remained flat. Per-pupil spending still isn't as high as it was in the budget that was approved the year before Scott took office. The statement contains an element of truth but leaves out key details, so we rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2014-07-24T11:21:29	2014-07-22	['None']
pomt-09543	"The money supply has doubled in the last year."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/05/ron-paul/ron-paul-claims-money-supply-has-doubled/	Joining the chorus of critics of Washington's handling of the economy, Rep. Ron Paul used a Jan. 26, 2010, column on his Web site to criticize the Federal Reserve: "We have been on a disastrous course for a long time. The money supply has doubled in the last year, our debt is unsustainable, the value of the dollar is going to continue its drop, and those Americans who understand where we are headed feel helpless and held hostage by foolish policymakers in Washington," wrote Paul, a Texas Republican who ran for president in 2008. We were intrigued by his claim that the "money supply has doubled in the last year," a statement Paul has made before in editorials and speeches on the House floor. The money supply is the total amount of money that is available in the economy at any given point. Some economists focus on it because of theories that a larger supply can lead to long-term inflation. There are several ways to measure it (and they sound like the names of British spy agencies): M1, M2 and M0. M1 consists primarily of general currency (i.e., cash in your wallet) and checking accounts. In December 2009, M1 was $1.7 trillion. M2 is more inclusive: it includes all of the money counted under M1, plus savings accounts. In December 2009, M2 was $8.5 trillion. We started by looking at changes in M1 and M2. From January to December 2009, M1 increased 7.6 percent, while M2 grew by about 2.8 percent -- far short of the doubling Paul claimed. We contacted Paul's office to ask about the source of his claim. A spokeswoman directed us to a chart of bank reserves and the monetary base (which is known as M0) over the past two years. And this is where things get a little tricky. M0, just like M1 and M2, can be used as a measure of the money supply. It consists of the currency in circulation, the money stored in bank vaults, and commercial bank deposits with the Federal Reserve. One economist told us it is "the raw material for the money supply." From January to December 2009, M0 grew by 19 percent. But in a slightly longer period that includes the fall 2008 response to the economic crisis, it grew by 139 percent. What accounts for the large discrepancies? Robert Barro, a Harvard University economist, told us that M1 and M2 experienced a much slower growth due to the "very large increase in holdings of excess reserves by financial institutions." In other words, although there is technically more money in the economy, the banks haven't been lending that money, and have instead been storing it as reserves. Because M0 counts reserves while M1 does not, it follows that M0 has been booming, while M1 is only slowly tagging along. According to Barro, Paul's argument "is correct in spirit but not quite right on the details." Indeed, although there is some debate about this in economic circles (we're reminded of the old joke that economics is the only field where two people can get a Nobel Prize for saying exactly the opposite thing), two economists that we spoke with -- Allan Meltzer from Carnegie Mellon University and Iwan Azis from Cornell University -- told us that economists generally measure money supply with M1 or M2, not M0. And if you want to check the money supply on the Web site for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, it is measured by M1 and M2. George Selgin, a professor of economics at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia, also agreed that M1 and M2 are more useful measurements of the money supply than M0. He added that although a doubling of the monetary base "is, in fact, very significant," it does not mean that the money supply has doubled. To review. Paul said that the money supply has doubled over the past year. But that's not the case if we rely on M1 and M2, the measurements economists generally use when they talk about the supply. Paul's claim is based on the M0 -- the monetary base and bank reserves -- which did increase significantly due to explosive growth in the reserves. But most economists do not rely on it as much as they do on the other two. So we find the statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2010-02-05T15:26:23	2010-01-27	['None']
pomt-09115	"Phoenix, Arizona, I'm told, is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City."	/texas/statements/2010/jun/18/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-phoenix-has-more-kidnappings-any-oth/	Curbing illegal immigration was a leading war cry of the Republican Party of Texas convention in Dallas last weekend, and party leaders repeatedly rallied delegates by commiserating with Arizona, which has come under fire for its law that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime. Critics say the new law invites racial profiling. Defenders say it's needed because the federal government isn't securing the U.S.-Mexico border. Joining that chorus, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told conventioneers Friday that "Phoenix, Arizona, I'm told, is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City. That's unacceptable in America. We understand. We in Texas understand the frustrations people feel in Arizona." Play a round of golf, good chance you'll be kidnapped? That's a scary prospect, and ripe material for the Truth-O-Meter. One thing's for sure: Many media outlets could have "told" Dewhurst that Phoenix ranks second in kidnapping incidents worldwide. Mike Walz, a spokesman for Dewhurst's campaign, sent us eight news stories noting Phoenix's nickname, plus two opinion columns and a blog post. Far as we could tell, ABC News broke the story, reporting on a Feb. 11, 2009, that: "Phoenix, Arizona, has become the kidnapping capital of America, with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone." Several news organizations then reported the information, including the Associated Press, The Arizona Republic and United Press International; some media outlets attributed the news to ABC, others just said Phoenix was "known as" the No. 2 kidnapping capital. The Los Angeles Times more specifically reported that Phoenix "police received 366 kidnapping-for-ransom reports" in 2008 and that they estimate "twice that number go unreported," according to a Feb. 12, 2009, article. A quick online search shows that Dewhurst has at least a dozen news accounts backing up his claim, but there's a hitch: None of the stories says how the kidnapping ranking was reached. Also, while all the stories specify the number of kidnappings that have occurred in Phoenix since 2008, none says how many kidnappings were reported in other cities. We asked ABC to elaborate on its report, a request that didn't immediately yield supporting evidence. Meantime, we kept digging. Neither the FBI nor the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that serves as the United States' representative to Interpol, could confirm that Phoenix has the second-highest frequency of kidnapping cases worldwide. LaTonya Miller, an Interpol spokeswoman, said the agency doesn't track local kidnapping rates. An FBI spokeswoman, Denise Ballew, suggested we call city police departments to compile a kidnapping count since unlike local authorities, the bureau tracks kidnappings that result in someone being taken from one jurisdiction to another, such as across state lines. Short of the time we'd need to call authorities in every medium- to big-size city in the world, we contacted Daniel Johnson, an overseas kidnapping operations consultant at ASI Global, a Houston-based company that coaches clients through kidnappings. You read that right: Say an insured family travels to Bulgaria and the father is kidnapped for ransom; ASI Global will deploy to Bulgaria to help the family negotiate with the abductor. Johnson said: "From our internal experience in the last year, Mexico by far has been the biggest location for kidnappings" followed by Honduras, Venezuela, Nigeria and the Philippines. The company has handled domestic cases but Thompson said they don't compare in volume to overseas incidents. Thompson said the company annually dispatches a consultant to handle about 50 to 100 cases a year. Mexico City, Caracas, Venezuela, and Tegucigalpa, Honduras are the three cities where they work on the most kidnapping cases, he said. Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company, separately chimed in: "According to our analysts, there is no way that Phoenix is the No. 2 city in the world for kidnapping and there are significantly more kidnappings in many other cities throughout Latin America," he said. "San Salvador, Guatemala City, Bogota as well as several cities in Mexico certainly have higher kidnapping rates than Phoenix." That said, Stewart said Stratfor doesn't track such kidnapping statistics, noting that it's "extremely difficult to measure given the fact that so many cases go unreported and that the record keeping in many of the most effected countries is inaccurate." The company bases its information on "intelligence that we gather through our network of human and open sources, as well as the experience of our analysts," he said. Johnson also said that generally, the problem with kidnapping statistics is there's "no reliable empirical data" and kidnappings are "inherently under-reported, anyway." Kidnappers nab someone and tell you not to tell the police, he said, adding that especially outside the United States, people typically don't report the incidents to law enforcement. Among countries that track kidnappings, Johnson said, the definition of "kidnap" varies. An "express kidnapping," for instance, can be classified as a prolonged robbery, he said. Someone takes to you against your will from ATM to ATM until your checking account is depleted. Robbery or kidnapping? Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a public information officer at the Phoenix Police Department, also said kidnappings are under-reported. "Herein lies the problem with the numbers," Thompson said. "Does Bogota, Colombia, keep records? Does Mogadishu, (Somalia), keep records? Does Houston, Texas, keep records? Does Austin keep records?" He said Phoenix has been dealing with the issue for several years now, and the number of reported kidnappings have actually decreased since this story broke in 2009. There were 358 reported kidnappings in 2008 (10 fewer than reported by the LA Times, due to later reclassification of the crimes), 318 in 2009 and there were 105 from January through May 2010, he said, putting the city on track to sustain less than 300 this year. Mindful that "spillover violence" from Mexico has become a politically-charged term in the U.S., Thompson said almost everyone who is kidnapped in Phoenix is involved in criminal activities such as illegal border crossings and the drug trade. "Unless you're involved in the dope trade, there's a very very slim chance" that you'll be kidnapped, he said. "Everyone wants to tie it to their political agenda," Thompson said. "Again, the two overwhelming questions are, do they keep records elsewhere in the world and are there more people — other agencies — across the nation who are even willing to talk about such a problem?" "It was the media that said 'second in the world only to Mexico City,' and it was basically because we were open enough to say that we have an issue with kidnappings and not try to hide it," Thompson said. Summing up: "Kidnapping capital" turns out to be a headline-grabbing label; no wonder it caught Dewhurst's attention. Still, it's incumbent on him — and news organizations bandying the No. 2 description — to check it out. So far, we've seen no evidence that it's accurate, or even close. Phoenix has experienced hundreds of kidnappings over the past few years. However, we couldn't find reliable around-the-planet evidence to confirm that only Mexico City experiences more of them. In fact, experts advise that such rankings can't be made based on available information. If they could, they speculate, other cities would prove to have more kidnappings than Arizona's capital. Punch line: Nothing confirms Phoenix as No. 2 in kidnappings worldwide. We'll revisit this turf if compelling evidence surfaces, but for now Dewhurst's statement is False.

pomt-07467	Human error, such as skipping a community in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, "is common in (the vote-tabulation) process.	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/17/kathy-nickolaus/waukesha-county-clerk-kathy-nickolaus-says-errors-/	It’s a safe bet no election clerk in Wisconsin history ever invited more questions about a vote count than Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus did on April 7, 2011. With a possible statewide recount hanging in the balance, why did Nickolaus wait more than a day to report an error that had helped give the appearance of a narrow JoAnne Kloppenburg victory in the state Supreme Court race? How could she have left an entire city, Brookfield, out of the countywide vote tabulation she released to the media? The mistake had the effect of masking a statewide lead of about 7,500 votes by Justice David Prosser in the ultra-close contest, if the now-revised totals are correct. (A statewide canvass completed April 15 gave Prosser a 7,316-vote margin of victory.) State election officials are still investigating what happened, so questions remain about what led to the screw-up. One statement Nickolaus, a Republican elected to the post in November 2002, made at her news conference got our attention. "It is important to stress that this is not a case of extra votes or extra ballots being found," she said. "This is human error -- which I apologize for -- which is common in this process, which is why the state requires us to conduct a canvass." Are errors in the election process "common?" And what about errors of this type? Nickolaus did not return a call, and has not spoken much to the media since the news conference, but we checked news archives and national, state and local experts for perspective. There’s unanimous agreement that human error is not unusual in the bustle of election day (and night), causing discrepancies between unofficial totals and the official canvassed totals produced in the days after an election. Officials also stress that such discrepancies almost invariably have nothing to do with stolen votes, uncounted or lost ballots, or extra votes. In other words, the actual voting numbers were not affected -- just the early, preliminary, unofficial tally of them. For example, in the city of New Berlin, as Nickolaus reported, a clerical error recorded a vote total for Prosser as 37 but the voting machine tape showed it was 237. And in Winnebago County, the unofficial returns in the Supreme Court race were more than 1,100 votes short because of a modem malfunction in communicating municipal votes to the county from a few voting machines. In all, more than 45 counties of 72 reported an official number -- after their canvass -- that differed from the totals they reported to the public on election night. In some cases they were off by a single vote. In some cases, the difference is not an error at all. Sometimes overseas ballots are counted late. People who forget to bring proof of residence when registering to vote can cast provisional ballots that are not counted until after the election. Write-in votes can cause delays in tabulation. Whatever the cause, the official vote canvass is where mistakes get corrected. That’s why state law sets up that process. In the case of Brookfield, the 14,000 votes were accurately tabulated at the municipal level and transmitted correctly to the media and to Nickolaus. The numbers reported by Brookfield have been confirmed by state election officials. The problem was that Nickolaus left them out of her unofficial aggregated county-wide total. That is far from common. And that puts it on a different level right off the bat. When you add in the close margin in a widely watched race -- and Nickolaus’ decision to keep it quiet -- her error falls into a category almost by itself. In fact, the Waukesha situation is so uncommon that observers have a hard time even agreeing how to describe the error. Among the descriptions: unreported votes, lost votes, unrecorded votes, discovered votes. "Waukeshananigans," some Democrats called it. Has anything remotely like this popped up in Wisconsin over the years? Here’s a look at some high-profile problems: In 1993, controversy arose over punch-card ballots that had to be thrown out because of computer or voter glitches. That became an issue in the Peter Barca-Mark Neumann congressional race, which had over 1,100 invalidated punch-card ballots in a contest Barca won by 675 votes. In November 2004 in Milwaukee, 238 absentee ballots were not returned to the polls in time to be counted. The city got special state permission to add them to the statewide canvass, but it did not affect the outcome of any races. In addition, the Journal Sentinel reported a major discrepancy between the ballot count and the number of people listed as having voted. Investigators later narrowed that gap to 4,600, based on discovery of clerical errors. In 2004 in Taylor County, a software bug in an optical scan tabulator omitted 1,500 votes for federal offices on ballots where the voter took the straight-party option. A reporter noticed the discrepancy in March 2005. It did not change any results. In 2006 in Milwaukee, the city’s unofficial count was more than 33,000 votes too high due to a computer programming error. But it’s different than the Waukesha situation: The total vote in Milwaukee was misstated, but it did not affect the totals in individual races, which were tabulated separately. So, it’s clear that big mistakes also occasionally happen. Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin’s top elections official, took issue with Nickolaus using the word "common" while describing the alleged error she made. "There are mistakes and we build in checks to catch them," Kennedy said. "But this is unusual in its magnitude and the fact that it wasn’t brought to light (immediately). That is very unusual." Three other election officials or researchers agreed with aspects of Kennedy’s comments. Kristine Schmidt, the Brookfield city clerk, said the situation was rare because Nickolaus waited so long to tell the state about the error. Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a nonprofit group that advocates for cleaner elections, said a more transparent process in Waukesha County might have prevented the error from escalating into a big deal. Diane Hermann-Brown, the Sun Prairie city clerk and president of the Wisconsin Municipal Clerks Association, said human error was inevitable, but it was uncommon to have an entire community’s results left out. Wisconsin’s unusual reliance on municipal-level election administration rather than county-by-county increases the possibility for errors, various experts noted. For a national perspective, we turned to Lawrence Norden, who catalogues election errors for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School, a left-leaning advocacy and research group. Norden said discrepancies between official and unofficial tallies are "unfortunately very common." He’s seen other instances of an entire community’s tally being left off -- but rarely in an area where the vote so heavily went to one candidate. Let’s tally up the facts here. Nickolaus talked about "common" human error in the election process. We think it’s fair to assume she was including her own error as one of the "common" mistakes. History, and experts, confirm that human error is indeed not unusual in the tabulation of preliminary election results. It’s equally clear that her error, while not unprecedented, is on the extreme end of the scale and is a rarity. Our definition for Barely True is: The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our ruling. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04306	Says Mitt Romney’s plan makes "catastrophic cuts to education."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/30/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-will-make-catastrophic-cuts-e/	With Election Day approaching, a new ad from Barack Obama implores voters to remember, in the solitude of the voting booth, what Mitt Romney plans for the country. "In here, it’s just you," a narrators says against an image of a man voting. "No ads, no debates, just you. "So think about this: Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations on the banks that crashed our economy. Medicare: voucherized. Catastrophic cuts to education. Millionaires will get one of the largest tax cuts ever, while middle class families pay more. "That’s what Mitt Romney wants to bring here," the narrator says against a photo of the White House. "Remember that when you go here." (Another voting booth shot.) PolitiFact has examined numerous claims throughout the campaign about the potential effects of Romney tax plan and the budget constructed by his running mate, Paul Ryan, who’s also the chair of the budget committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. Here we’ll look specifically at the charge that Romney would make "catastrophic cuts" to education. The Ryan budget Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, first presented his budget in 2011. Versions of it have passed the House each of the last two years, but it has never passed the Democratic-controlled Senate. The 2013 proposal cuts $5.3 trillion from the federal ledger over the next decade by enacting major changes in entitlement programs and making steep reductions in discretionary domestic spending to bring down the public debt. Ryan’s plan doesn’t say which programs would be cut or by how much, nor does it dictate that programs be cut across the board. But because the budget reduces federal spending so drastically -- from its current level of 12.5 percent of GDP down to 5.75 percent by 2030 -- experts say deep program cuts will be necessary. Any direct cuts to schools, though, would be implemented at the state and local level. Those are the government entities that collect taxes that fund individual school districts. Where does Romney stand on the Ryan budget? In March 2012, Romney said in Chicago, "I’m very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. The following week, while campaigning in Wisconsin, he added, "I think it’d be marvelous if the Senate were to pick up Paul Ryan’s budget and adopt it and pass it along to the President." More recently, since Ryan joined the ticket, Romney has said the two agree broadly. "I’m sure there are places that my budget is different than his, but we’re on the same page," he said in August. The campaign has also emphasized the Romney will put together his own plan. But on his website, Romney makes this promise about "stopping the bleeding" of federal spending: "Pass the House Republican Budget proposal, rolling back President Obama’s government expansion by capping non-security discretionary spending below 2008 levels." On education The Obama ad cites the Denver Post as its source for the "catastrophic cuts" to education claim. But that Oct. 19 story is actually an editorial endorsing Obama’s re-election. And the cuts are not specific to education. "Romney's approach is one of tax cuts for all, drastic Medicare reform, increased defense spending, and what would be catastrophic cuts to other discretionary programs," the editorial said. The campaign also pointed us to an analysis of Ryan’s budget by the White House Office of Management and Budget. The OMB generally presents reliable numbers, but it’s important to bear in mind that it’s part of the Obama administration. The report from March 2012 is headlined "The Ryan-Republican Budget: The Consequences of Imbalance." The report criticizes the proposed spending cuts, and the overall lack of specificity. "What would it all mean? The Budget doesn’t say. In fact, the Budget resolution includes a magic asterisk — or, in more technical parlance, an ‘allowance’— for $897 billion in unspecified cuts. But what could the resolution mean? Since the House has refused to specify what would be cut, we consider the impacts if the cuts are distributed equally across the Budget. The result would be that." So the analysis assumes across-the-board cuts, which -- again -- is not specified in Ryan’s budget. Under that assumption, OMB predicted that the Department of Education would be cut by more than $115 billion over a decade. The fallout of that? According to the OMB: "9.6 million students would see their Pell Grants fall by more than $1,000 in 2014, and, over the next decade, over one million students would lose support altogether. This would derail bipartisan education reforms and deeply undermine K-12 education and college opportunity." Romney’s position We contacted the Romney campaign, which directed us to comments the former Massachusetts governor made in the first presidential debate on Oct. 3. "I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm not planning on making changes there," Romney said. On the specific issue of Pell grants for college students, Romney said at a Univision Forum in Miami on Sept. 19, "We’re going to continue a Pell Grant program. … I think the Republican budget called for a Pell Grants being capped out at their current high level. My inclination would be to have them go with the rate of inflation." But that stands in contrast with what Romney told donors at a private fundraiser in April. Then, he said he would at least restructure the federal education agency and make it smaller. "The Department of Education: I will either consolidate with another agency, or perhaps make it a heck of a lot smaller. I'm not going to get rid of it entirely," Romney said. Our ruling Obama’s ad said Romney would make "catastrophic cuts to education." The statement assumes Romney would adopt the Ryan budget, a blueprint he has generally embraced. The Ryan budget does not specify any cuts to education funding, but we think it’s fair to expect significant reductions to any domestic program, given that lower spending is the goal of the Ryan proposal. And Romney is on the record as saying he would shrink the Department of Education. The ad’s claim uses exaggeration to fill in the blanks of what Romney might do, but the Ryan budget and Romney's own words point toward cuts. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02557	NFL "players are living, on average, longer than the average male."	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/02/roger-goodell/nfls-goodell-says-players-live-longer-average-male/	Fox started its wall-to-wall coverage of Super Bowl XLVIII on Fox News Sunday, with host Chris Wallace interviewing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell live from MetLife Stadium. Goodell talked about the weather, and how it appears conditions will be fine for the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks. He addressed a proposal to eliminate extra points, saying they’re almost automatic (as we previously reported, they are). And he discussed the health of NFL players amid concern that the sport is too violent. Goodell offered a defense that we hadn’t heard before. "Our players are living, on average, longer than the average male," Goodell said. After serious talk about concussions in the NFL and some prominent suicides in the sport, we wondered about Goodell’s claim. It’s accurate, it turns out, but requires some additional explanation. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a government research agency within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, studied the mortality rates of former NFL football players in a report released in 2012. The study included nearly all NFL players who played in the league for five or more years from 1959 to 1988 -- a pool of 3,439 men. Researchers said based on current mortality rates, they expected 625 players to be deceased. But by the end of 2007, only 334 were. "We found the players in our study had a much lower rate of death overall compared to men in the general population," researchers wrote to the NFL players in a March 2012 letter. "This means that, on average, NFL players are actually living longer than men in the general population." The former NFL players also had lower rates of heart disease and cancer compared to average males, the report found. There are a few important caveats to point out. NFL players aren't like your average male in a number of ways. They are professional athletes, many of whom might be wealthy, and they are likely to have access to quality health care. The report also raised red flags. Researchers found that men who were considered obese, those with a Body Mass Index of 30 or more when they played, had twice the risk of death from heart disease than other players. African-American players also had a higher heart disease risk than Caucasian players, the report found. Another important note: Because the study excludes modern-day players, it fails to account for the changing physique of today’s football player. Of the 3,439 men in the NIOSH study, only 1 percent had a Body Mass Index of 35 or more when they played, and 33 percent had a Body Mass Index between 30 and 35. Today’s NFL players are much bigger. To create an example, we looked at the current 53-man roster of the Denver Broncos and calculated each player’s Body Mass Index using a calculator from the National Institutes of Health. Of 53 Broncos players, 13 have a Body Index above 35 (24.5 percent) and another 14 have a Body Mass Index between 30 and 35 (26.4 percent). That’s an important distinction that may affect the results of future studies. Our ruling Goodell said that NFL "players are living, on average, longer than the average male." His claim is backed up by a government study that examined former NFL players who played from 1959 to 1988. But the study, which was released in 2012, did conclude that bigger players had an increased risk of dying from heart disease and did not evaluate more modern-day players. Modern-day players are bigger. We rate Goodell’s statement Mostly True.	None	Roger Goodell	None	None	None	2014-02-02T12:25:08	2014-02-02	['None']
pomt-14998	Virginia’s current unemployment rate is "the lowest in Virginia history."	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/12/richard-saslaw/salaw-says-virginia-unemployment-rate-all-time-low/	Richard Saslaw, the state Senate minority leader, says although Virginia faces headwinds from federal budget cuts, the state’s economy is sailing forward. "Our unemployment (rate) is the lowest in the Southeast U.S. and the lowest in Virginia history — the lowest in Virginia history," Saslaw, D-Fairfax, said during Monday’s debate against his Republican counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment of James City. Since Saslaw doubled down on his proclamation that the state’s jobless level has reached the lowest point ever, we checked to see if he was correct. We turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which keeps the closely watched tallies of each state’s unemployment rate. For August, the rate was 4.5 percent, according to the latest figures available when Saslaw made his claim. These monthly figures date to 1976, but you don’t have to go back too far to find a time when the rate was lower than 4.5 percent. It was lower than that level each month during the 149 months from May 1996 through September 2008. During that period, there were times it even was below the 3 percent threshold and actually reached a low point of 2.1 percent in October and November of 2000. In September 2008, as the recession took hold, Virginia’s jobless rate started to grow at a brisk clip and eventually hit 7.4 percent by January 2010. The rate has trended down since then. The 4.5 percent figure for August is the lowest the rate has been since it started to spike in 2008, Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a Sept. 18 news release. Sam Sterling, Saslaw’s campaign manager, said the senator was trying to reiterate the governor’s point that unemployment is the lowest since 2008, but he didn’t say that during the debate. "He had meant to say that (Virginia) has its lowest unemployment rate since 2008," Sterling wrote in an email. We also should note that Virginia has seen other periods of sub-4.5 percent unemployment, including 39 months from May 1987 through July 1990 and from December 1994 through April 1995. Our ruling Saslaw said during the debate that Virginia’s unemployment rate is the lowest in the state’s history. Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show he’s wrong, and the senator’s campaign says he garbled his talking point. We rate the claim False.

pomt-03144	Pending a federal waiver, the 2013 Legislature "eliminated the overtesting of students in grades 3-8 by decreasing the number of tests from 17 to 8."	/texas/statements/2013/sep/12/jason-isaac/legislators-claim-overstates-possible-reduction-te/	Great news for students, state Rep. Jason Isaac said in a commentary describing education-related actions by the 2013 Texas Legislature. Mandated high school end-of-course exams were cut from 15 to five, Isaac wrote. We knew that. But the Dripping Springs Republican celebrated more reductions, writing: "We also eliminated the overtesting of students in grades 3-8 by decreasing the number of tests from 17 to 8." Isaac added that House Bill 866 eliminated "some of the STAAR (State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness) testing requirements for students who meet certain performance thresholds." Isaac then mentioned the approved measure also would give charter schools more testing discretion. "However," he wrote, "because of federal mandates, the state must seek and be granted a waiver from the federal government in order for these changes to take place." A former Democratic state Senate candidate, Kathi Thomas, asked us to review the proclaimed 17-to-8 reduction. She said she saw Isaac's article in the Aug. 29, 2013, Dripping Springs News-Dispatch. Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email that House Bill 866, which was signed into law on June 14, 2013, "would reduce some testing" if the described waiver won federal approval. Another spokeswoman, DeEtta Culbertson, told us by email that the intended cut in tests--from 17 to 11, not 8--would apply only to students who performed well on such exams. Ratcliffe said a waiver was needed because the change in Texas law conflicted with federal requirements set in place by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, "which requires us to test students in reading and math every year for grades 3-8, we have had to ask the U.S. Department of Education for a waiver. That waiver is still pending." Her response came a few days before the TEA announced Sept. 9, 2013, that the federal department had turned thumbs down on granting the waiver. Previously, in a July 19, 2013, press release, the state education agencyhad announced that Michael Williams, the Texas education commissioner, had sought clarification from the U.S. Department of Education per its authority to waive reading and math tests of students in grades 3-8 as required under the federal law. The agency had said then that under HB 866, a federal "waiver must be secured to reduce or eliminate assessment requirements for certain students at the elementary and middle school grade levels." "Should the federal government determine that relevant provisions of federal law may be waived and ultimately grant a waiver request," the press release said, "potential changes would include assessments for math in grades 3, 5 and 8; and reading in grades 3, 5 and 8. Current federal law requires testing for math and reading for all students in grades 3 through 8." Students who performed well on the tests would be freed "to focus their time and energy on learning new material and not focusing every year on a test where there is a high likelihood that they would demonstrate success," Williams said in a letter to Arne Duncan, the U.S. education secretary. If the federal government were to grant the waiver, according to a May 1, 2013, analysis of the state law by the non-partisan House Research Organization, students in grades 3-8 who met certain performance thresholds would not be required to take some STAAR exams. The analysis said supporters of the measure predicted high-performing students could go from having 17 STAAR exams to facing as few as eight. Not quite, according to TEA’s Culbertson, who told us that if the waiver were granted, students in grades 3-8 would still be required to take 11 tests and students who did not score highly enough would face additional exams. Culbertson listed the 11 STAARs required of all students under the 2013 law as reading and math tests in grades 3, 5 and 8; writing in grades 4 and 7; science in grades 5 and 8; and social studies in grade 8. Culbertson said that students who either fail to score well enough on a test or who attend school in districts choosing to give the exams to every student could be subject to reading and math STAARs in grades 4, 6 and 7. Isaac’s chief of staff, Ellen Troxclair, pointed out by email that while Isaac’s column explicitly said lawmakers had cut required tests in grades 3-8 from 17 to 8, it also mentioned students needing to meet performance thresholds and that the need for a waiver. "The fact remains that had the waiver been granted, the bill would have significantly reduced the number of tests for many students," she wrote. We noticed, finally, that Isaac’s commentary was published in the newspaper with the relevant test-cut sentences taking up two paragraphs, effectively distancing his declaration that mandated tests were cut from 17 to 8 from some of his caveats. Troxclair sent us the text of what she described as his original commentary as submitted and showing all the test-cut information in one paragraph. In contrast, Dale Roberson, publisher of the News-Dispatch, told us by phone that the Isaac commentary arrived at the paper as one giant block of copy. He said he broke the text into readable paragraphs before publication. Our ruling Isaac declared that lawmakers reduced state tests in grades 3-8 from 17 to 8, pending a federal waiver. Under the change in law, though, only well-performing Texas students would have faced fewer tests and even they would still have faced at least 11 exams, not 8. The approved measure left students not fulfilling performance expectations subject to 17 tests. In his commentary, Isaac waved at the need for the waiver and that students scoring well would be affected, but he mentioned these elements only after asserting that the tests were cut--period. Presenting the conditions up front would have made the claim more accurate. We rate this statement, which overstates the reduced number of tests and risks the misimpression that every student would see relief, as Half True. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-10595	"The 1990s were a time of prosperity. We created more than 22-million new jobs, moved 8-million people out of poverty, and turned our economy around."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/25/bill-clinton/the-1990s-good-times/	With heightened fears of a recession, Bill Clinton wants you to remember the good old days, the days of Spice Girls and Starbucks and economic prosperity ... the 1990s. The days when, you know, he was president. In a radio ad that is running in South Carolina, Bill Clinton suggests things could be like that again, if you elect his wife. "The 1990s were a time of prosperity," Clinton says in the ad. "We created more than 22-million new jobs, moved 8-million people out of poverty, and turned our economy around. "It's time for another comeback, time to make America great again. I know Hillary's the one who can do it." There are two main statistics in this advertisement (which Hillary Clinton has also thrown out from time to time), and we find that Bill Clinton is on target on both. The first is about new jobs. According to Bureau of Labor statistics, the number of employees on nonagricultural payrolls went from 109.7-million in January 1993 (when Clinton took office) to 132.5-million in January 2001 (when Clinton checked out). Net gain: 22.8-million new jobs. The other claim is fewer people living in poverty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people living in poverty went from 38-million in 1992 to 31-million in 2000; not quite 8-million as Bill Clinton said, but pretty close. "The hard numbers are correct, but how much of that can you attribute to Clinton's policies?" said James Sherk, a labor policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. Keep in mind, Sherk said, the country was beginning to come out of a recession before Clinton took office. And much of the dramatic change came after 1995 when Republicans had secured control of Congress. Sherk noted that Clinton initially opposed the Welfare Reform Act, which Sherk believes may have been the biggest catalyst in reducing poverty numbers. Sherk says Clinton was also a little lucky. "He had the good fortune to be in office at the height of the tech bubble," he said. "It makes his time in office look good in ways he can't take credit for." Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institute, says there's no getting around the numbers. Sure, Burtless said, the dot.com craze may have helped the economic numbers, and some may argue that the U.S. economy was due for an up-cycle during the 1990s, "but the fact is, there was significant economic growth during that period. It's tough to get around that." "To the degree that a president can effect economic progress," Burtless said, "most would say Bill Clinton did well above average." Let the partisan folks argue about whether Bill Clinton deserves credit for the numbers, or whether Hillary Clinton can recreate them. The numbers are right. We rate Bill Clinton's statement True.

pomt-12579	"More than 20 million people are at risk of dying from starvation within 6 months in 4 nations."	/global-news/statements/2017/apr/11/joseph-crowley/famine-threatens-four-nations/	Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., joined members of Congress on Twitter April 7 to raise awareness for food issues using the hashtag #FightFamine. "More than 20 million people are at risk of dying from starvation within 6 months in 4 nations," he wrote. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is that true? The tweet is based on a projection from the United Nations. The U.N.’s head of emergency relief Stephen O’Brien provided the 20 million persons estimate to the U.N. Security Council on March 10. Behind that figure lie crises in Yemen, South Sudan, northeastern Nigeria and Somalia. "Without collective and coordinated global efforts, people will simply starve to death," O’Brien told council members. To be clear, the number of people today who literally would have nothing to eat if it weren’t for international aid is less than 20 million. But O’Brien warned that it would reach that number if nothing is done. O’Brien said this disaster would unfold in 2017. The chief economist of the U.N. World Food Program warned in February that the world could see widespread starvation develop in these four places within six months. "This is the first time that we are literally talking about famine in four different parts of the world at the same time," Arif Husain told Reuters in an interview. An immediate surge of $200 million in aid was needed O’Brien said, but he cautioned that most of the problems are political. "With access and funding, humanitarians will do more, but we are not the long-term solution to this growing crisis," he said. Only in Somalia has nature played a key role. The causes in Yemen, South Sudan and northeastern Nigeria are primarily man-made. Yemen Years of civil war have killed an estimated 10,000 civilians and shredded the fabric of life for millions of Yemenis. A coalition of followers of the Houthi movement and forces loyal to the previous president toppled the elected government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Iran has backed the insurgents. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have deployed airstrikes and soldiers to restore Hadi to power. The World Food Program said nearly a quarter of the population -- 6.8 million -- rely entirely on outside assistance. A sharp delcine in oil and gas exports caused the economy to collapse, essentially shutting down all imports of wheat and rice. South Sudan After almost 40 years of civil war, South Sudan separated from Sudan in 2011, but peace was short lived. By 2013, competing factions battled for control of the new country. Since then, the violence displaced about 2.7 million people. Combatants target civilians and aid workers, making South Sudan one of the most dangerous places to deliver humanitarian assistance. The U.S. Famine Early Warning Network reported that the "conflict has disrupted planting, harvesting, and other livelihood activities." With production down, food prices have shot up beyond the reach of millions. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Northeastern Nigeria Kidnappings and attacks by Boko Haram insurgents in the north produced a running battle with Nigerian armed forces. About 2 million people abandoned their fields and fled their homes. The crisis is most acute in the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe where about 7 million people need humanitarian assistance. Despite gains by the Nigerian military, farmers have been unable to plant for three years in a row. Some fear outright attack, but landmines present an ongoing threat long after rebels have been driven back. Without a new harvest, not only will farmers’ families lack food, but what food is available will be more expensive. Somalia Extreme weather has dramatically added to the human misery in an already fragile state. After floods ruined crops and displaced people in 2015, drought has now led to some of the driest conditions in decades in some regions. According to the United Nations, over half of the population -- about 6.2 million -- is in need of help. That includes about 363,000 acutely malnourished children. Aid officials say the nation is on the brink of famine. Our ruling Crowley said that 20 million people are at risk of dying from starvation within six months in four nations. That’s in line with the assessments of two U.N. officials who say the threat is of historic proportions. We rate this claim True.

pomt-08720	"80 to 85 percent of my campaign funds go to donations to various organizations throughout the City of Providence."	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/03/john-lombardi/lombardi-says-he-donates-80-85-percent-his-campaig/	Political observers will remember the Aug. 24 Providence mayoral debate for candidate Chris Young's marriage proposal, which made national news. But amid the YouTube clips and pundit chatter that dominated the aftermath, an otherwise substantive debate was overshadowed. There’s a lot we could have checked from that debate (was the proposal legit, or was it a political ploy?). We'll start, however, by focusing on the one candidate who specifically challenged voters to check his record. Drawing on questions from viewers during the web-broadcast segment, WPRI-TV's Tim White, the moderator, asked the candidates whether they’d be willing to give leftover campaign funds to nonprofit organizations. Longtime Providence Councilman John Lombardi’s answer? "I would challenge anyone to look at my finance reports at the Board of Elections. I would venture to say that 80 to 85 percent of my campaign funds go to donations to various organizations throughout the city of Providence, so the answer would be yes, but that would just be a natural occurrence for me." We love a good challenge, so we barely hesitated before picking up the phone to ask Lombardi whether he actually did all that math to get to 80 to 85 percent. "Of course I didn’t run the numbers," he told us, half laughing, half annoyed. OK, but you did challenge us to check your filings, right? Lombardi said the comment was said in jest and was meant to be nothing more than "a tongue-in-cheek remark." We here at PolitiFact like a good joke as much as the next person; however, when you encourage "anyone to look at my finance reports," it doesn't sound much like one. We decided to take him up on the challenge that he now says wasn't a challenge and checked his campaign filings anyway. Since Lombardi didn’t specify a time frame for the 80-percent donation rate, we elected to start by looking at his 2010 second-quarter campaign finance report. Lombardi said he gave to "various organizations," rather than "nonprofits," so we gave him a little latitude on whom we counted. For example, we included his donations to the 15th Ward Democratic Association as well as checks written to fundraisers and schools. The only exception was when such a donation specified "advertising," as was the case with money he gave to the Rhode Island Catholic Diocese and several other organizations. (It is worth noting that giving away money -- including campaign contributions -- is a standard practice for candidates to reward supporters and attract votes.) The most cash Lombardi had on hand during the second quarter was $121,393; he gave about $5,400 of that to local organizations. That's about 4.4 percent of the total, nowhere near the 80 percent to 85 percent he suggested. When we asked Lombardi about his second-quarter filings, he said the 80-percent figure was never meant to apply to that period because he is spending so much of his campaign funds on his run for mayor. "But if you go back last year or so before, you’ll find that," he told us. "…Other than this year, that’s a matter of course for me." We understand that rationale. It makes sense that he’s not giving away much of his money during a heated primary, which is why we took him up on this suggestion as well and checked all his filings from 2009. That was before he was ramping up his mayoral campaign, but after his last City Council race was over. So it seemed like a reasonable time for him to have given more to charity. He didn't. In the first quarter he gave about 4.2 percent of his funds to local organizations. That number jumped to 7.4 percent in the second quarter, before dropping to 3.5 percent in the third quarter and 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter. That's a yearly average of 4.35 percent. It doesn't even break double digits. In a follow-up conversation, Lombardi's campaign treasurer said the candidate meant to phrase the claim as 80 percent to 85 percent of his total spending, not his total cash. In the interest of fairness, we ran those numbers too. In 2009, just under 20 percent of his spending, on average, went to local organizations. Again, the numbers never came close to 80 percent. Lombardi himself offered another defense, insisting that many of his paid ads ran in church bulletins and should therefore be counted as charitable donations. But regardless of where they appeared, those announcements were still paid advertisements promoting Lombardi. When he filed his campaign reports he listed them as just that. It's clear that Lombardi gives donations to local organizations. But his statement at the debate that he donates 80 percent to 85 percent is simply wrong. Lombardi may have been joking, as he maintains, or perhaps he just made an unfortunate exaggeration that in a less politically charged time may have gone unnoticed. Speaking on camera during the debate, he didn't say he was speaking in jest, nor did he crack a smile or do anything else to suggest he wasn’t serious. What he did was lead voters to believe he deserved credit for a level of charity that was, at best, greatly exaggerated. Pants on Fire.

pomt-14997	"There have been seven investigations (of Benghazi) led mostly by Republicans in the Congress" that concluded "nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/12/hillary-clinton/clinton-there-have-been-7-benghazi-probes-so-far/	House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested last week that Congress’ current investigation into the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, is a political move against former Hillary Clinton, and she was quick to jump on the Republican’s gaffe. In an interview Monday morning, Clinton was visibly frustrated with the ongoing Benghazi investigation. "There have been seven investigations led mostly by Republicans in the Congress," Clinton said. "And they were nonpartisan, and they reached conclusions that, first of all, I and nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make. This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans." Is Clinton correct that there have been seven and now eight investigations into Benghazi? We started counting and found she was largely accurate. Here’s what we found. Background Clinton was secretary of state when Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in the barrage. In the weeks following the attack, the White House was heavily questioned for its response to the terrorist attack. Many debated, among conflicting reports from intelligence officials, what role al-Qaeda played in the attack and how much the White House knew about the group’s involvement. Critics also questioned whether Clinton and the State Department could have better addressed security at the U.S. facilities before they were attacked. The debate got more partisan as time went on, as Republicans began speaking of conspiracy theories and cover-ups. The seven probes mentioned by Clinton include only those conducted by Congress, but there was at least one more. After the attack, Clinton convened an Accountability Review Board to investigate the incident -- something she was legally required to do. The Board’s report found no fault in the State Department for the terrorist attacks but acknowledged "systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies" that left Benghazi vulnerable. Four State Department officials were temporarily suspended and ultimately reassigned within the department. It should be noted that each congressional committee that investigated the Benghazi attack looked into different aspects of the event. After the attack, Republican Speaker John Boehner directed the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence to investigate the issues within their jurisdictions. The House investigations were led by Republicans. Two bipartisan Senate Committees also investigated the attack. Clinton said the committees found that she and her department had not committed wrongdoing but suggested changes. Actually, almost every committee report found her department did not adequately address security concerns in Libya or could have done more to prevent the attack. Clinton’s words give the best possible spin to the various committee findings, but she’s also essentially accurate. Here’s a list of all the congressional investigations and what they found. Investigation 1: The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform The House Oversight Committee was one of the first committees to question Clinton following the Benghazi attack. On Sept. 16, 2013, the Republican-led committee released an interim report on the Accountability Review Board appointed by Clinton. The report raised questions about the independence and integrity of the Accountability Review Board (since Clinton appointed the board to investigate her own department) and criticized the conclusions in the board’s final report. Investigation 2: The Senate Committee On Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs This bipartisan committee released a report in December 2012 detailing the "high risk" of a terrorist attack at the U.S. facilities in Libya. While the report criticized the State Department for not addressing the security concerns leading up to the attack, it also found "administration officials were inconsistent in stating publicly that the deaths in Benghazi were the result of a terrorist attack." The report attributed the State Department’s security failures to intelligence problems and a failure "to imagine the type of attack that occurred." Investigation 3: The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence The Senate Intelligence Committee released a bipartisan report in January 2014 calling the Benghazi attacks "preventable." Among other findings, the committee concluded the State Department had received ample warning about deteriorating security in Libya and failed to adequately increase security in the weeks leading up to the attack. The report also faulted intelligence officials for not relaying information on the CIA annex to the U.S. military. Investigation 4: The House Committee on Foreign Affairs Clinton testified before this House committee on Jan. 23, 2013 (she also testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier that day). The House Committee on Foreign Affairs later released a report criticizing Clinton and other high-ranking officials who they said were "provided extensive warning of the deteriorating security environment in eastern Libya." The report also criticized the State Department’s Accountability Review Board, which "was seriously deficient in several respects," especially in its failure to comment on the actions of the department’s highest ranking officials, including Clinton. Investigation 5: The House Committee on the Judiciary The focus of the Committee on the Judiciary’s probe was the FBI investigation that followed the terrorist attack. The committee released its findings in April 2013 as part of an interim progress report in conjunction with the five other Republican-led committees investigating Benghazi. The report detailed how the FBI did not investigate the scene until three weeks after the attack and spent less than one day collecting evidence in Benghazi. The committee also faulted Clinton for reducing security at the Benghazi consulate, despite her testimony that she "had no knowledge" of security requests from the compound. Investigation 6: The House Committee on Armed Services The Armed Services Committee began its investigation "immediately after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya… to evaluate the response of the Department of Defense" to the attack, according to a February 2014 committee report. The Republican-led committee bashed the Obama administration’s failure to address security threats in Benghazi, asserting that the military was unprepared for possible violence in Libya. Investigation 7: The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence The House Intelligence Committee concluded its two-year Benghazi investigation in November 2014 when it released a report exonerating the Obama administration of wrongdoing in its response to the attack. The report found evidence of contradicting intelligence among government officials and concluded officials did not intentionally mislead the public with information in the days following the attack. Ongoing Investigation 8: The House Select Committee on Benghazi The Republican-led House created the House Select Committee on Benghazi in May 2014 after a conservative watchdog group discovered new State Department emails about the attacks. The committee includes seven Republicans and five Democrats. The group released an interim progress report in May 2015, but the committee’s Democrats have been outspoken on the committee’s lack of progress. Clinton, who has faced more scrutiny over Benghazi after it was discovered she used a private email server while serving as Secretary of State, is set to testify before the Benghazi panel on Oct. 22. Our ruling Clinton said, "There have been seven investigations (of Benghazi) led mostly by Republicans in the Congress" that concluded "nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make." Clinton’s number is correct: there were seven previous congressional probes into the Benghazi attack. Saying these committees were led "mostly by Republicans" is also a fair assertion: the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs were the only two committees not led by Republicans. As for her comment that there was no overt wrongdoing, just room for improvement, that’s a rosy assessment. But it is also largely accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01684	Says Rick Scott took $200,000 in campaign contributions from a company that "profited off pollution."	/florida/statements/2014/aug/15/nextgen-climate/nextgen-ad-rick-scott-takes-money-polluters/	California billionaire Tom Steyer’s NextGen Climate group unleashed an ad that accuses Gov. Rick Scott of being cozy with a polluter. "A dangerous new type of oil drilling near the Everglades threatened drinking water for 7 million Floridians," states part of the ad. "But one Floridian is benefitting. Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution." The text on the screen states: "Rick Scott $200,000 from oil interests." Scott’s side refuted the ad and the Republican Party of Florida counter-punched with its own TV ad: "Crist’s team says Gov. Scott took contributions from this polluter. It’s total fiction. Scott didn’t take a nickel. Scott held the polluter accountable. Shut down their wells...." Did Scott, who is facing re-election, take campaign cash from a "company that profited off pollution" and receive $200,000 from oil interests? We decided to drill down to sort out the facts. Controversial drilling project led state to sue When we dug into the ad, we found a very complicated backstory. The ad’s makers told us the contributions refer to Collier Resources Co., but the story really begins with a separate company: Dan A. Hughes Co. In June 2012, Collier leased about 120,000 acres of mineral rights to Hughes. A few months later Hughes received a state permit to construct its first exploratory well. The public outcry began when Hughes sought additional permits the next year. Residents received a letter in April 2013 from a Hughes subcontractor asking for information needed to draw up an evacuation plan in case of an explosion. Despite residents’ protests, in September 2013, DEP granted Hughes a permit to inject acid deep underground to fracture the limestone. The process is similar to hydraulic fracking, which has been the subject of heated debate across the country, although the industry term for it is "acid stimulation." Hughes also wanted to try something never before allowed in Florida. After injecting the acid, Hughes workers injected a mix of sand and chemical gel under pressure to prop open the new fractures and let the oil flow out. That's known as using a "proppant," and it was not covered by the DEP permit, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In December 2013, Hughes told DEP that it intended to start that operation in a few days. The DEP sought a short delay to review the plan, but then Hughes did it anyway. That led DEP to fine Hughes $25,000 in April and order Hughes to hire an expert to monitor groundwater for contamination. After months of wrangling, the state said Hughes failed to meet the terms of the consent order, yanked the company’s permits and filed a lawsuit. Collier and Hughes agreed to terminate the lease, and Hughes announced that it was pulling out of Florida. DEP conducted groundwater sampling and found no contamination, but environmentalists say more extensive testing is needed. "Hughes is not a ‘polluter’ nor has it turned a profit on the well, which the company unilaterally shut-in due to the controversy," Hughes spokesman David Blackmon said. There was, however, an entity that "profited" -- though we can’t say they "profited from pollution": the Collier Resources Co. that leased the land to Hughes. Blackmon told PolitiFact Florida that Hughes will not be reimbursed for the terminated lease. Campaign contributions The ad doesn’t identify the campaign donors or company when it states that "Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution." For those following the controversy, it would be easy to wrongly assume the ad referred to donations from Hughes. But Hughes "has not contributed to the Crist or Scott campaigns and does not intend to," Blackmon said. Instead, NextGen is referring to four members of the Collier family -- Barron, Miles, Parker and Thomas -- who each gave $50,000 to Scott’s Let’s Get to Work Committee in January 2013. PolitiFact Florida verified those donations on the state elections website. We asked a Collier representative why the individuals donated to Scott, but the answer didn’t shed much light. "Certain individual owners have personally supported the Governor in the past, but those decisions are made individually and without any input from Collier Resources Company," said Priscylla M. Oliva, executive assistant to Barron Collier Companies, in an email to PolitiFact Florida. The Collier family has donated to multiple state and federal candidates and causes -- mostly Republicans and conservative groups. In terms of state donations, the donation to Scott stands out. We found one state donation that was larger than the ones to Scott’s committee: Parker Collier gave $525,000 to the Republican Party of Florida in 2010. In 2010, Parker and Miles Collier were ranked seventh in the country among top individuals funding outside spending groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Our ruling NextGen’s ad states that "Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution" and received $200,000 from oil interests. Scott’s campaign received $50,000 from four different members of the Collier family. The Collier Resources Co. leased mineral rights on its land to Hughes for drilling, so it’s fair to refer to those donations as being from "oil interests." However, there are two key elements of the claim that are misleading. The ad doesn’t name the company or campaign donor, so it’s possible for viewers who are knowledgeable about the controversy to mistakenly assume that the donations were by Hughes. The other problematic part is that there isn’t proof that pollution occurred. The state’s preliminary tests indicated there was no contamination. Though environmentalists say additional testing is needed, we rate claims based on information available at the time. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07620	"What we have now is the most generous, in my opinion, 'good time' bill in the entire United States."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/21/richard-ferruccio/correctional-officer-says-rhode-island-has-nations/	The practice of granting early release to criminals in prison has come under intense scrutiny in Rhode Island, following the news that Michael Woodmansee is scheduled to be set free this summer, after serving 28 years of a 40-year sentence for murdering his South Kingstown neighbor, 5-year-old Jason Foreman. Many Rhode Islanders were outraged that Woodmansee’s sentence had been shaved by 12 years and he would soon be released to the community, at age 53. Among those speaking out against Woodmansee’s release is Richard Ferruccio, a correctional officer who was president of the correctional officers’ union for nine years and was a lobbyist on their behalf at the State House. On the "Helen Glover" show on radio station WHJJ (920-AM), Ferruccio complained that Woodmansee would have served his entire 40-year sentence if "good time" provisions had not allowed him to cut his sentence short. There would be less crime, he said, if criminals were kept in prison longer. He went on to say that Rhode Island’s "good time" provisions were already liberal during much of Woodmansee’s time in prison. Then, in 2008, the General Assembly, with support from prison administrators, made the provisions even more favorable to inmates. "What we had in Rhode Island prior to then [2008] was one of the most generous "good time" bills in the country," Ferruccio said. "What we have now is the most generous, in my opinion, ‘good time’ bill in the entire United States." We wondered if Rhode Island really has the nation’s most liberal "good time" policies. In general, "good time" refers to days prisoners can cut from their sentences for good behavior. At least 38 states offer prisoners the opportunity to earn "good time." Many states, including Rhode Island, also grant additional time off for prison work and successful completion of educational programs. Supporters of such programs say they are incentives to inmates to stay out of trouble while behind bars and can be part of the rehabilitative process. Educational and vocational programs, they say, prepare prisoners for life on the outside. Opponents say they allow dangerous criminals to go free far too early. The "good time" policy in place during most of Woodmansee’s 28 years in prison granted inmates up to 10 days off per month for good behavior, plus two more days for working in prison. In 2008, the General Assembly approved up to five more days per month for those taking classes or participating in programs. That brought the maximum time an inmate can earn to 17 days per month. The Assembly made the change in part to save money. And it worked. In the first year of the new law, the average population of the Adult Correctional Institutions dropped by 87 prisoners, to 3,773, according to a Department of Corrections report. To support his argument that Rhode Island’s current "good time" law is the nation’s most generous, Ferruccio supplied a March 18, 2008 survey of state policies, compiled by the Connecticut Department of Corrections. (Rhode Island’s law was changed in May 2008.) The Connecticut survey shows that at the time of the survey, Rhode Island fell roughly in the middle of states. Some states, such as Georgia, Hawaii and Idaho, had no "good time" provisions. But 13 other states had more generous policies. Arkansas and New Mexico, for example, granted up to 30 days off a month. California would waive half a sentence for non-violent offenders. Iowa reduced sentences by 1.2 days for each day served. North Carolina granted one day off for each discipline-free day served. A more recent survey, completed in January by the National Conference of State Legislatures but not yet published, found the awarding of "good time" appears to be a growing trend. The survey showed that 14 states appear to be more generous than Rhode Island. Alabama, for instance, grants up to 75 days off per month for good behavior -- the result is those prisoners who qualify serve about a third of their sentences. Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico grant up to 30 days per month. Rhode Island does have the most generous policy in New England, according to the 2011 survey. Massachusetts allows inmates to earn up to 7.5 days per month for educational and work efforts, Maine offers up to 4 days per month. New Hampshire, Vermont and Connecticut have no "good time." When we apprised Ferruccio of our findings, he said he was more certain about New England. Ferruccio argues that Rhode Island corrections officials misrepresent the total amount of time prisoners can cut from their sentences because they earn additional time off for completing education and rehabilitation programs. But that’s the case in many states. For instance, prisoners who complete their high school equivalency get an extra 90 days in Arkansas and Kentucky, six months in Indiana. Alison Lawrence, author of the January survey, says most states allow prisoners to accumulate earned time on top of good time. And there is an overall increase in granting more earned time because states believe it leads to less crime. (Because of the Woodmansee case, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin says he intends to file legislation to reduce "good time," especially for those who commit heinous crimes.) In conclusion, if Ferruccio had limited himself to a New England comparison, he would have had a point. But he didn’t. He said Rhode Island has the most liberal "good time" law in the nation. That wasn’t true in 2008. And it’s not true now. We rule his statement False.	None	Richard Ferruccio	None	None	None	2011-03-21T00:00:01	2011-03-08	['United_States']
pomt-13571	"Almost half a million people are still eligible (for DACA), particularly in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-almost-half-million-people-still-elig/	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has presented herself as an advocate for immigrants, saying she’ll push for immigration reform within her first 100 days in the Oval Office and promising to continue the deferred deportation plans of President Barack Obama. On Aug. 15 — four years to the day since immigration officials began accepting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals applications — she published a post on Medium directed to those who have applied for the deportation relief program and to those who haven’t. "In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential  —  that’s what makes our country great, and that’s the promise I’m going to fight to fulfill," Clinton wrote. She said a sizable amount of immigrants could still apply for the program. "Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community," Clinton wrote. We wondered if Clinton was right about the estimated number of eligible applicants, and whether the Asian and Pacific Islander communities represented an outsized proportion. Clinton’s campaign directed us to an August report published by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute analyzing DACA application rates. The study found that application rates were "generally very low" for immigrants born in Asia. DACA background The Homeland Security Department, which oversees immigration enforcement, announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in June 2012. It was designed to defer deportation for undocumented immigrants 30 years old or younger and who arrived in the United States before they were 16 years old. Applicants have to meet several criteria to be considered, including having continuously lived in the United States since June 15, 2007, and be in school, have graduated or obtained a GED certificate, or be an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or U.S. armed forces. Applicants also cannot have felony convictions, a significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors, nor can they be be a threat to national security or public safety. Advocates argue that those who were brought to the country by their parents as children should be given opportunities to stay in the country since they likely weren’t the ones making decisions to migrate or to stay in the country illegally. DACA does not grant lawful status, but people who receive DACA are not considered to be "unlawfully present" during their time of deferred action. DACA defers deportation for two-year periods, it can be renewed and beneficiaries can also apply for work permits. This summer, the Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4-4 decision on an extended version of DACA and on a deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, which allowed an appellate court’s injunction to stand. That decision does not affect the original DACA. DACA eligible population Back to Clinton’s point: We wondered how many unauthorized immigrants are eligible and how many have applied. When it comes to the undocumented population, what’s usually available are just estimates. The Migration Policy Institute report is based on a formula using federal immigration data and Census Bureau survey data. The report offers two sets of eligible applicants: 1.3 million and 1.7 million. The institute found that about 1.3 million unauthorized immigrants were immediately eligible for DACA in 2016  — they met all criteria, including high school completion or school enrollment. About 400,000 more met DACA criteria except high school completion or school enrollment requirement in 2014. The additional 400,000 may have become eligible for DACA by enrolling in an adult education program — bringing the total eligible population in 2016 to about 1.7 million, the institute said. As of March 31, 2016, immigration officials had accepted about 820,000 (meaning they can begin going through the deferred-action process). Of the nearly 820,000 accepted, officials approved 728,285. So of the 1.3 million immediately eligible population, about 480,000 can still apply. By assuming up to 1.7 million are eligible, then there could be up to 880,000 who can still apply for DACA. Clinton is right that immigrants from the Asian and Pacific Islander population comprise a large chunk of people who can still apply. South Korea ranked fourth among the top five countries of birth for the immediately eligible DACA population in 2016 (after Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador), according to the institute. Honduras was fifth. But only 7,000 of the estimated 49,000 eligible South Koreans have applied. And less than 30 percent of about 33,000 eligible immigrants from India and the Philippines have applied. Multiple immigration scholars and experts we reached out to cited MPI’s research as a credible base for DACA estimates. There are more than 130,000 undocumented immigrants of Asian descent eligible for DACA, according to estimates cited by the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group also noted back in 2014 that DACA enrollment from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders was "disproportionately low." Mexican-born immigrants represented 63 percent of the immediately eligible DACA population and 78 percent of them have applied, according to MPI. New America Media, a national collaboration of 3,000 ethnic news organizations, reported earlier this month that applications from Asians and Pacific Islanders may be at lower rates because those communities may not know they can apply. Some of the reasons they have not applied may include fear of immigration agencies, cultural stigma in speaking about immigration status, shortage of community resources about DACA in languages spoken by Asians and Pacific Islanders, and few portrayals of deportation relief as an issue for their communities, said Sheridan Lagunas, a spokesperson for United We Dream, a youth-led immigrant rights national group. Our ruling In a Medium post, Clinton said, "experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible (for DACA), particularly in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community." Researchers have estimated the number of eligible DACA recipients might be around 1.3 million to 1.7 million people, with immigration officials having accepted about 820,000 applications. Based on varying estimates, that leaves about 500,000 to nearly 900,000 people who can still apply. Immigration advocates and scholars have said Asian American and Pacific Islander application rates are lower compared to other populations, likely due to lack of information. We rate Clinton’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3a0188dc-1fd5-4886-9ab0-3646af62b99d	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-22T18:41:47	2016-08-15	['None']
pomt-01733	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau "passed a rule giving the agency unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes."	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/05/katie-pavlich/townhall-editor-claims-us-agency-empowered-itself-/	Don’t feel too bad if you’ve never heard of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It’s the new kid in Washington, as far as government agencies go, created by the passage of the 2010 massive financial regulation overhaul known as Dodd-Frank. The bureau, which opened in 2011, has rulemaking powers, supervises certain financial institutions and checks out complaints from consumers about lending practices that may violate the law. An editor of the conservative news website Townhall claimed it has more nefarious aims. A reader asked us to look into the thrust of a June 19 story by news editor Katie Pavlich, also a Fox News contributor and conservative author, who said the agency granted itself authority to shut down businesses for basically any reason. "Last week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, through the power of Dodd-Frank, passed a rule giving the agency unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes through a cease-and-desist order," Pavlich wrote. That seemed like a lot of unilateral power, so we wanted to look into her claim. Federal rulemaking fun We tried to reach Pavlich through email and Twitter, but she did not respond. Her article links to a post on CFPB Monitor, a blog maintained by the Ballard Spahr law firm, about the agency adopting a final rule on temporary cease-and-desist orders. Just one problem: The cease-and-desist order isn’t what Pavlich thinks it is. One of Ballard Spahr’s attorneys told us the rule Pavlich referenced is not meant to gut businesses’ rights and is typical of other federal and state financial regulators. "It’s not like a blank check to put somebody out of business," said Christopher Willis, a Ballard Spahr partner and consumer finance attorney who represents financial institutions that would be subject to the rule. "It’s supposed to be tied to stopping someone from violating the law." Here’s how Willis explained it to us: When the agency thinks a business has broken the law, the agency can file a lawsuit, pursue administrative proceedings or do a cease-and-desist order. But a cease-and-desist order is to cease-and-desist violating the law -- not to stop existing. Moreover, the agency didn’t give itself the power to issue cease-and-desist orders, Congress did. Section 1053(c) of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act allows the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct cease-and-desist proceedings. So, in September 2013, the agency developed an interim rule that spells out how to do what Congress wanted. Essentially, the rule says the agency’s director may issue a temporary cease-and-desist order when he or she finds a company’s alleged unlawful action will render it unable to pay debts or "otherwise prejudice the interests of consumers." An earlier CFPB Monitor post equated this kind of order with a temporary restraining order in a judicial proceeding. The order is enforceable once served. The agency published its final rule June 18, effective July 18. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received just one public comment about the regulation, which appears to have been intended for the Food and Drug Administration. Power with precedent So we know the agency didn’t just assign itself this power. But there are more issues to address with Pavlich’s claim that the rule gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau "unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes." Is the cease-and-desist authority unprecedented? Not really. Other banking agencies have had this power for a long time, Willis said. Agency spokesman Samuel Gilford sent us an alphabet soup of federal financial regulators with similar power, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, OCC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, as well as many state banking regulators (see examples in Texas, Connecticut, North Carolina). Can the agency shut down businesses for any reason? The agency is tasked with overseeing a large amount of businesses -- mainly payday lenders, non-bank mortgage lenders, banks and credit unions with assets over $10 billion, and private student loan lenders. Still, we’re not talking about mom and pop’s pizza shop. The agency can only go after the businesses it’s tasked with overseeing. Gilford said the agency has not yet issued a cease-and-desist order. But when it does, it can’t just do it for any reason. "Any temporary cease-and-desist order issued by the CFPB must describe the basis for the order, the alleged violations of the law, and the harm that is likely to result without the issuance of an order," Gilford said. That said, the agency is powerful and operates with more autonomy than other agencies, Willis said. Its budget is not controlled by Congress, and its director is insulated from the political process after the president appoints him or her. "So there’s a lot of criticism against the agency for lack of democratic accountability," Willis said. "But it has nothing to do with cease-and-desist programs." Our ruling Pavlich recently wrote for Townhall, "the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, through the power of Dodd-Frank, passed a rule giving the agency unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes through a cease-and-desist order." She is mistaken, an attorney who represents the financial services industry told us. Pavlich ignores several key facts about the agency’s temporary cease-and-desist authority. Namely, it’s not unprecedented, it’s not issued without reason, and it’s meant to stop violations of law, not the business altogether. We rate her claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03584	"The State of Wisconsin thinks you should have to" wash your hands "at least 28 times to make one peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/16/jeff-wagner/talk-show-host-jeff-wagner-says-state-requires-28-/	Conservative talk show host Jeff Wagner teased a few topics at the top of his show on May 8, 2013, then he posed a question and made a claim. "How many times do you wash your hands while making the same peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich? Maybe once, right? Maybe?" he asked on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee. "Well, the State of Wisconsin thinks you should have to do it at least 28 times to make one peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich." We happened to be driving to a lunch appointment (for Ethiopian food, not PB&Js) when we heard Wagner’s claim, so it caught our attention. Wagner’s evidence The former federal prosecutor replied promptly to our request for evidence to back his statement. He even went to the trouble of posting on his blog both the request and his response (which included the requisite dig at PolitiFact). The evidence consisted of two things: -- A four-paragraph Associated Press news article, headlined "Outagamie County sues over food code inspections," that was posted on JSOnline.com the day before Wagner made his claim. -- A copy of a federal court lawsuit Outagamie County filed against the state over state inspections of the county-owned nursing home. Wagner also noted in his email that he discussed the lawsuit later in his show. (By the way, both the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which produces PolitiFact Wisconsin, and WTMJ are owned by Journal Communications.) That means listeners who only heard Wagner’s tease might have thought the state was poking its nose into their kitchen. But he made it clear half an hour later that his claim had to do with the nursing home lawsuit. The lawsuit Outagamie County sued the state Department of Health Services in March 2013, objecting to code violations cited in 2011 and 2012 at Brewster Village, a county-owned nursing home. State inspectors enforce both state and federal regulations governing nursing homes. And some of the violations cited at Brewster Village involve federal codes for food preparation. After the state issued its violation notices in 2011, according to the lawsuit, workers at the nursing home conducted "time studies." They wanted to see -- based on how they said the state interpreted federal food regulations -- how long it would take "to provide for the number of hand washes, glove changes and other steps." The county concluded that in order to comply, nursing home staff would need to wash their hands 28 times to safely make peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches -- rather than the nine times they normally do. Of course, in the context of a lawsuit, it’s in the county’s interest to claim the state-required number is as high as possible. Whether it’s nine times or 28 times, the impression for most will be the same: Really? Wash, wash, wash It’s important to remember we’re not talking about a person at home making a PB&J for their lunch, but multiple workers making sandwiches for medically fragile people in a 204-bed nursing home. Still, it seems like a whole lot of washing going on. State inspectors cited a number of instances at Brewster Village they said violated the federal food code. For example: workers adjusting knobs on a device that was soiled with a brown substance; pouring hot water into a pitcher without first washing hands; touching a drawer handle soiled with grease to remove a clean utensil from the drawer; and donning a pair of gloves and opening a drawer to get a clean utensil and, without hand washing, cutting open two bags of gravy mix. What does the state say about all this? State inspectors didn’t declare in their reports that nursing home staff needed to wash hands a particular number of times during food preparation. And the Department of Health Services wouldn’t comment to us on Outagamie County’s claim that, according to the state’s interpretation of federal rules, 28 hand washes are necessary during sandwich making. It seems likely, though, based on the violation notices the state issued, that the state believes the hand washing should have occurred more than nine times. Our rating Wagner said "the State of Wisconsin thinks you should have to" wash your hands "at least 28 times to make one peanut butter and jelly sandwich." Wagner later made it clear he was referring to food preparation in a county-owned nursing home. But although the state indicated it wanted nursing home staff to wash their hands more than nine times, it didn’t specify a number. Wagner’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.	None	Jeff Wagner	None	None	None	2013-05-16T07:00:00	2013-05-08	['Wisconsin']

And I’ll tell you this, there’s been more than a 200 percent increase in apprehension(s) of heroin coming across the border. This is real dangerous stuff that we must get control of before we further lose control of our border." We were curious about those stats, so we asked the governor’s campaign for backup. We didn’t hear back. Next, we turned to government-posted border and heroin apprehension figures, focusing first on apprehensions of people. Counting border apprehensions Apprehension counts--often cited as an indication of illegal border crossings--are regularly posted by Customs and Border Protection, the part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security primarily responsible for regulating the movement of people and goods across U.S. borders. Generally, the number of people detained in the Border Patrol’s Southwest region, which runs from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego, Calif., has mostly decreased since 2005, according to a CBP document we checked that provides such details for every year since 2000: SOURCE: Web page, "Total Monthly Apps by Sector and Area, FY2000-FY2017," Customs and Border Protection, undated (accessed April 10, 2018) But Abbott’s claim to KTSA was limited to comparing the number of individuals apprehended near the border in March 2018 with the tally of individuals detained the same month the year before. We confirmed a more than 200 percent difference in apprehensions for the chosen months. That’s partly because the 2017 count was historically low. In March 2018, a CBP chart indicates, Border Patrol agents apprehended 37,393 individuals near the border. That was up 207 percent from the agency’s March 2017 apprehension of 12,195 individuals along the border. But the chart shows, too, that that the March 2017 count was down 64 percent from March 2016--and the lowest for any March from 2000 on: SOURCES: Web pages, Customs and Border Protection, "Total Monthly Apps by Sector and Area, FY2000-FY2017," undated; "Southwest Border Migration FY2018," last published April 4, 2018; "CBP Enforcement Statistics FY2018, undated (accessed April 10 and 19, 2018) We sought an independent fix on recent changes in apprehensions by comparing the CBP figures covering the first half of fiscal 2018, through March of this year, with the same stretch of fiscal 2017. According to those figures, there were 173,599 apprehensions along the southern border in the first half of fiscal 2018--down some 13 percent, we calculated, from the 199,171 border region apprehensions in the first half of fiscal 2017. We also asked Carlos A. Diaz, chief of CPB’s Southwest Branch, to address the count of March 2018 apprehensions singled out by Abbott compared with border apprehensions the same month of the year before. By email, Diaz replied: "The increase and decrease in entries during any given period is determined by ‘push/pull’ factors," which, he said, can seem bigger if you compare shorter time periods. "These factors," Diaz wrote, "vary by country of origin (push) and by perceived policy changes in the U.S. (pull). In 2017, there was the perception by individuals wishing to enter illegally into the U.S. that there would be immediate policy changes to how the U.S. handled illegal immigration. This perception was due in large part to the newly elected President Trump’s proclamation on enforcing immigration laws." Diaz, asked if CBP believes there’s been a fresh surge in people illegally trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico, reminded us of the big percentage differences between apprehensions in March 2017 and March 2018. In his April 2018 reply, he further said: "The current entry numbers are following statistical norms when compared to years 2014, 2015 and 2016." Heroin seizures Next, we sought information speaking to Abbott’s heroin statistic. Mexico remains the primary smuggling route for increased heroin reaching the U.S. and, the Drug Enforcement Administration says, opium poppy cultivation in Mexico has increased in recent years, according to the agency’s 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment. That report says federal seizure data also indicate a shift of heroin transportation through the U.S.-Mexico border and away from commercial air routes, "the method most commonly used by traffickers of South American and Asian heroin." In 2008, the report states, 47 percent of CBP heroin seizures were made from air conveyances and 49 percent were made on land. In 2016, the report says, 14 percent were made in the air and 82 percent on land. "This increase is primarily due to the more prominent role Mexican traffickers have taken in the United States heroin market, and also partially due to increased law enforcement presence on the Southwest Border," the report says. Our look for figures specific to Abbott’s claim led us to a couple of CBP charts--one showing the Border Patrol lately on pace to capture fewer pounds of heroin than before and the other indicating a national spurt in heroin seizures by the agency. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, through March 2018, the Border Patrol reported seizing 263 pounds of heroin near the southern border--which, we gauged, breaks out to 28 percent of the 953 pounds of heroin seized along the border by Border Patrol agents through the entire previous fiscal year, from October 2016 through September 2017. The second chart states that CBP’s Office of Field Operations reported seizures of 2,479 pounds of heroin in the first half of fiscal 2018--which breaks out to nearly 70 percent of the 3,626 pounds of heroin seized by that office through all of fiscal 2017, possibly an indication that far more heroin will ultimately be seized through the full year. A note: We saw no indication on the chart of where the office’s seizures took place--on the border or elsewhere. SOURCE: Web page, "CBP Enforcement Statistics FY2018," Customs and Border Patrol, undated (charts fetched April 19, 2018) To our inquiry, Melvin Patterson, a DEA official, emailed a breakdown showing annual heroin seizures in the border region by law agencies, though the information wasn’t up to date. According to the breakdown, the 2,443 kilograms in heroin seizures along the border in the fiscal year running through September 2016 ran short of the 2,855 kilograms seized there the previous fiscal year; it also ran behind the 2,559 kilograms seized in fiscal 2014. Patterson said the government had yet to post relevant data for October 2017 and beyond. It could be that Abbott reached his seizures’ percentage based on information from the Texas Department of Public Safety. We queried DPS, but the agency didn’t respond. Our ruling Abbott said that as of March 2018 compared with 2017, "there’s been a more than 200 percent increase in the number of people who are apprehended coming across the border. And, I’ll tell you this, there’s been a more than 200 percent increase in apprehension(s) of heroin coming across the border." This claim has an element of truth in the 200-plus percent escalation in apprehensions when you compare the chosen months, though it’s worth noting that the percentage starts from border apprehensions in March 2017 setting an 18-year-low. Meantime, we found, border apprehensions in the first half of fiscal 2018 trailed apprehensions in the comparable stretch of 2017. We didn't find evidence that border heroin seizures have lately increased more than 200 percent. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11490	Says Sen. Bill Nelson "hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control."	/florida/statements/2018/feb/28/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-bill-nelson-has-done-nothing-gun-c/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson criticized Gov. Rick Scott for not appearing at the CNN town hall following the Parkland shooting. "There is no representative of the state of Florida," Nelson said during the Feb. 21 town hall in which Marjory Stoneman Douglas students spoke. "Our governor did not come here." Days later at a press conference where Scott announced a proposal for $450 million in school security funding, a reporter asked Scott to respond to Nelson’s criticism. Scott, a Republican, is widely expected to challenge Nelson, a Democrat, in the 2018 elections. "Bill Nelson is a career politician," said Scott. "He talks a lot. He does nothing. Think about it: He has been in office for almost 50 years. He hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control." That’s a sweepingly broad attack by Scott to claim that Nelson hasn’t done "anything" on gun or school safety and mischaracterizes Nelson’s record. We found multiple examples of legislation Nelson supported that related to gun control. Before Nelson was in the Senate Nelson has supported a ban on assault rifles for decades. In 1990 when running for governor, he promised, "As governor, I will propose a ban on the sale of assault rifles in Florida, as well as a seven-day waiting period on the sale of firearms." At campaign stops in 1990, Nelson waved a weapon over his head and said that a campaign aide was able to buy a semi-automatic rifle in less than 10 minutes at a Miami gun store. While in Congress in 1990, Nelson cosponsored the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to make it unlawful for any licensed dealer to sell a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless certain criteria were met. The legislation ultimately passed in 1993 after Nelson left the House. Nelson’s legislative record in the U.S. Senate Nelson spokesman Ryan Brown sent PolitiFact a list of more than one dozen bills that Nelson had supported related to gun safety, gun control or school safety. Many were bills he either cosponsored or sponsored or voted in favor of, but many did not become law. Here’s a look at some of the key bills by topic: Assault weapons ban: Nelson has repeatedly supported an assault weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire in 2004. This year, Nelson became one of about two dozen cosponsors of a bill to ban semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The bill has not reached any votes. Bump stocks: Nelson was one of many cosponsors of a 2017 bill to ban bump stocks, an accessory that allows someone to convert a semi-automatic firearm to a nearly fully automatic one. Improving background checks: Nelson sponsored a bill that would require the Justice Department to include in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System information about an individual who is or has been under a federal terrorism investigation. The bill, which Nelson introduced in 2017 after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, has not reached any votes. He supported other efforts to strengthen background checks in the past. Denying firearms to terrorists: The "no fly no buy" bill would deny the transfer of a firearm if the transferee is known (or appropriately suspected) to be engaged in terrorism. Nelson was one of a few dozen cosponsors. The 2015 bill has not received a vote. Ban certain types of firearms: Nelson sponsored a bill in 2017 to ban firearms that are not detectable by metal detectors if certain components are removed. The bill has not received a vote. He also voted to ban guns with high-capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds, which failed to pass the Senate in 2013. He also voted for an amendment to require trigger locks and safety devices for handguns in 2004 and to strengthen penalties for the use of so-called cop-killer bullets in 2005 -- both were amendments that passed the Senate. Conceal-carry reciprocity: Nelson voted against legislation that would allow concealed-carry permits issued in one state to be valid in all others that issue such permits in 2009 and 2013. Mental health: Nelson voted for the 21st Century Cures Act, which became law in 2016. The bill stated that the attorney general may provide active-shooter response training to local law enforcement and called for the development of crisis intervention teams to include specialized training for school officials in responding to mental health crises. Nelson was one of about two dozen bipartisan cosponsors of the Excellence in Mental Health Act S. 264, which proposed grants to states to build or modernize community-based mental health services. After the Parkland shooting, Nelson, along with Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, wrote a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urging her department to quickly approve applications from the Broward school district for a Project School Emergency Response to Violence grant. The money could be used for mental health services, overtime for law enforcement and school staff, and costs to operate the school at an alternative site. Nelson took some pro-gun votes Nelson has taken some pro-gun votes during his Senate tenure. In 2005, Nelson voted in favor of prohibiting civil lawsuits from being brought against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm. He voted to permit Amtrak passengers to transport guns in checked baggage and to allow individuals to possess firearms in the national parks in 2009. Nelson spokesman Brown said that Nelson is not anti-gun. "He’s a hunter, he’s owned guns his entire life," Brown said. "He’s never said he wants to ban all guns. He wants to expand background checks and ban semiautomatic assault rifles, like the AR-15." Response from experts and Scott’s office We sent a list of several of the laws that Nelson supported to Harry Wilson, Roanoke College professor and author of the book Guns, Gun Control, and Elections. We asked Wilson to weigh in about Nelson’s record on guns. "What kind of alternate universe is this?" he said. "The Republican argues that the Democrat is too soft on gun control. Beam me up, Scotty." "If one votes for the assault weapons ban and enhanced background checks and against reciprocity, one has clearly voted in favor of stricter gun laws (ask any gun rights group!)," he said. But Scott does have a point if he wants to argue that some of these bills didn’t pass, so nothing was "done." As for Nelson’s pro-gun votes, Wilson said that the Amtrak and national parks votes that were signed by President Barack Obama were not major issues, while the 2005 vote for immunity for gun manufacturers was an important vote that clearly favored gun rights. "I would call this a mixed record, but the charge is misleading, at best," he said. Everytown for Gun Safety spokesman Andrew Zucker praised Nelson for fighting "for criminal background checks on every gun sale, opposed arming teachers, and (he) has been an ally in the fight for gun safety for years." As of 2012 when Nelson was up for re-election, the NRA had given him an F grade. We sent Scott spokesman McKinley Lewis links to several bills that Nelson supported and asked if he had evidence to support the claim that Nelson "hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, done nothing on gun control." "Bill Nelson could not point to any meaningful legislation brought forth and sponsored by him to make it across the finish line," Lewis said. "He’s had nearly 50 years in office, and what has happened? Has he rolled out any bills or legislative packages in the wake of the Parkland shooting?" Our ruling Scott said Nelson "hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control." At least since 1990, Nelson has supported an assault weapons ban. He has also supported several gun control measures including bills to tighten background checks, keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, ban bump stocks as well as firearms that can pass through metal detectors. While many of the bills Nelson supported didn’t become law, it’s an exaggeration to state that he has done "nothing." We rate this claim False.

pomt-04235	"Wisconsin is the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children – regardless of whether that child is seven or 20 years old – at bars and restaurants."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/21/health-first-wisconsin/health-first-wisconsin-says-wisconsin-stands-alone/	Wisconsin’s ranking as the nation’s top binge-drinking state was confirmed in a 2012 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But is the state the most permissive in America on allowing minors to imbibe in a public establishment? That’s the gist of a claim by Health First Wisconsin, a group that lobbies to prevent alcohol abuse and curb tobacco use. On Nov. 12, 2012 the organization, (formerly known as Smoke Free Wisconsin) decried what it called Wisconsin’s "extreme alcohol culture" after a question on Reddit, the social news website, led to online debate over "extreme legal loopholes." One of the "loopholes" cited prominently was a Wisconsin liquor law that creates an exception to the 21 drinking age. "Wisconsin needs to send a strong message that 21 means 21," Maureen Busalacchi, executive director of Health First Wisconsin, said in a news release. "Wisconsin is the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children – regardless of whether that child is seven or 20 years old – at bars and restaurants." Health First wants to eliminate the exception, saying the law fuels an unsafe drinking culture and that research shows impaired brain development associated with early-age drinking. Does Wisconsin really stand alone by allowing children of any age to drink in taverns and eateries under such supervision? The evidence Asked for backup, the group pointed us to state and national research on state-by-state alcohol-control laws, which we reviewed along with other materials in order to compare states, starting with Wisconsin. Wisconsin law does say that persons under 21 can be sold alcohol and drink it if they are with their parents, guardians or spouses of legal drinking age, the state Department of Revenue website says. State law allows that at bars as well as restaurants with liquor licenses. And as Health First says, the Wisconsin law sets no age restriction. But it’s important to note that establishments can decline, on their own, to serve parent-accompanied minors. The Wisconsin Tavern League doesn’t tell its members how to handle it, but many are not comfortable serving the underaged, executive director Pete Madland said. Others do so. Madland said it’s an option for people who want to teach their children how to drink responsibly, a practice he noted is common in European countries with lower legal drinking ages. How does Wisconsin compare? We did not check on all 50 states because the available national research doesn’t get to the level of state-by-state detail required to fully check this. But we didn’t need to check all 50 to assess the group’s Wisconsin-stands-alone claim. We found that many states allow parent-supervised underage drinking at home by their children. And a few allow underaged drinking by 18-20 year olds at bars if they are accompanied by parents or guardians. What’s at issue here is narrower: how many states allow underage imbibing at bars (and restaurants) at any age. Based on our reporting, Wisconsin is not alone, though it appears to be a very short list. Laws in Texas, Ohio and Montana closely mirror the law in Wisconsin. Texas: In many places in the Lone Star State, persons of any age can consume or possess alcohol in bars and restaurants when in the "visible presence" of their adult parent, legal guardian or spouse, according to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Unlike in Wisconsin, those accompanied drinkers can’t actually buy booze themselves. But their adult parent, guardian or spouse can buy it for them. "It does happen," commission spokeswoman Carolyn Beck said of parent-supervised drinking in public places. They hear occasional complaints, especially in divorce situations in which someone objects to a former spouse getting alcohol for their child. Texas has some "dry" counties and cities that prohibit some or all alcohol sales, but there’s still a way for underage drinkers to tip one legally, Beck said. At private clubs in dry areas, adult members can get served and in turn can provide booze to their children, under the same law that applies at bars. Ohio: Sales to underage drinkers are allowed if they are supervised by a parent, a spouse who is not an underage person, or a legal guardian. Tavern owners can allow underage drinking on premises if one of those persons gives the liquor or beer to the underage person and is present when they drink it, according to the Ohio Division of Liquor Control and state statutes. Bartenders can refuse to serve these drinkers if they want to. As in Wisconsin, no minimum age is specified. Montana: An exception to Montana’s underage drinking law allows a person under 21 to receive a "non-intoxicating quantity" (less than 0.5 percent of alcohol by volume) from that person’s parent or guardian. It doesn’t rule out that happening in licensed drinking establishments. But it’s a legal gray area because another law contradicts that and the exception is not clearly written. No minimum age is specified. The state’s Liquor Control Division suggests that minors not be served; the office is trying to change the law to rule out such sales on licensed premises. So that’s the quick tour. We asked Julia Sherman, coordinator for the Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project at the University of Wisconsin Law School, to describe Wisconsin’s relative position among the states on this. She said Wisconsin’s statute is "out of the mainstream" in allowing drinking under such circumstances. "Ours is clearly extremely broad," Sherman said. But it doesn’t stand alone. Our rating A health advocacy group pushing to tighten up drinking laws said Wisconsin is "the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children – regardless of whether that child is seven or 20 years old – at bars and restaurants." We found less than a handful of states that allow that, but a few others do. So Wisconsin’s law is not unique. We rate the group’s statement False.

pomt-07367	Says one of Austin City Council Member Randi Shade’s biggest contributors is the lobbyist for the Formula 1 racetrack planned outside Austin.	/texas/statements/2011/may/06/kathie-tovo/kathie-tovo-says-one-randi-shades-biggest-donors-l/	Kathie Tovo, among challengers to Place 3 Austin City Council Member Randi Shade, says in at least two recent mailers sent to voters that despite a city budget crisis, the council might give $4 million a year for 10 years to subsidize a racetrack. That’s referring to possible council action designating a portion of estimated city sales and use tax revenues to cover costs related to future Formula One races on the track planned southeast of Austin. Here, we’re not delving into whether such spending would be a subsidy. We’re wondering about what Tovo adds in her mailers: "And one of (Shade’s) biggest contributors is the racetrack lobbyist." Tovo’s campaign manager, Mark Yznaga, told us in a telephone interview the lobbyist is Richard Suttle, a partner in the influential Austin law firm, Armbrust & Brown. Yznaga conceded that Suttle has personally given Shade’s campaign only $25, the maximum any lobbyist working City Hall can give per election. But, he said, lawyers and spouses connected to the Armbrust & Brown firm accounted for 51 firm-connected contributions, 45 for $350, six for $25, for a total $15,900 from late December through April 4, the end of the latest reporting period. Nudged about Suttle’s tiny donation, Yznaga replied: "You’re being silly. It’s quite well known in the city that (Suttle) is the lobbyist who does a lot of Armbrust & Brown work." Yznaga noted that 16 members of the firm, which lists 21 lawyers on its website, contributed the maximum allowed, $350. And he pointed out that David Armbrust, among the firm’s founders, is listed on Shade’s finance filings as a bundler, which the city defines as anyone who has solicited and obtained contributions for the candidate adding up to more than $5,000 during a finance reporting period. Armbrust, like Suttle a city-registered lobbyist, gave $25. Suttle is a familiar figure at City Hall, where he frequently represents real estate developers. He has reported 55 clients to the city, including Circuit of the Americas, which is building the racetrack. Next, we reached Suttle, who called the characterization of him as one of Shade’s biggest contributors "a stretch. It’s old-school campaign lies." The city ordinance limiting individuals who lobby the city to $25 donations means he couldn’t be a top donor. "I have to chuckle," he said, adding that he told his wife, who also donated $25 to Shade’s campaign: "I guess 50 bucks gets us on the big contributors list now." In a telephone interview, Shade’s campaign manager, Katherine Haenschen, pointed out that the money donated by the Suttles accounted for a minuscule share of more than $168,000 Shade raised from November through April 4. She said by email: "By my calculations, our average donation is $208. Suttle's $25 is about 1/8 of that. Furthermore, the last time I checked, there are only 10 individuals who have donated LESS than Richard Suttle!" That may be true. But donors connected to Armbrust & Brown accounted for 9 percent of Shade’s contributions through April 4. Shade’s finance reports show 9 bundlers other than Armbrust accounting for 15 percent of her campaign contributions through April 4. The next-most-successful single bundler raised about $6,300, less than half Armbrust’s haul for Shade. Armbrust’s bundling is surely appreciated by the incumbent and signals the firm’s lawyers, including Suttle, want her to win a second term. But Tovo overshoots when she spears the racetrack lobbyist. Other members of his law firm are responsible for sending far more money Shade’s way. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Kathie Tovo	None	None	None	2011-05-06T06:00:00	2011-05-02	['Austin,_Texas']
pomt-05985	"Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican."	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/23/charlotte-bergmann/another-republican-claims-martin-luther-king-jr-wa/	Anyone driving the Interstate 240 beltway around Memphis will now see the new billboard at Getwell Road that proclaims "Martin Luther King Jr. Was A Republican. So Is Charlotte Bergmann. Charlotte Bergmann for Congress." Bergmann is a Republican candidate in the Democrat-rich 9th Congressional District now represented by Steve Cohen. She got a quarter of the vote in 2010 in the general election and, by all accounts, is doing more campaigning this year than two years ago. We’re going to take her at her word that she is a Republican. But Martin Luther King Jr., who marched with Memphis sanitation workers, who was planning a Poor People’s March on Washington at the time of his death, who advocated a guaranteed annual income to end poverty -- a Republican? We decided to put that assertion to the test. We knew, because he said so, that King never endorsed politicians and "took this position in order to maintain a bipartisan posture, which I have followed all along in order to be able to look objectively at both parties at all times." We also know from his autobiography that he wrote to a supporter in 1956 that "in the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket." We know that his father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., a longtime Republican when most Southern Democrats were segregationists, endorsed John F. Kennedy publicly in the 1960 presidential race over Republican Richard M. Nixon. Asked for her sources for the claim, Bergmann directed us to her website, which displays a 20-page newsletter of the National Black Republican Association that charts Republican Party efforts to advance Civil Rights from 1854 through the Eisenhower Administration and the 1957 Civil Rights Act and documents the segregated positions of prominent Democrats in the Jim Crow South. It concludes by saying, if King were alive today, he’d be a Republican. She also pointed to a statement made by King’s niece, Alveda C. King, a founder of the group King for America: "My uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during his lifetime, was a Republican." Bergmann also said King "subscribed to Republican values" and that most black voters before 1960 associated themselves with the Grand Old Party -- the Party of Lincoln -- that passed the 13th and 14th amendments to the Constitution ending slavery and guaranteeing equal rights in the 19th century. However, in a 2008 Associated Press story, King’s son and namesake Martin Luther King III said:"It is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states." Dr. Kenneth W. Goings, professor and past chairman of the Department of African American and African Studies at Ohio State University, said in an email message that King may have had to register as a Republican to vote in Alabama in the 1950s. Goings said: "Daddy King was a Republican as were most African Americans in the South until the early 1940s. But the combination of Dem. Party outreach and Republican Southern strategy meant that by the 1950s the South was well on the way to the split that is evident now. I’ve not seen any evidence that MLK Jr. was a Republican but if he registered to vote it would have been as a Republican in Alabama simply because the Dems. would not allow black voters. Throughout the (Civil Rights) movement he worked with the northern Dem. Party...I wonder if somehow people have just confused Sr. and Jr. (maybe even on purpose)." Another academic authority on King was not as generous in his assessment of the motivation for suggesting King was a Republican. Michael K. Honey, a professor at the University of Washington-Tacoma and author of "Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King’s Last Campaign" (2007), said in an email: "Do they now make things up out of whole cloth or do they fabricate based on assumptions with no actual knowledge. In either case, not very good qualifications for office." Honey, who edited a collection of King’s speeches released last year as "All Labor Has Dignity," said the idea that King was a Republican is "laughable...His interest was in getting both parties to do the right thing on issues. The Democrats certainly disappointed him on the (Vietnam) war, and the Republicans had an orthodox conservatism opposed to most of the changes he wanted to see." PolitiFact Texas looked into a similar claim in 2011 and interviewed David J. Garrow, author of the Pulitzer Prize winning King biography "Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference" (1986). He said in told them: "It is simply incorrect to call Dr. King a Republican." Our Ruling: Weighing the niece’s claim against King’s son’s, Honey’s and Garrow’s, and Goings’ speculation that he might have had to register as a Republican even though he always voted the Democratic ticket, it seems to us that the preponderance of the evidence shows that a claim that Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican is simply False.

pomt-08016	Says the person who Florida U.S. Rep. Allen West first hired as chief of staff told people attending a Tea Party rally that, 'We will use bullets if ballots don't work.'	/florida/statements/2011/jan/10/debbie-wasserman-schultz/arizona-shooting-prompts-questions-about-civility-/	The tragic shooting of Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Jan. 8, 2011, at a Tucson constituent event is prompting some elected officials, members of the media and everyday citizens to re-evaluate whether American politics has become too filled with vitriol, anger and hate-filled speech. While the motives of the gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, remain unclear, many have used the shooting to push for restoring civility to the political process. Yet others already have engaged in a game of subtle finger pointing. Some liberals have blamed overheated Tea Party rhetoric for contributing to today's political climate. Conservatives, meanwhile, have noted that some Democrats are no better, and that Loughner was disturbed beyond the bounds of either political party. Others also have singled out the media for covering the extremes of the political debate. Pima County Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik lectured the media at a Jan. 8 news conference, saying that trying "to inflame the public on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, has impact on people, especially who are unbalanced personalities to begin with." On NBC's Meet the Press on Jan. 9, 2011, five members of the U.S. House talked about the shooting, the political climate and the security of members of Congress. The panel included Republican Trent Franks of Arizona, Democrat Raul M. Grijalva of Arizona, Democrat Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, Republican Raul Labrador of Idaho and Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida. The discussion was at times emotional, and Meet the Press moderator David Gregory began to choke up when he talked about one of the shooting victims, a nine-year-old girl who was elected to her student council. Gregory then talked about the demonization of the political opposition -- "whether it's a congressman saying, 'You lie,' from the House floor, whether it's a Democrat who literally shoots the cap and trade bill in a campaign advertisement. Or your former colleague, Alan Grayson from Florida, compared Republicans to the Taliban." "I think we're a country that tries to solve our problems by ballots and not bullets, so a good debate is fine," answered Franks. "But when you try to go into an area of threatening debate and things of that nature, then it's very dangerous." Wasserman Schultz picked up on Franks' "ballots and not bullets" reference when it was her turn to speak. "Just based on what Trent just said and what, what everyone has said, I agree, it's our responsibility to make sure that we set the right example and set the tone of civility," she said. "But the shock-jocks and the political movement leaders that are out there on both sides of the aisle need to ... have some pause as well. "I mean, the phrase that you just used, 'we use ballots, not bullets,' the actual reverse of that phrase was used in my district by someone who was almost the chief of staff to an incoming member of Congress where she said at a rally, at a Tea Party rally, 'We will use bullets if ballots don't work.' " It's a provocative claim made by Wasserman Schultz, and we wondered if it was true. Turns out, we've covered some of this ground. Wasserman Schultz is referring to Joyce Kaufman, an outspoken South Florida conservative radio talk show host on WFTL-850 AM, who garnered national attention after newly elected U.S. Rep. Allen West hired her as his chief of staff a week after the Nov. 2, 2010, election. She resigned from that position days later amid controversy, and after someone sent a threat to her that stated: "I'm planning something big around the government building here in Broward County, maybe a post office, maybe even a school. ..." The threat led to a lockdown of Broward schools Nov. 10 and an FBI investigation. At a political rally on July 3, 2010, Kaufman addressed a Broward County crowd about the need to change the culture in Washington by electing new members to the House and Senate. Her entire speech has been posted on YouTube and is about 10 minutes long. You can watch her speech here. A few of our notes after watching the entire speech: Kaufman suggested that, without a changing of the guard in Washington, people could be banned from street corners and that "there would be kill switches on the Internet." She told the crowd to put the brakes on this "insanity" that's been happening, and to get rid of "these people in Washington who have no integrity." Kaufman said the 2010 election was the most important one in "our lifetime," and that she says "what I mean, and I mean what I say." She then talked about the Founding Fathers and how brilliant they were. "They gave us ballots," she said a little more than 5 minutes into her speech. "That is the first line of defense ... We send home all of these incumbents who have done nothing to represent the people. They don't come to their districts. They don't talk to us. "And then the Founding Fathers were ever so brilliant -- and I don't care how this gets painted by the mainstream media, I don't care if this shows up on YouTube -- because I am convinced that the most important thing the Founding Fathers did to ensure me my First Amendment rights is they gave me a Second Amendment," Kaufman said, referring to the constitutional amendment that speaks of gun rights. "And if ballots don't work, bullets will," Kaufman said, as people in the crowd reacted by clapping. One person is heard saying "Absolutely," and another says "Amen." "I never in my life thought that the day would come where I would tell individual citizens that you are responsible for being the militia that the Founding Fathers designed," she said. "They were very specific. You need to be prepared to fight tyranny, whether it comes from outside, or whether it comes from inside." Months after the comments, Kaufman tried to suggest they were meant as a metaphor, and told PolitiFact Florida that: "My goal certainly wasn't to incite violence. .... I was encouraging people to go out and use their vote." PolitiFact Florida ruled True a claim from Kaufman that President Barack Obama said in a political context during the 2008 campaign that "If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun." The line was a quote from the 1987 movie The Untouchables. (For the record, Kaufman gave her speech at the corner of Oakland Park Boulevard and North Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale, which is near a shopping center in West's District 22, not Wasserman Schultz's District 20. Wasserman Schultz's district is less than 10 blocks away). Calling for less heated political rhetoric in the wake of the shooting of an Arizona congresswoman, Wasserman Schultz noted on NBC's Meet the Press that the person hired to be chief of staff for an elected Florida congressman told people at a rally that if ballots can't enact political change, "bullets will." Wasserman Schultz is quoting Kaufman accurately. (Kaufman said, "If ballots don't work, bullets will.") Maybe we could all do better by leaving the war and gun language out of political discussions. As NBC News' Chuck Todd put it, "To political professionals, the use of these images has no impact; the problem is when these images are digested by those who are already a bit unstable. No one is calling for censorship, only responsibility." We rate this statement True.

pomt-01493	Greg Abbott "has campaigned with a sexual predator who has bragged about having sex with underage girls."	/texas/statements/2014/sep/25/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-overstates-whats-confirmed-about-abbot/	CLARIFICATION, 4 p.m. Sept. 26, 2014: We revised the conclusion of this fact check to clarify our reasoning. The rating did not change. Democrat Wendy Davis revived a link between Republican Greg Abbott and guitar rock and roller Ted Nugent in the Sept. 19, 2014, debate between the gubernatorial nominees. The Fort Worth state senator initially mentioned her 2013 filibuster against legislation tightening restrictions on abortion in the state. "My opponent, on the other hand, has paid women less than he has paid men," Davis said, likely referring to a March 18, 2014, news story in the San Antonio Express-News exploring that topic. And, Davis said, "he has campaigned with a sexual predator who has bragged about having sex with underage girls." By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas said Davis was referring to Abbott stumping in Denton in early 2014 with rock guitarist Ted Nugent, the so-called Motor City Madman whose 1970s hits included "Cat Scratch Fever." Petkanas emailed: "An adult man who has sex with underage girls is by definition a sexual predator." We identified a legal definition using "predator." By email, Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, guided us to a Texas definition connected to civil commitments of individuals repeatedly convicted of sexual offenses who haven’t proved amenable to traditional mental illness treatment. A person is a "sexually violent predator," this law says, if the person is a "repeat sexually violent offender" and "suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence." Nugent has no criminal convictions, according to a background check we conducted on LexisNexis. Nugent (who has his own Truth-O-Meter report card) appeared with Abbott on Feb. 18, 2014. At that time, Davis said Abbott had appeared with "an admitted sexual predator." Karin Johanson, then her campaign manager, went on to say Nugent "has boasted of having sexual relations with underage women." That day, Abbott praised Nugent’s zealous defense of gun rights and claimed ignorance of the performer’s inflammatory remarks on immigration and women. Nugent had suggested immigrants who are not in the country legally should be treated like "indentured servants" until they earn citizenship; he’d also referred to feminists as "fat pigs" and used lewd language about women in song lyrics and interviews. Nugent later apologized for referring to the Democratic president, Barack Obama, as a "subhuman mongrel." Appearing on WBAP Radio in Dallas, Nugent said, "I apologize for using the street fight terminology of subhuman mongrel." He said he should have called Obama "violator of his Constitution, the liar that he is," a reference to the 2012 health law known as Obamacare. Abbott then said Nugent’s comment was "not the kind of language I would use or endorse in any way." Nugent has been married to his current wife, Shemane, since 1989, she says on her blog. Has he also boasted of relations with underage girls? Petkanas pointed us to a Nugent profile on the VH1 cable channel as the basis of what Davis said. The episode of "Behind the Music," which debuted in April 1998, presents Nugent, in his words and comments from others, as a tee-totaling, drug-free, gun-loving performer who had had many sexual partners. We spotted a remastered version on VH1’s website, dated Jan. 30, 2012. "I didn’t get into rock and roll to pick up women," Nugent says in the program. "But I adapted." The episode’s narrator says Nugent was divorced by the mother of two of his children in the mid-1970s in part because he was "fighting a losing battle with his own addiction, his weakness for young women." "I was addicted to girls," Nugent says. "Addicted. It was hopeless. It was beautiful." Post-divorce, Nugent, 30, paired up with a 17-year-old from Hawaii. "She was like a dream," Nugent says. "I was underage," the woman, says, looking back. "And even back in the wild ‘70s, it just wasn’t a terribly appropriate situation in most people’s eyes." The narrator says the girl’s mother even signed papers making Nugent her daughter’s legal guardian. "Ted admits to a number of liaisons with underage girls," the narrator says. Petkanas also forwarded a web link to a Huffington Post article stating Courtney Love, the singer, recalled performing a sex act with the elder Nugent when she was a 12-year-old groupie. Love said so in a radio interview in March 2004, according to a March 23, 2004, New York Post news story. The Post said Nugent didn’t return its call for comment on Love’s statement. Nugent’s office didn’t engage with our email and telephone inquiries for this article. Our ruling Davis said Abbott "has campaigned with a sexual predator who has bragged about having sex with underage girls." Davis didn’t mention Nugent’s name, but she’s right the former rock star, who stumped for Abbott this year, has talked about sexual escapades with much younger women. Then again, we found no confirmation of Nugent explicitly saying his victims were underage. Also, Davis’ statement could have given debate viewers the misimpression Nugent is a convicted sex offender, which isn’t so. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-08976	Bill McCollum "diverted a state plane to his home 53 times. A state auditor called it: likely a misuse of state resources."	/florida/statements/2010/jul/16/lets-get-work/rick-scott-group-goes-after-air-mccollum-new-tv-ad/	Back a year ago when we read the stories about Attorney General Bill McCollum's use of state airplanes, we kind of figured it would pop up sometime during the campaign for governor. Enter rich-guy Rick Scott and his 527 group "Let's Get to Work." Scott, who not only is challenging McCollum for the Republican nomination but leading in polls, began airing two TV ads recently through Let's Get To Work slamming McCollum's use of state airplanes. The first ad, called "Politicians are like diapers -- They should be changed regularly," says McCollum spent $280,000 in taxpayer money on air travel on state planes, including trips for personal travel. The second ad, which was released July 14, 2010, goes deeper into McCollum's use of the state airplane. Called "Frequent Flyer," it makes three basic claims: 1. That McCollum spent $280,000 using the state airplane, including for personal travel; 2. That "he diverted a state plane to his home 53 times;" 3. And that a state auditor called those diversions likely a misuse of state resources. The ad ends with the famous ding that sometimes precedes an announcement on an airplane, and the line, "You are now free to remove career politicians." In this fact-check, we'll discuss all three of the plane claims. But we'll specifically be checking a combination of claims No. 2 and No. 3 -- that McCollum diverted his plane to the airports closest to his home (Sanford and Orlando) 53 times, and that an auditor labeled those diversions likely a misuse of state resources. Using state planes The use of state planes by McCollum and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink became an issue in June 2009 after an investigation by the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald found dozens of flights by the two Cabinet members that appeared to be, at least partially, for something other than official state business. State law requires Cabinet members to maintain a legal residence in Tallahassee, and McCollum and Sink have second homes in the capital. But the law prohibits them from using a state plane to commute to get to their state jobs. The Times/Herald reported that on several occasions, McCollum dispatched an empty plane from Tallahassee to his home near Sanford to take him to events around the state. Often the plane would return him to Central Florida and fly back to Tallahassee with no passengers. Between January 2007, when he took office, and June 22, 2009, McCollum spent $280,189 on state air travel. Total air travel by Sink, agriculture commissioner Charles Bronson and Gov. Charlie Crist was even higher, the newspapers found. The Times/Herald articles match the first claim in the Scott-group ad -- that McCollum spent $280,000 using the state airplane. Now, onto the more serious allegations that McCollum diverted the plane to the airport nearest his Central Florida home, a practice an auditor called a misuse of state resources. Diversions/audit findings The record is clear: state airplanes flew 53 times to Sanford or Orlando for McCollum between January 2007 and July 2009, according to the state agency that oversees use of the plane, the Department of Management Services. A few examples: • Sept. 10, 2007, McCollum had a plane pick him up in Sanford. The plane then traveled to Naples before returning to Tallahassee. The cost of the Sanford diversion: $390; • May 29, 2008, McCollum traveled from Tallahassee to Vero Beach. On the return trip, McCollum was dropped off in Orlando and the plane returned empty to Tallahassee. The cost of the Orlando diversion: $1,072; • July 21, 2008, Two of McCollum's staffers traveled from Tallahassee to Sanford to pick him up. They then went to Fort Myers and St. Petersburg, before all three returned to Tallahassee. The cost of the Sanford diversion: $922. A Department of Management Services auditor, Sandra Lipner, wrote in a draft report on March 4, 2009, that those flights and the flights taken by the other officials appeared to be against state rules. ''The use of the state aircraft to transport the Governor, Attorney General, CFO and Commissioner of Agriculture between the seat of government and a residence located outside of Tallahassee would appear to be a misuse of state resources,'' Lipner wrote in the draft report. So, to the ad's claim, 53 flights by McCollum to home ... check. An auditor calling it a likely misuse of state resources ... check. If only the story ended there. What Scott left out The allegations prompted ethics complaints against McCollum and Sink. At issue was whether they misused state resources for personal gain. The Florida Commission on Ethics hired Craig B. Willis, a former assistant attorney general, as a special advocate to investigate the claims. On Dec. 4, 2009, Willis presented his findings. On McCollum's travels, Willis found that "in all instances where McCollum flew on state aircraft from Tallahassee to Sanford or Orlando, his calendar reflects a clear public purpose associated with the flight." However, Willis noted, that there were nine instances where flights were routed in a manner that did not have an apparent public purpose. For those flights, public business was conducted at another location prior to or after the stop in Sanford or Orlando. "There was no occasion found by ethics investigators where McCollum traveled only to his home on state aircraft and the plane flew back to Tallahassee empty or vice versa," the commission said in a subsequent press release. Put another way, McCollum didn't use the plane solely for getting home. It was always part of some other work-related trip. The commission unanimously dismissed the ethics complaint against McCollum -- it dismissed the complaints against Sink too. The postscript here is critical for two reasons. First, Willis determined that McCollum's diversions had a public purpose. And second, he argued -- and the ethics commission agreed -- that they did not violate state laws. That's omitted in the Let's Get to Work ad. So is the fact that the auditor's allegation that McCollum and the others appeared to misuse state resources was not included in the final report. It was only in a draft. Our ruling It's interesting to note that since the first Times/Herald story ran in summer 2009, McCollum has drastically reduced his use of the state plane. Between July and October 2008, before the stories ran, McCollum used the state plane 25 times. In the same four months in 2009, he used the plane only twice. So far in 2010, according to the Department of Management Services, McCollum has used the plane on only four days, all for travel related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. One of the trips was with Crist. The ad by the Scott-backed group Let's Get to Work claims that McCollum diverted his plane to the airports closest to his home (Sanford and Orlando) 53 times and that an auditor labeled those diversions likely a misuse of state resources. The ad is technically accurate on both marks, but leaves out critical information about the outcome of the investigation. The 53 trips to Central Florida were found to have a public purpose by the Florida Commission on Ethics, and an ethics complaint against McCollum was dismissed. The auditor who labeled those trips a likely misuse of state resources did not include those findings in her final report. Because of those omissions, we rate the Let's Get to Work ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05855	"You're supposed to throw away your shoes" if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them.	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/13/bob-marshall/del-bob-marshall-says-throw-your-shoes-out-if-cfl-/	Del. Bob Marshall says breaking a compact florescent light bulb is hazardous to the environment and to your shoes. Marshall, R-Prince William, sounded warnings about the mercury inside each of those curly-cue CFL bulbs. If one bulbs shatters, it creates a "hazardous materials situation in your home," he said in Feb. 2 testimony before a House Commerce and Labor subcommittee at Virginia’s General Assembly. "If (the mercury) contaminates your shoes, you’re supposed to throw away your shoes," he said. We’d hate to needlessly throw away a pair of shoes because a light bulb broke on them. So we decided to see if Marshall was correct. An average CFL contains 4 milligrams of mercury -- about enough to cover the tip of a ballpoint pen, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing light bulb makers. To put that in perspective, the association notes on its website that older glass thermometers contain about 500 milligrams of mercury, 125 times more than what’s in an average CFL. Debate over CFL use has been burning since 2007, when Congress passed a law requiring greater energy efficiency from light bulbs. The law phases out many traditional incandescent bulbs that don’t meet the standards, although manufacturers are making more efficient forms of the old-style bulbs. They’re also making more CFLs -- touted by state and federal officials as a much more efficient light source. The new standards have ignited conservative protest that the long arm of government has reached too far when Congress tells citizens they can no longer use an old-fashioned light bulb in their homes. Marshall, who is challenging George Allen this year for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat, urged the General Assembly to shield Virginians from the regulations. He introduced a bill that would allow Virginia companies to continue producing and selling the old-fashioned incandescents. At hearings, Marshall sought to convince legislators that increased use of CFL bulbs could expose Virginians to new risks of mercury exposure. But the bill died in subcommittee Feb. 2. We asked Marshall for information supporting his statement that shoes need to be tossed if they touch the debris from a broken CFL bulb. He sent us links to environmental agency websites from four states. But some of the sites Marshall cited don’t specifically say they’re providing instruction on how to handle a broken CFL bulb. They are advising how to deal with a larger mercury release, such as the dispersal of the "quicksilver" liquid mercury when a glass thermometer breaks. For example, the fact sheet from the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection that Marshall cited urges homeowners get rid of contaminated shoes and clothing after cleaning up "visible mercury beads." But as Indiana’s Department of Environmental Management notes, breaking a thermometer or thermostat with liquid mercury inside is different than breaking a fluorescent bulb. In the case of a broken bulb, "you will not be able to see the mercury," according to Indiana’s DEM. Robert Francis, manager of the environmental response branch at the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection, said his agency’s recommendation for getting rid of shoes tainted by mercury is a reference to what should be done in case of a larger spill than a light bulb break. He said his agency doesn’t have a recommendation on whether shoes should be thrown out if they’re contaminated by a bulb breakage. The Arizona Department on Environmental Quality says on its website that any clothing coming in direct contact with broken glass or powder should be thrown away. But when it comes to shoes, it recommends wiping them off with a damp cloth or paper towels. But Mark Shaffer, a spokesman with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, said his state would recommend throwing out shoes even if the smaller amount of mercury from the bulb gets on them. What about other states? In a quick search, we found agencies in West Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Mississippi all recommend homeowners should wipe off shoes with damp towels after they come in direct contact with mercury from a broken CFL bulb. The shoes don’t need to go, but the towels and wipes do. NEMA, the light bulb makers trade group, also advises wiping off -- not throwing out -- shoes that have bulb fragments or mercury powder on them. Virginia’s guidelines on CFL cleanup don’t speak to shoe contamination. Bill Hayden, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, referred our queries about how to handle contaminated shoes to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA website, in a section detailing how to clean up a broken CFL, offers no guidance on shoes. It does, however, recommend steps for dealing with a broken CFL at home. It suggests clearing everyone out of the room where the bulb shattered and opening a window or door to let it air out for 5-10 minutes. Heat or air conditioning should be shut off and then cardboard, tape or damp towels should be used to pick up the glass and powder from the bulb. But if you don’t clean up perfectly, the agency says that’s OK. "Don’t be alarmed: These steps are only precautions that reflect best practices for cleaning up a broken CFL," the EPA’s website states. "Keep in mind that CFLs contain a very small amount of mercury -- less than 1/100th of the amount in a mercury thermometer." For some additional perspective, we also spoke with Edward Groth, a former senior scientist with the Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. He said throwing away shoes tainted by a CFL bulb break would be a "fairly extreme" response. "If you get some on your shoes, the best solution, in my mind, would be to take them outside on the porch and let them air out for several days," Groth said. Our ruling: Marshall said that when shoes are contaminated with mercury from a broken CFL bulb, "you’re supposed to throw them out." To back his statement, he referred us to the websites of environmental agencies in four states. They advise throwing out clothing -- and sometimes shoes -- contaminated by a significant mercury release, such as the amount that would come from an old thermometer. But CFL bulbs have a tiny fraction of a thermometer’s mercury. None of the agencies specifically advise throwing shoes hit by a broken CFL. Two of the states’ websites say to clean off the shoes. Our quick search found five additional state websites that recommended wiping off the shoes off and not a single state that advised to throw them out. The Environmental Protection Agency offers no shoe advice. Marshall hasn’t proved his claim. We rate his statement False.	None	Bob Marshall	None	None	None	2012-02-13T06:00:00	2012-02-02	['None']
pomt-01027	"Insured Floridians pay about $2,000 for every hospital stay to cover the cost of the uninsured."	/florida/statements/2015/jan/28/florida-chamber-commerce/insured-people-pay-about-2000-uninsured-hospital-s/	The Florida Chamber of Commerce is weighing in on the state’s rising cost of health care, decrying the Affordable Care Act’s plans to expand Medicaid, but acknowledging uninsured residents cost big bucks. A chamber task force on Jan. 13, 2015, released a seven-point plan entitled "Smarter Healthcare Coverage in Florida," ahead of a potential fight among state lawmakers about how to cover the uninsured; Florida’s annual legislative session starts March 3. The group made it pretty clear they don’t endorse President Barack Obama’s health care law, calling it "a bureaucratic malaise that is taxing Americans and making our country less competitive" by shifting costs to businesses and taxpayers, and forcing up insurance premiums. They do acknowledge that Florida having the second-highest number of uninsured residents is a problem that needs fixing. "Floridians pay an additional $1.4 billion in hidden health care taxes to cover health care received by the uninsured," the report read. "Insured Floridians pay about $2,000 for every hospital stay to cover the cost of the uninsured." Making insured residents pay an extra $2,000 per hospital stay piqued our interest, because that’s a hefty add-on to already high medical bills. We wondered whether it was a true expense, or if the chamber was just padding its own invoice. Footing the bill The chamber’s report said 3 million Floridians don’t have health insurance. The group told us it used Kaiser Family Foundation data that showed there were about 3.6 million. An estimate using Census data said about 3.8 million of Florida’s 19 million residents were uninsured in 2013. That same report ranked Florida second in the nation in uninsured residents. We’ve explored this topic before, and found Florida was third in its percentage of uninsured, behind Texas and Nevada. Calculating how much those uninsured Floridians cost other patients is not the easiest leap to make. We asked several state, medical and insurance agencies whether the number was accurate or not, and no one had a statistic measured in such a way. The chamber told us they collected data from "an urban hospital" and tracked that unspecified facility’s cost-to-charge ratio. That’s a measure of how much care actually costs a hospital to provide versus how much they would charge a patient, and can vary from hospital to hospital. The chamber then divided the uninsured procedures’ costs by the total number of admissions through managed-care insurance plans. After adjusting for accounting discrepancies and other factors, the chamber determined the cost was about $2,300 per patient. To account for cost differences between the kinds of patients other hospitals would admit and the type of care they receive, they estimated a lower end of the range at $1,700, or about 75 percent of the first estimate. The chamber acknowledged setting this low end was a "somewhat arbitrary determination." The description of "about $2,000" was meant to be an average of this range, chamber spokeswoman Edie Ousley told PolitiFact Florida. "There will be, of course, individual hospitals (that) cost shift and some cost-shifting less per insured patient," Ousley said. "The intent of the calculation was to take real data from a representative hospital and try to provide an order of magnitude of the cost shift of the uninsured." The chamber said in its plan there were $1.4 billion in unpaid hospital expenses in 2012, a number that jibes with a Florida Hospital Association report that said in 2012, state hospitals spent $1.4 billion in "charity care" (the same as it was in 2011). To put that in perspective, the Agency for Health Care Administration reported more than $119 billion in charges for all hospital admissions in 2012. The average stay was about five days and cost more than $44,500. Charity care is defined as "free or discounted health services provided to people who meet hospitals’ criteria for financial assistance." It doesn’t include bad debt, uncollected charges or differences in treatment costs versus what a government program pays. FHA President Bruce Rueben has said he hoped "there will be inroads" to lowering that number in future reports, when people newly insured under the Affordable Care Act are taken into account. The federal insurance exchange didn’t open until Oct. 1, 2013, with policies starting in 2014, so data on how that affects charity care aren’t available. In any event, patients with insurance do end up paying for people who are not covered. Linda Quick, president of the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association, said she had heard the Chamber’s number used before, but wasn’t aware of how it had been calculated. Nonetheless, it’s an estimate that is rooted in a real problem, she said. "I think the underlying premise, those who do pay, pay for those who can't/don't is true," she told PolitiFact Florida via email, "although the ‘cost shifting’ had become more burdensome before the Affordable Care Act and the availability of affordable coverage." If Florida fully implemented the health care law, it would reduce the ranks of the uninsured. The pro-expansion Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy estimates about 1 million people would be covered under the Medicaid expansion by 2020, while the Kaiser Family Foundation said about 1.3 million people now qualify under the Affordable Care Act for subsidies to help them pay for private insurance. The Kaiser study said some 764,000 Floridians would fall into a coverage gap created when they earn too much to get Medicaid coverage, but not enough to get those subsidies. The rest either must buy their own insurance, are children covered by another program or are ineligible because of their immigration status. Our ruling The Florida Chamber of Commerce said, "Insured Floridians pay about $2,000 for every hospital stay to cover the cost of the uninsured." That number is based on an estimate the chamber developed in-house, calculating an average based on an unspecified "urban hospital" using the most recent data. There’s no way to tell just how accurate that estimate is, since it makes plenty of assumptions on actual costs. It also doesn’t take into account how much the Affordable Care Act will change the data, since the requirement for the uninsured to have policies didn’t kick in until 2014. Experts we talked to said there are problems with the chamber’s number, but it’s a somewhat reasonable illustration to a real problem in Florida: People who are insured end up paying for those who aren’t.

pomt-06475	"94 percent of winning candidates in 2010 had more money than their opponents."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/17/occupy-wall-street/occupy-wall-street-protesters-sign-says-94-percent/	A reader recently sent us a link to a photograph taken at the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City’s Zuccotti Park on Oct. 5, 2011. It showed a protester holding a sign that said, "94% of winning candidates in 2010 had more money than their opponents. Is this Democracy?" This statistic has been cited in a number of other forums recently. For instance, MSNBC host Dylan Ratigan -- who is backing a petition for a constitutional amendment to "Get Money Out" of politics -- used it on Martin Bashir’s MSNBC show on Sept. 27, 2011.] Ratigan said "there is a single statistic that I think is the only statistic that you need to understand about money and politics in America. … If you look at campaign for federal office, Congress, president, whatever, … if I know who raised more money, without even knowing anything else, 94 percent of the time I will pick the winner." We took up the reader’s suggestion to fact-check the statistic. We’ll first note that the creator of the sign is not specific about what offices are being referred to. We found two data sets that directly address the issue, both compiled by nonpartisan groups that track money in politics. One is the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks spending patterns in races for U.S. House and Senate seats. The other is the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks spending in state legislative contests. In congressional races in 2010, the candidate who spent the most won 85 percent of the House races and 83 percent of the Senate races, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That’s a large percentage, but it’s lower than what the sign indicated. Indeed, the percentage for 2010 was lower than it had been in recent election cycles. The center found that in 2008, the biggest spenders won 93 percent of House races and 86 percent of Senate races. In 2006, the top spenders won 94 percent of House races and 73 percent of Senate races. And in 2004, 98 percent of House seats went to candidates who spent the most, as did 88 percent of Senate seats. So the protester’s sign would have been essentially correct had it not specifically cited 2010 -- though even then, it would only be true for the House and not for the Senate, which has consistently seen lower percentages of the bigger spenders win. Meanwhile, the success rate of big spenders has been lower at the state level. The most recent figures, from the 2008 election cycle, show that 80 percent of state legislative candidates with the monetary advantage won their contests. In 2006, it was 83 percent; in 2004, it was 84 percent; and in 2002, it was 82 percent. (The group’s figures for 2010 are due to be released in the next month or so.) So the percentages for state legislative races have also been consistently lower than what the sign indicated. Our ruling The protester has a point: Even in the relatively atypical year of 2010, a large majority of contests for congressional and state legislative races were won by candidates who spent the most money, and the 94 percent mark was reached in federal races in 2006 and nearly again in 2008. Still, the sign’s figures were off. In 2010 -- which is not only the most recent election year but also the year specifically cited in the sign -- the percentage of big-money winners in U.S. House races was actually 85 percent, or nine points lower. And the percentages of U.S. Senate seats and state legislative seats won by the deeper-pocketed candidate have been consistently lower in recent election cycles. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Occupy Wall Street	None	None	None	2011-10-17T17:58:25	2011-10-05	['None']
pomt-10763	"I supported tort reform with regard to securities...product liability...interstate commerce."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/25/fred-thompson/a-mixed-record/	At an Oct. 21 Republican debate in Orlando, Fla., Fred Thompson responded to an attack by Rudy Giuliani, who had criticized votes by Thompson against tort reform. Thompson said, "I supported tort reform with regard to securities legislation. I supported tort reform with regard to product liability legislation, things that have to do with interstate commerce. I think it appropriately passed. I supported and worked for those things. Local issues belong at the state level. Most states have passed tort reform. That's our system. It's not all federalized." Thompson's statement fairly summarizes his record on the issue. A former trial lawyer, he has opposed some tort reform bills because he said they violated his principle of states' rights. But he has supported others because he said they involve interstate commerce. In 1995, he voted with his party for a bill limiting product liability lawsuits against manufacturers. However, he was instrumental in narrowing it from the broad tort reform that the Republican leadership had wanted. He was one of only nine Republican senators to vote against an earlier version of the bill, which included protections for doctors against medical malpractice suits and sanctions meant to limit frivolous lawsuits. The legislation went on to be passed without the protections for doctors and limits on frivolous suits. Also in 1995, Thompson voted with fellow Republicans on a bill that made it harder for shareholders to file class-action lawsuits against companies. When that law caused more and more class-action securities fraud lawsuits to be filed in state courts, Thompson voted for a 1998 law that required such cases to be handled by federal courts. He is correct that most states have passed some sort of tort reform, according to Darren McKinney, spokesman for the American Tort Reform Association, a group that advocates state and federal tort reform. Overall, we find Thompson's response to Giuliani's attack to be Mostly True.	None	Fred Thompson	None	None	None	2007-10-25T00:00:00	2007-10-21	['None']
pomt-05012	The media won’t publish a real photo of Trayvon Martin with tattoos on his face.	/florida/statements/2012/jul/17/chain-email/real-photo-trayvon-martin-chain-email-says-so/	There’s more to Trayvon Martin’s appearance than the media would have you know, a chain email claims. Martin is the 17-year-old Miami Gardens resident who was shot in February by volunteer neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. The answer is attached within the email, "Is This Little Trayvon Martin." Here, Trayvon is bigger and stronger than the boy we’ve seen in the hoodie. This Trayvon has facial hair. He’s inked up from his hands to his neck. His right cheek bears a can’t-miss tattoo -- a red star inset with "LA," in the style of the Los Angeles Dodgers logo. The email accuses reporters of deceiving the public by suppressing this photo and publishing photos of a younger Trayvon after his death. Then it complains the media won't report the 17-year-old’s disciplinary problems. Actually, the Miami Herald reported his suspensions and getting caught with marijuana and women’s jewelry. The email ends with a rant about the divisive, liberal agenda of the media. "They don't show the up-to-date pictures of Trayvon Martin, in the media," the email says. "Now you know why. Kinda scary, ain't it?" A couple readers asked us to investigate the photo in their inboxes. As we suspected, it’s not Trayvon Martin. We will note that after Trayvon's death a much younger picture of him provided by the family got a lot of press. But this email goes way off the mark. This man is Jayceon Terrell Taylor, also known as Game, a 32-year-old rapper from Compton, Calif., near Los Angeles. Formerly known as The Game, he earned Grammy nominations in 2006 for his collaboration with rapper 50 Cent on "Hate It or Love It." Game weighed in on the Trayvon Martin controversy in a March 2012 interview with MTV.com: "I'm far from racist. I'm very educated and intellectual and I understand how life works and how people of all colors exist under the sun, but it just seems like more than not black people are, I don't know, there's always some negative occurrence that goes on in our existence. This is just another reminder that stupidity still exists." As for the right cheek tattoo, it used to be a butterfly. Game concealed it with the Dodgers logo and red star after a lot of criticism. "I’m the face of L.A., so I put L.A. on my face," he once said. A publicist for the rapper said this picture was probably snapped during a photoshoot with XXL Magazine, though he wasn’t sure when. It’s no matter. We have enough information here to make our ruling. We rate the chain email Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2012-07-17T12:18:19	2012-07-16	['None']
pomt-08692	"Our law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert, either buried or just lying out there, that have been beheaded."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/08/jan-brewer/gov-jan-brewer-talks-beheadings-th-arizona-desert/	Defending her state's controversial immigration law she signed on April 23, 2010, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said border violence has gotten so bad there have been beheadings out in the Arizona desert. That's right, beheadings. It's a shocking image, but critics say it's also completely made up and an example of fear-mongering of the worst kind used by Brewer to manipulate an already emotional national debate on immigration. "We cannot afford all this illegal immigration and everything that comes with it, everything from the crime and to the drugs and the kidnappings and the extortion and the beheadings and the fact that people can't feel safe in their community. It's wrong! It's wrong!" Brewer said in a June 16, 2010, interview with Fox News. The Republican governor stood by her beheading claim when questioned about it during an interview on Phoenix NBC-affiliate KPNX 12 News on June 25, 2010. "Oh, our law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert, either buried or just lying out there, that have been beheaded," she said. That came as surprising news to Dr. Eric Peters, deputy chief medical examiner for Pima County, which has the largest border with Mexico of any county in Arizona. "We probably have handled the most deaths from border crossings," Peters told PolitiFact. "We have had approximately 1,700 deaths in the last 10 years. We haven't had a single death due to a beheading or having a beheading associated with it." The vast majority of deaths -- more than 95 percent, he said -- were due to exposure to the elements, either extreme heat in the summer or extreme cold in the winter. The remainder of deaths, less than 5 percent, were "generally related to the process of human smuggling," Peters said. For example, he said, passengers who are killed when a smuggler tries to put too many people in a van and the van rolls or is involved in an accident. "It's exceedingly rare for the deaths to have anything to do with any type of violence at all, and certainly no beheadings," Peters said. "It's not terribly uncommon that we'd find just a skull," Peters said. He then added a grisly (if clinical) explanation: "As a body decomposes, local animals will use the deceased as a food source and sometimes the head can become dis-articulated from the spine." But none from violent beheadings. It would be clear from the bones, Peters said, if there were a "traumatic removal from the remainder of the body." Other medical examiners and law enforcement officials along the border echoed Peters' sentiments. "We have received no headless bodies from the desert at all," said Pinal County spokesman Joe Pyritz. Reporters from the Arizona Guardian and television station ABC15 talked to several other medical examiners in counties along or near the Mexican border, and all said the same thing: no beheadings there. We also spoke to Vincent Picard, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Phoenix, who told us there have been no cases involving beheadings in any of their investigations. In a Sept. 1 debate, Brewer's Democratic opponent Terry Goddard called Brewer's beheading comments "fear-mongering" that painted an untrue picture of Arizona and hurt the state's economy. "Jan, I call upon you today to say there are no beheadings,'' Goddard demanded. She skirted the issue during the debate, but two days later, on Sept. 3, 2010, Brewer walked back her comment in an interview with the Associated Press. "That was an error, if I said that," Brewer said. "I misspoke, but you know, let me be clear, I am concerned about the border region because it continues to be reported in Mexico that there's a lot of violence going on and we don't want that going into Arizona." Escalating cartel-related violence -- including beheadings -- have been widely reported in northern Mexico. And some of those cartels are involved in cross-border smuggling. But Brewer twice described the beheadings as happening on the U.S. side of the border. And for weeks, she refused to back away from the comment. When Brewer finally acknowledged she had erred, she couched her admission with the qualifier "if I said said that." She did. This claim, like several others by opponents of illegal immigration, is ridiculously false -- emphasizing a non-existent danger. So we rate her comment Pants On Fire.

pomt-10346	"I investigated Abramoff and people ended up in jail."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/john-mccain/raised-awareness-but-doesnt-get-sole-credit/	Trying to tap voter frustration with Washington's political establishment, Sen. John McCain used a July 8, 2008, appearance on Fox News to remind viewers about his role investigating the political corruption scandal involving disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. His comments imply that his work directly resulted in guilty pleas. "The American people are angry when we see spending completely out of control . . . when we see corruption, that former members of Congress are now in federal prison," McCain said on the Fox and Friends program. "I investigated Abramoff and people ended up in jail, of course we get angry. Americans are angry now." McCain is referring to a two-year investigation he led as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that detailed how Abramoff and his associate, Michael Scanlon, defrauded Indian tribal clients of tens of millions of dollars. The probe involved extensive interviews and subpoenas, five committee hearings and a review of some 750,000 pages of records. A resulting 373-page report, approved by the panel in June 2006, outlined the circumstances under which six tribes paid Scanlon approximately $66-million for grass-roots lobbying activities during a three-year period, one-third of which Scanlon delivered to Abramoff. Republicans and Democrats alike have praised McCain for aggressively pressing the issue. And the hearings led to expanded inquiries into Abramoff's efforts to pressure former Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and other senior Interior Department officials on behalf of Indian tribes with gambling interests. But McCain wasn't the only one investigating. Federal prosecutors also were conducting extensive investigations into how Abramoff and Scanlon laundered millions of dollars through charities and front organizations in an effort take their cut of the proceeds and avoid paying taxes. Those probes and spinoff inquiries directly resulted in more than a dozen guilty pleas. Scanlon in November 2005 pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge stemming from his efforts to defraud tribes as part of the corruption scheme. He agreed to cooperate with investigators. Though there are several former members of Congress currently serving prison time on corruption charges, as McCain indicated, only ex-Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, was convicted as part of the Abramoff investigation. In January 2007, Ney was sentenced to 2 years in prison after acknowledging taking bribes from Abramoff. In February 2008, he was released from prison and moved to a halfway house. However, Ney's activities were not a particular focus of McCain's investigation. McCain can legitimately take credit for snaring a senior Interior Department official in his probe. Ex-Deputy Interior Secretary J. Steven Griles, the former No. 2 official in the department, pleaded guilty in March 2007 to lying to the Indian Affairs Committee about his relationship with Abramoff during testimony on Nov. 2, 2005, and during an earlier deposition with panel investigators on Oct. 20, 2005. In June 2007, Griles was sentenced to 10 months in prison and a $30,000 fine. Another Bush administration figure who went to prison in connection with the scandal was David Safavian, the former chief of staff of the U.S. General Services Administration. Safavian was sentenced in October 2006 to 18 months in prison for lying to McCain's committee, the GSA's inspector general and a GSA ethics officer about his efforts to help Abramoff obtain control of two properties controlled by the GSA and covering up a golf trip he took with Abramoff to England and Scotland in 2002. However, a federal appeals court in June 2008 threw out some of the charges and ordered a new trial. As for Abramoff himself, the ex-lobbyist in March 2006 was sentenced to nearly six years in prison in a separate case — for defrauding banks of $23-million while purchasing a fleet of gambling boats in Florida in 2000. While he serves his sentence, Abramoff is cooperating with authorities in the ongoing corruption investigation of administration officials, lawmakers and their aides. At least 14 individuals caught up in the corruption probe or the Florida case have pleaded guilty to various charges. Most were sentenced to probation in return for their cooperation in the investigation. It certainly can be argued that McCain was the most aggressive member of Congress who investigated the Abramoff affair, and that his efforts expanded inquiries into wrongdoing that ultimately resulted in the convictions of Bush administration officials, congressional staffers and businesspeople. And though McCain didn't directly send any of the wrongdoers to jail, Griles, the former Interior Department deputy, wound up serving time specifically because he lied to investigators from McCain's committee. For this reason, we rule McCain's statement Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-15T00:00:00	2008-07-08	['None']
pomt-06508	"I created a flat tax in the state of Utah. It took that state to the number-one position in terms of job creation."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/12/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-touts-record-taxes-job-creation-new-h/	During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., Jon Huntsman touted his achievements on both tax policy and job creation. "I created a flat tax in the state of Utah. It took that state to the number-one position in terms of job creation. We rated both of these claims previously. We’ll recap those analyses here. The flat tax When we first reported this item, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports from this spring and from 2007 that explained how he began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005. "We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states," Huntsman said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005. Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years. When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent. This created a much flatter tax, stripping away most deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bonds or deducting withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts. The research arm of the Utah Legislature says this was not a flat tax in the purest sense. "Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people.) Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit on state taxes a portion of their federal tax deductions and exemptions. The credit phases out and goes away for those making very high incomes in the state. This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis. "There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study. Anti-tax groups have given Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax. The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some "minor blemishes"' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.) So the system he and the Legislature enacted in Utah wasn’t a pure flat tax, since taxpayers may still make adjustments for certain financial factors -- but it is a flatter tax, and it includes one major defining factor of a flat tax, a single rate for all income groups. Job creation When we asked the Huntsman campaign in September for data to back up the claim, they directed us to a blog post at National Review Online, the website of the well-known conservative magazine. The item, posted June 20, 2011, compared employment statistics for several governors. "During Huntsman’s tenure, January 2005 to August 2009, Utah had the best overall job-growth rate of any state in the nation," the item said. "In that same time frame, Perry’s job-growth rate was 4.9 percent. (Minnesota Gov. Tim) Pawlenty’s job-growth rate was negative: The number of jobs in Minnesota decreased by 1.8 percent." At PolitiFact, we always double-check data in media reports against official statistics, so we did so here. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment statistics. We looked at the Current Employment Statistics database for each of the 50 states and subtracted the number of jobs in January 2005 from the number in August 2009. As it happens, this period was split between an expansion (2005 through 2007) and a deep recession (2008 and 2009), so a majority of states actually lost jobs over that period. Utah was not one of the job-losing states -- but it also wasn’t No. 1 in the nation, according to this set of statistics. The states with the fastest employment growth over the period when Huntsman was governor were Wyoming, with a 9.5 increase; North Dakota, with 7.5 percent; Texas, with 6.5 percent; and Utah, with 4.8 percent. So Huntsman’s claim gets a False, right? Not so fast. When we showed our math to the Huntsman camp, they stood by their numbers. They sent us to a page for the state of Utah on the BLSwebsite that backed up the claim Huntsman made during the debate -- the number of jobs in Utah rose by 5.9 percent over the period. Using the equivalent pages for the other three states, we found that Utah exceeded them all -- Texas grew by 4.9 percent, as Huntsman indicated, while Wyoming grew by 4 percent and North Dakota grew by 3 percent. Using these figures, Huntsman was correct. So what gives? When we checked with the BLS, a spokesman explained that the way we calculated the numbers and the way the Huntsman camp calculated the numbers are different because the numbers come from different data sets. The data we used come from the Current Employment Statistics, a monthly study of the payroll data at 400,000 businesses, whereas the Huntsman campaign was using data from the Current Population Survey, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households. Is one of these data set preferred in this context? The BLS’s answer is yes -- and the preferred method is not the one used by the Huntsman campaign. "BLS uses changes in the payroll survey to describe job gain or loss," said spokesman Gary Steinberg. We’ll note one additional factor. For claims like these, where elected officials suggest that they deserve credit for an achievement (or that their opponent deserves blame for a failure), PolitiFact attempts to determine whether the politician in question does in fact deserve credit or blame. In the case of job creation, Huntsman, as governor, played some role, but there were so many other factors at play -- from the state of the national economy to the particular climate for specific industrial sectors in the state to broader demographic trends -- that we think it’s a stretch for Huntsman to claim a significant share of the credit. That’s particularly because he credited just one portion of his efforts in office, the tax overhaul, with the job-creation numbers. Our ruling Huntsman didn’t create a pure flat tax in Utah, but he did create a flatter one. As for jobs, the Utah economy did well, but was not the No. 1 job-creating state in the nation by the yardstick most economists, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, would use. And we don’t think it’s valid for Huntsman to claim as much credit as he does for himself and his tax changes for the jobs numbers. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-13424	Says Russ Feingold was the "only senator to vote against Homeland Security."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/21/let-america-work/pac-wrongly-claims-russ-feingold-was-only-vote-aga/	A TV ad from Let America Work, a single-candidate super PAC that supports Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson for re-election, paints Democratic challenger Russ Feingold as someone who weakened the military during his 18 years in the Senate. Feingold, the narrator states, "voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times" -- a claim Johnson made that we rated Half True. Feingold did vote 11 times against an annual bill that authorizes defense spending levels and covers policy issues. But those were not votes to defund the military, given that it takes appropriations bills to provide funding. And lawmakers sometimes oppose the annual measure because of policy provisions included in it. The ad, released Sept. 1, 2016, continues with words on the screen that say Feingold was the "only senator to vote against military intelligence" and the "only senator to vote against Homeland Security." The two claims are essentially fleshed out by the narrator saying: "Feingold voted against the Patriot Act and against creating the Department of Homeland Security." Feingold is well known for casting the lone vote against the USA Patriot Act, the 2001 anti-terrorism law introduced by U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, in his rematch with Johnson, Feingold has done a fundraising appeal explaining his vote. But did Feingold cast the only vote against creating the Department of Homeland Security? No. As reported by the New York Times at the time, the Senate voted in 2002 to "reorganize broad elements of a scattered federal government around a focused response to terrorism," with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security being "Washington's biggest transformation in 50 years." "Not since Congress and the Truman administration upended the nation’s military apparatus to fight the cold war in 1947 has the government been reshaped so dramatically around a single purpose," the Times said. The department "will slowly begin to absorb 22 of Washington's signature functions, including immigration, border protection, emergency management, intelligence analysis and the protection of the president himself." The roll call vote on the Homeland Security Act shows the measure passed 90-9. Feingold was one of the nine, along with fellow Democrats Daniel Akaka of Alaska, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Carl Levin of Michigan and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. (James Jeffords, a Vermont independent, also voted no, while Frank Murkowski of Alaska was not present. Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl voted yes.) Feingold’s campaign responded to the ad the same day, issuing a statement saying Feingold voted no because the bill contained "unrelated riders." The statement included this excerpt from his book, "While America Sleeps": Using the same tactics as the drafters of the Patriot Act, the backers knew they could grab a victory on some unrelated agenda because the overall bill was what was known in Washington as a must-pass. Such bills, which Congress has almost no choice but to pass, often attract riders like the one that restricted employees’ rights. The Bush administration and the Republicans in the Senate, hungry to regain the majority, pounced with some gusto on the political opportunities this new climate of fear provided. Let America Work didn’t respond to our requests for information. Our rating Let America Work says Feingold was the "only senator to vote against Homeland Security."

pomt-12118	"70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults."	/new-york/statements/2017/aug/18/andrew-cuomo/yes-one-three-us-adults-have-criminal-record/	Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants businesses in New York state to hire more applicants with a criminal record. They become loyal employees and bring tax benefits, he said. And, they make up a huge pool of prospective employees. "70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults," Cuomo wrote in an article on career website LinkedIn. People with a criminal record number too many for employers to pass over because of unsubstantiated fears of workplace violence, theft or incompetence, he said. But is the number as high as he said? Does one in every three adults have a criminal record? The FBI’s definition of criminal record The FBI considers anyone who has been arrested on a felony charge to have a criminal record, even if the arrest did not lead to a conviction. The FBI only counts those with a misdemeanor if a state agency asks the bureau to keep it on file. So by the FBI’s standard, 73.5 million people in the United States had a criminal record as of June 30. The Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249.4 million. That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record. Cuomo’s statement Cuomo did not make any distinction between convictions and arrests in his article. He just used the term 'criminal record' without defining it. The meaning of criminal record can be ambiguous. A search on the internet will tell you a criminal record is a history of someone’s convictions, a step beyond the FBI’s definition. "When I teach my classes and I talk to my students about this, I tell them the term criminal record is almost useless," said Robert Brame, a professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina. "It could mean so many different things," Brame said. "Are you talking about conviction record, arrest record, juvenile record?" In most cases, arrests shouldn't show up on pre-employment checks, said Michelle Rodriguez, a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. "But there's still mistakes that happen in background check reports so there is a possibility that something could show up," Rodriguez said. There is no federal data on the number of people with a criminal conviction living in the U.S. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics does have an estimate for how many people were under correctional supervision in 2015. The bureau reported 6.7 million adults either incarcerated or on parole or probation. That’s close to three out of every 100 adults.

But the term ‘criminal record’ is ambiguous, and the FBI definition is different from the common-sense definition.

pomt-09010	Blue Cross headquarters has "a $30,000 granite table."	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/11/steve-archambault/archambault-says-blue-cross-headquarters-has-30000/	Another Democratic candidate has decided to go after Blue Cross of Rhode Island for its perceived extravagance. This time it was Stephen Archambault, one of the three Democrats who have filed for Attorney General. At the June 28 Democratic state convention in the 17th-floor ballroom of the Providence Biltmore hotel, Archambault complained that Blue Cross, which enjoys non-profit status, spent excessively when it equipped its new Providence headquarters. The company has been a popular target of politicians, in part because of its double-digit rate increase requests; it was awarded an average 9.8 percent increase July 7. "We don't have to look too far to see a $125 million building across the way with a $30,000 granite table and a state-of-the-art gym that Governor Schwarzenegger could have trained for the Olympiad in," Archambault said. Spending $30,000 on a table seems pretty extravagant. If it's true. The Archambault claim came the same day Democrat Bill Lynch, who is running for Congress, drew a Pants On Fire ruling from us because he claimed -- with no proof -- that Blue Cross spent $25 million on decor for its new building. We asked the Archambault campaign to put its cards on a, presumably, much cheaper table and say where the candidate got his information. Spokesman Rob Horowitz said the campaign couldn't back up the claim because the information came from a source, whose name he would not disclose. "We received the information from what we believe to be a reliable source. But we don't have first-hand knowledge and at this juncture cannot confirm it," said Horowitz. "As a result, we will not be using it any more and it shouldn't have been included in the speech the other night. The broader point about the cost of the building we believe to be completely on target." When we asked Blue Cross about the table, Kimberly Reingold, director of media relations and external affairs, said she was unable to find a granite table, not even in the board room, where the table is made of wood. So we went back to the Archambault campaign and asked Horowitz to contact the secret source and identify the room containing the swanky table. Then we called Blue Cross and asked for a tour of the new 13-story building that overlooks Waterplace Park. We were told by Reingold that customer service areas were off-limits because of federal patient confidentiality laws. We offered to wear earplugs so we couldn't overhear comments from the customer service representatives. We also offered to sign a confidentiality agreement vowing to keep any medical information secret. Reingold said neither offer was acceptable, although we could see other areas of the building. Our plan was to get the location of the table from the Archambault source and, if we weren't taken there on the tour, ask to see the room where it was purported to be. Horowitz, Archambault's spokesman, reported a few days later that the campaign's source was not returning phone calls. So we took the tour anyway. We were allowed to view a customer service area from afar and didn't see any furnishings that appeared lavish. We saw the gym, with new exercise equipment, along with a room for exercise classes (employees pay $16 a month to use the facility), but nothing out of the ordinary for a building with 1,100 employees. "There are no granite tables," insisted Thomas Bovis, assistant vice president of corporate real estate and administrative services, who coordinated the development of the building. At the end of the tour, we asked to see the board room to confirm Reingold's report. Reingold said it was off limits because we would have to pass areas where we might be able to see documents with customer information. She then agreed to take our camera to the board room and snap photos from two different angles. Based on those pictures, the table looks like it's made of wood. We give the Archambault campaign credit for retracting its claim as soon as we challenged it. If this tale of the extravagant table takes a turn, we'll recalibrate the Truth-O-Meter. But for now, it's registering a rock-solid Pants on Fire.	None	Stephen Archambault	None	None	None	2010-07-11T06:00:00	2010-06-28	['None']
pomt-13324	"Toomey and Trump will ban abortion and punish women who have them."	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/oct/06/naral-pro-choice/attack-ads-unsubstantiated-claim-pat-toomey-trump-/	One pro-choice political action committee said in a recent ad that if Pennsylvanians re-elect Sen. Pat Toomey to the Senate, he’ll work together with GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump to ban abortion and punish women who have them. The attack ad, put out last week by NARAL Pro-Choice America, is part of a surge of outside spending in the Pennsylvania Senate race. Democrats have for months tied Toomey, a Republican who hasn’t explicitly endorsed the presidential nominee, to Trump -- but this ad takes it a step farther. It first flashes a clip of an interview between Trump and MSNBC’s Chris Matthews from March when Trump caused an uproar by saying women should be punished for having an abortion. "Pat Toomey might use different words, but his agenda is the same," the narrator of the ad says. "Toomey and Trump will ban abortion and punish women who have them." No, they probably won’t. First and foremost, the president and the Senate can’t ban abortion and punish women who have them. First, the U.S. Supreme Court would need to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 43-year-old decision that says states can’t put in place unreasonable barriers for women seeking abortions. Whether Congress can even vote to restrict abortion is in dispute, and was a major issue last year when lawmakers considered a bill that would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks in most cases. Toomey and Trump do mostly agree on abortion: Both consider themselves to be pro-life, and both have said they would support the overturning of Roe v. Wade if the Supreme Court did so. Toomey’s said that abortion should be up to states to decide and, if Pennsylvania banned abortion, he would support it. In a 2009 interview also with Matthews, when asked if doctors who perform abortions should face prison time, Toomey said: "At some point doctors performing abortions I think would be subject to that sort of penalty." Trump took it farther in March during that now-infamous interview on MSNBC. During a segment on abortion, Trump said: "There has to be some form of punishment." Matthews responded: "For the woman?" Trump replied: "Yeah." But the GOP nominee walked back those comments hours later in what PolitiFact has previously dubbed "as clear a reversal as it comes." "If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman," Trump said in a statement at the time. "The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions." But we weren’t able to find a single example of Toomey saying he believes women should be punished for having an abortion. A campaign spokesman said "he obviously does not." When we reached out to NARAL for any evidence that Toomey supports punishing women who have abortions, a spokesperson directed us to NARAL’s own website. At the top of a page dedicated to Toomey, it reads: "Together, Pat Toomey and Donald Trump will ban abortion and punish women who have them." The sources listed include Trump’s interview with Matthews, as well as three citations related to Toomey’s stances on abortion. The first is a quote from Toomey during a 2010 Senate campaign debate, in which he says "I think Roe v. Wade was mistakenly determined and I support its repeal." During that same debate, Toomey said: "I’m pro-life. And I would accept a ban on abortions, with the exceptions of rape and incest and the life of the mother." The second citation from NARAL notes that Toomey co-sponsored the bill last year that banned abortion after 20 weeks and would stipulate doctors who perform them could face prison time. That bill, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, never made it out of committee. The third citation notes that last year, Toomey voted in favor of a bill that would have made it harder for victims of human trafficking to seek federal assistance in paying for an abortion. Democrats and Republicans eventually came to a compromise on that bill that meant federal funds wouldn’t be used for abortions, but Democrats didn’t see the amendments as an affront to women’s health. None of the citations showed Toomey saying or implying he believes women who have abortions should be legally punished. Our Ruling In an attack ad, NARAL Pro-Choice America said, "Toomey and Trump will ban abortion and punish women who have them." Even if Toomey and Trump could themselves ban abortion and punish women who have them, Toomey has never said he’d support punishing women who have abortions. Trump said he’d support such a measure, but walked back that stance hours after saying it. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525a11ea-916b-474f-b872-a15c52b04277	None	NARAL Pro-Choice America	None	None	None	2016-10-06T08:42:57	2016-09-28	['None']
pomt-07518	"From '05 to '09, we've had 1,100 soldiers commit suicide, one every 36 hours."	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/08/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-cites-rising-numbers-service-personne/	Persistent U.S. deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have coincided with a widely documented increase in military suicides. At a March 16 House Armed Services Committee hearing on the war in Afghanistan, Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, raised the issue with General David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, as well as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy. "From '05 to '09, we've had 1,100 soldiers commit suicide, one every 36 hours. A report in Navy Times said that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have thought about attempting suicide," Ryan said at the hearing. Ryan, whose district includes an Air Force Reserve base, brought up an important issue. PolitiFact Ohio reviewed the second part of his quote in a separate item, rating it Pants On Fire. This item will focus on his claim about the number of suicides and their frequency. Ryan’s staff referred us to a 2010 Pentagon report titled "The Challenge and the Promise: Strengthening the Force, Preventing Suicide and Saving Lives," which shows the military’s suicide rate rose from 10.3 per 100,000 service personnel in 2001 to 18.4 per 100,000 in 2009. The report counts 189 suicides by active duty and reserve component service members in 2005. In 2006, the number rose to 213. It was 224 in 2007, 267 in 2008, and 309 in 2009. That’s a grand total of total of 1,202 suicides over five years, which exceeds the number Ryan cited. Dividing the 43,824 hours in that period by 1,202 suicides reveals that there was one military suicide every 36.46 hours, a number nearly identical to Ryan’s statistic. The groups with the highest suicide rates were service members who were male, Caucasian, divorced, under age 25 and those with a GED. The largest U.S. military branch the Army, had the highest number of suicides during those years. It released its own report on the topic last year. So where does this claim rank on the Truth-O-Meter? Ryan’s number for actual suicides over a five year period was understated, but not off by enough to distort his underlying point - that suicides among military personnel are a problem that is on the rise. His statistic of one military suicide every 36 hours was also on the mark. On this point we rate his statement as True.	None	Tim Ryan	None	None	None	2011-04-08T06:00:00	2011-03-16	['None']
pomt-10617	"I'm proud of the fact that I've raised more money from small donors than anybody else, and that we're getting $25, $50, $100 donations, and we've done very well doing it that way."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/16/barack-obama/obama-rakes-it-in-from-small-donors/	Barack Obama said in a debate that he has raised the most money from small donors. For this question, we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics. The center found that, based on available data, Obama has raised the most money from small donors, said spokesman Massie Ritsch. Small donors are defined as people who donate less than $200; the Federal Election Commission requires candidates to itemize contributions from people who give more than that. Smaller donations get reported as a lump sum, and Obama has reported the most money raised under this category. (The donation limit for any individual donor is $2,300 per candidate.) An important caveat: The center has only analyzed data compiled through Sept. 30, 2007, the last deadline for campaign finance data. Another report is due about two weeks from this writing, on Jan. 31, 2008. It's possible, though not likely, that fundraising during the last quarter of the year could change this analysis. Here are the totals for individual donors calculated by the center so far, excluding PAC contributions and transfers from other accounts: * Obama: $79.2-million total, $19.8-million small; * Clinton: $79.6-million total, $10.4-million small; * Edwards $30.1-million total, $8.4-million small. Based on the center's analysis, we find Barack Obama's claim that he gets the most money from small donors to be True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-01-16T00:00:00	2008-01-15	['None']
pomt-08174	"Historically," Senate ratification of arms control treaties "has been bipartisan."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/30/michael-mullen/adm-mike-mullen-says-past-arms-treaty-ratification/	As the House and Senate move into a brief lame-duck session before the new Congress begins work in January, one issue on the table is whether the Senate will ratify a new START treaty to control nuclear arms, as the Obama Administration wants. The treaty would enact modest nuclear-weapons reductions and extend verification provisions that lapsed last year. Most Democrats and many foreign-policy professionals favor ratification of the new treaty, which would require 67 votes in the Senate. But the effort has run into problems with Senate Republicans. The Senate Republicans' leading spokesman on the issue, Minority Whip Jon Kyl of Arizona, said earlier this month that the lame duck session did not offer enough time to iron out problems he sees with a related issue -- U.S. plans for modernizing nuclear forces and infrastructure. The administration took up the gauntlet, redoubling its efforts to ratify the treaty this year. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Vice President Joe Biden wrote that "national security interests are at stake" in the ratification battle. But Republicans countered that the need for speed was overblown. In a separate item, we checked a statement by Kyl on NBC's Meet the Press in which he cited reports by the Washington Post and the Associated Press to justify his position that failure to ratify the new START treaty immediately would not threaten national security. Now we'll take a look at an earlier comment by Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In an interview on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Nov. 21, 2010, the host asked the nation's top military officer whether the Senate is "playing politics with American national security." Mullen responded, "Well, you'd have to ask the Senate about that." Amanpour pressed him, asking, "What do you think?" Mullen replied, "Well, certainly, what I think is that there is a sense of urgency with respect to ratifying this treaty that needs to be ... recognized. Historically this has been bipartisan. This is a national security issue of great significance. And the sooner we get it done, the better." We wondered whether Mullen is correct that most prior arms-control treaties have been passed with bipartisan support. We began by determining which treaties we should include in our assessment. We turned first to the list of "treaties and agreements" handled by the State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance. We only looked at formal treaties, which require a two-thirds vote by the Senate in order to be ratified. (A quick reminder: Treaties are negotiated and signed by representatives of the president, then ratified by the Senate. Once a few additional logistical steps are taken, treaty adherence is made official.) We also stuck to treaties that were primarily designed as arms control efforts, particularly when they dealt with weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological and chemical. By our count, the Senate has ratified 14 such treaties in 13 votes. Here's the list in chronological order, along with the year of U.S. ratification and the tally for and against in the Senate: • Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1963 -- 80-19. • Non-Proliferation Treaty, 1969 -- 83-15. (Seven Democrats and eight Republicans voted against.) • Latin American Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, 1971 -- 70-0. • Seabed Arms Control Treaty, 1972 -- 83-0. • Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, 1972 -- 88-2. (U.S. later withdrew.) • Biological Weapons Convention, 1974 -- 90-0. • Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, 1988 -- 93-5. • Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and Threshold Test Ban Treaty, 1990 -- 98-0 (to ratify both treaties). • Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, 1991 -- 90-4. • Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as START I, 1992 -- 93-6. (Expired 2009.) • Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II, also known as START II, 1996 -- 87-4. • Chemical Weapons Convention, 1997 -- 74-26 (with 29 Republicans joining 45 Democrats in voting yes and 26 Republicans voting no.). • Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, also known as the Moscow Treaty, 2003 -- 95-0. This list demonstrates that at least 13 treaties presented to the Senate for ratification passed by overwhelming majorities -- and with strong bipartisan support. The strongest opposition came in the vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. But the opponents, led by the late Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., could not muster enough support either on amendments to the treaty or the treaty ratification vote itself to derail it. An additional historical footnote that bolsters the notion of bipartisanship: Thirteen of the 14 treaties above were ratified when one party held the presidency and the other party held the Senate. There is, however, one example of a weapons treaty actually being voted down on the Senate floor. In 1999, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty fell, 51-48, with all but four Republicans voting no. (Sens. John Chafee, R-R.I., James Jeffords, R-Vt., Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., voted for the treaty, along with all Democrats except for Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who voted present.) In remarks after the Senate vote, President Bill Clinton presaged what some Democrats have argued this month. "In recent days, members of the Congressional majority have displayed a reckless partisanship," Clinton said. "It threatens America's economic well-being and now our national security. Yesterday, hard-line Republicans irresponsibly forced a vote against the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This was partisan politics of the worst kind because it was so blatant and because of the risks it poses to the safety of the American people and the world." So the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is a clear exception to Mullen's claim. Whether there are additional examples is murkier. We found two nuclear-related treaties from the Clinton era that were signed but never ratified by the U.S. -- the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. But in talking to experts, we found no evidence that either treaty was targeted for opposition based on partisan lines. In fact, according to a 1996 Chicago Tribune report, just days after the Clinton Administration signed the African treaty protocols, it clarified that the treaty would not prevent the U.S. from using nuclear weapons against Libya. So reservations about the African treaty don't appear to be based on partisanship. In addition, the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, or SALT II, was signed by President Jimmy Carter but never ratified. While the negotiations over the treaty were somewhat contentious, the immediate reason for not pursuing ratification was the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, a rationale that had bipartisan support. Another treaty that faced significant partisan opposition was the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which failed to advance to a vote in the Senate due to opposition by conservatives who expressed concern about its impact on U.S. sovereignty. But the subject of this treaty seems too far afield from what Mullen was talking about for us to count it. So where does this leave us? We found one clear example of partisan opposition to a nuclear-weapons treaty -- the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty -- but 13 which were passed with broad, bipartisan support. So we rate Mullen's contention that Senate treaty ratifications have "historically ... been bipartisan" as True.	None	Mike Mullen	None	None	None	2010-11-30T16:52:25	2010-11-21	['None']
pomt-13848	The war on drugs led to "a 500 percent increase in incarceration in our country, disproportionately affecting poor and disproportionately affecting minorities."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/10/cory-booker/how-war-drugs-affected-incarceration-rates/	To address racial tensions in the United States, the federal government should invest in law enforcement, said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on NBC’s Meet the Press July 10. But it has to be the right kind of investment. "There is a challenge with America where we have invested, unfortunately, in a war on drugs, which has been profoundly painful to our nation, with a 500 percent increase in incarceration in our country, disproportionately affecting poor and disproportionately affecting minorities," Booker said. President Richard Nixon launched the war on drugs in the early 1970s, and about 10 years later President Ronald Reagan strengthened the effort. We decided to look into Booker’s claim that these stricter drug policies led to a 500 percent increase in incarceration. We found that the number of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, as has the overall incarcerated population. But it’s hard to prove a causal relationship. Rising incarcerated populations A spokesman said Booker’s statistic comes from the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice reform advocacy organization. It says the current incarcerated population is 2.2 million — including federal prisons, state prisons and local jails — which is a 500 percent growth over the past 40 years. Experts told us that the Sentencing Project’s statistics are credible. The state and federal prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent since 1974. The state and federal prison population remained fairly stable through the early 1970s, until the war on drugs began. Since then, it has increased sharply every year, particularly when Reagan expanded the policy effort in the 1980s, until about 2010. So it seems Booker has his numbers right, but how much of this increase is a direct result of the tougher drug laws? The effort resulted in the Drug Enforcement Administration's establishment, as well as policies such as mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes and new asset forfeiture rules. It’s hard to say exactly how much of the increase can be attributed to these policies because it’s difficult to isolate the impact to any one cause, experts told us. That being said, "a lot of people attribute the increase in incarceration to the war on drugs," said Nancy La Vigne, director of the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center. "While it's much more complicated than that, I suppose most would agree that it was the single biggest driver." In 1980, about 41,000 people were incarcerated for drug crimes, according to the Sentencing Project. In 2014, that number was about 488,400 — a 1,000 percent increase. More people are admitted to prisons for drug crimes each year than either violent or property crimes, found Jonathan Rothwell, a senior economist at Gallup. So drug prosecution is a big part of the mass incarceration story, he said. Rothwell told PolitiFact he thinks some of the increase would have happened regardless, but Booker is right to focus on the drug war. Others see it differently. John F. Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School, has argued that the impact of the war on drugs is greatly exaggerated, finding that drug crime only accounts for about 20 percent of prison growth since 1980. "In reality, a majority of prison growth has come from locking up violent offenders, and a large majority of those admitted to prison never serve time for a drug charge, at least not as their primary charge," he wrote last year. But violent crime and seemingly unrelated factors that contributed to the rapid increase in prison population growth can actually be connected to the war on drugs, said Steven Duke, a professor at the Yale Law School. For example, if policies cause the cost of drugs to go up, users might be more prone to steal in order to afford drugs. And black markets can lead to more violent crime, like if a drug deal goes sour and results in a murder. Effect on minorities and poor people It is a well-established fact that minorities are overrepresented in the prison population. About 58 percent of all sentenced inmates in 2013 were black or hispanic, yet the two groups make up just about 30 percent of the total population. Research also suggests that when black and white people engage in the same illegal activity and have the same criminal history, black people are more likely to be arrested, more likely to face tougher charges and more likely to receive longer sentences than whites. In a 2014 article, Rothwell found that the war on drugs has significantly impacted black people. He found that white people are more likely than black people to sell drugs and about as likely to consume them. Even so, black people are 3.6 times more likely than white people to be arrested for selling drugs and 2.5 times more for drug possession. The question of how poor people are represented in the prison population, particularly among those incarcerated for drug-related offenses, is a little more elusive. The best data about prisoners’ income before their arrest comes from a 2004 government survey. The Prison Policy Initiative analyzed the survey and "found that incarcerated people had a median annual income of $19,185 prior to incarceration, which is 41 percent less than non-incarcerated people of similar ages." This would indicate that the incarcerated population is disproportionately poor, but it does not shed light directly on the question of the war on drugs' impact on poorer populations. Our ruling Booker said the 40-year war on drugs led to "a 500 percent increase in incarceration in our country, disproportionately affecting poor and disproportionately affecting minorities." Booker has his numbers right, looking at incarcerated population growth over the past 40 years. It’s hard to conclusively attribute the rapid rise to the war on drugs, but many experts believe that it is a major factor, if not the primary factor. Minorities are disproportionately represented in the prison population, and some slightly dated research indicates poor people are, as well. Evidence seems to show that black people are more likely to be arrested for drug crime than white people, despite being equally likely to use and less likely to sell drugs. Even though it’s hard to prove a direct causal effect, the evidence seems to back up Booker’s claim. Because of that additional context, we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05765	Says that Rick Santorum "voted for the unions over FedEx."	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/29/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-rick-santorum-sided-union-inter/	Newt Gingrich, in Nashville on Monday, cast his opponent, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, as a "Big Labor Republican," the kind of apparent oxymoron that tends to catch our attention. He did it in the context of an historic 1996 showdown in the U.S. Senate, when FedEx was seeking to guarantee that its truck drivers would remain under the jurisdiction of the Railway Labor Act. Any change in that jurisdiction threatened the possibility that drivers could organize local collective bargaining units at FedEx operations. Specifically, Gingrich said: "He voted for the unions over FedEx. I suspect most folks in the state don’t know that. But in fact he was a big labor Republican in Pennsylvania and I suspect when you get to Memphis and you say to people, ‘Gee, this is a guy who wanted to guarantee that FedEx give in to the unions,’ Santorum won’t be as popular the following morning." Popular or not, there is a legislative history of what happened. We asked Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond for additional supportive evidence of Santorum’s pro-labor, anti-FedEx position after he forwarded an Associated Press story about Gingrich’s remarks. In response to that request, Hammond emailed: "Look up the vote!" We took that to mean Gingrich was basing this line of attack on an October 1996 skirmish over a provision FedEx wanted. There were three votes of significance, and they paint a mixed picture of Santorum's position on FedEx. The issue at the time was the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization act. It had passed both the House and Senate, but then emerged from a House-Senate conference committee with a new labor provision, one favorable to FedEx, that had not been in either the House or Senate versions of the bill. It had been inserted by conference committee member Sen. Ernest Hollings, Republican of South Carolina. When it came to the Senate floor, several senators, but especially Edward Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked that the FedEx provision, Sec. 1223 of the bill, be ruled outside the scope of the conference committee’s authority under Senate Rule 28. The chair then ruled the provision was, in fact, extraneous. Next the Senate took up the issue of cloture – whether to cut off debate on the reauthorization act (not just the provision) and proceed to the substantive vote. Santorum joined Kennedy and fellow Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Alan Specter in voting not to invoke cloture -- in other words, to continue debate (some bills and acts never even get an up or down vote if enough senators refuse to end debate on it). That arguably was against FedEx’s interest, though very indirectly, and the tally was 66-31 -- Santorum’s side lost by six votes (cloture requires a three-fifths majority). Next the Senate took up whether to sustain the ruling of the chair that Sec. 1223 -- the FedEx provision -- was beyond the scope of the conference committee’s authority. On this, Santorum voted in favor of the ruling of the chair – arguably, against FedEx’s interest – but the chair’s ruling was easily overturned, 39-56. Again, Santorum voted with Kennedy and Specter, and lost. Finally, when the bill itself came up for a vote, with the FedEx provision intact, Santorum voted for it. The vote was 92-2. Only Specter and Paul Simon of Illinois voted against it. We are not making a ruling here on whether Santorum was a "Big Labor Republican" senator but thought we’d get the thoughts of the "Big Labor" voice with the most to win or lose in this 1996 struggle – The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Did the Teamsters consider Santorum a "Big Labor Republican?" "Absolutely not," said director of communications Bret Caldwell. "Any vote that he had that might have been in favor of labor would likely have been cast for other reasons. We worked very hard, successfully, to defeat him six years ago, and we would never consider Santorum as a friend of labor." Asked specifically about Santorum’s votes in favor of the ruling of the Senate chair and on cloture, which seemed to side with the pro-labor faction, Caldwell said: "The question is whether he was with labor or with (FedEx rival) UPS as a corporation. His reasonings for that vote we’re not certain at this point, 16 years on, but there’s other reasons for him to vote the way he did. We certainly don’t think it gave him any further credibility with the Teamsters union." Caldwell acknowledges that on the initial procedural votes, Santorum’s were "the right votes." But "do we think he made those votes because of his relationship with labor? Absolutely not." Our ruling Santorum took three votes on the 1996 FAA reauthorization act, all three of some interest to FedEx, and Gingrich is correct that on the one vote with a direct connection to the provision FedEx wanted, Santorum voted against its wishes. However, Santorum voted for the entire FAA reauthorization act, and the union with the most to gain in the procedural brouhaha with FedEx does not believe Santorum’s vote had anything to do with supporting the labor cause.

pomt-13731	Says Donald Trump "cashed in" on Sept. 11, "collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover — even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/joseph-crowley/did-donald-trump-cash-federal-funds-days-after-911/	U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., made a serious charge on the second night of the Democratic National Convention about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump making money off of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Crowley, who lost a cousin that day, (accurately) painted Hillary Clinton as someone who was there for the city and its first-responders. Trump, however, "saw a payday for his empire," Crowley said. "Where was Donald Trump in the days and months and the years after 9/11? He didn’t stand at the pile, he didn’t lobby Congress for help, he didn’t fight for the first responders," he said. "Nope, he cashed in, collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover — even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected." Did Trump, a New Yorker, take taxpayer-funded money earmarked for small businesses and for losses he said he didn’t even suffer? A spokeswoman for Crowley referred us to a 2006 New York Daily News investigation. The Daily News found that Trump did receive $150,000 for the Trump Building, which is less than a mile away from the World Trade Center. But Crowley’s charge is misleading as it suggests Trump took advantage of the program, when his property at 40 Wall Street did meet the criteria for the money. Under the 9/11 business recovery grant program run by the Empire State Development, New York’s economic development agency, firms were eligible if they employed 500 employees or less, had been physically or economically damaged by the attacks, and located on or south of 14th Street in Lower Manhattan. According to the Daily News, Trump’s "grant application describes the corporation through which Trump owns that building as having 28 employees and $26.8 million in annual revenues." (The newspaper notes that the federal definition of a small business is $6 million.) Trump’s was among over 14,000 companies that received grants totalling $530 million. That includes other firms like the Rockefeller Group, Ford Motors, Dell Inc., Morgan Stanley and the Bank of China. Was the Trump Building impacted by the 9/11? According to Trump, no, though he was likely referring to physical damages. "I have a lot of property down there," he told a German TV reporter after the attack. "But it wasn’t, fortunately, affected by what happened to the World Trade Center." Here’s how Trump responded when the New York Times asked him about the grant in May 2016: "The company received this small amount of money after qualifying, given the limited number of employees working at the property. For many months, I allowed people to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building. I was happy to do it and to this day I am still being thanked for the many people I helped. The value of what I did was far greater than the money talked about." Our ruling Crowley said Trump "cashed in, collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover — even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected." Trump did receive a grant for his building at 40 Wall Street, which was less than a mile away from the Trade Center, but the property was eligible under the grant criteria. He also did say in 2001 that his properties were not affected by the attack, although he likely meant physically. The grant also provided compensation for economic losses.

pomt-13056	Texas spends "more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student."	/texas/statements/2016/nov/18/jennie-lou-leeder/democrat-jennie-lou-leeder-says-texas-spends-more-/	Former teacher Virginia "Jennie Lou" Leeder said during her Texas Senate campaign that she’d like to see the state do more for students. As it is, the District 24 Democratic nominee declared: "We spend more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student." Really? Previous analyses First, we recognize that prisons are 24/7 operations that provide housing, meals, rehabilitation programs and other services for a housed population. Meantime, students in public schools attend classes for roughly eight hours a day, five days a week, for about 180 days each year. Regardless, it’s not uncommon for people to compare prison and school spending as an example of what they consider unbalanced budget priorities. In 2013, for instance, PolitiFact Oregon found True a claim that Oregon was spending about $10,000 a year per student compared with $30,000 per inmate, a move the governor said showed the state prioritized prisons over schools. In 2015, PolitiFact Virginia rated Half True a statement by Sen. Bernie Sanders that it costs more to go to prison than to the University of Virginia. Sanders based his claim on what it costs to house a federal prisoner, but at the state level the cost comes out to be less than a year’s fees to attend the university, particularly if considering out-of-state tuition. Fox News found in 2011 that most states, "despite spending more money overall on education, are spending three to four times more per capita incarcerating prisoners than they are educating students." In July 2016, the U.S. Department of Education released a report that compared the rise in spending on prisons with the rate of spending on public education. The report found that nationwide, public pre-K through grade 12 expenditures went up 107 percent while state and local corrections expenditures increased by 324 percent over a 33-year period. Leeder cites CNN We asked Leeder before she lost to Republican Dawn Buckingham of Lakeway about the basis of her statement as quoted in an October 2016 Austin American-Statesman news article. On Leeder's behalf, Steven Rivas replied by emailing us web links from a briefing book that Rivas said the candidate took on the road to meet with teacher groups. While Leeder’s comment to the American-Statesman didn’t specify if she meant Texas or the nation in saying "we," the provided web links focused on Texas. Among Leeder's offerings: A May 2013 CNN Money infographic, "Education vs prison costs," indicating that nationally in 2012, every state spent more to hold inmates than it did on educating students with New York having the biggest dollar difference, spending about $40,000 more per inmate per year, and Kentucky appearing to have the smallest difference, annually spending $6,000 more per inmate. In Texas, according to the graphic, the year’s cost per student hovered below $10,000 while the cost per inmate landed near $20,000. We learned from a CNN footnote that the per-student spending figures came from the Census Bureau and the costs per inmate traced from the Vera Institute, a New York-based nonprofit research group that says it’s focused on ending mass incarceration. Scarlet Neath, an institute spokeswoman, responded to our email inquiry with links to a 2012 report, "The Price of Prisons." In the report, researchers calculated the cost of incarceration to taxpayers, accounting for expenses such as employee benefits, pension contributions and capital costs through a survey of 40 states. According to its Texas assessment, the state spent $3.3 billion on prisons in fiscal 2010, which ran through August 2010, or $21,390 per inmate--or, in keeping with Leeder’s "per day" statement, $58.60 a day. Then again, that was six-plus years ago. Updated Texas spending To get an up-to-date grasp on Leeder’s comparison, we started by eliciting figures from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the agency tasked with running state prisons and jails. In 2012, the agency had an operating budget of $3,087,899,321, and there were 152,303 offenders incarcerated, agency spokesman Jason Clark told us by email. Based on these numbers, the fiscal 2012 per inmate cost boiled out to $20,275, or $55.55 per day. Clark told us the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on fiscal matters, reaches its own estimates of such per-day costs. Clark pointed us to the board’s 2013 Criminal Justice Uniform Cost Report, which says that the state spent $50.04 per day per prisoner in fiscal 2012. The report says that figure reflects the costs of programs offered at specific prison units, such as sex offender or substance abuse treatment. Next, we searched the Census Bureau website to find its breakdown of per student state, federal and local education spending. In the latest analysis, a 2016 report called "Public Education Finances," Texas was shown to spend $8,593 per student in fiscal 2014. To reach a per-day cost, we divided that figure by 180, the minimum number of days in a Texas school year--getting an estimated daily cost of $47.73 per student. A web search led us to a similar 2016 report, from the National Education Association, a teacher labor union, that cited bureau figures for state, federal and local spending to estimate the annual per student cost in 2015 for Texas at $8,935, which breaks out to $49.64 per day, we found. Next, we pursued spending figures from the Texas Education Agency. According to the agency’s online database, the 2011-2012 school year’s budget for all school districts totaled $49,623,331,143. Districts spent $9,969 per student that year, according to the agency’s calculation, that divided the state’s total revenue for school districts by the total number of students, except for those taught for less than two hours per day that year. That total comes out to a per day cost of $55.38, we calculated. Upshot: Breaking down annual spending to expenditures per day tightens the usual prison-education comparison. That is, the $55.38 that Texas spent on average to schoolchildren in 2011-12 is very close to our estimate that the state ponied up $55.55 a day in 2012 for state prisons. For perspective on the comparison, we reached Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University school finance expert, who told us there’s research that suggests higher educational attainment can reduce the likelihood of crime, yet in her view that’s not an argument for unconstrained education spending. "To argue that spending on schools should increase requires, in my mind, a description of what you expect schools to accomplish with the extra cash," she said. Our ruling Leeder said Texas spends "more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student." This contention holds up if you divide total costs for prisons versus schools by the 365 days in a year. It’s also narrowly so--by 17 cents a day in 2012, we found--if you limit the school part of Leeder’s comparison to the 180 days in a Texas school year. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-02595	Says Alex Sink supported "more taxes on water and TV."	/florida/statements/2014/jan/27/national-republican-congressional-committee/alex-sink-supported-more-taxes-water-and-tv-nrcc-s/	Democrats and Republicans have drawn the battle lines for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat, with candidates’ backgrounds serving as ammunition. While Democrats go after David Jolly’s history as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C., the GOP is attacking Alex Sink’s record on issues in Florida. One oft-repeated charge is that Sink is a "tax and spender Florida can’t afford." In a TV commercial released on Jan. 22, 2014, the National Republican Congressional Committee charges that Sink supports Obamacare, then adds charges about her stance on taxes. "Sink has supported higher taxes, too," the ad says. "Higher property taxes. Higher sales taxes. More taxes on water and TV too." Sink, a former banking executive, only held one elected office -- Florida’s chief financial officer from 2007 to 2010 -- so we weren’t sure whether it was accurate that she supported higher taxes "on water and TV." And since both are important to her prospective constituents, we decided to tune in focus on that claim in this item. An old problem The NRCC’s claim stems from Sink’s tenure on the Governor's Commission on Education, back in 1997. The bipartisan group of educators, business leaders and lawmakers was co-chaired by Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, a Democrat, and Jack Critchfield, a Republican and chairman of Florida Progress Corp. Sink, then president of the Florida Banking Group for NationsBank, was joined on the board by executives of such companies as Walt Disney Attractions, Eckerd Corp. and CSX Transportation. The group, appointed by Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles in 1996, had no legislative power, but it did make recommendations about how to pay for school construction at a time when overcrowding was plaguing some districts. Faced with full schools and outdated facilities, one topic that drew the board’s attention was searching for ways to build more classroom space. One of the commission’s potential solutions was unveiled in February 1997: Expand a 2.5 percent utilities tax on the gross receipts of electricity, natural and manufactured gas and telecommunication services to include water, sewer, cable and solid waste utilities. The group proposed instituting the new tax on those utilities in 0.5 percent increments over five years, which would eventually cost the average household $24 per year, and would raise millions for school construction. Sink was in favor of instituting the entire tax all at once, rather than over the course of five years. Lawmakers opposed this, especially House Republicans, who in 1997 held a majority in that wing of the Legislature for the first time in 122 years. "We ought to say we have a crisis, and this is what we really think should happen," Sink said. "If the politics go the other way, so be it." The idea of instituting the tax all at once failed in a vote by the commissioners, 18-12. The group spent the rest of the year looking for other solutions, including a video lottery and a variety of local taxes. Ultimately, all was for naught, as the divided Legislature debated new taxes without coming to an agreement during the regular session. Chiles called a special session in the fall to deal with the school construction issue, with lawmakers eventually agreeing to use Florida lottery profits for $2.5 billion in bonds, plus $200 million from surplus revenues. That lottery money amounted to $180 million per year over 30 years. The deal was considered a victory by both Democrats and Republicans, since it built new schools without relying on new taxes. Our ruling The NRCC said Alex Sink supported "more taxes on water and TV" in the past. She did indeed support such taxes, though that happened during her tenure on an advisory panel 17 years ago. Sink didn’t have any control over the state’s tax structure, either then or in her future job as the state’s chief financial officer. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-09545	"For the hour after the (Jan. 14) debate, 'Debra Medina' was the No. 1 search on Google and for the remainder of that night No. 3."	/texas/statements/2010/feb/05/debra-medina/debra-medina-says-her-name-was-no-1-search-night-f/	Debra Medina, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, was little known going into a televised Jan. 14 debate with her well-known GOP opponents, Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. But the Wharton businesswoman, making her first run for public office, generated waves of curiosity that night. Medina subsequently told a reporter for Dallas radio station KERA: "For the hour after after the debate, 'Debra Medina' was the No. 1 search on Google and for the remainder of the night No. 3." For real? We looked into her claim. Medina's campaign didn't respond to our requests to visit about her statement. A spokesman for Google said the company doesn't reveal top searches for particular days or on an hour-by-hour basis, so he couldn't speak to whether Medina was the No. 1 or No. 3 search term the night of the first debate. He guided us to Google's online Insights for Search feature, though, which calculates interest in topics over longer time periods. For most of January into early February, according to the Insights' tool, the top searched items on Google in the United States included Facebook, YouTube and Yahoo. The top-50 most-searched items were rounded out by Amazon, ESPN and AOL. Our check for searches under Medina's name for the time period showed that Web interest in her spiked twice in January, both times in connection with televised GOP gubernatorial debates, including the first debate Jan. 14. Kate Morris, an Austin search-engine marketer, told us it's possible that when she made her claim, Medina was referring to the Jan. 14 spike in interest instead of the total number of searches of her name. That explanation made sense after we checked with Google Trends, an online tool that can track how interest in a search topic changes within a given time frame. Overall, we learned, "Debra Medina" was the 13th "fastest-rising" search in the United States on Google Jan. 14, spiking into what Google Trends calls the "Volcanic" range, its highest indicator of intensified interest. Searches for her name started to climb at 6 p.m., an hour before the one-hour debate started, cresting as the debate ended. Separately, Morris pointed us to a non-Google site based in India that she said indicates Medina was the No. 3 fastest-rising search item nationally as of about 10 p.m. on the debate night. Google's Insights for Search feature suggests that during January, online interest in Medina in Texas rose more than for the state's other major gubernatorial candidates. Medina's name was searched for 20 times for every 14 searches for Perry and 11 searches for Hutchison. By comparison, the names of Democratic hopefuls Bill White and Farouk Shami were searched for eight and seven times, respectively, for every 20 searches for Medina. Google spokesman Galen Panger, looking over Medina's surge statistics, said Medina may well have been the nation's "hottest search" on debate night, meaning she enjoyed a sudden increase in searches. But that's a big difference from being No. 1 in total searches -- especially when compared to oft-used terms like Facebook. Perhaps Medina misspoke to the radio reporter or exaggerated her search ranking on Google. Despite our requests, her campaign never produced evidence to shore up her claim. Medina enjoyed a spurt of debate-night interest that may have extended through the month. Yet we couldn't find proof her name was the No. 1 or No. 3 search term that evening--and Morris, the Austin expert, said that's surely not so. We rate Medina's statement as False.

pomt-14475	"Texas is home to millions of Latinas, but the state has never elected a Latina to Congress."	/texas/statements/2016/feb/29/stephanie-schriock/emilys-list-leader-correct-texas-home-millions-lat/	EMILY’s List, the national Democratic group that backs "pro-choice" women running for office, endorsed former Hidalgo County Democratic Party Chairwoman Dolly Elizondo in the crowded March 2016 primary field for Texas’ 15th Congressional District. Elizondo is one of six Democratic candidates vying to replace retiring Rep. Rubén Hinojosa of Mercedes in the South Texas district. EMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock praised Elizondo’s record, according to a Feb. 1, 2016, Texas Tribune news story, and also suggested a greater significance to Elizondo’s candidacy. "Texas is home to millions of Latinas," Schriock said, "but the state has never elected a Latina to Congress." Is all of that so? Latina population To get a sense of Latina Texans, we reached out to the Office of the Texas State Demographer, which by email provided us with a few different data sets. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s one-year survey, Texas’ Hispanic or Latino population in 2014 numbered 10.4 million--with the female Hispanic population that year totaling nearly 5.2 million residents. Put another way, Latinos comprised about 39 percent of the state’s nearly 27 million residents in 2014, per the bureau, with Latinas accounting for 19 percent of residents. The Texas State Data Center’s own most recent population estimate, for 2013, put the female Hispanic population at 5.1 million, and the entire Hispanic population at 10.3 million. It’s worth noting that that number included nearly 1.7 million minors. Upshot: Texas has lately been home to more than 5 million Latinas. Texas representatives To check Texas’ history of congressional representation, we asked EMILY’s List for its backup for Schriock’s statement. A spokeswoman, Rachel Thomas, said by email that Texas through history has elected three women of color to the House and none to the Senate--and each of the elected women were African-American. A web search led us to a searchable history of women in Congress, also cited by Thomas, posted at history.house.gov. That history showed that through 2015, Texas, a state since 1845, had elected seven women to the House, including current Republican Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth and Democratic Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Dallas and Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston. Historically, too, four of Texas’ congresswomen were white, three were black. According to a similar history of Hispanic Americans in Congress on the House website: --Seventeen Hispanic Texans, all men, have won election to Congress including current Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Houston as well as Republican Rep. Bill Flores of Bryan and Democratic Reps. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio, Henry Cuellar of Laredo, Filemon Vela of Brownsville, and Hinojosa, whose seat Elizondo seeks. --The first Latino elected to the House from Texas was Henry B. González of San Antonio, who served from 1961 into early 1999. With 37 years in the House, he also was the longest-serving Hispanic member of Congress. --The first woman to represent Texas was Lera Millard Thomas of Nacogdoches, a Democrat who won 74 percent of the vote in a special election to serve out nine months remaining in her husband Albert Richard Thomas’ term upon his death in 1966. The first woman of color to represent Texas was Houston’s Barbara Jordan, who was elected to the House in 1973 with 81 percent of the vote and served until 1979. --Nationally, 107 Latinos and 313 women have served in Congress, counting 11 Latinas. --The 11 Latinas to have served in Congress -- all in the House: Washington Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, Florida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, New Mexico Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham, New York Democrat Nydia M. Velázquez, and California Democrats Grace Flores Napolitano, Gloria Negrette McLeod, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Loretta Sanchez, Linda T. Sánchez, Hilda L. Solis and Norma Judith Torres. All except McLeod and Solis are currently serving in the House. Our ruling EMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock said: "Texas is home to millions of Latinas, but the state has never elected a Latina to Congress." Of late, more than 5 million Latinas live in Texas, whose voters have historically sent 17 Hispanic men to Congress including one to the Senate--but no Latinas. We rate this claim True.

pomt-10401	"Fidel Castro endorses Obama."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/05/republican-party-florida/castro-not-stumping-for-obama/	The subject line of an e-mail from the Republican Party of Florida was designed to grab attention: "Fidel Castro endorses Obama." Inside is a doctored (read: fake) image of Castro holding a poster of Obama. Above Castro are the words, "I love this guy!" A link in the e-mail sends you to an article that states that Castro gave Obama "a qualified endorsement," calling him "the most advanced candidate" in a commentary published in a Communist newspaper on May 26, 2008. The absurdity of this claim is demonstrated by the very headline of Castro's article: "The empire's hypocritical politics." In the article, Castro actually spends most of his words criticizing a speech Obama made to the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami just a few days before, on May 23. In that speech, Obama pledged that if elected, he would immediately allow unlimited family travel to Cuba and family members to send money to relatives in Cuba. Obama reiterated his position that he would meet with the leaders of enemy nations without preconditions. But the thing that really raised Castro's ire was Obama's vow to maintain the embargo as "leverage" to encourage Cuba to "take significant steps towards democracy." Here was Castro's assessment: "I feel no resentment towards him (Obama), for he is not responsible for the crimes perpetrated against Cuba and humanity. Were I to defend him, I would do his adversaries an enormous favor. I have therefore no reservations about criticizing him and about expressing my points of view on his words frankly." Yes, Castro says Obama is "doubtless, from the social and human points of view, the most progressive candidate to the U.S. presidency." Castro also praises Obama's "great intelligence, his debating skills and work ethic." But it amounts to lesser-of-two-evils praise, at best. For example, Castro later calls the embargo that Obama pledged to maintain "an act of genocide." Said Castro: "Presidential candidate Obama's speech may be formulated as follows: hunger for the nation, remittances as charitable handouts and visits to Cuba as propaganda for consumerism and the unsustainable way of life behind it." Not exactly a warm and fuzzy endorsement. Katie Gordon, press secretary for the Republican Party of Florida, said the whole thing was a joke. The "cartoon" image, she said, was not meant to be taken literally. "It was our way of finding a creative way to illustrate a larger point," Gordon said. "The idea is that Sen. Barack Obama has expressed numerous times his willingness to sit down with the leaders of Communist regimes." While Castro did not literally endorse Obama, she said, the point is that Castro stated that "of the people running for president, he (Obama) is the one he'd prefer to work with." But Castro never says that in his commentary. Gordon said she doesn't think the image or the headline caused any confusion. The e-mail isn't trying to say that Castro "actually" endorsed Obama, she said. Rather, she said, it was used as an attention-getter. First of all, it was not a "cartoon" image. It was a doctored photograph. And a pretty good one. A trained eye, or someone who closely follows Cuban politics, would probably recognize the image as implausible. But it's too realistic-looking to be passed off as a cartoon spoof. And we realize the word "endorse" can have a formal meaning, as well as a generic one. A New York Times blog originally ran a story about Castro's commentary under a headline that read "Castro's stinging endorsement." The story now carries the headline "Castro Weighs In on Obama." An update notes: "The headline was altered to avoid the misinterpretation that Mr. Castro's remarks represented a formal endorsement." But we don't think Castro's commentary even amounts to a generic "endorsement." The RPOF makes our call on this one easy. Even its press secretary acknowledged the claim that Castro endorsed Obama is not accurate. She said it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. We're all for keeping a sense of humor in this long election season. But there are better ways to get people's attention than to distort facts. And this comes off less like a joke and more like an intentional smear. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-05037	The health care law could cost up to $2 trillion, "double what we were promised."	/florida/statements/2012/jul/11/american-commitment/tv-ad-says-health-laws-cost-2-trillion-double-what/	A new ad attacks Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., on the health care law and claims to have "the facts." Then it trots out a series of distortions. "Florida patients and seniors deserve to know what are the facts about President Barack Obama’s health care law," the ad says. "Fact: Bill Nelson was the deciding vote. The bill could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised. Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage. Tell Bill Nelson: Protect Florida patients, repeal the health care law." The ad is from an outside spending group called American Commitment, which says on its website that it supports "free markets, economic growth, constitutionally limited government, property rights, and individual freedom." It’s a 501(c)4, so it doesn’t have to disclose its donors. (For more details about American Commitment’s connections and spending, check out this report from the Washington Post.) We fact-checked several of the ad’s claims: that Nelson was the deciding vote on health care (Mostly False) and that the law "imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class" (Pants on Fire.) Previously, we've also looked at claims about cutting $500 billion from Medicare (Mostly False) and millions losing coverage (False). Here, we’ll examine the claim that the law "could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised." We asked American Commitment for evidence for its charges, but we didn’t hear back. Tiny print that flashes by on the screen -- we read it only by pausing the YouTube video -- says the claim is from "Congressional Budget Office Estimate." Even though American Commitment didn’t respond to our queries, we easily found similar statements about the health care law costing up to $2 trillion. Though the claim is repeated often, it’s not accurate. First, some background on the Congressional Budget Office. It’s a nonpartisan, widely respected agency with an expert staff that generates projections and reports about how proposed laws affect the federal budget. It works with another agency, the Joint Committee on Taxation, that is charged with looking at the effects of various taxes on the federal budget. The Congressional Budget Office is not always right in its projections. In recent years, for example, it overestimated how much it would cost to cover prescription drugs for seniors in Medicare. The program actually came in under projections. But for claims about federal spending, we consider the Congressional Budget Office, often called the CBO, to be the standard by which we fact-check claims. The CBO updates its reports and projections from time to time, and one of its updates on the health care law was released March 14, 2012. In that report, the CBO increased its projections of the costs under the new law. Most of the costs will come in the form of tax credits to help people of modest income buy health insurance, or in outright spending to enroll the poor in Medicaid, a government-run insurance program. Critics of the law seized on the line from the report that the law’s "provisions related to insurance coverage are now projected to have a net cost of $1,252 billion over the 2012-2022 period; that amount represents a gross cost to the federal government of $1,762 billion." (Read the CBO’s update for yourself.) The ad upgrades that $1,762 billion, or $1.762 trillion to $2 trillion. In this case, we won’t quibble about $240 billion, because the $1.76 trillion number itself is extreme cherry-picking. It doesn’t account for the law’s tax increases, spending cuts or other cost-saving measures. In fact, the CBO has said that overall the health care bill actually reduces government spending by about $124 billion over 10 years. Still, this $1.76 trillion number gained traction quickly and started spreading around the Internet and into comments from the law’s opponents. The Congressional Budget Office soon released a statement to set the record straight. Here’s part of what it said: CBO released two reports this week related to the analysis of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) conducted by CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). One report presented updated estimates for the insurance coverage provisions of the ACA, and the other responded to questions we’ve received regarding the effects of the ACA on employment-based health insurance. Some of the commentary on those reports has suggested that CBO and JCT have changed their estimates of the effects of the ACA to a significant degree. That’s not our perspective. ... For the provisions of the Affordable Care Act related to health insurance coverage, CBO and JCT’s latest estimates are quite similar to the estimates we released when the legislation was being considered in March 2010. After the U.S. Supreme Court found the health care law constitutional, the CBO announced it would revise its findings on the health care law. Those findings are scheduled for release during the week of July 23, 2012. Finally, our fellow fact-checkers at FactCheck.org created their own set of estimates, specifically comparing the CBO’s original set of gross-cost estimates from 2010 with the estimates released in 2012. FactCheck.org found the estimates increased by 8.6 percent -- a far cry from doubling. Our ruling The TV ad says that the health care law "could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised." Actually, only part of the health care law -- the gross costs -- could cost up to $1.76 trillion. That’s only a slight increase from what was originally promised -- not close to double. The number also doesn’t account for the portions of the law that pay for that spending, both new taxes and cost reductions. The ad’s source -- the Congressional Budget Office -- specifically rebutted the charge that the costs had doubled, and they issued that rebuttal months ago. The CBO said that its latest estimates "are quite similar to the estimates we released when the legislation was being considered in March 2010." We rate this statement False. Update: This report has been corrected to clarify the projections of gross costs as distinct from the insurance coverage provisions. The rating remains the same.

pomt-04618	The significant drop in Florida’s unemployment rate is a good economic sign.	/florida/statements/2012/sep/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-brags-about-floridas-declining-unemploy/	The competitive businessman in Gov. Rick Scott wants Florida to be No. 1 for jobs. By most measures it’s not, and in at least one area it’s dead last. But what about its declining unemployment rate? Scott often points to this measure as evidence the state is headed in the right direction. In August, when monthly jobs numbers showed the state lost 3,300 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.8 percent, Scott’s office found something nice to trumpet: Over the past 20 months (when Scott took office), the unemployment rate fell faster in Florida than in any other state. Scott repeated the claim a month later at a Sept. 13, 2012, board meeting of Enterprise Florida, the official economic development organization of the state of Florida. "We have every reason to brag about what’s going on in our state," he said. "If you look at the fastest drop in unemployment, it’s down 2.3 (percentage points) in the last 20 months." We’ve heard conflicting reports about Florida’s job creation record, so Scott’s argument that the state’s falling unemployment rate is brag-worthy piqued our interest. His math is right. Since December 2010, the month before he took office, it has fallen 2.3 points to 8.8 percent in July, which is still above the national August unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. Is such a feat really good for Florida, though? Economists don’t share Scott’s sunny perspective. Cheering the decline overlooks the real reason for it: a labor force contracted by the departure of thousands of workers, many of whom simply gave up looking for work. "What we’re seeing is that our participation in the labor force is declining," said Amy Baker, the Florida Legislature’s top economist, at a Sept. 12, 2012, meeting. "And because it’s declining, that’s really leading to much of the improvement -- in the month of July, about 91 percent of the improvement -- in the unemployment rate." A September 2012 report by Baker’s team at the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, highlighted the same trend: dropping unemployment rate caused not by job creation, but almost exclusively by a shrinking workforce. People tend to leave the labor force when they become discouraged with the process of trying to find work. Florida ranks last in the nation when it comes to long-term unemployment, so economists say the shrinking labor force is a natural result. More than half of the 816,000 jobless people in Florida have been looking for work for six months or more, a new national record, according to a recent Florida International University study. "The conditions of the labor market have been dire for so long that many people have dropped out of the labor force," reads the FIU report, which highlights several areas where Florida’s recovery is lagging the national pace. "Labor force participation rates keep plummeting even though we are three years into the recovery." Absent the labor pool’s contraction, the unemployment rate would be 9.8 percent, Baker’s report found. A report from Scott's Department of Economic Opportunity found that if the state's 94,100 discouraged workers were added to the unemployment rolls, the jobless rate would be 9.7 percent. That’s because Florida’s job growth rate has been mediocre when compared to other states. The state has added 69,900 jobs in the last 12 months, a growth rate of less than 1 percent. This growth is slower than the national pace; Florida ranks 28th in the nation. For comparison, high-growth states like California and Texas have created 365,000 jobs and 222,500 jobs, respectively, over the same period. California and Texas are two of 13 states currently growing jobs twice as fast as Florida. It's not always a good sign when a state sees a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, said Sean Snaith, an economist with the University of Central Florida. "You need strong economic growth to bring down rapidly the unemployment rate in the way we want to see it decline, and we haven’t seen that strong economic growth," he said. "This is the contradiction in the unemployment rate: Just because it’s going down, doesn’t mean it’s good news." We reached out to Scott’s press office and a spokesperson referred us to the Department of Economic Opportunity. A DEO spokesperson said the workforce is shrinking due to a high population of retirees and a large number of seasonal workers. When pressed for more specific figures to back up those claims, the spokesperson declined to answer and ultimately referred us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our ruling Scott reassured Florida’s economic development leaders, "We have every reason to brag about what’s going on in our state." We found his example of the plummeting unemployment rate over 20 months is not something to tout. Experts say the reasons behind the drop are mostly grim: Thousands of discouraged workers have given up on finding work in Florida. The shrinking workforce can be attributed to a number of factors, but the fact that Florida is last in the nation when it comes to long-term unemployment can’t be ignored. A major factor in the drop in unemployment is the exodus of people who have simply given up looking for work. Job creation, meanwhile, has been below-average. So is the unemployment rate decline a positive economic sign for Florida? We say Mostly False. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election. See video fact-checks here.

pomt-05602	"Right now we have sufficient reserves to take care of Tennessee's lottery scholarship students for a few years more."	/tennessee/statements/2012/mar/29/dolores-gresham/leader-education-committee-claims-lottery-deficits/	It’s been one of the most controversial issues in this year’s session of the Tennessee legislature: a bill by Republican legislators to raise eligibility requirements for the full $4,000-a-year basic Hope Scholarship funded by the state’s lottery. Since the program began in 2004, Tennessee high school graduates have qualified by achieving either a minimum 3.0 high school grade-point average or a minimum 21 ACT composite score. The bill as originally proposed would require students to achieve both standards to qualify for the full $4,000 annual grant at four-year schools, starting in the fall of 2015. Those who achieve one of the two standards, but not both, would still receive $2,000 a year, which they could use at four-year universities or two-year community colleges. State Sen. Dolores Gresham, R-Somerville, the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, has massaged the bill several times. The bill is still working its way through the legislature, but the most recent version contains a "trigger" provision that puts the new standards into place with freshmen entering college in the fall of 2015 if lottery proceeds for the Hope Scholarship program don’t increase by at least $10 million this year and continue increasing each year through fiscal year 2014. If lottery proceeds don’t increase accordingly, the new standards for the scholarships go into effect. The most oft-stated reason for the bill by Gresham and House sponsor Harry Brooks, R-Knoxville, is to close a deficit between the annual costs of the scholarship program and the proceeds earmarked for it from the Tennessee Lottery. The annual operating deficits do exist, but on Feb. 29, when pressed by reporters citing improving lottery revenues, Gresham took it one step further and warned that the lottery reserve fund could not withstand deficits for very long: "Right now we have sufficient reserves to take care of Tennessee's lottery scholarship students for a few years more." So is Gresham’s claim true? Are yearly deficits so severe the lottery reserve fund could soon run out of money? First, let’s consider the reserve fund. Built up in the early years of the Tennessee Lottery as the scholarship program was being phased in, the state’s education lottery reserve fund balance totaled $393.7 million as of Dec. 31, 2011, the last accounting available from the state Department of Finance and Administration. That figure includes about $31 million that is the current fair market value of investments in the fund whose income won’t be realized until the investments are sold, so state budget planners back that out of the total and report, for accounting purposes, an adjusted reserve fund balance at about $362.7 million. Concern first arose over deficits in the annual operations of the scholarship program in 2009, when the financial collapse and recession coincided with a 2008 expansion of the scholarship program and the use of $24 million in lottery proceeds on the state’s pre-kindergarten program. That pushed total spending in scholarship, pre-K and some administrative costs in Fiscal Year 2008-09 to $294.8 million, when the lottery’s proceeds for those purposes totaled $285.5 million. To close the books on that year, the state dipped into the Lottery for Education reserve fund for the first time, by about $9.3 million. The annual deficit dropped to $5.7 million the following year, and was $8 million in the fiscal year that ended last June 30, according to Tennessee Higher Education Commission figures*. What about projected operating deficits? Last fall, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission made projections for the Senate’s Lottery Stabilization Task Force that showed the largest annual operating deficits would be for this year, about $29 million, and next year, about $25 million. That sharp rise is mostly related to the 2011 act allowing the scholarships to be used for summer college classes, starting this summer. The THEC projections then showed deficits dropping after 2013, mainly because that’s when a new cap is fully phased in that cuts off scholarship grants after a student has achieved 120 semester hours. Still, even by last fall’s THEC projections, the state’s lottery reserve fund could adequately sustain the program well into the 2020s. But recent rosy lottery figures indicate that actual operating deficits will be smaller than those THEC projections. Lottery President and CEO Rebecca Hargrove presented new figures on Feb. 29 showing record sales and education proceeds, and she predicted that lottery proceeds for the scholarship program will be up at least $10 million this year. Using those new lottery forecasts combined with the December THEC projections -- lottery sales have set new records every month of fiscal year 2012 which began in July 1 -- PolitiFact Tennessee estimates that in the 2020-21 academic year, there may actually be a $2.2 million operating surplus in the scholarship program. And at that point, we calculate the reserve fund would stand at about $262 million. Sen. Gresham made her remarks about there being only "a few years more" of reserve cushion immediately after Hargrove’s presentation -- saying she preferred to press ahead with the higher eligibility standards. THEC estimates that those higher standards will trim between $17 million and $20 million a year from the scholarship program’s costs, because it cuts the number of students who qualify for the full $4,000 annual award. But in addition to those savings, her bill recommends a $10 million increase in the funding flowing from lottery proceeds (in this case, the reserve fund) to the need-based Tennessee Student Assistance grants annually for the next 10 years. That cuts the annual savings about in half. Our ruling In pushing for more stringent standards for students to qualify for the state’s lottery scholarships, Gresham said recently recurring deficits in the program could only be sustained for "a few years more." For Tennessee’s huge lottery reserve fund to be depleted would mean exponentially unprecedented deficits that are not seen by even the most pessimistic of projections. Gresham’s claim is unsupported by the numbers and we rule it False. ---------------------------------------- * None of the figures in this article include $10 million to $12 million a year in Tennessee Lottery unclaimed prize proceeds that are placed into a separate account exclusively for after-school programs in the elementary grades.

pomt-10206	On whether global warming is man-made.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/12/sarah-palin/earlier-she-didnt-attribute-it-to-being-man-made/	In her first major news interview since being named the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party, Sarah Palin answered questions from journalist Charles Gibson about her thoughts on climate change. Gibson prefaced his question by saying that Palin, before being selected for the ticket, had said global warming was not caused by human activities. That would conflict with the views of her running mate John McCain. "Do you still believe that global warming is not man-made?" Gibson asked. "I believe that man's activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming, climate change," Palin said. "Regardless of that, John McCain and I agree that we gotta do something about it, and we have to make sure that we're doing all we can to cut down on pollution. ... After a followup question, she said: "I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now." Gibson said he detected a change in her position, but Palin said she hadn't. "Show me where I've ever said that there's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any effect or no effect on climate change. I have not said that. I have said that my belief is there is a cyclical nature of our planet — warming trends, cooling trends." We looked for Palin's previous statements on global warming. Earlier this year, she gave an interview to the Web site Newsmax, which ran the following brief exchange with Palin. Question: "What is your take on global warming and how is it affecting our country?" Palin: "A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made." She also gave an interview to a Fairbanks newspaper in December 2007, discussing her first year as governor. The story states: "A few months into her term, Palin directed a group of state commissioners to develop a strategy for addressing climate change. State lawmakers had already formed a climate commission, but the administration up until then had nothing. "'I'm not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity,' Palin said Monday, 'but I'm not going to put my head in the sand and pretend there aren't changes.'" Those are two clear statements that Palin didn't believe that human activity contributed to global warming. She agreed that global warming was real but implied that it had non-human causes. In her interview with Gibson, she said that "man's activities certainly can be contributing." We rule this one a Full Flop.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-09-12T00:00:00	2008-09-11	['None']
pomt-00012	"In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/08/donald-trump/were-gops-house-losses-dramatically-smaller-histor/	In recent midterm elections when presidents faced a backlash from voters, the president accepted their brushback. In 2006, George W. Bush acknowledged a "thumping" by Democrats. In 2010, Barack Obama said he’d been delivered a "shellacking" by Republicans. By contrast, when President Donald Trump addressed the results of the 2018 midterms -- when his party lost at least 31 seats and control of the House -- he focused primarily on Republicans’ ability to flip at least three seats in the Senate. "It was a big day yesterday," he said. "Incredible day. And last night the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House." (Officially, Republicans currently have the same number of seats in the Senate -- 51 -- with three races still undecided in Mississippi, Florida and Arizona. You can read more about that in a separate fact-check.) Later in the day-after press conference, Trump said, "In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents and overcame a historic number of retirements. The most House Republican retirements in 88 years -- 43 House Republicans retired." The Republicans did have to cope with many retirements, which in 2018 reached a high for Republicans going back at least as far as 1930. But Trump is wrong that the Republicans outperformed historical precedents. The losses were fairly average or worse than average. Here is the data for midterm losses for the president’s party going back to the Civil War. The 2018 figure is in green. We have set it for 31 net-seats-gained that were confirmed by Nov. 8. This number could grow a bit as about a dozen races are yet to be called, and a Democrat is leading in five of those uncalled races. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com If we ignore the small number of years in which the president’s party gained seats in the House, the average loss going back to 1862 is 38 seats and the median loss is 30 seats. That may make the loss of at least 31 seats in 2018 seem pretty average -- though even there it would be wrong to say, as Trump did, that 2018 represented a dramatic overperformance. It would even be worse if Democrats end up winning the five uncalled contests where they are currently ahead. More problematic is that the swings in recent years have been much smaller. Going back to 1970, the average midterm loss for the president’s party has been 23 seats, and the median loss has been 14 seats. By this standard, a loss of 31 seats (or more) looks pretty substantial. Indeed, if you look just at losses suffered under Republican presidents, the total for 2018 exceeds all but two midterms going back to the Great Depression. The 2018 total even edged out the losses under George W. Bush in 2006, which was the last time the Democrats re-took the House in a midterm election. "This one was clearly pretty bad," said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. And while the Republican outlook in the House was indeed harmed by retirements, as Trump said, the GOP conversely benefited from district lines that were drawn largely by Republicans following the 2010 Census. "Republican gerrymanders likely minimized the damage, preventing even more GOP losses," said Costas Panagopoulos, a political scientist at Northeastern University. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said, "In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents." That’s not what the numbers currently show, and the GOP’s position in the House is likely to end up worse as the outstanding races are called. If you look all the way back to the Civil War era, the expected GOP losses are in line with the long-term historical average -- not a dramatic overperformance. And if you look at the patterns typical over the last 50 years, the projected losses for 2018 are one-third higher than the average losses and more than double the median losses during that period. We rate the statement False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-11-08T15:55:03	2018-11-07	['None']
pomt-01573	Says Mary Burke’s Madison school district "will be the only school district left in the state" to "ignore the (Act 10) law" in the 2015-16 school year.	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-madison-school-district-only-one/	Mary Burke’s position as a member of the Madison Metropolitan School District board has played a minimal role in the governor’s race so far. Gov. Scott Walker tried to change that Sept. 3, 2014, calling on Burke and the board to find savings by using his signature Act 10, which dramatically curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees, including those of the district. In a campaign news release, Walker said Madison "will be the only school district left in the state out of 424 to ignore the law and not take advantage of Governor Walker’s reforms into the 2015-16 school year." Walker was playing off the fact the Madison board in 2014 signed a far-reaching contract with its teachers union despite the fact that Act 10 only allows for limited negotiations on base wages. Burke, who opposed Act 10 and who supported negotiating with school district employees, countered that the Madison district is being fiscally responsible, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. Is Madison the sole district in the state with such a contract for 2015-’16? And does that mean the district is ignoring Act 10? To back the claim, the Walker campaign pointed us to a Madison Teachers Inc. flier on contract negotiations that said only seven of the state’s public school districts "have contracts for the current school year, and MTI is the only union to have contracts for 2014-15, and now, upon ratification, for 2015-16." In our research, we were told by multiple officials there is no central repository for school contracts, so definitive proof of Madison’s singular status is lacking. But the Madison teachers union flier is very likely correct, based on our interviews with experts on both sides of this issue. And it makes sense. Act 10 took effect in 2011, and existing labor contracts remained in effect, but most of those have long since expired. Madison’s teachers, however, challenged Act 10 in court and in 2012 won an initial round before a Dane County judge, which opened a window in which technically they were not covered by the provisions of the new law, noted James Scott, chairman of Walker’s Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. The state Supreme Court later upheld the law, in July 2014. During that interim period, the union negotiated a contract with the Madison district that went beyond just base wage changes. The Wisconsin Education Association Council, an umbrella group representing most local teachers unions in Wisconsin, has heard of no other local affiliates with collective-bargaining agreements for 2015-’16, said spokeswoman Christina Brey. AFT-Wisconsin represents some other local unions at school districts. Likewise, it has no locals under collective bargaining agreements for 2015-’16, said Kim Kohlhaas, president of the group. And an official with the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators told us he believes Madison is "the only district that will continue under what would be described as a pre-Act 10 contractual agreement." "In Madison’s case, they continue to adhere to a contract that was bargained with the union prior to Act 10 and that does include all items that were the subjects of that earlier bargain," said Jon Bales, executive director of the administrators group. "Thus, all conditions such as working conditions, transfers, evaluations, etc. – anything that they had negotiated in the past as a part of the contract." So Walker appears to be on firm ground in singling out Madison. Debating the law’s effect But what of his characterization that Madison is ignoring the law? That is, that the district is not taking advantage of the measure’s ability to save costs through unilateral changes in benefits and working conditions. If Walker means the district is disobeying the law, that’s a matter of dispute that has yet to be settled in court. If he means the district is not applying it, there’s some evidence both ways. Madison district officials and Madison Teachers Inc. executive director John Matthews disagree with Walker’s characterization. The union leader notes that employees accepted a 0.25% base-wage increase, well within Act 10, which limits increases to the inflation rate. It was a raise, he said, the district never could have sold to employees before Act 10. And Matthews said the district got authority through Act 10 to change the employees’ health insurance carrier, though the district says ultimately that was done as part of bargaining. Walker, meanwhile, has criticized the district for not using Act 10 to get teachers to contribute to their health insurance premiums, something his law allowed districts to do without bargaining. Madison teachers currently make no contribution to premiums. Additionally, one of Act 10’s provisions was that districts adopt an employee "handbook" spelling out policies that had once been bargained. Madison has not yet done so, although like some other districts it will do so using the union contract as a basis for it. Another provision of Act 10, new deductions from worker paychecks toward pensions, went into effect automatically statewide. The Madison district counters that it has found cost savings by working collaboratively with employees. It believes it was on solid legal ground in negotiating contracts, said Rachel Strauch-Nelson, spokeswoman for the Madison district. One final note: The 2015-’16 year is a ways off, and it’s possible another district could sign a pre-Act 10-style contract before then. Such a move could or would subject a district to legal challenge. Our rating Walker said Mary Burke’s Madison school district "will be the only school district left in the state" to "ignore the (Act 10) law" in the 2015-16 school year. Due to some legal circumstances, Madison stands alone right now with a 2015-’16 contract that has pre-Act 10 elements. The law has affected some elements of district policies nonetheless. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-09-10T05:00:00	2014-09-03	['None']
pomt-01177	"Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis!"	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/08/jesse-ventura/jesse-ventura-says-nazis-pioneered-use-fluoridated/	Were Nazis the first to put fluoride in the water? In a recent interview with Salon.com, Jesse Ventura -- whose varied career has included stints as a professional wrestler, governor of Minnesota, and talk show host -- brought up a topic that’s often been raised by conspiracy theorists. At one point during the interview, Salon asked whether he worries about "the U.S. becoming a fascist state." Here’s what Ventura said: "I worry about it tremendously. We’re forever incorporating Nazi things into our lives. Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis! I don’t particularly like anything the Nazis did too much, and they were the first ones to put fluoride in the water. They tell us, ‘Oh, it’s for your teeth’ and all that — well, isn’t that your parents’ job, to teach you how to brush your teeth and use mouthwash? Why do you need the government putting some type of chemical in your water? I don’t know if you know this [but] fluoride is the main component of Prozac! What you’ve got is people drinking Prozac-water. Well, what does Prozac do to you? It calms you and dumbs you down so you’re less emotional. There’s a reason for all that stuff; what do we need fluoride in our water for? There’s no reason whatsoever to put chemicals in our water." Ventura’s answer offers us a lot to analyze, but one of his claims -- that "fluoride in the water ... was originally done by the Nazis" -- stood out out to us because PolitiFact Florida debunked this precise claim in 2011. Nazis, who killed millions of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, were known for chemical tests and inhumane medical experiments. Far be it from us to defend them, even in a minor way. But after tracking down the roots of claims about fluoride on the Web, reaching out to Holocaust historians, contacting well-known critics of water fluoridation, and reading book excerpts, magazine articles, and news stories, we concluded that there's no teeth to this claim. With a national celebrity now making the claim, we decided to put it in the spotlight again. Ventura, through a publicist, said he doesn't remember the exact source of the claim but added that he found out about it when he did a show on water conspiracies for his show on the TruTV network. He provided a link to an article on prisonplanet.com, a site run by Alex Jones, a broadcaster who describes himself as a "prominent figure of the 9/11 Truth Movement." "If those facts are false, then the information we received when doing research for the water conspiracy episode was wrong," Ventura told PolitiFact in an email. "Regardless of if the Nazis did it or not, I don't think we should have it in our water. You don't need the government putting chemicals in the water. It's your responsibility to brush your teeth and use mouthwash. I haven't had a house yet with fluoridated water." (He’s only used well water.) If you’re interested in reading a critique of Ventura’s claim that "fluoride is the main component of Prozac," here’s one by the American Academy of Pediatrics. For this fact-check, though, we’ll stick to the claim about the Nazis. *** We’ll begin by noting that this fact-check won't explore the pros and cons of fluoride in your drinking water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the practice one of the greatest public health achievements of the century; at the same time, groups of citizens, scientists among them, have been wary of the practice since the 1950s. When we originally fact-checked this claim, we contacted historian Patricia Heberer-Rice of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, whose expertise is the German medical community, including Holocaust-era experimentation. Most Nazi medical experiments, she told us, had two themes: new drugs and treatments for common battlefield ailments, from war wounds to typhus, and the more infamous effort to underpin Nazi racial ideas, such as Josef Mengele's twin studies. None of the experimentation that she knows of involved fluoride, either for mind control or for healthy teeth. Meanwhile, in the concentration camp system, as in the ghettos, it would have been surprising if fluoride delivery was a focus — in the final few days before liberation, water lines scarcely delivered water. So, would water have been treated just for the Jews? "I can't see it," she said. But she had heard a similar Cold War-era theory. It wasn't about the Nazis fluoridating water. It was the Communists. We re-connected with Heberer-Rice for this fact-check, and she told us that no additional evidence supporting Ventura’s claim had emerged in the three years since our last fact-check. "The first mass fluoridation of drinking water was carried out by the U.S. Public Health Service on a trial basis in certain regions of this country in 1945, with its rapid extension in 1950," she said. "The first interest of German scientists in this approach was in 1949" -- that is, years after the Nazis had been deposed. *** Still, do an Internet search for "fluoride" and "Nazis," and you'll find articles such as "Nazi Connections to Fluoride in America's Drinking Water." The text appears on various sites, and includes the citations "Stephen 1995," and "Bryson 2004." "Stephen 1995" is presumably Ian E. Stephens, author of a 1987 self-published booklet, an extract of which was published in Nexus Magazine in 1995 under the title "Fluoridation: Mind Control for the Masses?" We tracked down a copy of the article from the magazine's website, an alternative Australian publication covering, among other things, "suppressed news, free energy, religious revisionism, conspiracy, the environment, history and ancient mysteries, the mind, UFOs, paranormal and the unexplained." "Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him," says a document quoted in the excerpt. "Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile." "Bryson 2004" is Christopher Bryson, an investigative reporter and television producer who reported on Guatemalan human rights abuses for the BBC World Service, National Public Radio and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in the 1980s, and later wrote a book called The Fluoride Deception. It delves into murky connections between military-industrial fluoride polluters and the early push for public water fluoridation. But even Bryson -- a backer of certain conspiracies involving fluoridation -- isn’t convinced by the Nazi connection. His book mentions Nazis or Nazism fewer than 10 times, and none of the references discuss water fluoridation. "I never came across any documentation or credible information showing that fluoride was used in Nazi death camps," he told us in 2011. *** In 2009, two scientists published a book called The Fluoride Wars: How a Modest Public Health Measure Became America's Longest Running Political Melodrama. The book presents a lively social history of the fluoridation debate in the United States, starting with the fluoridation of the water in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1945. The hydrologists dedicate more than 30 pages to conspiracy theories and their origins. We contacted one of the co-authors in 2011. "The World War II death camp statement is an absurd lie," said Jay Lehr, who has authored or co-authored more than 30 books, most of them self-described "boring science books for scientists." Meanwhile, Paul Connett -- a chemist who directs the anti-fluoridation group Fluoride Action Network and recently co-authored a book called The Case Against Fluoride -- told us in 2011 that the Nazi angle is something that he’s been steering people in his movement away from. "We have done our level best to discourage opponents of fluoridation from using this emotive argument," Connett said. "The historical evidence for this assertion is extremely weak. It is sad that the U.S. media has done such a bad job of educating the public on this issue that it is so easy for crazy ideas to fill the vacuum." Our ruling Ventura said, "Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis!" Two book authors who researched the topic, one a journalist, the other a hydrologist, found no credible evidence of such a connection. A leading anti-fluoridation activist repudiates the story. The most commonly cited Web source for the story was a 16-year-old extract in a fringe Australian publication. And a Holocaust historian we contacted knew of no such project. This claim remains Pants on Fire! Editor's note: This report initially referred to Ventura as a Navy SEAL, something he includes on his ora.tv biography. Readers later pointed out that there’s been a long-running debate on whether Ventura is justified in calling himself a SEAL. For more on his military background, see this story.

pomt-12451	A University of Texas "student pulled out a concealed handgun" on a knife-wielding suspect "and made him back down."	/texas/statements/2017/may/10/blog-posting/pants-fire-claim-university-texas-student-gun-help/	Web posts assert that the May 1, 2017, stabbing attacks at the University of Texas ended after a heroic student pulled out a handgun. A reader inquiry after the incident that left one student dead and three wounded led us to fact-check a May 2, 2017, web post on ihavethetruth.com headlined "Texas Campus Concealed Carry Student Stops Slaughter at UT Austin." That post says: "Eyewitnesses reported that a student pulled out a concealed handgun on the suspect and made him back down, stopping what was heading towards a slaughter! Although Fox has reported the incident, the local media is working real hard on not covering that little fact. Imagine that!" Ihavethetruth.com doesn’t describe itself as a news source--or much otherwise. Its "About" web page says only: "I Have The Truth is where you show up every day for your marching orders." No evidence, newspaper says A day after the site said a student intervened with a gun, the Austin American-Statesman published a news story finding no confirmation that a gun-toting student got involved. The prospect of someone pulling a gun had seemed especially possible because the Texas law allowing individuals with state-issued permits to carry a handgun on public college campuses took effect in August 2016. The American-Statesman story, partly headlined "VIRAL ITEM DEBUNKED," said chatter about a student possibly brandishing a gun to help police end the incident appeared to have originated in an anonymous Twitter feed, whose user posted a screenshot of a conversation thread in which someone – whose name was blurred out – claims to have "grabbed my gun and ... chased the kid briefly." According to the story by reporter Marty Toohey, UT police termed the rumor of help from an armed student false and said they’d found no corroborating evidence, be it video or first-hand accounts. "It’s a rumor and there’s nothing to verify it," campus spokeswoman Cindy Posey said. Meanwhile, the student-with-a-gun account also was trumpeted on the InfoWars web site under the headline "Report: Student with gun stops mass stabbing at University of Texas." Its post pointed to a May 1, 2017, tweet by @TexasRebel56, who appears to have shared a screenshot of a private message of someone – the names of the people on thread are obscured – claiming: "I ran inside and grabbed my gun out (sic) and came back and chased the kid briefly but I wasn’t comfortable shooting because people were around." Also on May 1, a UT student who arrived at the scene after the attack told the American-Statesman that another student told him he had "flashed" a gun at the suspect. But police said they couldn’t confirm that story, adding that it was unlikely based upon the incident's brief timeframe. The same day, UT Student Government Vice President Binna Kim was among those who repeated the rumor, though after sending it via GroupMe she promptly tweeted an apology that stated the rumor had not been confirmed. Police chief a day later At a May 2, 2017, press conference, a reporter asked UT Police Chief David Carter: "There was a rumor on social media that someone with a concealed handgun prevented further attacks. Is there any validity to that?" Carter replied: "So one of the things that bedevils police departments on occasion is the information that comes across social media. "Yes, we’ve heard that," the chief said. "We have no verification of that. I will tell you, if you look at the sequence of events and the timeline, it doesn’t appear likely." Carter said that a minute and a half elapsed between the stabbings and before the student accused of the knife attacks, Kendrex White, was apprehended as he moved toward a campus dormitory knife-in-hand. A day earlier, Carter specified that that about 1:49 p.m. May 1, his department got a call about an individual who "actually attacked or assaulted somebody" near a gym. In less than two minutes, an officer was on the scene. The officer observed the individual walking away from an individual who was down on the ground," Carter said. "He was armed with a large, Bowie-style hunting knife." The officer confronted the man, Carter said, drawing his weapon and ordering the man to the ground. Then the suspect was taken into custody. On May 4, 2017, the debunkists at Snopes.com found "unproven" the idea that a student with a concealed handgun stopped the knife attacks. Then an Associated Press news story, published May 7, 2017, said that during the UT incident, "no gun-toting student or professor pulled a pistol to stop the man in his tracks. No shots were fired and no gun was even drawn until police swarmed in to subdue the suspect." No changes, UT says We asked UT if there were developments since the knife attacks suggesting a student with a gun helped quell the attacker. By email, Shilpa Bakre replied: "This is an incorrect rumor." Bakre said a UTPD officer "took the suspect down and arrested him – no civilians with guns were involved. Police have interviewed over 40 witnesses thus far, as well as reviewed video footage to support this." Our ruling A web blog said a UT student used a concealed gun to help police stop knife attacks on the campus. In a week-plus after the attacks, there were no credible news reports or law-enforcement confirmations of this claim which looks to us like it was bandied by pro-gun advocates presuming or perhaps wishing it was so.

pomt-13657	California’s marijuana legalization initiative, Prop. 64 "allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers."	/california/statements/2016/aug/05/dianne-feinstein/feinsteins-claim-about-prime-time-marijuana-tv-ads/	Editor’s Note: A week after we published our fact check, a Sacramento Superior Court judge ordered campaigns for and against Prop 64 to soften their claims about what the initiative would do. The No on Prop 64 campaign was ordered to change claims similar to Feinstein’s statement at the center of this fact check. Claims such as "marijuana smoking ads will be legal on all broadcast primetime shows" were dialed back to "could be allowed." On the Yes on 64 side, however, the judge ruled there should be "No change" to that campaign’s statement that "Nothing in 64 makes it legal to show marijuana ads on TV. Federal law prohibits it!" We continue to view Feinstein’s claim that Prop 64 "allows" recreational marijuana ads on TV as misleading. Had the senator said Prop 64 could open the door, someday, to recreational marijuana ads on TV, that might have been accurate. We continue to rate her statement Mostly False. Californians will decide in November whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Proposition 64, a much-debated measure on the state’s ballot. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, who opposes Prop 64, says a green light for the initiative could strip away advertising rules and dramatically change what’s seen on TV. Prop 64 "allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers," Feinstein said on July 12, 2016, in a No On Prop. 64 campaign press release. We know Prop 64 would allow Californians to legally smoke pot in their homes, yards and possibly in designated shops where it’s sold and regulated. But would it also lead to marijuana ads on "prime time" TV? Or is Feinstein blowing smoke? We decided to fact-check the senator’s statement. Half-baked claim? Prop 64 is backed by Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Democratic Party. Recreational marijuana is already legal in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. Several states in addition to California are set to decide on legalizing pot in November. Feinstein’s office did not expand on her statement. Instead, it referred us to the No On Prop. 64 campaign. The campaign pointed us to Prop 64’s chapter on advertising and marketing restrictions, specifically Section 26151. It states: "Any advertising or marketing placed in broadcast, cable, radio, print and digital communications shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older, as determined by reliable, up-to-date audience composition data." Wayne Johnson, spokesman for No On Prop. 64, said the 71.6 percent threshold is so low that only a few shows, such as Saturday morning cartoons, would be prohibited from airing marijuana ads. "It’s a ridiculous standard," Johnson said. "It only applies to the tiniest handful of shows." In this photo taken on Thursday, May 26, 2016, Sarah Seiter, curator of the exhibit "Altered State: Marijuana in California" handles a cannabis leaf with gloved hands at the Oakland Museum in Oakland, Calif. Ben Margot / AP Claim ignores federal law TV and legal experts say Feinstein’s statement ignores federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal drug and prohibits advertising it on television. "If Prop 64 passes, nothing will change in terms of what radio and television stations can legally broadcast," said Joe Berry, president of the California Broadcasters Association. "The federal government licenses the radio and TV stations in California. The federal government’s position is that marijuana is an illegal substance. So, it’s illegal to advertise that substance." Berry added: "The stations themselves are federally licensed. So, there is a risk to the license for the station at license renewal." Experts said cable and satellite television services would likely be subject to similar restrictions. They point to Section 843 of the Controlled Substances Act, which specifically prohibits using "communications facilities" to transmit advertisements for the sale of Schedule I drugs, which includes marijuana, heroin and ecstasy, among others. The law was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Nixon in 1970. It defines "communications facilities" as any and all public and private instrumentalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds of all kinds and includes mail, telephone, wire, radio, and all other means of communication." Marijuana leaf (AP photo) Legality a cloudy issue Others say the legality of advertising marijuana on television -- particularly in states that have legalized the drug -- remains cloudy, at best. "There is no (Federal Communications Commission) rule that prohibits such advertisements in states with legalized cannabis," Kathleen Kirby, a media lawyer based in Washington D.C., told PolitiFact California in an email. A spokeswoman at the FCC could not point us to one, and declined to elaborate on the subject. Kirby said several of her clients in states where pot is legal have been approached to run marijuana advertisements. "I don’t say no, but I counsel," regarding the lack of clarity, Kirby told the American Bar Association in an online article. Kirby noted in the December 2015 article that all of her clients had decided to hold off on the ads. She added in her email to PolitiFact California that federal law "would need to change to make accepting such ads risk free. The feds have more or less signaled that they will look the other way, but you never know with changes in administration or even changes in federal prosecutors." No TV ads in other states In recent years, federal drug enforcement authorities have taken a ‘hands-off’ approach on the sale and cultivation of marijuana in states that have legalized and regulated the drug. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll look the other way on federal advertising rules, said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University and editor of the Marijuana Law, Policy and Reform blog. A local TV station in Colorado had planned to run the nation’s first marijuana TV advertisement in 2015, but backed away over concerns about federal rules. Stations have yet to air any marijuana ads on television, Berman said. Those ads would be treated "from a federal regulatory perspective as equivalent to if you were broadcasting (ads for) heroin," the law professor added. The Yes on Proposition 64 campaign filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court in early August demanding what they described as "false and/or misleading statements" -- including the claim about marijuana ads on TV at the center of this fact check -- be removed from the official ballot arguments submitted by the measure’s opponents. Efforts to change federal law are underway. But it’s unclear if, when and how much the law will change. Berman said California’s provisions, if approved through Prop 64, could pave the way for advertising on TV, but only if the federal rules change first. "It ain’t happening anytime soon," he said. "Certainly, it’s not something that’s going to automatically happen based on how California votes this fall." Our ruling California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein recently said the state’s pot legalization initiative "allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers." Proposition 64 includes a provision that marijuana advertisements "shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older." If Feinstein had said Prop 64 helps pave the way for marijuana ads on TV, that might have been accurate. But experts say Feinstein’s claim, as she stated it, is misleading. The federal Controlled Substances Act bans TV stations from advertising illegal substances, including marijuana. There’s an element of truth to Feinstein’s statement: The FCC doesn’t have a rule expressly prohibiting marijuana television ads in states that legalize the drug. And federal authorities could choose to ignore the Controlled Substances Act. Still, the experts we spoke with say California’s Prop 64 will not lift the legal cloud of uncertainty by itself. Feinstein’s statement goes too far. We rate her claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-01477	On opposing legislation that would take away existing health care plans.	/virginia/statements/2014/sep/29/mark-warner/warner-has-mixed-record-protecting-pre-obamacare-i/	Republicans are accusing U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of breaking a promise to Virginians on Obamacare. They point to a videotape Warner posted on Aug. 10, 2009 laying out his qualified support for health care reform. Congress was considering Obamacare at the time and there was loud debate over whether the bill would strip people of health insurance policies they liked and wanted to keep. Warner, a Democrat, vowed he wouldn’t vote for legislation that required such a sacrifice. "Let me make clear, I’m not going to support a health care reform plan that’s going to take away health care that you’ve got right now or a health care plan that you like," he said. Warner went on to vote for Obamacare in December 2009. And last fall, millions of Americans who buy their own insurance were notified their policies were being cancelled because they didn’t meet minimum coverage standards in the law. The videotaped pledge is getting plenty of play this year as Warner seeks reelection. Republican challenger Ed Gillespie posted the video in January with the caption "Senator Mark Warner broke his words to Virginians." During a July 26 debate, Gillespie told Warner his 2009 comments "prove you were wrong" about Obamacare. The Republican Party of Virginia last month posted a link to Warner’s videotaped statement and tweeted, "Five years ago, @Mark Warner made the promise he broke." And on Sept. 9, Gillespie began airing a TV ad featuring the tape of Warner’s pledge and the false claim in capital letters, that our colleagues at PolitiFact National cited it as the "Lie of the Year" in 2013. We’ve rated Gillespie’s claim False; the Lie of the Year focused remarks on repeated remarks about the ACA by President Barack Obama. Warner’s name never came up in PolitiFact National’s announcements of the award. But there’s no doubt Warner’s pledge is an issue this fall. So we decided to pull out the Flip-O-Meter and examine whether Warner had changed his stance in protecting insurance people’s insurance plans. Let’s start with some history. What happened The Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010, requiring that all Americans have health insurance and that policies bought after that date meet minimum coverage standards. Policies in effect prior to the bill signing were exempt from the new requirements. Many Democrats said the exemption was important because it addressed a key argument against the healthcare bill: That Obamacare would strip people of health insurance plans they liked. Conservatives predicted many employers would be unwilling to comply with the minimum coverage standards and find it cheaper to stop providing insurance, pay a federal fine, and let their workers buy policies on exchanges that would be set up under the law. But the bill approved by the Democratic-controlled Congress gave President Barack Obama wiggle room on the exemption. Lawmakers left it to the White House to develop the specific rules on how it would work. Obama repeatedly had promised that people who liked their insurance plans could keep them. He undercut his pledge in June 2010, however, by imposing tough regulations that prevented insurers from adjusting their grandfathered plans to market conditions or offering them to new clients. That all but assured the insurers would pull the plug on substandard plans. The major impact, however, has not been on work-based insurance, as originally predicted. Many employers were already providing coverage that exceeded the standards. The Congressional Budget Office, in a May 2013 study, estimated that the ACA will cause 11 million to lose their employer-based insurance by 2019. That comes to 7 percent of the 157 million people in the U.S. now covered through work. Instead, the brunt has fallen on people who buy their own policies. Insurers began sending notices last fall saying their policies would be eliminated in 2014 because they did not comply with ACA standards. No one knows how many people got notices because the health insurance market is largely private and fragmented. The Washington Post and NBC News reported last fall that their sources estimated between 7 million and 12 million people might be affected. About 16 million people in the U.S. are privately assured, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Obama, last fall, apologized for the "assurances" he gave people about keeping their coverage plans. And he’s given state legislatures the option of allowing insurers to keep substandard plans in effect until Oct 1, 2016. What Warner says now Warner essentially says he couldn’t keep his 2009 pledge because he was blindsided by Obama. "Once the law was implemented, it quickly became clear that this provision had been implemented in such a way that many individuals were having their plans cancelled, despite the administration's promise," David Turner, a spokesman for Warner’s campaign, wrote to us in email. Turner referred to fact checks published by the Associated Press and PolitiFact National in early August 2009, around the time Warner made his pledge. Both gave credence to Obama’s "like it, keep it" assurances, but noted conditions could undercut the president’s promise. PolitiFact National, back then, rated the president’s claim Half True. Turner also cited language in the ACA that encouraged Warner to vote for the bill. The law says, "Nothing in this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) shall be construed to require that an individual terminate coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage in which such individual was enrolled on the date of enactment of this Act." The ACA says, "With respect to a group health plan or health insurance coverage in which an individual was enrolled on the date of enactment of this Act," the minimum standards "shall not apply to such plan or coverage, regardless of whether the individual renews such coverage after such date of enactment." Finally, Turner said Warner took action last fall when insurers started sending out cancellation notices. He sent us copies of letters the senator wrote to the White House and the state insurance commissioner urging them to extend the cancelled plans. Warner also has been urging the General Assembly to pass legislation that would allow insurers to continue offering subpar health plans in Virginia until Oct. 1, 2016. We spoke to a couple of health care experts and found that their views of Warner’s explanation coincided with their opinions on Obamacare. Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who specializes in health care law and supports the ACA, said Warner was true to his word. "The promise was literally kept," he said. "At the time the law went into effect, people could keep their policies." Jost said it’s "irrational" to hold Warner responsible for cancellations that occurred four years or so after he voted for Obamacare, noting that insurers routinely change plans based on market conditions. "I don’t think anyone was promising that if you bought a policy in the past, you could keep it forever," he said. Gail Wilensky, an ACA critic, kept Warner on the hook. She’s an economist at Project HOPE, an international health foundation, and was a senior health adviser to President George H.W. Bush. Wilensky said a major goal of Obamacare was to provide a "minimum benefit standard" and many expected the president to draft regulations that would discourage insurers from continuing plans deemed inadequate by the law. "It should have come as no surprise to anyone who understood the insurance market, and Mark Warner is a very smart guy," she said. We should finally note a Senate vote on Sep. 29, 2010 -- about three months after Obama imposed the regulations with projections that they would force between 39 percent and 69 percent of all businesses relinquish their grandfathered plans by 2013. Republicans, citing that analysis, introduced a resolution that would abolish the minimum standard rules and help people maintain existing policies. The measure was defeated on a party-line 59-40 vote, with Warner voting against it. Turner said Warner viewed the resolution as "political posturing" that could undermine consumer protections written into the ACA. During the Senate debate, Democrats said repealing the regulations would essentially strip Obamacare of popular provisions allowing adult children to stay on their parents policies until they turn 26 and banning insurers from placing limits on lifetime benefits paid out. Our ruling In 2009 Warner pledged he would not support health care reform "that’s going to take away health care that you’ve got right now or a health care plan that you like." The bill Warner voted for that December had language exempting existing plans from complying with minimum coverage standards. So under a narrow interpretation, it can be argued Warner held steady. But Warner’s pledge weakens under a broader lens. The bill had a loophole: It allowed the president, who promised to protect policies people liked, to fill in the details. Obama, in 2010, imposed tough regulations that made it in infeasible for insurers to continue offering many grandfathered plans. Warner says he was disappointed by the president’s action. Later that year, Warner and all Senate Democrats voted against a GOP resolution to repeal the regulations, even though the White House had begun projecting that many grandfathered insurance plans would be cancelled. Democrats said that repealing the rules would jeopardize other popular provisions written into the ACA. Warner, on the other hand, has advocated pushing back deadlines on the enactment of the insurance regulations. There’s been some back and forth on Warner’s position. On the whole, we rate it a Half Flip.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2014-09-29T12:00:00	2014-09-29	['None']
pomt-04774	"Independent voters have a ten-point margin in favor of Mitt Romney right now."	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/26/bob-mcdonnell/eve-gop-convention-mcdonnell-says-romney-leading-o/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist’s surprise endorsement of President Barack Obama came with a warning for the Republican Party. Crist, who was elected governor as a Republican and then ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as an independent, penned an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times that told arriving Republican National Convention delegates that an element of the GOP had veered too far to the right on women’s issues, immigration, seniors and students. ABC’s This Week host George Stephanopoulos used Crist's endorsement to press Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, chairman of the Republican party’s platform committee, to respond to the charge. McDonnell replied that Crist was "wrong on the platform. He also missed the point. What matters is getting the nation back on track, the federal government out of debt, and jobs for the American people. "So on the things that really matter to voters, George, I think the records are stark, and I think that's why independent voters have a 10-point margin in favor of Mitt Romney right now," McDonnell said. Romney is ahead by 10 points among independents? We looked at the most recent national polls to find out if that was correct. We found that while national polls showed Romney leading Obama among independent voters, the Republican’s advantage varied from a few points to 11 points. A Fox News poll supported McDonnell’s claim, with Romney leading Obama among independents 42 percent to 32 percent. This poll tracked likely voters, and was conducted Aug. 19-21. The margin of error was 3 percentage points. An AP-GfK poll last week showed Romney ahead among independent voters 41 to 30. The poll was conducted Aug. 16-20, with a margin of error of about 4 percentage points. A CNN/ORC International poll showed Romney ahead with the backing of 48 percent of likely independent voters, to Obama’s 45 percent. It was conducted Aug. 22 and Aug. 23 by telephone. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The three-week average of Gallup’s poll of registered voters showed Romney leading Obama among independents 44 percent to 41 percent. Polling took place July 30 to Aug. 19. It’s worth nothing that Obama was ahead among independents in the days before Romney chose U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his vice presidential pick. CNN and Fox polls showed that about three weeks ago, Obama was ahead by 11 percent. We also took a look at recent polls in three key battleground states. A Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll released Thursday showed that Romney was ahead 48 percent to 44 percent among independents in Florida. This was within the poll’s margin of error. That same poll in Ohio showed Romney was ahead of independents 48 percent to 43 percent in Ohio. In Virginia, data from the firm Public Policy Polling showed Romney with a 46 to 43 lead among independents. Our ruling McDonnell said Romney was ahead of Obama with independents by 10 points. He is right that polls show Romney leading among independents, although the polls range from a few to 11 points. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-10700	The Red Sox waited "87 long years" to win the World Series.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/29/mitt-romney/flubbing-a-key-number-in-red-sox-lore/	The number is as much a part of Red Sox lore as the Green Monster, Fenway franks and the curse of the Bambino. Eighty-six. That's how many years passed between the team's 1918 World Series victory and its next one in 2004. It's a number that has been used in so many descriptions of suffering fans ("86 years of despair and disappointment" . . . "86-year drought" . . . "86 long and depressing years") that it's iconic. Do a Google search on the phrase "86 years," as we did, and five of the first 10 listings relate to the Red Sox. But when Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a self-described "true-suffering fan" of the Sox, spoke about his team at the CNN/YouTube debate on Nov. 28, 2007, he used a different number: Eighty-seven. In fact, he used the wrong number twice in a row. "Eighty-seven long years," Romney said. "We waited 87 long years. And true suffering Red Sox fans that my family and I are, we could not have been more happy than to see the Red Sox win the World Series, except by being able to beat the Yankees when they were ahead three games to none." It wasn't exactly the magnitude of Bill Buckner's blunder in Game 6 of the '86 World Series (there's that number again!), when the ball rolled through his legs, letting the winning run score. But to Sox fans, it was a significant mistake. And so, even though he was only off by a year, we award Romney a False. A Sox fan should know better.

pomt-07319	"Most military experts say there is anywhere between 25 and 30 members of al Qaeda in Afghanistan."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/15/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-there-are-only-25-30-al-qaeda-fight/	Congressman David Cicilline, a freshman Democrat, was on WPRO-AM (630) radio May 6 making the case that the United States should stop funneling money to Afghanistan for construction projects and use the money for badly needed projects back home. "We are investing in that infrastructure and rebuilding a country. We ought to be directing those resources back here to the United States. We have some urgent needs of infrastructure and investments in law enforcement that we need be making in our own country," he said during an interview with Morning News hosts Tara Granahan and Andrew Gobeil, just days after the killing of Osama bin Laden. Putting aside his views on President Obama’s strategy for Afghanistan, we were struck by another statement the congressman made to support his position. "I think that most military experts say there is anywhere between 25 and 30 members of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. So we have succeeded in our mission. That was to dismantle al Qaeda and you know we have to, of course, still have a presence in that part of the world. The growing danger, I think, is really in Pakistan." We wondered: Are there really so few al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan? We didn’t hear back right away from the congressman so we began to conduct some reconnaissance of our own. There aren’t any census workers checking caves in Afghanistan and asking if whether anyone belongs to al Qaeda. And the Defense Department doesn’t make a habit of announcing its intelligence estimates. But there have been numbers cited in the media and elsewhere. In December 2009, as Mr. Obama was deciding whether to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, ABCNEWS.com reported that senior U.S. intelligence officials estimated about 100 al Qaeda members in Afghanistan. On June 27, 2010, CIA Director Leon Panetta gave an estimate on ABC’s "This Week" that has been cited frequently. "I think the estimate on the number of al Qaeda is actually relatively small," Panetta said at the time. "At most, we’re looking at 50 to 100, maybe less. It’s in that vicinity. There’s no question that the main location of al Qaeda is in the tribal areas of Pakistan." The Wall Street Journal gave a different estimate in an April 6, 2011, story. "Precise numbers of al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan at any given time are hard to come by," the story said. "For the most part, al Qaeda has been viewed by Western officials as a declining force in the Afghan fight. Just six months ago, U.S. intelligence estimates indicated only one or two dozen al Qaeda fighters were present in Afghanistan at any one time." But, the story continued, "Most of the few hundred fighters it had in the region were holed up in Pakistan hiding from Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes." With the pullback of U.S. troops from northeastern Afghanistan, senior military officials were quoted as saying, al Qaeda fighters are reportedly returning. On April 9, 2011, Gen. David Petraeus, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces, told the Associated Press that he did not believe al Qaeda was making a comeback. "There is no question that al Qaeda has had a presence in Afghanistan and continues to have a presence — generally assessed at less than 100 or so," he said . Finally, we contacted Bing West, of Newport, a former assistant secretary of defense and author of several military books, including his just-released "The Wrong War." In it, West argues that counterinsurgency efforts are not working in Afghanistan and that U.S. troops should be withdrawn and replaced by a corps of advisers to assist Afghanistan battalions. "He’s basically right," West said about Cicilline’s comments. "No one knows the number and, of course, since they can walk back and forth across the border, the number is elastic to begin with. If we are trying to make the general point that there are relatively few al Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan, that’s a correct statement." So the estimates varied, but none was as low as the numbers Cicilline cited on WPRO. When we did hear back from the congressman’s office, spokeswoman Jessica Kershaw said that Cicilline had erred and referred us to the estimates we had already found. "Congressman Cicilline accidentally misspoke during his interview with WPRO and meant to say that military members and the Director of the CIA indicate there are more like 50-100 al Qaeda members in Afghanistan," Kershaw wrote in an e-mail. "However, the point Congressman Cicilline was making is simple and rings true -- compared to the approximately 100,000 American troops stationed in Afghanistan, there is a relatively small number of hardcore al Qaeda members left in that country, and that is supported by General Petraeus and CIA Director Leon Panetta." We’ll grant that precise numbers are hard to come by. But Cicilline claimed the number he cited -- lower than most others -- was what "most military experts" were saying. In fact, that’s not what most military experts were saying. And even he acknowledges he "misspoke." We rate his claim Barely True. (To comment or offer your own ruling, visit us on Facebook.) Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01395	The United States was not one of 16 countries where David Perdue said in his Pillowtex deposition that he created jobs.	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/14/michelle-nunn/key-context-missing-attack-perdues-job-record/	A nine-year-old legal document has become a focal point in the highly competitive contest to become Georgia’s next U.S. senator. Democrat Michelle Nunn has made several attacks and claims against Republican David Perdue based on his blunt statements about outsourcing in a 2005 deposition. Most of the political hay comes from Perdue saying that he "spent most of my career" establishing work and supply lines in foreign countries. At the Oct. 7 debate, Nunn pounced on something else she found in the 186-page document. "He talked about 16 countries," Nunn said. "Not once did he talk about creating jobs in the United States." Since the outcome of the race is expected to help decide control of the Senate, and polls show a potential runoff, the claim called out for a spin on the Truth-O-Meter. First, some background. The deposition was taken as part of a bankruptcy lawsuit against Pillowtex, a North Carolina textile company that failed shortly after Perdue’s brief tenure as CEO. Perdue, who was CEO at Dollar General when he was deposed, said his turnaround plan when he joined Pillowtex in 2002 called for a mix of marketing and outsourcing. High-end products would be made in America, while lower-cost products would be manufactured overseas. That was the idea, at least, until Perdue and other Pillowtex executives found a large unfunded liability missed when the firm exited its first bankruptcy. Unable to execute his plan, Perdue left after less than a year and the firm eventually collapsed. The legal interrogation lays out that failure and includes Perdue’s description of various executive jobs where he specialized in outsourcing with firms such as Reebok and Sara Lee. Asked specifically about his "experience" with outsourcing, Perdue goes on at length about that background. "I dealt with companies from Japan westward all the way to Kenya and Lesotho in Africa, Dubai, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, all points west of Japan," Perdue said in part of his answer. In addition to those 12 countries, Perdue mentions three more and Hong Kong, now part of China. He does not reference the United States. That’s technically 16 then-nations. So is the case closed? Not without an understanding of how a deposition works. For the interrogation, Perdue would have been under oath, sworn to answer honestly the questions posed to him. A deposition is similar to taking the witness stand, but there is no judge present to referee the questions and answers, said Jill Polster, an Atlanta defense attorney. That means the attorney of the person being deposed counsels them to be sure to answer only the question posed. "I tell all of my witnesses, you answer the question that is asked and no more," Polster said. "Witnesses can sometimes talk about whatever they want to talk about, but that would be weird in a deposition. It’s a narrow inquiry." In Perdue’s case, that narrow focus was, unsurprisingly, on his business successes finding low-cost manufacturing plants and labor. The line of questioning that led to Perdue to talk about his experience in other countries included: "Can you describe your experience with outsourcing?" "When you joined Reebok, was Reebok outsourcing all of its product to Asia?" and, "At any of your jobs prior to Pillowtex, were you involved at all in building the infrastructure of outsourcing? In other words, there were no questions about the United States. And the structure of a deposition would not allow for much free form discussion about jobs there, even if Perdue wanted to bring that up. Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s spokesman, said a careful reading of the deposition could show Perdue was trying to show efforts to save American jobs – not just outsource them – with his turnaround plan for Pillowtex. Moreover, at the time Perdue was starting work on creating thousands of jobs at Dollar General, through a massive expansion of the discount chain. But the list of countries doesn’t get into that, Dickey said, because no question was posed for him to answer. "He was obliged to answer what the attorney was asking about," Dickey said. "It’s disgusting to twist it to say otherwise." Nunn is accurate to say Perdue lists job creation in 16 countries in his 2005 deposition. The United States isn’t one of them. But legal experts say it is unfair to focus too much on a missing answer in a deposition, since the real culprit would be a missing question. Nunn’s claim contains an element of truth but takes it out of context to be misleading. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Michelle Nunn	None	None	None	2014-10-14T00:00:00	2014-10-07	['United_States']
pomt-00525	"More than half of women under 30 who give birth do so outside of marriage..."	/virginia/statements/2015/jun/22/don-beyer/beyer-says-more-half-moms-under-30-are-unwed/	Rep. Don Beyer says the U.S. needs to help young moms raising children on their own. "A growing percentage of women are single mothers; more than half of women under 30 who give birth do so outside of marriage and consequently serve a significant economic role for that child," Beyer, D-8th, says on his congressional website. We wondered if it’s true that most women under 30 having babies are unwed. Tia Shuyler, Beyer’s spokeswoman, pointed us to a series of reports and news articles on births to single mothers. But none of the sources provided a definitive source for the claim, so we went to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which keeps detailed records on births in the U.S. and mothers’ marital status. The proportion of babies born to unmarried mothers has generally risen during the last 75 years, according to CDC figures. In 1940, 3.8 percent of all births were to unmarried women. By 2009, 41 percent of all births were to unmarried moms. But Beyer’s statement required deeper research because it focused on women under 30. CDC records show that in 2005, 49 percent of babies born to women under 30 were born out of wedlock. They crossed 50 percent for the age group in 2006 and reached 54 percent in 2009. Amid the halting recovery from the Great Recession, the number has remained essentially flat. So the bottom line is that the proportion out-of-wedlock births -- both for all mothers and those under 30 -- has recently been stagnant, but historically has increased. Isabell Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, offered a couple of reasons for the the long-term increases. One is that women have more opportunities to provide for themselves and their children outside of marriage and don’t feel the need to have a husband to support them, she said. "Marriage is on the decline is the simple explanation," Sawhill said. "Each generation is marrying less than the previous one. If you take the women under the age of 30, you are talking about the youngest generation, so the proportion having children outside of marriage is larger because they are the most recent generation." Social norms could also be playing a part, Sawhill said. "It used to be if you had a baby outside of marriage, you were stigmatized," she said. "That is no longer true. It’s so common now, it is quite accepted." The U.S. Census Bureau, in a 2013 report , also examined the proportion of unmarried moms under 30. It found about half of such mothers who gave birth in 2010 and 2011 were unwed. The younger the mother, the higher chance of her being single. Of mothers age 15 to 19 with a recent birth, 86.1 percent of them had their babies out of wedlock. Among women age 20 to 24 with a recent birth, 61.5 percent of them weren’t married, and 31.9 percent of mothers age 25-29 had their babies outside marriage. Many reports, including from The New York Times and The Urban Institute, have noted that for unmarried women under 30, their birth rate has been declining in recent years. Many analysts attribute the fall-off at least partly to the economy as some mothers put off having babies or decide not to have them at all. For mothers of all ages, the birth rate has been going down, but preliminary CDC figures for 2014 showed an uptick. Our ruling Beyer said "more than half of women under 30 do so outside of marriage." Government figures back up his assertion. We rate his statement True.	None	Don Beyer	None	None	None	2015-06-22T12:13:26	2015-06-15	['None']
pomt-00052	"Liberal Democrats" who back Dan McCready "cut $716 BILLION from Medicare to fund their healthcare scheme: Obamacare."	/north-carolina/statements/2018/nov/03/mark-harris/republican-says-democrats-cut-billions-medicare-le/	Health care is a hot-button issue this election season. Candidates have thrown around quite a few numbers while accusing their opponents of either supporting or opposing some key health-care legislation. In a closely fought campaign for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, Republican Mark Harris is following suit after his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, accused Harris of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare. We recently checked McCready’s claim and found it to be Half True. Harris has not supported any plans that would immediately cut these two programs, but has expressed that he wants an "overhaul" of Social Security. A Facebook ad, paid for by Harris, addresses this claim directly. "My opponent attacks me, alleging I want to cut Social Security and Medicare, when it was the liberal Democrats who back his campaign that cut $716 BILLION from Medicare to fund their healthcare scheme: Obamacare," the ad said. The ad has been running since Oct. 22, 2018. We are specifically checking if $716 billion was "cut" from Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health law passed in 2010. It. This is a claim PolitiFact has checked numerous times. Politicians have been using the $716 billion number since at least 2012. Old claim and old number In 2012, PolitiFact checked a similar claim from presidential candidate Mitt Romney and rated it Half True. Paul Ryan, Romney’s vice presidential pick in 2012 and now the speaker of the House, made a similar claim that year that got him a Mostly False rating. Finally, a 2015 claim by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was rated Half True. And there are many more. Politicians often were using the right number but the wrong context. Asked where Harris’s $716 billion figure comes from, Jason Williams, his campaign manager, shared a link of a Washington Post blog post from 2012. The article says Mitt Romney, former Republican presidential candidate, is right in saying Obamacare cuts the Medicare budget by $716 billion. And while there was a cut in spending, there was never a loss of services or a decrease in quality of services. But that article is more than six years old, and so are the government numbers it relies upon. So let’s take a fresh look. Cutting benefits? Harris’s claim makes it sound like the ACA cut benefits for the elderly. Matthew Fiedler from the Brookings Institution, a center-left think tank, says there isn’t any evidence of that. "The implication when this claim was made is that these harmed Medicare beneficiaries. That implication is not accurate. These were changes that reduced what physicians and hospitals received from Medicare," Fiedler said. The ACA aimed in part to bring down the future growth of costs in Medicare, offsetting some of the cost of the law. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, from 2011, says the health-care legislation would "permanently reduce the growth of Medicare’s payment rates for most services." "You might suggest maybe that reductions in payments may have reduced the quality in care. I don’t think there is a whole lot of evidence of that," Fiedler said. "Various other changes were aimed at giving hospitals and physicians incentives to provide better care." Fiedler said that prior to the ACA, people were paying more for medical services than they needed to in order to cover the costs. After the ACA, premiums and co-payments went down, saving Medicare beneficiaries money. The $716 billion figure was an estimate of how much would be saved. But that was a projection, and while Obamacare has been in effect for years, PolitiFact wasn’t able to find a recent estimate of what happened in reality. Any repeal or replacement bill that has passed through Congress actually included these same provisions, even Republican plans, according to Tricia Neuman, the senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care policy organization. "Subsequent proposals to repeal the ACA retained those Medicare savings. It’s sort of having it both ways for criticising ACA savings, but keeping them in subsequent proposals," Neuman said of Republicans. Neuman also said that the ACA improved drug coverage and preventative services for Medicare beneficiaries. Our rating Harris’s number would’ve been closer to the truth if this was 2012 and not 2018. However, his use of the number also gives a false impression. The number actually represented a projection of how much federal money Obamacare would save over the years, mainly at the expense of insurers, medical providers and hospitals. We rate this claim Mostly False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

pomt-11592	"In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-misleading-claim-about/	President Donald Trump reaffirmed his commitment to crack down on terrorists and blamed those before him for not doing enough in his first State of the Union speech. "In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released," Trump said Jan. 30. Those claims are misleading. ‘We have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield’ Trump is referring to the number of prisoners released from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, who were confirmed of re-engaging in some type of terrorist activity. About every six months, the Director of National Intelligence releases figures about detainees transferred from Guantanamo and how many are known to have re-engaged in some sort of terrorist activity. The most recent report was published in October 2017 and includes data from 2002, when the prison opened, through July 2017. During that time, the U.S. government transferred more than 700 detainees from Guantanamo, and 122 of them were "confirmed of re-engaging" in some sort of terrorist activity. Eight of those transfers happened during the Obama administration. The remaining 114 — or over 92 percent — happened under George W. Bush. So Trump’s "hundreds and hundreds" is really 122 combatants spread out over 15 years. What about al-Baghdadi? Trump claimed that the United States was responsible for releasing Baghdadi back into the battlefield, but that claim is also missing key context. From early February 2004 until early December 2004, Baghdadi was held at a U.S. detention system known as Camp Bucca, according to the Defense Department. However, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis in 2004, who released him some time later. In a previous fact-check, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro falsely tied President Barack Obama to Baghdadi’s release. Baghdadi was not in U.S. custody when Obama was in office. The framework for transfers was set up while Bush was president. The legal contract between the United States and Iraq guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi, and there is no evidence that he was on anyone’s radar. Our ruling Trump said, "We have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi." Trump is overstating the number of prisoners released from Guantanamo, who were confirmed of re-engaging in some type of terrorist activity. That number is 122, not "hundreds and hundreds." He is also not entirely right that al-Baghdadi was "released" by the United States. The ISIS leader was was handed over to the Iraqi justice system, which released him some time later.

pomt-13222	Says Donald Trump "said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-still-promising-depor/	Immigration was one of the main topics during the final debate between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican contender Donald Trump. Asked about their positions, Trump reaffirmed his plans to build a wall along the southern border, get "bad hombres" out of the country and not give "amnesty." Clinton said she doesn’t want to rip families apart or "see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country." As evidence, Clinton said that Trump "said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation." We wondered if in fact Trump said all undocumented people would be subject to deportation. Clinton’s campaign pointed to Trump’s immigration speech on Aug. 31 in Phoenix. In that 10-point speech, Trump started by talking about criminals, saying there would be "zero tolerance for criminal aliens." He said his administration would begin moving them out "Day One," working especially with police and law enforcement who "know who these people are." His fifth point centered on the enforcement of all immigration laws. The Clinton campaigned highlighted this part of the speech to back up Clinton’s debate comments. "In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced ... As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country." Trump said his deportation priorities included criminals, security threats and visa overstays. According to some estimates, about 40 percent of the undocumented population came to the United States on visas and overstayed their departure date. While Trump emphasized removal of undocumented criminal immigrants and of those who arrived illegally, Clinton’s claim that every undocumented immigrant would be subject to deportation has merits. In other parts of the Phoenix speech, Trump said undocumented immigrants would eventually have to return to their home countries and apply for re-entry. "Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined," Trump said. But Trump also gave another mixed message within the same speech. He said that after accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, after building a wall, ending illegal immigration and establishing a new lawful immigration system, "then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain." That suggests that while every undocumented person could potentially be deported ("subject to deportation"), they won’t all be deported. Our ruling Clinton claimed that Trump said "as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation." Trump said Aug. 31 that anyone in the country illegally who wants lawful status has to go back home and apply for re-entry, and that those who came illegally are subject to deportation. But Trump also said "then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain." That suggests he doesn’t intend to deport literally every undocumented person. Clinton’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-08753	Gov. Rick Perry "has overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years."	/texas/statements/2010/aug/28/back-basics/back-basics-pac-says-gov-rick-perry-has-overseen-t/	In a full-page ad that ran Tuesday in newspapers across Texas, including the Austin American-Statesman, a political action group asks voters to "tell Rick Perry to stop cowering and face Texans like a man." It's the latest salvo in the crossfire over which gubernatorial candidate is afraid to debate: Democrat Bill White or GOP incumbent Rick Perry, who says he's waiting for White to release more of his income tax returns. The ad, paid for by Back to Basics, a pro-White PAC, claims Perry is scared to "defend his miserable record." Among its charges: Perry, who's been governor for 10 years, "has overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years." That's practically a whole generation. Is it true? After contacting Back to Basics, we learned that its researchers had looked at annual unemployment data for Texas from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and compared those rates with the average thus far for 2010, which is 8.3 percent. The last time the annual rate was higher was 1987 — 23 years ago -- when it was 8.5 percent. Following the advice of Cheryl Abbot, an economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, we examined monthly statewide unemployment rates that have been seasonally adjusted, which accounts for temporary employment surges (such as during the Christmas holidays). The state's all-time low is 4.2 percent, which it hit most recently in January 2001, shortly after Perry took office. The all-time high: 9.3 percent, in November 1986. During Perry's tenure, the highest monthly unemployment rate has been 8.3 percent, in April and May of 2010. The last time the unemployment rate was greater? July 1987, when it was 8.4 percent (Republican Bill Clements was re-elected as Texas' governor later that year.) So, considering unemployment on a monthly basis, the jobless rate in April 2010 was the highest it's been since July 1987, 22 years and nine months earlier. But that hasn't stopped Perry from praising Texas' economic performance during his tenure. "We’re dealing with joblessness like everyone else is, but our unemployment rate is more than a full point below the national average thanks to the strength of our economy," the governor said in a speech prepared for delivery Aug. 12 in West Texas. Texas' seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in July was 8.2 percent, compared with the national rate of 9.5 percent. Responding to Back to Basics' statement that the governor "has overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years," Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign, told us that "we are one of the few states that continues creating jobs and attracting renowned companies to relocate and expand within our borders." Asked to point to specific ways that Perry has contributed to the state's economic health, Frazier said the governor has "led the charge to establish the Texas Enterprise Fund" to encourage companies to expand in Texas. She also said Perry "has worked with state leadership to uphold principles of low taxes, fiscal restraint and reasonable regulations, which are the reasons Texas is ahead of the pack economically compared to other states." Still, we wondered how much credit — or blame — governors deserve for the employment situation in their states, and asked several experts that question. "The short answer: Their power is very limited," said Susan Hansen, a political science professor at the University of Pittsburgh. In a 1999 article in the journal Political Research Quarterly, Hansen argues that the Federal Reserve — with its power to affect interest rates — the president and Congress "have far more influence over the nation's economy (and) unemployment ... than do the states in our federal system. State elected officials seem to be well aware of their vulnerability to economic downturns, and their policy efforts (symbolic though they may be) must be considered in this light." Such "symbolic" efforts, wrote Hansen, run the gamut from economic-development programs to overseas trips to promote a state's business climate — all things Perry has done. Hansen also said state programs that use incentives to lure companies — like the Texas Enterprise Fund — are "marginal at best" in boosting employment. Paul Brace, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, said that virtually every state offers such programs and that their actual benefits are exaggerated. The Texas Enterprise Fund has spent $397 million since 2003 on projects that have generated "more than 53,600 new jobs," according to an Aug. 18 news release from the governor's office, which oversees that fund. To put that number in context, Texas had a net gain of about a million nonfarm jobs between 2003 and 2010, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. Jobs credited to the enterprise fund are about 5 percent of that total. More important, the experts agreed, were the state's strength in sectors where employment remains high, particularly natural resources and agriculture. Brace cited the state's housing markets, which avoided the worst pain of the subprime mortgage crisis, and the absence of a personal income tax in Texas. When asked what role the governor may have played in the Texas rise in unemployment, Abbot of the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that higher jobless rates are a national trend and "you could only say that (Perry) had a part in it in the sense that all other 49 governors had a part" in growing joblessness nationwide. Cliff Walker, director of the Back to Basics PAC, said that "as CEO of the state, (Perry) certainly touts his success in creating a strong economic climate. If he takes credit for that, why shouldn't he also take the responsibility for "the state's job losses?" Perhaps because the first is politically advantageous while the second is not. Either way, the experts we talked to agreed that governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place on their watch. As Brace put it: "Overall unemployment wasn't (Perry's) fault, but our relatively good performance also has little to do with what he did." In other words, synchronous events don't necessarily add up to responsibility. We made the same point in our January ruling (Pants on Fire!) on a Republican Party claim that as mayor of Houston, White "presided over" construction of a Planned Parenthood "abortion clinic." We found White no more responsible for the privately funded clinic than he was for the weather or baseball playoffs during his tenure. In this case, Back to Basics' numbers stand up: The state's unemployment rate under Perry has hit a 22-year high. But the suggestion that the governor is to blame does not. We rate Back to Basics' statement as Half True.	None	Back to Basics	None	None	None	2010-08-28T06:00:00	2010-08-24	['Texas', 'Rick_Perry']
pomt-07173	"Obamacare cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding in order to fund the new constitutionally questionable government mandate, even going so far as to scuttle Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage."	/florida/statements/2011/jun/10/mike-haridopolos/mike-haridopolos-takes-health-care-bill-newspaper-/	The federal health care law returned to the news June 8, 2011, when a trio of federal judges heard oral arguments over whether Congress can force people to either buy health insurance or pay penalties. Which means for us ... more claims about the health care law. This one comes from Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, a Republican running for Bill Nelson's seat in the U.S. Senate in 2012. Haridopolos published an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel on June 9 titled "More need protection under Medicare reform." Here are the first 200 words or so: Liberal politicians and media pundits in Washington have repeatedly sold us a false paradigm that we can either reform government spending, or we can protect the promise we've made to Americans in need, including seniors. What if I told you we could do both? Everyone should start from the position that no one will be helped if America falls into bankruptcy. That's why I worked with Florida legislators during the 2011 session to pass a resolution rejecting Obamacare, countering the dangerous cuts this new government entitlement made to current programs, including Medicare, in order to fund new ones. It's not a political ploy. It's a question of government making promises and breaking them at a time when millions of Americans are counting on them most. Here's what I mean: Obamacare funds welfare for able adults on the backs of seniors that have already paid their dues. Obamacare cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding in order to fund the new constitutionally questionable government mandate, even going so far as to scuttle Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage. Strip aside the derisive references to Obamacare and you have an interesting two-part claim. One, that the federal health care law "cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding." And two, that it "scuttle(s) Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage." PolitiFact has addressed the $500 billion in Medicare "cuts" several times, but since the topic keeps reappearing, we think it's time for a refresher course. By way of introduction, Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up 12 percent of the federal budget. Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation. Some reforms increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage, said Tricia Neuman, who is vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation -- a trusted independent source. For instance, the health care law adds $5 billion to help cover prevention services and $43 billion to help fill in a gap for enrollees purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program (sometimes called the doughnut hole). Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help pay for coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation, Neuman said. And yet other provisions are designed to improve the delivery and quality of care. (Neuman explains the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen.) The key for us is noting that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending increases over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of future spending increases in Medicare, the law doesn't cut Medicare. Haridopolos' wording is better than similar claims we've seen. Again, he wrote that the health care law "cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding." It would have been better, though, had he added the word "increased" somewhere, and referred to Medicare spending rather than funding. The spending reductions to Medicare are intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the new health care law, which applies to everyone. So where does the $500 billion in savings come from? Nearly $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in payments that health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. A new national board will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. None of those are cuts in the traditional sense. Then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. A perfect segue to Haridopolos' second claim: The health care bill will "scuttle" Medicare Advantage. There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage programs typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100. The Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program, but it hasn't worked as planned. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use. The health care law phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs, starting modestly in 2012, to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The change is expected to result in fewer extra benefits offered by providers and higher out-of-pocket costs for enrollees, though the exact changes will fluctuate across the country. Actuaries with The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services said in October 2010 that the estimated out-of-pocket expenses to Medicare Advantage participants will increase by $873 in 2019, when the law is fully implemented. Remember, though, Medicare Advantage participants often get benefits traditional Medicare enrollees do not. The same actuaries also said the number of Medicare Advantage enrollees may be cut in half by 2017 under terms of the law. Those who drop out of Medicare Advantage are still eligible to opt back into traditional Medicare. But since that study, the impact of the Medicare Advantage cuts has been softened. The health care law included bonuses to high-performing plans -- plans that receive four or five stars on a five-star scale. The idea was to keep the most cost-effective plans in business. But in April 2011, the government decided to expand the pool of Medicare Advantage plans eligible for the bonuses, saying that average-quality plans with just three or three-and-a-half stars would also get bonuses. The change infuses an additional $6.7 billion into Medicare Advantage. According to the Associated Press, four out of five Medicare Advantage enrollees are in plans that are now eligible for a bonus. Without the changes, only one in four would have been in plans getting the extra payments. The bonuses are only temporary, however, and cuts will resume in 2015. To recap: In a Sentinel op-ed, Haridopolos made two claims about the federal health care law. He said it "cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding" and would "scuttle Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage." There are elements of truth in each claim. The $500 billion in "cuts" are actually cuts to future increased spending, so we give Haridopolos some credit for not simply calling it cuts to Medicare as so many others have done. And Medicare Advantage isn't going away as part of the new health care law. Instead, the law tries to put Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare programs on even-footing with respect to costs to the taxpayer. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14873	"We already pay the highest electricity prices in the country here in New England."	/rhode-island/statements/2015/nov/12/richard-paglia/electricity-rates-here-are-high-not-highest/	Over the next four to five years, New England’s power grid is expected to lose thousands of megawatts of electricity as power plants, such as Brayton Point in Somerset, head into retirement. The planned shutdowns, including the closure of Plymouth’s Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, will heighten demand for electricity from other sources, including plants fueled by natural gas. And some say New Englanders could see higher electricity prices without an ample supply of natural gas. This is where Richard Paglia and his company, Houston-based Spectra Energy, come in. An upgrade to gas pipelines and gas storage capacity would expand supply and lower electricity prices, says Paglia. Some critics of Spectra’s various infrastructure projects, including two men who locked themselves to the front gates of the company’s Burrillville compressor station over the summer, oppose greater use of fossil fuels. "Without that project going forward, we will really be constrained," Paglia said during an appearance on WPRI’s Executive Suite. "We already pay the highest electricity prices in the country here in New England." The costliest electricity in the country? We thought this was worth a check. Our research found that the average cost of electricity in New England is higher than other regions of the continental United States. But an emphasis on the words "region" and "continental" is important. In August 2015, the average price of electricity for New England’s six states was about 18.1 cents per kilowatt hour, according to a price monitoring report issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Oct. 27. The average price for electricity in the state of California, 18.2 cents, slightly exceeded New England’s average. But California’s averages were lower during the winter of 2015. Also, in August, California’s region, which encompasses Oregon and Washington, had less expensive electricity than New England. Washington state’s average of 9.4 cents – the lowest in the country – helped hold the average price in its Pacific coast region to 15.7 cents. In comparison, the average for Rhode Island this past August was 18.7 cents. In the region that encompasses New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, the average was 16.5 cents. In general, electricity was significantly less expensive elsewhere in the continental United States, away from the northeast and California coast. But in a region that the EIA refers to as "Pacific Noncontiguous," which encompasses just Alaska and Hawaii, the average price of electricity was almost 27 cents. Hawaii’s average electricity price was about 30 cents while Alaska’s was 21 cents. A spokesman for Spectra, Creighton A. Welch, acknowledged that the New England region’s electricity prices are only highest in the continental United States. "The main message here," said Welch, "is that it’s a shame New England’s electric costs are so high relative to nearby regions – especially when practically next door sits a vast supply of affordable, domestic natural gas – that they are limiting economic competitiveness and growth in the region. It’s critical that we solve this energy challenge." Our ruling New England had the priciest electricity in the continental United States according to a government report that compares New England to other regions of the country. The same report shows that California’s electricity was more expensive than electricity in four of six New England states. Meanwhile, Hawaii and Alaska are U.S. states and electricity within both of those states was more expensive than the New England region’s average. The average for the region that both states are grouped in was more expensive, too. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.

pomt-13195	In 1928 "school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-school-boards-anti-catholic-scare-tactics-/	A warning to political junkies: This has very little to do with the burning issues of the presidential campaign. Sometimes, we just like to fact-check claims about history. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton dropped an intriguing nugget in our laps when she spoke at the Alfred E. Smith memorial dinner in New York on Oct. 20, 2016. After making joke after joke at Donald Trump’s expense, Clinton turned serious and reminded her audience of the anti-Catholic bigotry Al Smith faced when he ran for president in 1928. Most of the arguments against Smith stemmed from the belief that Smith would be a puppet for Rome and the pope. One conspiracy theory was that the pope and Smith would ban protestant versions of the Bible. "It is important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party's nominee for president," she said. "Don't forget, school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible." We wondered if that was so. The Clinton campaign pointed us to a New York Times article from 2011. In the article, historian Robert Slayton at Chapman University described the hysteria stirred up by Smith’s candidacy. "Feelings were so strong that they swirled into a hurricane of abuse, a crescendo of fear and hate blasting through eight weeks," Slayton wrote. "The school board of Daytona Beach, Fla., sent a note home with every student. It read simply: ‘We must prevent the election of Alfred E. Smith to the Presidency. If he is elected President, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.’ " Clinton made the school boards plural; Slayton only mentioned one. We asked Slayton if he had an image of the note. He didn’t, although he said the anecdote might have come from a 1932 book The Shadow of the Pope by Michael Williams. We tracked down the book in the stacks at the Georgetown University library. Williams described something appreciably different from what Clinton and Slayton had said. Williams wrote about a Sunday school -- a class held on Sundays to teach about religion --, not a public school board. "On September 16, 1928, a Sunday school in Daytona Beach, Fla., (said the Daytona Times), was reported as acquiescing in a plan whereby the children were handed cards and told to pass them on the their mothers. "It is stated that the cards declared: ‘We must prevent the election of Alfred E. Smith to the Presidency. If he is chosen President, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.’ " Williams went on to write that this plan "is reported to have originated in St. Paul, Minn., and to have been used in other places." So it’s possible that other Sunday schools did this, but we don’t really know. We’ve tried without luck to find the Daytona Times report. If anyone reading this is able to find the article, or find an example from St. Paul, we welcome the help. Our ruling Clinton said that in 1928, school boards sent kids home with a note warning that if Al Smith were elected president, they would not be allowed to own or read a Bible. It appears that reference tracks back to a 1932 book, and a newspaper article before that, that spoke of a Sunday school in Daytona Beach passing out a note. There is a chance that other Sunday schools in other states did likewise, but we don’t have proof of that. There is a big difference between a Sunday school and a public school. The anti-Catholic sentiment Clinton talked about was real and there’s credible evidence that the note she described went home with some children. But her statement is only partially accurate.

pomt-01480	Under Scott Walker, "right now, we’re 46th in the country in terms of new businesses started."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/29/mary-burke/wisconsin-under-scott-walker-near-bottom-new-busin/	In a Milwaukee Public Radio interview on Sept. 22, 2014, Democrat Mary Burke critiqued Gov. Scott Walker’s jobs strategy, saying the Republican governor "generally believes that you give tax breaks to those at the top and the special interests and somehow it trickles down and creates jobs." "Well, I’m a business person. That’s not how jobs get created," countered Burke, who formerly served as a Trek Bicycle Corp. executive and state Commerce secretary. "So, it’s a flawed model and I have a very different model and I lay out in my jobs plan the five core strategies on how we’re going to do this," Burke continued, before making a claim we want to check. "It means we need to have a more entrepreneurial climate in Wisconsin. That’s one of them (her five strategies). Right now, we’re 46th in the country in terms of new businesses started." Just the other day, we rated True a Walker claim that Wisconsin ranks 11th "in total business establishment growth," compared with 47th in the years that Burke was Commerce secretary. So we wondered whether Burke’s claim contradicts that. As we’ll see, terminology is key. Different measures Walker referred to "business establishments," a term that means a business location, such as a new store or factory or farm. A single company can have multiple "establishments," and new "establishments" can be opened by existing or new firms. So it’s a particular measure. Burke’s terminology is different than Walker’s, and refers to a different measuring stick. In October 2013, days after announcing her candidacy for governor, Burke said Wisconsin was 49th in the United States in "new businesses created." We rated her statement Mostly True. Burke cited the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, an annual study produced by the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation, a Kansas City-based group that works to foster entrepreneurial activity. Business administration professor Stewart Thornhill, executive director of the Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Michigan, told us it is a widely cited measure. The index uses U.S. Census data to capture the number of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity. In Kauffman’s 2013 index, Wisconsin tied with Michigan for 48th among the states in the number of entrepreneurs per 100,000 people, ahead of only Nebraska and Minnesota. So, what’s the landscape now? Burke’s evidence To back Burke’s new claim, her campaign cited the 2014 Kauffman index. Here are the states rated lowest in terms of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity: Rank/State Entrepreneurs per 100,000 people U.S. average 280 (tie) Wisconsin and Washington 170 (tie) Minnesota and Indiana 160 Rhode Island 140 Iowa 110 So, Wisconsin is actually one notch higher than Burke indicated. On one hand, tying for 45th is an improvement from 48th in the 2013 index. On the other hand, Wisconsin’s 2014 rate of 170 entrepreneurs per 100,000 people is actually lower than its 2013 rate of 180. (Montana ranked first in both 2013 and 2014. Its 2014 rate was 610 entrepreneurs per 100,000 people.) Walker’s response Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marré pointed out that in our earlier Burke factcheck, the Kauffman Foundation warned that its index isn’t meant to provide a precise ranking of states. But its report in effect does that by reporting precise ratings and singling out states in the top five highest and lowest groups. Marré also cited other business-creation statistics, including the Walker claim about total business establishment growth. But, again, that is a different measure than the one Burke cites. Our rating Burke said Wisconsin is "46th in the country in terms of new businesses started." Wisconsin actually ties for 45th in the well-known Kauffman index, in terms of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-04885	Says Romney would add "trillions" to the deficit while Obama would "cut the deficit by $4 trillion."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/barack-obama/mitt-romney-would-add-trillions-deficit-while-obam/	Editor’s note: After we published this item, we were alerted that our description of the position of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget contained incomplete information. We reviewed that description, interviewed the committee’s staff again, made changes, and re-published our report on Sept. 19, 2012. The text of our original report is archived here. The ruling remains Half True. President Barack Obama would like to cast Mitt Romney as a retread of the George W. Bush years. His campaign’s latest ad lists some prominent features of the Bush presidency and has Romney’s plans matching them item for item. Here’s what the ad says: "You watched and worried. Two wars. Tax cuts for millionaires. Debt piled up. Mitt Romney's plan? A new $250,000 tax cut for millionaires. Increase military spending. Adding trillions to the deficit. Or President Obama's plan. A balanced approach. 4 trillion in deficit reduction. Millionaires pay a little more." In this fact check, we’ll look at the statement about the deficit. Would Romney’s plan add trillions while Obama’s cut the deficit by $4 trillion? Both candidates have put forward proposals, and independent analysts have tallied the impacts over the next 10 years. While predictions that far out are never guaranteed, they do provide some useful comparisons. Romney’s plan Romney has outlined specific tax cuts on his campaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax. Romney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent. To offset those cuts, Romney has suggested that he would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes. There are many tax breaks for individuals and businesses. Which ones will be reduced or eliminated? Romney doesn’t say. For individuals, two of the biggest are the home mortgage deduction and the tax-free treatment of health insurance benefits. For companies, industries from oil and gas to agriculture enjoy tax deductions and exemptions. Romney’s goal is to spur growth by giving people fewer opportunities and incentives to game the system. He promises that broadening the tax base will not be a back door tax hike. "Washington’s problem is not too little revenue," Romney says. "But rather, too much spending." On the expenditure side, Romney says he will bring federal spending below 20 percent of GDP by the end of his first term. Defense is not on the chopping block -- he would "reverse" the cuts proposed by President Obama -- but everything else is. Romney endorses capping non-security discretionary spending below 2008 levels. He would cap Medicaid, turn it into a block grant to the states and limit increases to 1 percent a year. We should note that Romney has been highly complimentary of the House Republican budget plan, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Romney says the plan moves in the direction he wants to go on spending. But the plans are not identical. For example, Romney favors more defense spending. And on taxes, Ryan would reduce the number of tax brackets to two, while Romney would keep the usual six. In Romney’s most detailed spending plan, he said he will "pursue further entitlement reform." He makes no specific proposals on Social Security or Medicare but says there are many options to keep both systems solvent. Romney says he will reduce the federal workforce by 10 percent and consolidate agencies. Romney’s lack of detail on both the tax and spending sides raises uncertainty among independent budget analysts. The Tax Policy Center, a collaboration of the Urban Institute and Brookings, said it was impossible to precisely gauge the impact on total tax revenues because Romney doesn’t say how he would expand the tax base. With no change in the tax base, the center estimated that by 2015, tax collections would be about $900 billion less than you would expect under current law. "That would be fine with me," said Chris Edwards, head of the libertarian Cato Institute’s project on downsizing the government. "But Romney should match it with equal proposed spending cuts, which I don’t think he’s done. He might give a percentage of GDP target for spending, but I think candidates should be specific." The Obama campaign cited an article by Josh Barro, now lead writer for the Bloomberg Ticker, as one of the sources of their claim that Romney’s plan would add trillions to the deficit. Barro estimates the 10-year cost of all of Romney’s tax cuts would be $5 trillion. But Barro himself says Romney is too vague for anyone to draw the definitive conclusion made in the Obama ad. "There’s a strong case to be made that it would add to the deficit," Barro told us. "But I would take it more as an opinion than a factual statement." Still, Barro is skeptical that Romney’s plan would hold up. "It is politically unlikely that you would be able to come up with enough spending cuts and base broadening to achieve $5 trillion in revenue reductions," he said. Finally, there is the assessment from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction. They estimate that Romney’s plan will increase the deficit by a total of $2.6 trillion by 2021. Jeff Vanke, senior policy analyst at the committee, says the Romney campaign consistently declines to describe how they will broaden the tax base and compensate for lower tax rates. "We’ve asked them several times if they can specify any offsetting reduction," Vanke said. "They have said each time that we’ll have to wait." Vanke’s tally of the missing numbers from theRomney plan looks like this: Revenue lost from reducing individual tax rates by 20 percent and eliminating the AMT -- $2.3 trillion Revenue lost from reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent-- $1.1 trillion Spending cuts needed to offset defense spending hikes -- $2.3 trillion Looking at a 10-year period through 2022, Vanke says Romney has not explained $5.7 trillion in tax changes and spending cuts. Obama’s plan The president’s plan for deficit reduction relies on a blend of tax reductions for some, tax hikes for others and spending cuts. On the tax side, he would allow the Bush tax cuts to expire for single people making over $200,000 and couples making over $250,000. Those higher-income earners would also see a drop in the tax benefit of their itemized deductions.The estate tax would go back up to 2009 levels. Big banks would pay as much as $61 billion more. He would eliminate tax breaks for oil and gas companies. Obama would extend the payroll tax cuts for employers with deeper reductions for firms with 20 workers or less. The corporate tax rate would fall from 35 percent to 28 percent. Like Romney, he would broaden the tax base by eliminating tax breaks. In contrast to Romney, Obama has an extensive list of tax breaks he would eliminate. They can be arcane. For example: Repeal last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories Determine the foreign tax credit on a pooling basis Repeal lower-of-cost-or-market inventory accounting method Eliminate special treatment of carried interest On the spending side, Obama proposes $580 billion in cuts to a number of programs that range from agricultural subsidies to rental assistance to airport construction. In 2011, Obama proposed some $320 billion in health program cuts. Washington would pay less to drug makers and nursing homes. In the long run, many states would shoulder a larger share of Medicaid costs. The Obama plan includes many hikes in user fees and related payments. Federal workers would pay more into their retirement fund. Higher income Medicare beneficiaries would pay more for Part B premiums and drug coverage. Air travelers would see a rise in the security fee added to a ticket. Gold and silver mining companies would pay higher royalties. Changing baselines The Obama campaign claims that over 10 years, it would trim deficits by $4 trillion. Many assumptions lie behind that statement but the most important question is, compared to what? No budget projection makes sense unless it’s measured against some baseline. A baseline is an analyst’s best guess as to what the deficit would be if things were left to themselves. Changes in tax law, government spending and economic growth are just some of the major factors that drive baseline estimates. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, looked at the president’s 2013 budget and concluded that it would increase the cumulative deficit by $3.5 trillion over its baseline between now and 2022. That greatly undercuts Obama’s argument that he is saving money. But the CBO baseline assumed that all of the Bush tax cuts and other tax breaks would expire. It assumed that Congress would stick to all the spending caps in the deficit reduction law it passed to avoid a government default. Many, if not most, analysts doubt that the CBO baseline is realistic. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has its own baseline. Unlike the CBO, it assumes that Congress will find a way around the deepest budget cuts and that it will extend the tax cuts to some degree. Where the CBO predicts that the total debt held by the public will stand at about 76 percent of GDP by 2022, the committee thinks the number will be more like 86 percent. It’s important to keep this in mind: A baseline that predicts a higher deficit, either in terms of dollars or as a percentage of the GDP, makes it easier for a deficit reduction plan to look good. The worse the problem is expected to be, the bigger the gains from a solution. By the way, the CBO does craft an alternative baseline. Under that one, the total debt would be about 93 percent of GDP in 2022. Using the baseline developed by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the president’s budget plan looks much better. Jason Peuquet, the committee’s research director, says it delivers about $2.4 trillion in new savings. Another group, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, estimates the number at $2.2 trillion. In order to get to $4 trillion, you need to add the savings that stem from spending cuts in 2011, both from the budget deal and earlier in the year. Obama includes those in his tally but they did not originate with his budget proposal. Peuquet warns that all numbers like these "can be gamed.". His group thinks the more important goal is to get deficits headed down relative to the size of the economy. On those terms, he says the president’s plan is a good start but does not go far enough. Our ruling The Obama campaign ad said Romney would increase the deficit by trillions while Obama would cut the deficit by $4 trillion. Obama's deficit reduction plan is much more specific than Romney's, but for a sitting president, that's expected. Still, independent analysts say that Romney's plan is so vague that it's difficult to know how his plan will impact the federal budget. What are missing are the politically sensitive details on which programs he would cut and which tax breaks he would reduce. What we do know indicates his plan could drive up deficits, potentially a great deal. The Obama plan offers enough details to estimate its impact with more accuracy. Independent analysts estimate savings of about $2.4 trillion over ten years due solely to his proposal. Obama’s plan on its own does not produce the full $4 trillion. Plus, estimates over 10 years are always uncertain and some analysts caution that achieving the $4 trillion goal by itself does less to solve the deficit problem than the president suggests.

pomt-04662	"We know there are more Democrats in Georgia than Republicans. We know that for a fact."	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/10/mike-berlon/which-party-has-more-supporters/	By most accounts, Georgia is as red politically as its famed clay. Not so, says the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party. "We know there are more Democrats in Georgia than Republicans. We know that for a fact," Mike Berlon said in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog as he and other party delegates gathered in Charlotte for the Democrats’ national convention. "The problem is, we don’t win because of turnout." It’s been nearly 20 years since a Democratic candidate for president won the state. Georgia’s governor, both of its U.S. senators and every statewide elected official are Republicans. In the Georgia Legislature, Republicans hold 115 of 180 House seats and 36 of 56 seats in the Senate. Considering such dominance, what’s the basis for claiming there are more Democrats in Georgia? Democratic leaders are hoping the state’s increasingly diverse electorate will help President Barack Obama pull off a victory in Georgia this year. Most polls, though, put Georgia on the Republican or leaning-Republican side of the scale. Berlon offered an explanation about why Democrats don’t win more statewide elections in the blog when he talked about turnout. Party spokesman Eric Gray forwarded us a spreadsheet that shows a slight majority of Georgians who voted in 2004 and 2008 elections considered themselves strong or leaned toward the Democrats. Gray said the data came from the Georgia secretary of state’s office, based on voter history. In Georgia, there is no partisan voter registration, so primaries are open to everyone regardless of party affiliation. And the secretary of state’s office doesn’t keep statistics on voters’ party preference. One way we attempted to glean which party has more voters was to examine the July 31, 2012, primary elections. Voters could choose whether to vote for candidates and various questions on the Democratic or Republican ballot. Most, by far, chose the GOP ballot. An average of 943,015 votes were cast on each Republican ballot question. An average of about 584,120 votes were cast on the four Democratic ballot questions. We also looked at the Feb. 5, 2008, presidential primaries, since both parties were choosing candidates to serve in the White House and both races were hotly contested. On that day, more Georgians voted in the Democratic Party primary than on the Republican ballot. We also looked at the Feb. 5, 2008, presidential primaries, since both parties were choosing candidates to serve in the White House and both races were hotly contested. On that day, more Georgians voted in the Democratic Party primary than on the Republican ballot. Nearly 1.1 million votes were cast on the Democratic side while about 960,000 votes were cast on the Republican side. The numbers for both elections were pulled from the secretary of state’s website. We also looked at polling data. Exit polls going back to 2006 and 2002 showed more Georgia voters identified themselves as Republican than Democrat, and the trend continued last year. A slim majority of Georgians identified themselves as Republicans in a December 2011 poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In the Mason-Dixon poll of 625 registered Georgia voters, 38 percent said they were Republicans, 35 percent identified themselves as Democrats and 27 percent claimed they were independents or were affiliated with another political party. The poll had a 4 percentage point margin of error. A Pew Research Center poll released in March 2008 found a near statistical tie in Georgia between those who identify themselves as Republicans (32 percent) and those who describe themselves as Democrats (31 percent). Berlon’s statement seems to have a sliver of support in a 2008 CNN exit poll following the general election that showed 38 percent of Georgia’s voters identified themselves as Democrats, and 35 percent identified as Republicans. Results of a survey conducted in August of this year for the liberal-leaning group Better Georgia seems to follow the trend of the 2008 exit poll. An August 2012 survey by 20/20 Insight of 1,500 registered Georgia voters reported 8 percent more voters identified as Democrats (39 percent) than Republicans (31 percent). The survey had a 2.5 percentage point margin of error. Despite those anomalies, a look at state voting patterns does not support Berlon’s statement, said Charles Bullock, a veteran political science professor at the University of Georgia. "Every one of the 15 statewide offices is filled by a Republican," Bullock said. "If we look at how people have actually voted, there is no evidence, at least in terms of voting behavior, that there are more Democrats than Republicans in the state." Gray described 2010 as a "wave election" in which Georgia Republicans had the advantage because many voters were angry about the economy and more energized. "Things were bad in 2010. Republicans were much more energized," he said. The party spokesman said the tide will turn in the Democrats’ favor this year. He also said the majority of Georgians who are not registered to vote are from demographic groups that typically vote for Democrats, such as African-Americans and Latinos. There’s little concrete evidence that definitively shows which party has more voters since Georgia does not allow partisan voter registration and the secretary of state’s office doesn’t keep statistics on voters’ party preference. There is some information that supports Berlon’s argument, and some that counter his claim. While more people voted Democrat in the 2008 primary, Republicans dominated in the 2010 statewide races, and more Georgians voted on the GOP ballot in July. The polling data says it’s close, but election results and the most recent makeup of the Georgia Legislature suggest there are more Georgians who consider themselves Republican.

pomt-06436	"My son had to resign his job because of federal regulations that Washington has put on us."	/texas/statements/2011/oct/22/anita-perry/anita-perry-says-federal-regulation-made-her-son-q/	Speaking in South Carolina, Anita Perry sympathized with a questioner who’d lost his job, saying her son, Griffin, recently gave up his job. According to a CNN account posted Oct. 14, 2011, the first lady of Texas said: "My son had to resign his job because of federal regulations that Washington has put on us." "He resigned his job two weeks ago because he can't go out and campaign with his father because of SEC regulations," she said, referring to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "He has a wife. ... He's trying to start a business. So I can empathize." Was America’s potential "first son" forced out by a federal reg? The CNN post says Griffin Perry worked for Deutsche Bank, which is a global investment bank that offers investment, financial and related products and services to private individuals, corporate entities and institutional clients. CNN’s story also says it was unclear what SEC regulations Anita Perry was referring to, but the "commission adopted a new rule last year aimed at limiting political activity on the part of investment advisers." That rule was described at the time as intended to stop employees of firms that advise government agencies on investing public funds from getting unfair edges on such contracts by making contributions to candidates with possible sway over who gets hired to give the advice. According to an SEC press release, the commission unanimously adopted the rule June 30, 2010, or about 18 months into Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency. At the time, SEC spokesman John Nester told us, the commission consisted of an Obama appointee and four appointees of his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. The commission had proposed a similar regulation in 1999, according to a June 30, 2010 New York Times news article. "Since then," the article says, "the SEC has brought enforcement actions against investment advisers in pay-to-play schemes involving public pension funds in states including California, Illinois, Ohio and Florida." The adopted rule doesn’t bar investment advisers from helping a candidate or even making huge campaign donations. However, an investment adviser risks being barred from getting paid for advising a government client for two years if any of certain employees make more than a minimal contribution--at most $350 per candidate per election--to a candidate or officeholder who could influence which firms get hired to advise agencies on investments. Also, the rule bars certain employees of such firms from soliciting contributions from others for a candidate or political committee, a practice known as bundling, if they also are providing or seeking government business. Nester told us the rule applies to senior staff members at investment advisory firms and employees who solicit business. Next, we wondered how the rule made Griffin Perry quit. According to information on the "Broker Check" website, overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Perry was a registered broker for Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in Dallas from May 2008 through Oct. 11, 2011. Information on an SEC website says he also was an investment adviser representative. We failed to pin down his duties, though. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Sigalit Grego had no comment. Perry’s campaign did not respond to our request to interview Griffin Perry. Deutsche Bank provides services for several Texas state agencies overseeing investment funds. Managers of the Permanent School Fund, the state’s public education endowment, use the firm as a broker, according to the Texas Education Agency. The Employees Retirement System of Texas told us the firm provides securities lending services, which is a way for investors to generate more money from stock without selling it. And Howard Goldman, spokesman for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, said Deutsche Bank is among 40 brokerage firms that assist that system by executing trades for stock and other investment vehicles. Inquiring into why Perry had to quit due to the rule, we heard from a Perry campaign spokesman, Ray Sullivan, that the son’s "contribution of time and effort, and likely participation in campaign fundraising (e.g., speaking at fundraising events), would have likely triggered the new rule and resulting sanctions." By email, Sullivan said the rule severely restricts employees such as investment advisers "from participating in the campaigns of incumbent state and local officials like Gov. Perry." "Griffin Perry was a financial adviser and is now understandably involved in his father's presidential campaign activities," Sullivan said. "Therefore he could not continue to be employed by the bank without jeopardizing a new SEC rules violation, which would have banned his employer from certain business in the state of Texas." Sullivan shared an article by Scott Gluck, a specialist in securities law, in the Oct. 6, 2011, Hedge Fund Law Report, saying the rule "applies to virtually all domestic fund managers seeking to manage money on behalf of public pension funds." The article says too that pitching in for a state official running for president can be problematic, specifying that contributions to "presidential candidate Gov. Rick Perry ... might trigger the rule." An SEC discussion of the rule when it was approved says the donation limit applies to donations to state officials seeking federal office "not because of the office he or she is running for, but as a result of an office he or she currently holds. So long as a (state or local) official has influence over the hiring of investment advisers as a function of his or her current office, contributions by an adviser could have the same effect, regardless to which of the official’s campaigns the adviser contributes." As much as donations are restricted, we noticed that the rule still permits someone at an investment firm to personally volunteer for a candidate. The SEC’s summary says: "A covered associate’s donation of his or her time generally would not be viewed as a contribution" in possible violation of the rule "if such volunteering were to occur during non-work hours." The summary also says the rule "does not in any way impinge on a wide range of expressive conduct in connection with elections. For example, the rule imposes no restrictions on activities such as making independent expenditures to express support for candidates, volunteering, making speeches, and other conduct." Sullivan, reminded of this element, replied: "Griffin will be involved in every part of the campaign, including raising the funds and volunteers we need." Pressed again, Sullivan asked: "Does the rule – in your view – allow Griffin to attend a luncheon fundraiser for or with his Dad? What are ‘non-work hours?’" We’re left not knowing the answers to several questions about the rule and Griffin Perry: Did his duties involve soliciting clients? Was he intent on bundling donations or contributing more than the rule’s permitted amount to the Perry campaign? Also, does Rick Perry’s position enable him to influence the hiring of particular outside advisers by state agencies managing public funds? If not, the rule would not be a factor. We’re left not knowing the answers to several questions about the rule and Griffin Perry: Did his duties involve soliciting clients? Was he intent on bundling donations or contributing more than the rule’s permitted amount to the Perry campaign? Also, does Rick Perry’s position enable him to influence the hiring of particular outside advisers by state agencies managing public funds? If not, the rule would not be a factor. Among experts on the regulation, Washington lawyer Ian Lanoff, former fiduciary counsel to the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, reminded us Perry might have pitched in for the campaign and kept his job because the rule "permits an employee of a state pension fund investment adviser to perform political volunteer work as long as his firm doesn't subsidize the volunteer work he performs." Terry Nelson, a Wisconsin lawyer versed in securities issues, said: "A large organization like that, they’re probably going to cut ties to people who bring them issues that hamper the business they can conduct in a big state like Texas, no matter what your name is." Indeed, Sullivan later emailed us that a lawyer for Deutsche Bank closely reviewed the SEC rule and "determined that Griffin could not work on his Dad's presidential campaign and remain employed at the bank. The risk of SEC penalties against the bank were too real and significant. The bank and (Perry) determined that his resignation was the best course of action to provide him the ability to be involved in every aspect of the presidential campaign and not run afoul" of the rule. Our ruling Given the unknowns, it’s tempting to say we can’t judge Anita Perry’s claim. It’s possible Griffin Perry could have volunteered for the campaign and kept his job. But we think it’s more reasonable to conclude that the SEC rule hastened his departure. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Anita Perry	None	None	None	2011-10-22T06:00:00	2011-10-14	['None']
pomt-08852	Repealing the sales tax on boats in Rhode Island has spawned 2,000 companies, 7,000 jobs and close to $2 billion a year in sales activity.	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/08/donald-carcieri/carcieri-says-tax-repeal-spawned-new-business/	The furor over U.S. Sen. John Kerry’s yacht being docked on the tax-free shores of Rhode Island -- not in Massachusetts where he lives -- has subsided now that the senator’s team has promised he will pay the $500,000 in owed taxes. But Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri did his part to make sure the underlying issue of Rhode Island’s tax exemption for boats is not forgotten. In one of the governor’s frequent appearances on Fox News’ "The Neil Cavuto Show," Carcieri touted the positive effect of the sales tax repeal on boat sales, the marine industry and the state’s economy as a whole. "We abolished the tax on boats back in 1993 and in the intervening period we have over 2,000 little companies that have been spawned, employing almost 7,000 people, generating close to $2 billion a year in sales activity," an enthusiastic Carcieri told Cavuto, a conservative pundit from Barrington, R.I., who seems tickled by the Ocean State connection. It’s no wonder Carcieri was excited. With the nation's fourth-highest unemployment rate, Rhode Island rarely gets to brag about any positive job news. And it's clear the sales tax repeal -- enacted under then-Governor Bruce Sundlun -- helped rescue a sector that was taking on water by the early 1990s, having struggled after a boom in previous decades. Following the law's passage, boat registrations in Rhode Island increased every year for two decades before declining slightly during the recent recession. But those are big numbers for a fairly narrow industry and they warrant a careful check. The Carcieri administration told us that prior to the interview, they put out a request to several state agencies for data demonstrating the impact of the tax repeal. The state Economic Development Corporation directed them to two studies by the Rhode Island Marine Trades Association: one from 2008 that focused on the skills gap in the industry and another from 2007 that looked at the effect of the repeal. We got a hold of those reports and it appears the governor is close to correct. The studies collectively find that the Rhode Island marine industry includes 6,600 jobs across 2,300 companies, which generates $1.6 billion a year in sales activity. The numbers don't exactly line up, but they're fairly close to those that Carcieri cited. The sales tax study does not make clear how it arrived at the final tallies and the Marine Trades Association refused to explain its methodology, saying it was confidential. The second study tries harder to explain its approach. It relied on a combination of 136 survey results, as well as U.S. Economic Census numbers and economic modeling, to determine the totals. The researchers started by using the ratio of payroll to sales obtained from the 2002 U.S. Economic Census to determine the number of jobs, companies and total sales in what they call "core marine trades industries." It then appears that they added those numbers to a secondary group of similarly calculated figures that included companies considered to be "indirect marine trades businesses." That math makes sense to us. But then the study offers this caveat: "In 2006, Rhode Island had approximately 1,700 businesses at least some of whose sales could be attributed to the state's 'direct' marine trades industries. Exactly how much was attributable to marine trades is impossible to determine from employment data reported by the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training." Put another way, there are a lot of companies in this state that may devote some, but not all, of their business to the boating industry. Paul Harden, manager of business and workforce development for the state Economic Development Corporation, offered a hypothetical example of a canvas textile company. It could manufacture boat covers, as well as awnings for shops. One product is clearly connected to the industry, the other is not. That unknown makes it difficult to track the number of jobs created and the business generated within the company specifically for marine work. Based on experience, Harden, who helped oversee the Marine Trades study, said researchers assigned estimated percentages that each subcategory of business devotes to marine sales. He acknowledged that it is an imperfect science. That's where Carcieri's claim gets a little shaky. He suggests the tallies are official, despite the study's stipulation that it is "impossible" to pinpoint an exact number. But the bigger issue is that Carcieri says that all of these jobs, businesses and sales activity were "spawned" by the 1993 tax repeal on boats, which the study never concludes. It seems clear that the repeal had a positive effect on the industry, but some of the businesses and jobs predated the repeal. "I don't think you can attribute all the job growth and all the sales activity to the repeal of the sales tax," said Harden, of the EDC. Given the study's limits, we tried to verify the numbers independently. We started with the state Division of Taxation. But because boats are not taxed, their sales are not reported to the division, said Tax Administrator David Sullivan. And the department doesn't collect data on marine-related sales. Next we spoke with the state Department of Labor and Training, which collects data on jobs and companies in different industries. Similar to the Marine Trades study, its data shows that in 2009, approximately 4,560 people were employed in "primary marine industries." A second class of "related industries" adds about another 1,400 jobs for a total of close to 6,000. But here again, a DLT spokeswoman said it's impossible to know just how many of those related jobs are definitively connected to the marine sector. Realistically, the number probably falls somewhere between 4,560 and 6,000, both of which are lower than the number Carcieri cites. And again, that's total jobs, not those "spawned" solely by the sales tax repeal. Carcieri got it right by doing his research before spouting statistics on national television, and the studies he cites offer some measurable data. However, it is impossible to know how precise those numbers are and the governor should have offered that caveat. More troublesome, he should never have said the tax repeal "spawned" what amounts to an entire industry. We find this Half True.

pomt-11476	"The US has approximately 5% of the world's population and 42% of civilian gun ownership."	/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/05/pricey-harrison/does-america-have-42-percent-worlds-guns/	In the aftermath of the mass shooting at a high school in Florida, politicians and pundits quickly offered facts and figures about guns in the United States. NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said that in one year, mass public shootings caused more deaths and injuries in France than in the United States throughout the entire Obama administration. (That’s Mostly False.) Bernie Sanders said that "40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks." (That’s False.) In North Carolina, Democratic state Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro recently tweeted statistics that emphasize America’s obsession with guns. "The US has approximately 5% of the world's population and 42% of civilian gun ownership," Harrison tweeted on Feb. 15. She has about 4,000 Twitter followers. She continued: "We must change the gun culture to gun violence prevention. NC Dems have filed comprehensive gun safety bills repeatedly since the Sandy Hook tragedy w/zero movement." She’s roughly correct about the United States accounting for 5 percent of the world’s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Experts agree that Americans have more guns than citizens of any other country in the world. But, globally speaking, is Harrison right about the United States’ share of gun ownership? 10-year-old stats She cited a story on Vox.com – "America’s gun problem, explained in 5 facts" – as the source for her tweet. Vox, for its part, cites a 2007 study by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey. "... in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people," the writer, German Lopez, explained. "Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms," Lopez wrote. The Switzerland-based group actually offered a less specific estimate. On page 46 of the survey itself, the group estimated that the United States is home to "roughly 35-50 percent" of the world’s civilian-owned guns. Lopez, for his part, told PolitiFact that he split the difference in the range. "It's pretty typical in research to just take the average of a range," he said. "So the range here is 35-50. If you take the average of this, it lands at about 42. That's with a margin of error of about 7.5, obviously, but it's just a shorthand for what the research finds." The Small Arms Study from 2007 remains the most comprehensive research private gun ownership worldwide, said Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama and author of the widely-cited study "Public Mass Shooters and Firearms: A Cross-National Study of 171 Countries," published in 2016. The Small Arms Study is an independent research project located at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva that’s supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as donations from other governments. The project compiles data using a "worldwide network" of researchers. Lankford agreed with Lopez’s methodology. If you take the survey’s average total of civilian firearms in the U.S. (270 million) and compare that with the survey’s average total globally (645 million), you get 41.8 percent. Guns are hard to track A 2009 National Institute of Justice report found the number of civilian-owned guns in the United States to be about 310 million, but didn't provide comparable global data. Pew Research Center, one of the world’s leading nonpartisan research firms, recently published a study on guns in America that found 42 percent of Americans live in a household with a gun. But the center hasn’t collected data from other countries, "so we can’t compare our US gun data to the rest of the world," spokeswoman Haley Nolan said. Governments don’t track firearms across the board. And many surveys rely on people to self-report guns. "We only have a rough guess of what there is in the U.S. We have no idea how many guns are in South America," said Philip J. Cook, professor of public policy studies at Duke University and co-author of the book "Gun Violence: The Real Costs." South America has a lot of guns that were bought underground, he said. In the ballpark? David Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard University and author of the book "Private Guns, Public Health," agreed that global estimates are squishy. "It’s very, very hard," Hemenway said. The best way to estimate the number of firearms in each country would be to have every country track guns that are bought and sold, he said. "Even then, you only get the legal guns." That said, he thinks Harrison’s claim is generally accurate compared to other estimates. "That sort of number is thrown around all the time," Hemenway said. "It’s pretty high validity. This seems to be in the ballpark of the figures I’ve seen." Our ruling Harrison said that the United States has approximately 5 percent of the world's population and 42 percent of civilian gun ownership. Those numbers are based on a study that’s now 10 years old. And experts say tracking guns is very difficult. But Harrison’s claim is on roughly par with the information available. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Pricey Harrison	None	None	None	2018-03-05T15:27:33	2018-02-15	['None']
pomt-12337	Says Senate deliberations on the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010 included hundreds of hours of debate and more than 100 Republican amendments, compared with zero for the American Health Care Act this year.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-tweet-exaggerates-lack-input-senate/	Amid criticism that Senate Republicans are working in secret to craft legislation that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted a graphic that tried to make that argument in stark statistical terms. The graphic, which Sanders tweeted on June 13, 2017, is titled, "Health Care Reform: Then and Now." It limits its comparison to the Senate, and it looks at two periods -- 2009 to 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was under consideration, and 2017, for the legislation the Senate is currently working on. (The House has already passed its version of a bill, the American Health Care Act.) Sanders’ graphic said that when Democrats were crafting the Affordable Care Act, they allowed 160 hours of debate; 100 "committee hearings, roundtables, or walkthroughs"; and more than 171 amendments from the opposite party. Currently, though, the graphic accuses Republicans now working on the repeal-and-replace bill of allowing none of those things -- hammered home with a string of red zeroes. How does the graphic add up? See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Debating Obamacare in 2009 and 2010 The left column is the more accurate of the two. When the Affordable Care Act was being put together, both the Senate and House passed distinct versions of the bill, but Democrats then lost a pivotal Senate seat in a special election, dropping their numbers below the crucial 60-seat threshold. Congressional leaders decided to have the House accede to the already-passed Senate version and then work out the differences in a subsequent round of legislation known as reconciliation. When we contacted Sanders’ office, spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis provided us with extensive documentation for the numbers relating to the debate over the Affordable Care Act. They sent us to a Senate Finance Committee fact sheet that includes six pages of detail on how the Senate version of the bill moved through the chamber. They also sent us several other documents about the legislative process in 2009 and 2010, as well as a February 2010 Obama administration letter that touted the "160 hours" the Senate had spent on the floor considering health insurance reform legislation On the hours of debate, Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the numbers seem broadly accurate. For the initial Senate version of what became the Affordable Care Act, the Senate started debating the bill in earnest on Nov. 21, 2009, and passed the bill on Dec. 24. Between those dates, "the Senate debated the bill nearly every day it was in session," Smith said. Meanwhile, news reports generally support the idea that there were 100 hours of committee meetings and other types of official events. The New York Times reported that "in June and July 2009, with Democrats in charge, the Senate health committee spent nearly 60 hours over 13 days marking up the bill that became the Affordable Care Act. That September and October, the Senate Finance Committee worked on the legislation for eight days — its longest markup in two decades." We previously fact-checked a claim related to Republican amendments. Combining the Republican amendments approved in markups at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, the number of approved Republican amendments was close to the 171 cited in the infographic. That said, it’s worth remembering, as we reported, that most of these amendments were technical in nature, and only two of them were passed via the more rigorous roll-call vote process used for more substantive matters. The debate on repeal-and-replace in 2017 But if the left-hand column is pretty on target, the right-hand column -- covering the debate in 2017 -- cherry-picks a time frame that prevents an equitable comparison. That’s because the graphic compares a completed bill with one that hasn’t yet advanced very far in the process. It’s a case of comparing apples and oranges. One of the three "zeros" in the chart may be justified -- the one that refers to time spent in committee hearings. Senate Republicans intend to bring the bill now being written directly to the floor once it’s analyzed for cost and impact by the Congressional Budget Office. That would mean bypassing the typical committee process. Sanders’ office pointed to recent public comments by the chairmen of the relevant committees saying that they had no plans to take up the bill before floor consideration. However, the zeros for floor debate and amendments are more questionable. Senate Republicans want to address the bill through a "reconciliation" process, which would enable passage with 51 votes rather than 60 votes to first cut off debate. If they take this course, there would be 20 hours of floor debate under rules for reconciliation bills. Twenty hours is significantly less than the 160 hours spent on the Affordable Care Act, but it’s certainly not the zero suggested in the graphic. "There will be debate on the current proposal after it is introduced," said John Cannan, a law librarian at Drexel University who has written about the legislative history of the Affordable Care Act. As for amendments, there will be an opportunity to consider some on the floor according to reconciliation rules, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist. (Without committee consideration, amendments in committee will be impossible, however.) Sanders’ office acknowledged that the graphic captures a moment in time. "Clearly, 2017 is ongoing, and the bill hasn’t passed the Senate yet, so the numbers in the right column might need to be updated at some point," Miller-Lewis said. Still, this amounts to a flawed comparison and a statistically exaggerated picture, punctuated by a string of bold zeros. Our ruling Sanders’ graphic said that Senate deliberations on the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010 included hundreds of hours of debate and more than 100 Republican amendments, compared with zero for the American Health Care Act this year. Sanders has a point that the Democratic process in 2009 and 2010 included more active involvement by Republicans than Republicans are allowing in the current debate over the repeal-and-replace legislation. However, it’s misleading for Sanders to make this point through an apples-to-oranges comparison that produces eye-catching zeros that will soon be rendered out of date. Under Senate rules, there will be debate and amendments. We rate the statement in the image Half True.

pomt-04223	"For the first time in history, the share of the national popular vote margin is smaller than the Latino vote margin."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/26/robert-menendez/us-sen-robert-menendez-says-latino-voters-made-dif/	For U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, Latino voters made history this month as the decisive force behind President Barack Obama winning the popular vote over Republican candidate Mitt Romney. About a week after the election, the Democratic senator claimed the race marked the first time when the popular vote was decided by Latino voters. Going forward, Republicans must face the growing electoral power of the Latino community, according to Menendez. "For the first time in history, the share of the national popular vote margin is smaller than the Latino vote margin," Menendez said at a Nov. 14 event hosted by the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. The senator is correct that Latino voters in 2012 made the difference in securing Obama’s popular vote victory. But Menendez’s claim about this scenario occurring "for the first time in history" needs clarification. Latino voters also delivered more than enough votes to make Vice President Al Gore the popular vote winner in 2000. But unlike Gore, Obama won both the popular vote and received enough electoral votes to win the election. That means this year’s election marks the first time when Latino voters played a decisive role in electing the president, according to the founders of Latino Decisions, a Seattle, Wash.-based polling research firm. The firm’s research has been widely cited by numerous media organizations, including the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. The senator’s claim is based on a recent study by Latino Decisions, in which it analyzed the results of a nationwide poll of Latinos conducted in the days leading up to the election. Based on that poll, Latino Decisions estimated that Latinos gave Obama a net gain of 5.4 percent of all popular votes. Since Obama won the overall popular vote by about 2.8 percent, Latino voters put Obama over the finish line, according to Gary Segura, a political science professor and co-founder of Latino Decisions. Applying the same methodology to exit polling data used by the Associated Press and major U.S. newspapers and television networks, PolitiFact New Jersey reached a similar conclusion. But a similar scenario occurred in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote by a smaller margin than the net gain he received from Latino voters, according to exit polling data compiled by The New York Times. Yet since Gore didn’t get enough electoral votes to win the presidency, 2012 marks the first year when Latino voters played a decisive role in a presidential election, according to Segura and Matt Barreto, also a political science professor and co-founder of Latino Decisions. Barreto told us in an e-mail that Menendez’s comments "are based entirely on our research, and the spirit of the comments were that Latinos ‘made a difference’ in the national election results for the first time ever -- that is accurate since Gore lost the EC (electoral college) vote." Kerri Talbot, Menendez’s chief counsel, echoed Barreto’s argument, saying the point of Menendez’s speech was that 2012 "was the first time Latinos made a difference in the national election." "I understand your point about the 2000 election popular vote but the Latino vote was not decisive in that election given that Gore lost in the electoral college," Talbot said in an e-mail. Our ruling About a week after Obama won re-election, Menendez claimed: "For the first time in history, the share of the national popular vote margin is smaller than the Latino vote margin." The senator’s correct that Latino voters put Obama over the top in winning the popular vote, according to both a Latino Decisions poll and exit polling data. But Menendez should have been clearer about the historic nature of the Latino vote in 2012. The 2000 election was the first time when Latino voters delivered more than enough votes for a popular vote victory, but this year’s election marks the first time when Latinos were decisive in electing the overall winner, according to the founders of Latino Decisions.

pomt-03103	"Governor Deal has increased education spending every year he’s been in office."	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/23/brian-robinson/does-education-budget-claim-add/	There have been some interesting moves in the political chess match between Gov. Nathan Deal and Georgia Schools Superintendent John Barge. Barge made the first by surprising the political establishment with his interest, and eventual announcement, that he would challenge the fellow Republican for his job in 2014. Deal made the next move. The governor’s camp attempted to take away the main issue his new opponent will campaign on in advance of the Republican Party primary -- education. "Governor Deal has increased education spending every year he’s been in office," said his spokesman, Brian Robinson. Checkmate? PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some homework on this claim, considering the likelihood that the Deal campaign may present this point again. Georgia’s budget runs on a 12-month fiscal year cycle. The current fiscal year began July 1 and ends June 30, 2014. Deal took office in January 2011. Education typically accounts for the biggest spending item in the state budget. This fiscal year, the Georgia Legislature agreed to spend about $7.4 billion on k-12 education. The entire state budget was nearly $20 billion. Georgia gets additional money from the federal government and other sources. That figure has declined from about $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $1.7 billion in each year since. Robinson said he was referring to the total amount of money budgeted for the state’s Education Department at the end of the fiscal year. In most years, those numbers are adjusted as state revenue increases or declines and departments make additional budget requests. FY 2011: $7,067,414,444 FY 2012: $7,075,837,688 FY 2013 $7,326,807,956 The budget adopted for Fiscal Year 2014 was $7,409,293,094. The numbers matched fiscal year funding data from the Education Department. In each fiscal year, as Robinson said, the final budget numbers for the state Education Department increased. But is that the whole story? Georgia’s public school enrollment has increased by about 28,000 students, to nearly 1.7 million pupils, in the three budget cycles since Deal took office. Some people we contacted noted the enrollment increase as we conducted our research. The education budget has risen by a slightly larger percentage than student enrollment, we found. Others say there’s some context that Robinson’s numbers miss. The Georgia School Boards Association says Deal is not devoting enough money toward education if you factor in inflation. The Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released a report earlier this month that concluded Georgia’s per-student spending will decline by about 1 percent this year once you factor in inflation. The center, a left-leaning organization, found Georgia has spent nearly 15 percent less on students since fiscal year 2008. Only seven states spent a lower percentage on students, according to the report. The left-leaning Georgia Budget Policy Institute, which has pushed state leaders to spend more on education, has looked at the education budget under Deal. It found the education budget has increased by 1.5 percent since Deal took office, as adjusted for inflation. The U.S. inflation rate has risen by 3 percent to 4 percent since 2011, according to data we reviewed. There’s been a 4 percent increase in the final state education budgets since Deal took office. The institute released a report earlier this year that concluded the education budget is $1 billion less than what schools should get under Georgia’s complicated Quality Basic Education formula. Claire Suggs, the institute’s senior education policy analyst, said the education budget has been underfunded for several years. Here’s a recent breakdown of the QBE funding gap, also known as "austerity cuts." The numbers came from the Georgia Department of Education. FY 2011: $1,089,521,696 FY 2012: $1,147,859,436 FY 2013: $1,143,762,797 FY 2014: $1,061,127,407 Since the 2003 fiscal year, state leaders have subtracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the funding formula every year. Initially, they said the austerity cuts were necessary because of a budget deficit, but the yearly cuts continued even after state revenue improved, The Atlanta Journal Constitution has reported. "It’s not been addressed," Suggs said of the issue. State Sen. Fran Millar, a Dunwoody Republican who served as chairman of the Senate's Education and Youth Committee, said he believed Robinson is correct, citing recent year-end budget numbers for the department. Millar also said austerity cuts for the Education Department have been less than other departments. "I think what they’re saying is true," Millar said of Robinson’s claim. To sum up, Deal’s spokesman said education spending has increased every year since his administration took office in January 2011. Robinson’s numbers are correct. But there’s some context missing here. There have been continued "austerity cuts." And some would say there’s little or no increase once you factor in inflation. We rate Robinson’s statement Mostly True.	None	Brian Robinson	None	None	None	2013-09-23T06:00:00	2013-09-05	['None']
pomt-07366	"Nearly 2,000 high schools - roughly 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States - produce about half of the nation’s dropouts."	/virginia/statements/2011/may/06/bobby-scott/rep-scott-says-12-percent-high-schools-produce-hal/	U.S. Rep Bobby Scott cited a staggering statistic when he announced he was introducing a measure to curb the high school dropout rate. "Nearly 2,000 high schools - roughly 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States - produce about half of the nation’s dropouts," Scott, D-3rd, said in an April 7 news release. Is it true that such a small percentage of the nation’s high schools have such a large impact on the country’s dropout problem? Scott’s office directed us to a 2007 report by Robert Balfanz, co-director of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University and a widely quoted expert on the dropout issue. Based on 2006 data, the report classified 1,999 high schools across the nation as "low performing." Balfanz said these schools, representing about 14 percent of the nation’s regular and vocational high schools enrolling 100 or more students, reliably produced 50 percent of America’s dropouts. He dubbed them dubbed "dropout factories." An even greater share of the nation’s minority dropouts came from these schools: 81 percent of Native Americans; 73 percent of African-Americans and 66 percent of Latinos. They were attended by 34 percent of the white dropouts. Scott accurately characterized the numbers in the report. But the study is several years old and we wanted to take an updated look. Balfanz re-examined the issue with other researchers in a 2010 report titled "Building a Grad Nation." Using U.S. Department of Education figures, the authors found the number of the country’s worst-performing schools had fallen from 2,007 in 2002 to 1,746 in 2008. The study was co-sponsored by the America’s Promise Alliance. Co-founded by retired Army General and Secretary of State Colin Powell, the non-profit group has proposed a "Civic Marshall Plan" to increase the number of students completing high school. A March 2011 update of the "Building a Grad Nation" study found that in 2009, the latest year statistics are available, the number of dropout factories fell yet again to 1,634. Those 1,634 low-performing schools represent about 10 to 12 percent of the nation’s high schools and still produce about half of the nation’s drop outs, said Colleen Wilber, a spokeswoman for the America’s Promise Alliance. Every state has at least one "dropout factory," which Balfanz defines as a school in which at least 40 percent of freshmen fail to make it to their senior year. For high schools that only have grades 10-12, his reports examine how sophomore year enrollment compares to the senior year. The reports do not identify any of the troubled schools by name. The largest number are in the South. Virginia had 29 of them in 2009, 25 in 2008, and 26 back in 2002. Scott’s bill -- also introduced in the Senate by Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa -- would strengthen regulations developed in 2008 that require states to use the same formula in reporting high school graduation rates. It would set a national graduation rate goal of 90 percent. The national high school graduation was 74.9 percent in 2008, the last year data was available. To sum up: Scott said that nearly 2,000 high schools, about 12 percent of those in the U.S., produce half the nation’s dropouts. He accurately cited a report based on 2006 data. An updated study found the number of low-performing schools dropped to 1,634 in 2009. That does not diminish Scott’s point that a small percentage of high schools have an enormous impact on the nation’s dropout problem. We rate Scott’s claim True.

pomt-04018	Says the claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without background checks traces to information gathered before background checks were even required.	/texas/statements/2013/feb/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-claim-40-percent-guns-are-sold-witho/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, participating in a U.S. Senate committee hearing on gun-related proposals, warmed up to a Jan. 30, 2013, question by referring to "much attention" drawn by some advocates to gun purchases occurring without background checks. "Indeed, the statistic of 40 percent has been bandied about," the Texas Republican said. "Now that statistic is unfortunately based on a study that occurred before the background check went into effect, and so it is a highly dubious figure." Cruz was evidently referring to claims by gun-control advocates that 40 percent of gun purchases are made without the purchaser undergoing a criminal background check. This happens, they say, because the purchases are made from private individuals, who are not required to check purchasers backgrounds. Advocates of a law requiring universal background checks have widely cited the 40-percent figure. President Barack Obama mentioned it in the White House ceremony outlining his slate of new gun restrictions. A white paper by researchers at Johns Hopkins University asserts it without qualification. Indeed, it’s a powerful claim: that 40 percent of guns are bought and sold in America with no paper trail, no fingerprint of the hands they fall into. Coincidentally, our colleagues at PolitiFact’s national website posted a review of the 40-percent claim on the day that Cruz made his comment, rating as Half True this statement by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.: "Today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check." We drew on research behind that fact check to get started on Cruz’s claim. The 1997 study The 40 percent figure originated in a 1997 National Institute of Justice study by researchers Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, who examined data from a 1994 telephone survey about gun ownership taken months after the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 took effect, mandating background checks of individuals buying guns at gun shops. Under the law, federally licensed dealers must verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime or declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons. Typically this is done online and takes less than a day. But only licensed dealers must conform. The law doesn’t apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. If a private seller suspects that a buyer would be disqualified under federal rules, then they can’t go through with the sale. But there is no background check. The 1994 survey, which sampled 2,568 homes, asked owners an array of questions, including how many guns were in the house, what they were used for, how they were stored and where they were obtained. Of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun. In those answers, Cook and Ludwig found that 35.7 percent of respondents reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. (That has been rounded up to 40 percent.) Some people answered "probably" and "probably not" if they weren’t entirely sure whether the seller was a licensed dealer. In some cases, where the respondent skipped the question about whether the gun came from a licensed dealer, the researchers made a judgment call. Ludwig said in an email that they mined answers to other questions (such as whether the gun was a gift) to guide them. "Our approach ... was to be conservative in estimating what fraction of sales are in the primary market," Ludwig wrote. "Primary market" refers to guns sold by dealers in retail stores or pawn shops. The "secondary market" includes gun shows and other transactions where a background check is not required. Another fact check Some critics find fault with the 40 percent figure because it includes guns that are inherited or won—in other words, transactions that could reasonably be assumed not to involve a background check, which could mean a different look at the answers generates a different percentage. When the Washington Post’s fact-checking project, the Fact Checker, asked Ludwig to revisit the data, the newspaper said, results suggested that purchases without background checks amounted to 14 to 22 percent, not 40 percent. "And since the survey sample is so small, that means the results have a survey caveat: plus or minus six percentage points," the Post said. "Moreover, … the survey was taken in late 1994, eight months after the Brady law went into effect, and the questions were asked about gun purchases in the previous two years. So some of the answers concerned gun purchases that took place in a pre-Brady environment." Current-day applicability For his part, Cook, the other study author, told us he has no idea whether the 40 percent figure remains reliable. "This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers," Cook said. "How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number." Other scholars had similar views. "I don’t see how anyone could know that number," said James Jacobs, Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law. By telephone, we asked Cook about Cruz’s statement—that the percentage is dubious because the research took place before background checks were mandated. The surveys took place after the law took effect, Cook said, but it’s correct that the vast majority of gun acquisitions identified by respondents took place before then, given that respondents were asked to focus on guns acquired within two years, meaning 1992 and 1993. Of note: Most of the respondents had acquired at least one gun well before the Brady law took effect. "Persons owning handguns in 1994 acquired about 28 percent of them in 1993-1994," Cook and Ludwig wrote, "compared with 20 percent of long guns." States conducted background checks Another wrinkle: Eighteen states were imposing background checks before the federal mandate took effect, according to a research paper by Ludwig and Cook published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in August 2000. The states doing so included California, New York, Florida, Illinois and Michigan. Even so, Cook told us, he and Ludwig did not use information on individual states in doing their analysis. He emailed that "the survey provides an accurate representation of the nation as a whole but not of individual states." Also, he stressed, the survey had no questions about whether there had been a background check and respondents also weren’t asked the states where they had acquired their guns. He agreed there is "no way to reach any conclusions about background checks for any of the transactions that are reported in the survey." As we closed out this review, Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton pointed out by email that 32 states were evidently not requiring background checks before the Brady law took effect. The 40-percent statistic is dubious, Rushton said, "because it is not an accurate reflection of the number of gun transactions without background checks that are happening today." Our ruling Cruz said the claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without background checks traces to information gathered before background checks were required. However, the 1994 survey took place a few months after federal law mandated background checks--and about one third of states were requiring the checks even earlier. Given the infancy of the Brady law, it still may be that few respondents underwent the mandated checks. Significantly, respondents were not asked if they had undergone such checks or in which states they had acquired their guns. Summing up: Some background checks were ongoing at the time of the survey. Still, Cruz’s statement drives at the fact that the oft-quoted survey was conducted nearly two decades ago, before the federal law had time to have much effect.

pomt-11953	In Wisconsin, "we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/06/chris-taylor/wake-las-vegas-lawmaker-says-wisconsin-bill-would-/	At a news conference in response to the Las Vegas mass shooting, Wisconsin state Rep. Chris Taylor made a claim about a bill that’s advancing in the Wisconsin Legislature. The Madison Democrat said on Oct. 4, 2017, three days after the shooting: Unfortunately, the other thing that we see after these horrible massacres is a loosening of gun laws, allowing dangerous individuals to get firearms more easily. That seems to be the trend in this country. Right here, in our own state, we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools -- even around schools. Let’s see if that’s what the bill would do. The bill’s history and status Taylor was referring to Senate Bill 169, which was introduced by two GOP lawmakers in April 2017. In September 2017, 11 days before a gunman killed 58 people and wounded 489 in Las Vegas, the bill was approved by a Senate committee. The three Republicans voted yes and the two Democrats no. The full Senate could take up the bill later in 2017 or in 2018. Both the state Senate and the Assembly are controlled by Republicans. But GOP Gov. Scott Walker has cast some doubt on the legislation, saying in June 2017 it was "appropriate" for the state to require people to get permits to carry hidden weapons. The bill vs. current law To be clear, under current state law, certain people, such as felons, are prohibited from possessing a gun. Generally speaking, it is legal in Wisconsin to openly carry a firearm without any training or license to carry. But a state license is needed to carry a concealed firearm. Now let’s get to how concealed carry would change under the bill, according a memo by the nonpartisan Legislative Council and Larry Konopacki, the state attorney who wrote it: Licensing: Currently, it is generally illegal in Wisconsin to carry a concealed weapon unless you have a concealed carry weapon (CCW) license issued by the state. A background check and training are required to get a license. The bill would do away with the licensing requirement -- which means no training or background check would be required to carry a concealed weapon. So, the "no training, no background check" part of Taylor’s claim is correct. Schools: Currently, guns are generally prohibited on school grounds. The bill would do away with that blanket prohibition. Instead, individual schools could ban guns on their grounds. But people with a CCW license would still be able to bring their guns on the grounds, as long as the guns stayed in their vehicle or within five feet of their vehicle. (The provision was included so that parents who carry weapons aren’t breaking the law when they pick up and drop off their children at school, supporters say.) Those with licenses would also be free to bring guns onto any school grounds when there were no school activities. But Taylor’s claim was "around schools," so let’s be clear on that. Currently, only CCW license holders are generally allowed to possess firearms within 1,000 feet of school grounds. Under the bill, anyone who legally possesses a firearm could generally carry within 1,000 feet of school grounds. It's worth noting that while carrying within 1,000 feet of school would be made legal under state law, generally speaking, people would still be in violation of federal law if carrying a concealed weapon within 1,000 feet from a school if they don't have a concealed carry license. Prohibitions: Currently, it is generally illegal for certain persons -- such as people convicted of any felony, or of a misdemeanor involving domestic violence -- to possess a gun at all. The bill would not change that general prohibition. However, it would allow even those people who are generally prohibited to be able to legally carry, open or concealed, antique, replica and muzzleloading firearms. So, to Taylor’s claim, even felons could concealed carry those certain types of firearms and they could do so within 1,000 feet of a school. Our rating Taylor said in Wisconsin, "we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools." The "every single person" part of the claim needs clarification, in that not every person, particularly felons, can legally possess any type of weapon. But Taylor is correct that if the bill becomes law, people could generally carry concealed weapons without getting a license -- which would mean no background check or training would be required, either. And even felons could conceal carry certain weapons, such as antique or replica guns. As for around schools, anyone who can legally possess a firearm could generally carry it concealed within 1,000 feet of a school, under the bill. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. Note: This item was updated on Oct. 6, 2017 to make reference to the federal law on carrying a weapon near a school. This does not change the rating. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Chris Taylor	None	None	None	2017-10-06T13:40:58	2017-10-04	['Wisconsin']
pomt-02315	"No one" claims the report vindicating New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the bridge scandal is "conclusive."	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/30/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-no-one-says-bridge-report-vindicates-new-/	The first in a series of investigations into a bridge-closing scandal surrounding Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his office was released this week, providing plenty of fodder on the political future of the potential 2016 heavyweight on all five Sunday talk shows. Randy Mastro of the New York law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, unveiled a report March 26, 2014, that exonerated Christie of any wrongdoing and blamed a top aide of the governor and a senior official for the Port Authority for devising a scheme to close parts of the George Washington Bridge for a traffic study in September 2013. Reports have alleged the maneuver was political retribution against officials in Fort Lee, N.J., which was most impacted by the lane closures. Christie’s critics scoffed at Mastro’s report, noting that it was commissioned by the governor and paid for with New Jersey taxpayer dollars. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was asked on Meet the Press whether the findings closed the door on the scandal and vindicated Christie. Giuliani defended Mastro, a Democrat who worked for Giuliani's administration, as "someone who took on the teamsters union and cleaned up New York from the mafia under threat of death several times." Christie has "a guy doing this report who’s not about to do a whitewash," Giuliani went on to say. "I think this is a pretty strong report. It is not conclusive. No one claims it is, but it’s a good step in the right direction." That’s a pretty measured assessment of the report and the reaction to it, and a lot different than what we heard from Mastro and Christie in interviews this week. The Mastro report According to the report, investigators had access to personal and private email accounts and phone records of Christie and his current and former staff members. They reviewed more than 250,000 documents and conducted 70 interviews. The findings were detailed in a 360-page document looking at both the bridge scandal and allegations Christie withheld Hurricane Sandy aid from a New Jersey town for political reasons. You can read the full report here. The authors are upfront that there is one big hole in their investigation: They were not able to interview Christie aide Bridget Kelly or Port Authority official David Wildstein. But that didn’t keep them from strong conclusions. "Based on our investigation, we are now in a position to address most but not all of these allegations, as several key witnesses have refused to cooperate with our investigation or asserted their Fifth Amendment rights," the report said. The report concluded that those two individuals were at the center of the controversy, and the only major missing piece is understanding why they took such actions. "We are therefore confident that, based on our thorough review, we have a clear understanding of what happened here, even if the participants’ precise motives remain to be determined," the report said. Later, in the conclusion, the report stated rather definitively: "In sum, we have not found any evidence of anyone in the governor’s office knowing about the lane realignment beforehand or otherwise being involved, besides Bridget Kelly. Whatever motivated Wildstein and Kelly to act as they did, it was not at the behest of Gov. Christie, who knew nothing about it." Christie and Mastro comment Christie took questions from reporters for more than an hour last week after the report was released, his first since the early days of the controversy. In his remarks, Christie called the report "exhaustive" in its breadth and the access investigators were allowed. He noted he even turned over his personal cell phone. "It’s an exhaustive report that follows the mandate that I set out when I commissioned the review," Christie said. "I told (Mastro) to go find the truth no matter where it led and to turn over every rock to get to the bottom of what happened and to let me know what the truth was." Christie did acknowledge other pending reports, including from Democrats controlling the state legislature and from the Justice Department. But he expected similar results. "The report will stand the test of time, but it will be tested by the other investigations that are ongoing," he said. He also reiterated that the report was limited in finding a motive, "in small part by some of the access that they had and didn’t have to certain people, but in the end all of that is fronted in the report. It doesn’t claim to be anything other than what it is. But it is exhaustive, and it is thorough." For his part, Mastro had strong language in backing up the report’s findings and on ABC This Week, Mastro didn’t hold back. "I have to say this, for the skeptics out there, there are some who have a visceral reaction to this bridge controversy," he said. "Reminds me of the (A Few Good Men) movie line, ‘They can't handle the truth.’ We believe we got to the truth." But that came Sunday. Maybe Giuliani didn’t see the interview since he was shooting Meet the Press. What did Mastro have to say about the report earlier in the week? "There is not a shred of evidence that Gov. Christie knew anything about this lane realignment decision before it happened," he told Fox News on March 27, 2014. "Not a shred." Our ruling Giuliani said "no one" called the Mastro report "conclusive." Perhaps no one used those exact words (though the report itself had a pretty strongly worded "conclusion" section). But one of the targets of the investigation, Christie, said it would "stand the test of time" and the main investigator stated bluntly there was "not a shred of evidence" that Christie is to blame. That sounds pretty conclusive to us. The broader point here, of course, is that critics of the report say the investigation is anything but conclusive, as it was ordered by Christie. In that regard, Giuliani was no doubt trying to tamp down any fires. But in doing so he ignored the claims of both Christie and Mastro. Christie and Mastro admit some blind spots exist in the report, but those relate mostly to understanding why Kelly and Wildstein closed the bridge, and not Christie. We rate Giuliani’s statement Mostly False.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2014-03-30T18:11:17	2014-03-30	['New_Jersey', 'Chris_Christie']
pomt-01203	Wisconsin is below the national average in wage growth and job growth.	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/28/chuck-todd/under-scott-walker-wisconsin-lags-us-wage-job-grow/	Five days after Scott Walker won re-election by a five-point margin, inciting speculation about whether he’ll run for president in 2016, the Republican governor appeared on NBC’s "Meet the Press." Several minutes into the Nov. 9, 2014 show, Walker was asked by host Chuck Todd about Wisconsin’s economic record and whether it is "something that translates nationally." Walker responded with statistics about how jobs have increased during his first term and unemployment has decreased. (He also went on to make a number of claims that we’ve previously fact-checked). Todd interjected by returning to the national perspective and making a claim of his own. "But I’ve got to show you," he told Walker, as a graphic with figures appeared on the screen, "compared to the national average, when it comes to wage growth, it's below the national average, Wisconsin is. When it comes to job growth, it's below the national average." How Wisconsin's economy compares nationally could bear on Walker’s viability as a presidential contender, a prospect he has readily encouraged. So let’s check both sets of figures. Federal statistics The graphic that flashed on the screen cited figures from the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report, which compared March 2013 to March 2014. On job growth, the "Meet the Press" graphic said Wisconsin’s rate from increased 1 percent, less than the national average of 1.7 percent. The so-called QCEW numbers are considered the most accurate source for jobs numbers, but lag behind real time by six to nine months. The graphic quoted the figures accurately, according to a news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker’s office didn’t dispute this part of Todd’s claim, but said most states had job growth during the period that was at or below the national average. The graphic also accurately cited the average changes in wage growth from March 2013 to March 2014 -- 2.9 percent in Wisconsin, which was behind the national average of 3.8 percent. It doesn’t affect the accuracy of Todd’s statement, but we decided to use the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ database to take a longer view on both job and wage growth to see how Wisconsin and the United States have compared during Walker’s nearly four years as governor. The quarterly time frames don’t match up precisely with Walker’s time in office because, as we noted, there is a lag of several months in reporting the figures. But when compared March 2011 to March 2014, and December 2010 to December 2013, the results were essentially the same: Wisconsin has lagged the national average on job growth, but was slightly higher on wage growth. Our rating Citing statistics for the most recent year, Todd said Wisconsin is below the national average in wage growth and job growth. The latest federal figures, comparing March 2013 to March 2014, show Wisconsin’s job growth rate at 1 percent, below the national average of 1.7 percent, and its wage growth rate at 2.9 percent, behind the national average of 3.8 percent.

pomt-14498	Says Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele spent "$100,000 of taxpayer money on a new luxury SUV."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/24/wisconsin-working-families-party/wisconsin-working-families-group-claims-taxpayers-/	A group working to block a new term for Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele is arguing Abele is more concerned about himself than public safety and families. A direct mail piece sent out in the days before the Feb. 16, 2016 primary election by the Wisconsin Working Families Party included this statement: "Abele broke his own promise to crack down on perks for government workers, spending $100,000 of taxpayer money on a new luxury SUV. He also awarded a no-bid contract to a celebrity firm to provide personal security to himself." The claim was illustrated with a picture of a shiny black SUV. So, did county taxpayers spend $100,000 on a sweet ride for the County Executive? First a bit of background. The group making the claim is led by a longtime political foe of Abele -- Marina Dimitrijevic, a Milwaukee County supervisor who is the state director for the Wisconsin Working Families Party. Dimitrijevic, a former chair of the County Board, took the job with the political group after the state Legislature moved to slash the pay for county supervisors and made the job part time. Abele pushed for the move to a part time board. Milwaukee County voters overwhelmingly approved the changes in a 2014 referendum, and they take effect this spring. Meanwhile, there has been a spat between the board and Abele over his security dating to 2013. First elected in 2011, Abele went two years without a security detail. Then, after receiving unspecified threats, Abele asked the county to spend $400,000 for a private firm or local law enforcement agencies to provide him with security. Supervisors allocated $100,000 and required that Abele use the Sheriff’s Department for security. But that never took place, and the money went unspent. The board allocated $100,000 for Abele security in the 2015 budget. In the summer of 2015, Abele decided to hire Gavin de Becker & Associates, a company that, among other things, provides security for celebrities, including actress Jennifer Lawrence. The county spent $95,000 of the $100,000 for the company’s services. Abele personally paid the remainder -- $300,000. In the fall of 2015, the County Board refused to allocate additional money for the firm, and Abele is now footing the entire bill. So what did county taxpayers get for the $95,000 that they paid Gavin de Becker? Dimitrijevic and Abele’s office provided the same set of documents regarding the security contract, but offered different interpretations. One thing was clear: The county didn’t purchase a $100,000 SUV. Wisconsin Working Families perspective The contract between the county and Gavin de Becker has numerous sections blacked out as confidential -- "heavy redaction" was the way Dimitrijevic put it. In a statement, the group said "it will be difficult for you to demonstrate that $100,000 in public funds was NOT used on the luxury SUV." Here’s their reasoning: "Based on the retail price of the GMC Yukon ($50,000) and the fact that Abele used it to travel to and from events during and after business hours for a minimum of a period of six months, it is not unreasonable to state that taxpayers had to foot a $100,000 bill for the cost of the SUV. One could reasonably assert that the cost of the SUV use, insurance, gas, mileage etc. would account for a minimum of $100,000 or about 25% of the total cost, before he could unilaterally renew this public contract". The group also included an email from Corporation Counsel Paul Bargren to Dimitrijevic, who had sought details of the contract with Gavin de Becker. He noted that portions of the contract were redacted, and added: "The $100,000 payment in public funds was a flat fee, all inclusive. There was no breakdown." We also note that the claim in the mailing included a footnote to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel column by Dan Bice published Oct. 11, 2015. The column discusses the security contract and notes that the SUV is part of the package of services provided by Gavin de Becker. "The GMC Yukon XL does not belong to Abele or the county," Bice wrote. Abele’s take The payments to Gavin de Becker covered more than just the vehicle, Abele spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said in an email. "This contract is for security services, which includes the use of a vehicle. That vehicle is leased locally by the security firm," she said. We asked if the vehicle pictured in the campaign flier was the one used to transport Abele. It has a different grille than the vehicle identified as Abele’s in a picture that accompanied the Bice column. And the word "Yukon" appears on the floor in front of the SUV, an indication that it’s a handout photo from an automaker. "That is not the car that the security firm leases, not even the same kind of car," Baldauff said. Our rating Wisconsin Working Families said Abele spent "$100,000 of taxpayer money on a new luxury SUV." In a footnote, the group cited a Journal Sentinel column that stated the vehicle was part of a package of security services, presumably just like the uniforms, radios and other items used by the two guards assigned to the Abele detail. The county’s lawyer told the group the same thing -- the county paid a flat fee. In any case, the vehicle was not bought by county taxpayers. We rate the claim False.

pomt-07191	The budget for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau "is only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/08/elijah-cummings/rep-elijah-cummings-says-new-financial-protection-/	During a contentious hearing on May 24, 2011, members of a congressional oversight subcommittee sparred with Elizabeth Warren, who is President Barack Obama’s pick to head a new federal agency charged with protecting consumers from abusive practices in the financial services sector. The hearing attracted media attention for a testy exchange between the subcommittee’s chairman, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and Warren, who has become a champion of those who want to see stricter oversight of Wall Street. Her official appointment as director has been blocked by Republicans, who want to see changes in how the new agency operates, though she has been working to get the agency up and running as assistant to the president and special adviser to the Treasury Secretary. A reader pointed us to one statistic presented at the hearing that purported to show the imbalance between federal regulators and Wall Street. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the full oversight panel, said that the new agency’s "budget is only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees. … I have to ask you: How in the world will you be able to compete against this Goliath when you are so mismatched?" We wondered whether there was such an imbalance. We were able to track down sources for both types of fees. R.K. Hammer, a privately held bankcard consulting firm, tracks credit card penalty fees. The firm found that card penalty fees assessed by the industry during 2010 totaled $22.5 billion. We should note that the figure we’re using from R.K. Hammer -- what the firm calls "penalty fees" -- is an umbrella category that includes various types of fees. However, the firm says that late fees -- the category specifically cited by Cummings -- account for more than 90 percent of penalty fees. So we’ll reduce the amount slightly, to an estimated $20.3 billion in late fees. Meanwhile, the economic research firm Moebs Services tracks data on overdraft fees. The firm projected that for 2010, overdraft fees will total $35.4 billion. If you add these two figures, the total is $55.7 billion. To make sure we weren’t double-counting, we checked with both firms, and they confirmed that the two estimates do not overlap. What about the agency’s budget? We turned to the agency’s website for the answer. Budget documents posted there say that the agency’s estimated budget for fiscal year 2011 is $142.8 million, a number that Obama wants to increase to $329 million in fiscal year 2012. Using the 2011 figure, the agency’s budget is three-tenths of 1 percent of the industry fee totals. Using the larger figure for 2012 -- which is only a proposal -- it works out to six-tenths of 1 percent. Both figures are well under the 1 percent threshold Cummings cited. And the fees in Cummings’ comparison are just a small slice of the resources available to financial institutions. According to the Department of Commerce, profits in the finance and insurance sector for 2010 -- not revenues, just profits -- amounted to $366.8 billion. We’ll note here that we're not ruling on whether a budget that’s equal to 1 percent of penalty and overdraft fees is too little (or too much) to carry out the agency’s tasks. But on the specific comparison Cummings made, we found that he was accurate and even understated the disparity slightly. He’s correct that the new agency’s budget is "only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees." So we rate his statement True.

pomt-11079	Says Kevin Cramer wants to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/19/senate-majority-pac/fact-checking-democratic-attack-kevin-cramers-stat/	Kevin Cramer, a Republican congressman from North Dakota running for U.S. Senate, voted in favor of the Republican tax plan that President Donald Trump signed into law — and Democrats are using its cost as political ammunition. "Kevin Cramer’s vote increases the deficit by $1.9 trillion," the voiceover on a Cramer attack ad running in North Dakota says. "And now, Cramer says, they’ll have to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for it." The CBO estimated the law increases the deficit by $1.3 trillion over 10 years. When the cost of paying interest on the debt is added, the increase comes to $1.9 trillion. Did Cramer claim he would cut Social Security and Medicare in order to fund the tax plan? His words were not so clear cut. The Senate Majority PAC pointed to two interviews with Cramer two days before Trump signed the tax cuts into law. A caller asked Cramer the following question on the Rob Report on Dec. 20, 2017: "It looks like the tax bill could result in a debt increase that could lead to cuts in Medicare and Social Security. Congressman Cramer, can you commit today to not cutting Social Security or Medicare in the future? Yes or no?" Cramer responded, "Well, the two are not related at all. That’s been one of the scarier tactics of—" "Well," the caller pressed, "if we have debt increase, they might rationalize that we have to cut Medicare and Social Security." Cramer said the tax law would spur the economy and that the deficit was already an issue, but he added that reform to the social safety net was also necessary. "We need to reform all of our programs, not just to make sure people keep them but to make sure they can be kept for the long haul because both Medicare and Social Security, as you talked about, are on a path to insolvency," Cramer said. "So we need to shore up both of them, not to cut them, we need to shore them up for the long haul." Steve Ellis, Taxpayers for Common Sense vice president, said Cramer has a point. "With or without the revenue loss from the tax law, the major entitlement programs were on an unsustainable trajectory," Ellis said. "Changes or ‘cuts’ to Medicare and Social Security are not simply because of a $1.9 trillion deficit increase, which would ‘only’ be roughly $200 billion a year, when we’re looking at a total deficit of $800 billion this year and $1 trillion annual deficits soon." This is a point Cramer has been making for years, before the tax law. "Social Security ought to be preserved and made available as promised to seniors and soon-to-be seniors who have paid in with an expectation of receiving benefits," Cramer told the political website On the Issues on Oct. 30, 2012. "We should implement a program to reform and save it for future generations. Included in the reforms should be means testing, raising retirement age and allowing workers to invest more of their own money." Cramer offered a slightly more clear plan for reform in order to make Medicare and Social Security more sustainable in another interview on Dec. 19, 2018, on Valley News Live’s "Point of View." "Are you on board with this for entitlement reform in 2018? And if so, how specifically?" host Chris Berg asked. "Well, we have to get after entitlement reform, Chris, because that’s the only way to get to the debt and deficit," Cramer said. "Over two-thirds of our budget is entitlements. If we don't deal with that, not only do we not deal with the debt if we don’t deal with it, but the entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are going to go broke. We can’t let them just go broke—" "For clarity, sir, and again just for time’s sake, you’re saying, ‘Hey, yes, Chris, we do need to start doing reform, Social Security and Medicare," Berg asked. "The first thing is we can’t do any harm to anybody that’s currently on those programs or near getting on those programs," Cramer said. "But for younger people I think we need to design programs, you know expand those programs, maybe do a little more means testing, maybe increase the age by a month or two for a while. The people at the 25-year-old generation might have a little different program than the people that are 75 today." Cramer suggests vague changes to the way age and need for government assistance is determined, both of which Chris Hayden, spokesman for the Senate Majority PAC, told us qualify as "cuts" to Medicare and Social Security. Vanessa Williamson, a governance fellow at Brookings with a focus on taxation, agreed with Hayden’s characterization. "It seems clear to me that from these remarks that Mr. Cramer is calling for benefit cuts, both by means testing the programs (i.e. reducing or eliminating benefits for non-poor people) and by increasing the age at which you qualify," Williamson said. Other experts said the phrasing gave Cramer more leeway. Ellis said the word "cut" could be interpreted as an elimination, which Cramer did not suggest. But anything that reduces the cost of a program could be considered a cut, too, including improvements that bring about efficiency. Annette Nellen, professor and director of the Master of Science in Taxation program at San Jose University, said retirees might interpret "cut" to be something that affects their monthly checks and non-retirees interpret it to mean less benefits when they retire, or doing so at a later age. Cramer’s comments would not affect current retirees or people nearing retirement. Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC said, "And now, Cramer says, they’ll have to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for (tax cuts)." Cramer said reform was necessary in order to make Medicare and Social Security solvent. Recently, he broadly suggested raising the eligibility age by "a month or two" and increasing means testing. Experts said they could be interpreted as calls for cuts. But they don’t affect retirees or people nearing retirement, and were not accompanied by any concrete policy proposals. Also, the Democrats linked his position to the tax bill, but he has held that position for years. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02743	"Whether the Amendment passes or not, the medical use of marijuana is a federal criminal offense."	/florida/statements/2013/dec/17/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-medical-marijuana-illegal-under-fed/	Almost half the nation has reefer madness these days, with 20 states having passed laws allowing medical marijuana, or outright decriminalizing it. But the office of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi suggests making it crystal clear to voters that even if a proposed constitutional amendment legalizing cannabis for medicinal purposes makes it to the November ballot and passes, users will still be breaking the law -- United States law, that is. "The summary suggests that medical marijuana is permissible under federal law," Bondi’s office said in an initial brief filed Oct. 24, challenging the proposal in Florida Supreme Court. "In reality, whether the Amendment passes or not, the medical use of marijuana is a federal criminal offense." With so many states allowing marijuana -- medical or otherwise -- to be consumed by the public, this claim seems to often be overlooked, so we figured it was time to clear the air. Use and abuse Whether the proposed amendment even makes it is dependent on advocates collecting 700,000 confirmed signatures by Feb. 1. Even if the petition is approved, the Florida Supreme Court has until April 1, 2014, to rule on the attorney general’s challenge. If voters pass the law, it would allow registered patients with cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis or other conditions approved by a doctor to obtain marijuana for medicinal purposes. Bondi’s brief also says the law would "would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states, allowing use for limitless ‘other conditions’ specified by any physician," a claim we rated Mostly True. All marijuana legislation is written to apply only to state laws. Under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is defined as having a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Proponents of decriminalizing marijuana disagree with that definition. Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project, said there are obvious, widely used medical applications (such as pain relief and appetite stimulation). He said no other drug, from Lipitor to Oxycodone, must specify its exact use like medical marijuana laws do. But even with that in mind, no matter how many states pass marijuana laws, even advocates like Riffle freely admit that the use, possession, manufacturing and distribution of the drug remains a federal no-no. The Controlled Substances Act imposes strict penalties on marijuana users, growers and sellers. A first misdemeanor offense for possession in any amount can result in a $1,000 fine and a year in prison, climbing for subsequent offenses to as much as $5,000 and three years. Selling cannabis is considered a felony. Punishments range from a $250,000 fine and 5 years in prison to as much as $10 million and up to life for selling 1,000 kilograms or more. Penalties double if the sale is to a minor or within 1,000 feet of a school, playground or public housing. Cultivating cannabis plants carries similar penalties, contingent on the volume. Feds let states take the lead Even with federal law on the books prohibiting marijuana, there are reasons users and distributors aren’t constantly being busted by the Drug Enforcement Agency. There is a continuing debate over state rights versus federal control, and decriminalizing marijuana is a flashpoint. "Just because federal law bans something doesn’t mean states have to," George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin said. Whether the U.S. government can enforce policy that contradicts state law is another matter. The 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case Gonzales vs. Raich established the federal government has the right to use the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to regulate homegrown marijuana, even when it’s for approved medicinal use. DEA officials destroyed Oakland, Calif., resident Angel Raich’s homegrown marijuana plants in 2002, despite the fact Raich’s possession was legal under California’s Proposition 215 medical marijuana law, which was passed in 1996. Raich sued the federal government and lost, but California’s law was not affected. The ruling showed that the federal government cannot force states to criminalize something (marijuana, in this case), but can enforce its own laws. Since then, several states have still shrugged at federal guidelines, passing their own medical marijuana laws. Colorado and Washington state last year decriminalized cannabis use outright. This has led to a recent softening of the federal government’s stance on the drug. On Aug. 29, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys that apparently relaxed Washington’s attitudes about marijuana. The memo included new guidelines focusing on cartels or other criminal organizations -- for example, distribution to minors, cultivating plants on public land, committing violence to distribute the drug or using state-regulated operations as a cover for illicit activities. Otherwise, the Justice Department is content to allow state and local agencies "to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws." Indeed, raids of growing operations are infrequent, and prosecution of individuals in those states is nearly unheard of. That’s not to say these guidelines can’t or won’t change, Somin said. When Attorney General Eric Holder or President Barack Obama leave office or if they change their minds, the priorities of the Justice Department may shift again. Federal prosecutors could ignore the guidelines and root out medical marijuana users anyway. United for Care, the group pushing for the Florida initiative, said the lack of enforcement is an integral part of what makes medical marijuana laws possible, and is at the heart of the proposed amendment. "Our aim is not to set up a marijuana business," campaign manager Ben Pollara said. "We want safe access to medical marijuana." Bondi’s office, meanwhile, doesn’t see it that way. "Currently it is illegal," communications director Jennifer Meale said. "Whether there are other considerations doesn’t change the fact that it is illegal." Our ruling There are a lot of talking points about medical marijuana being passed around in Florida, but one immutable fact underlies the pro- and anti-marijuana lobbies: The federal government considers cannabis an illegal drug by law. Whether that’s the way it should be depends on your point of view. Proponents point to current federal administrative guidelines that deprioritize marijuana prosecution, saying that state preferences equal de facto law. The state attorney general says that even if the U.S. Attorney General’s Office says it’s not focusing on medical marijuana laws, that doesn’t change the Controlled Substances Act. Only Congress could do that. Even with the caveats implied by the U.S. government’s recent guidance, Bondi’s office declared "whether the Amendment passes or not, the medical use of marijuana is a federal criminal offense." Whether you’re a supporter of states’ rights or not, she’s correct. We rate this statement True.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2013-12-17T09:55:51	2013-10-24	['None']
pomt-02883	Says Rick Scott "cut education by $1.3 billion" in his first year, then "in his second year he decreases funding by $300 million to our state universities."	/florida/statements/2013/nov/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-cut-k-12-13-billion-/	Former Gov. Charlie Crist has portrayed Gov. Rick Scott as taking a chainsaw to the state’s education budget. Crist, now a Democrat, spoke about education funding in an interview with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Nov. 5, 2013, the day after he announced that he would challenge the Republican governor. (Crist was a Republican governor in 2007 but left the party while running for his failed U.S. Senate bid in 2010.) "First thing he does when he comes in, Chuck, is cut education by $1.3 billion," Crist said. "That’s an incredible decrease. Then in his second year he decreases funding by $300 million to our state universities." Scott and his backers have touted teacher pay raises that Scott pushed this year, while the Democrats have attacked him for cuts. In this fact-check we will explain if Scott cut education by $1.3 billion in his first year in office in 2011 and then in the second year cut $300 million from state universities. K-12 budget As Scott approached his first legislative session in 2011, he unveiled a budget proposal at a tea party rally that included steep spending cuts, including to education. Ultimately, the Republican-led Legislature backed some of those cuts. Multiple news articles described the cuts to K-12 education at more than $1 billion -- and many articles used that $1.3 billion figure cited by Crist. A Senate budget subcommittee conference report during the 2011 session shows a cut of about $1.35 billion. But not all of that cut was as a result of reduced state funding -- the largest chunk of the decline was due to the fact that the two years of federal stimulus funds had expired. In 2009-10 and 2010-11, the state received federal stimulus dollars. (Crist was the governor when the state accepted the stimulus.) When the state got the stimulus, it reduced the state’s contribution by the same amount. When the stimulus funds expired, Scott and the Legislature chose not to fully reinstate the state dollars. The Florida Education Finance Program, the main source of dollars for K-12 education, is by law a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars called the "required local effort" -- and the state dictates the amount. Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, the state cut its own contribution to education funding by about $200 million, but it also reduced the local contribution by $572 million. Add in the lost federal stimulus money of $870 million, and we get $1.6 billion in funding reductions. Finally, there were other things happening that reduced funding for schools, said Ruth Melton, legislative director for the Florida School Boards Association. During this same time period most school districts lost the authority to levy local discretionary millage (a loss of about $200 million) and had to serve an additional 25,000 students (an additional cost of about $155 million). On the plus side of the ledger, the state did get more federal aid apart from the stimulus, of about $555 million through a program known as Education Jobs Fund Program. "In short, I can make a very strong case that the cut between 2010-11 and 2011-12 was more than $2 billion, but I can also find my way to agreeing that the cut was about $1.4 billion," Melton said. "Whatever the case, it seems that the bottom line is that the state could have increased state and local funding levels to cover, at a minimum, the loss of the (stimulus) funds, but chose not to do so." The education cuts aren’t on Scott’s plate alone, but he was one of the main driver’s behind them. Scott proposed even steeper cuts to education, and in the end he signed off on the budget crafted by the Legislature. By December 2011, Scott did a major about-face and called for a $1 billion boost to education, though that did not fully cover the previous cut. "I will not sign a budget that does not significantly increase state funding for education," Scott said at a news conference in the Capitol, the Tampa Bay Times reported. "We've got to really focus on education." With an eye toward his 2014 re-election campaign, Scott has touted education funding increases. The Department of Education’s powerpoint shows funding hit a recent low of $16.6 billion in 2010-11. But then, over the next two years, it rose to $18.3 billion in 2013-14. But that’s still lower than the pre-recession level -- in 2007-08 the total was $18.7 billion. One of Scott’s victories in the most recent session was persuading the Legislature to agree to his plan for $480 million in teacher raises. Scott’s spokesman also cited a 2013 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that said Florida had the second-largest per pupil increase in education spending for the 2013-14 budget year, only behind Oregon. But despite that increase, the report also showed that Florida was among the majority of the states where funding per student remained lower than 2008. Higher education Crist specified cuts to the state’s universities, not state colleges and community colleges, so we will focus this part of our fact-check on state funding for universities. State appropriations for universities dropped by $303.7 million between 2011 and 2012, according to the Florida Board of Governors. Lawmakers assumed that universities would dip into reserves and increase tuition up to 15 percent to cover the shortfall. In 2013, lawmakers approved restoring the $300 million, and schools received additional money for particular projects. That means the total state appropriations (general revenue plus education enhancements) grew by about $519 million between 2012-13 and 2013-14. "For the first time in seven years, our universities did not see their budgets cut," wrote Frank Brogan, chancellor of the State University System, in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times. "This is a welcome change that we hope signals the state's long-term re-investment in higher education, particularly following years in which students have shouldered more and more of the costs." Why would the Legislature slash $300 million only to restore it -- and then some -- the next year? The Legislature looked at universities’ reserves and found they had more than $1 billion, well above the legal requirement of about $250 million, said Tim Jones, chief financial officer for the Board of Governors. So the Legislature essentially told universities that the state was going to cut $300 million to balance the budget, and universities could use reserves to cover the loss. The plan was that it would be a one-year cut and they’d get their money back the following year if the state budget outlook was brighter. "Universities know that every year kind of stands alone," Jones said. "If the (state’s) budget had been bad, they could have said, ‘Sorry, we can’t restore it this year." Our ruling Crist said that Gov. Rick Scott "cut education by $1.3 billion" in his first year and then "in his second year he decreases funding by $300 million to our state universities." There are various ways to add up the total cuts in K-12. Crist uses the $1.3 billion figure that includes the cut in state and state-required local dollars, but the largest chunk was due to the expiration of the stimulus funds. The state also cut $300 million from universities during Scott’s second legislative session. We should note that much of K-12 education funding was restored, though it’s still below pre-recession levels. And the Legislature restored the cut to universities the next year. The bottom line, though, is that Crist chose his words carefully, and those cuts did happen during the years he mentioned. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-14003	"More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history."	/nbc/statements/2016/jun/03/david-perdue/sen-perdue-uses-bad-history-business-birthdeath-tr/	Some Republicans might have misgivings about Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, but Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., isn’t one of them. Perdue told NBC News that Trump has what the country needs. "We have the lowest worker participation rate since 1978," Perdue told host Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on June 2. "Poverty rate hasn’t changed. More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history, Chuck. This is an economic fiscal policy that is failing, and I believe this guy (Trump) will absolutely set us in the right direction to change that." We wanted to look at that statement about more businesses closing than opening last year. Perdue’s communications director Megan Whittemore sent us charts of business births and deaths posted by Gallup and the Brookings Institution, but neither had numbers beyond 2011. Whittemore said "the trend is still downward of where it should be and that’s the point the senator is making." But Perdue said the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, not that growth was lackluster or some variation of that theme. And the data after 2011 paint a different picture from what Perdue presented. The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on new businesses forming and businesses closing as part of a project called Business Dynamics Statistics. The Census data undercut Perdue’s claim in several ways. 1. The numbers only go back to 1977. Perdue said, "More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history." No one has exact figures on what happened before 1977. But it is likely that in the depths of the Great Depression during the 1930s, more firms folded than were created. 2. The figures for "last year" -- 2015 -- aren’t available. They’re not available for 2014, either. 3. The limited data does show a few years when more businesses were closing than opening, but not for the most recent years. In 1981, the country lost about 31,000 more businesses than were created. That trend reversed in 1982 and stayed that way until 2009. That year, and in 2010, more businesses closed than opened. That flipped again the following year. In 2011, the country saw a tiny gain of about 6,000 businesses. That was followed by net gains of about 40,000 in 2012 and nearly 70,000 in 2013 This chart based on the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics shows the ebb and flow. Ian Hathaway, a Brookings Institution non-resident senior fellow who has studied patterns of business openings and closings, said Perdue’s statement is incorrect. "He is making a stale statement," Hathaway said. Our ruling Perdue said that last year the country saw more businesses closing than starting for the first time in the nation’s history. That’s wrong. Data doesn’t exist for last year. And the last year data is available, 2013, showed the opposite trend. Perdue’s historical claim also falls short. In 1981, there were more deaths than births. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6749fafb-c552-477a-90bd-14b78cc01c6b	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2016-06-03T17:30:00	2016-06-02	['None']

John McCain, R-Ariz., argues that President Bush was correct to veto legislation to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program because it would allow "everybody" to enroll. If "everybody" qualified for SCHIP and McCain says, there would be no need for private health insurance, Americans would be taking home more money in their paychecks because they wouldn't have to pay premiums and the federal government would be flat-out bankrupt. But even in the complex formula for SCHIP eligibility it's easy to dream up an example of someone who wouldn't qualify. Say, a single, 25-year-old man, earning $75,000 a year. The American Heritage Dictionary defines "everybody" as "every person." The SCHIP bill that Bush vetoed would cover more people than before, but it certainly wouldn't cover everybody.

pomt-09034	"President Barack Obama has deported more people in his first year in office than George W. Bush in his last year in office."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/06/jorge-ramos/obama-deported-more-people-his-first-year-bush-did/	On the July 4, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, Jorge Ramos -- a prominent news anchor for Univision, the Spanish-language television network -- said that "President Barack Obama has deported more people in his first year in office than George W. Bush in his last year in office." With immigration policy a hot political topic these days, we thought Ramos' statement was worth checking. When we contacted Ramos, he said the information had come from the White House. The White House, in turn, referred us to the Department of Homeland Security. A DHS spokesman provided us with the deportation statistics updated through June 7, 2010, though not all the numbers have been officially released yet. In fiscal year 2008 (which ran from Oct. 1, 2007, through Sept. 30, 2008), there were 369,221 deportations. During fiiscal year 2009 (which ran from Oct. 1, 2008, through Sept. 30, 2009) there were 387,790 deportations. That's an increase of 18,569 from one year to the next, a jump of about 5 percent. So, using these numbers, Ramos is correct. It's worth mentioning a few caveats however. • The fiscal years do not square precisely with presidential years. Fiscal year 2008 was entirely under Bush, while fiscal year 2009 consisted of four months under Bush and eight under Obama. So using the raw fiscal-year figures doesn't quite prove the Bush-Obama comparison. • It's not clear that Obama policies deserve credit (or blame, depending on your perspective) for any increase in deportations, as Ramos implies. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesman for the Migration Policy Institute, said that "deportation numbers have been on a steadily upward trajectory" since 2002, due to a number of policy changes initially undertaken during the Bush administration. Indeed, between 2002 and 2008, deportations rose by 117 percent. • DHS also provided totals for part of fiscal year 2010 -- the portion from Oct. 1, 2009, through June 7, 2010. That number was 227,163. If you prorate that amount to a full 12 months, you get a full-year total of 330,419 -- which is less than each of the two previous years. However, immigration experts said that deportations are not spaced equally throughout the year, meaning that prorating is not necessarily valid. In our view, these caveats add a bit of uncertainty to Ramos' otherwise clear comparison. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-04255	When it comes to income taxes, Wisconsin is "one of the best places in the country to be poor" but "top 4 or 5 worst" for middle-income earners.	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/14/robin-vos/vos-says-income-taxes-wisconsin-one-easiest-poor-a/	It’s one of Madison’s worst-kept secrets: Republicans at the Capitol want to cut state income taxes, and hope to take up the issue in the 2013 legislative session, which begins in January. The question is: Cut them for who? On that, it’s a good idea to listen to Rep. Robin Vos, the Republican from Rochester who was elected Nov. 13, 2012 as speaker of the state Assembly. Vos made clear in a recent WisPolitics interview that his top priority is a middle-class income tax cut. "If you’re poor in Wisconsin, it is one of the best places in the country to be poor. We’re in the bottom 10 states as far as paying taxes if you’re poor," Vos said in the interview. "If you’re successful, we are in the middle. I think we’re number 15 or 16 ..." "But if you’re a person in the middle class, somebody who makes $20,000 to $200,000, you’re in the top 4 or 5 worst places in the country to be a middle-class income taxpayer." Vos went on to tell WisPolitics that Republicans want an across-the-board income-tax cut, though the "primary benefits" would go to the middle class. When we asked him to clarify what he meant, he told us fiscal constraints might preclude -- for now -- reducing income tax rates on upper-income earners for whom legislative Democrats and Gov. Jim Doyle raised the top rate in 2010. So, is Vos right about how the income tax burden affects low and middle-income earners? When asked for backup, Vos pointed us to research presented to the bipartisan Steering Committee on Income Tax, a study group chaired by Vos that was set up through the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. Lower-income workers: Vos said their income tax burden is in the bottom 10, and it’s clear from the complete interview he meant among the 41 states that levy a personal income tax. In a November 2009 study, the nonpartisan, liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) ranked the burden on the lowest one-fifth of Wisconsin’s earners as the 29th-lowest among those 41 states. That’s not quite bottom 10, but the group’s executive Matthew Gardner told us the difference between Wisconsin and the lowest rung of the bottom 10 was so "trivially small" as to be meaningless. Another 50-state study, by the Minnesota Taxpayers Association in 2011, ranked the low-income burden in Wisconsin as either 32nd- or 34th-lowest for married couples at $10,000 or $20,000. Both are bottom 10. In Wisconsin, as in several other states, the working poor often have a "negative" income tax bill -- they get tax credits that wipe out their tax liability and in some cases result in a payment to them from the state. Wisconsin would be lower in these rankings, but some states pay even larger credits. Middle-income earners: Vos said this group faces a top-five burden. Income taxes paid by Wisconsin married couples and single heads of household in the $75,000 to $100,000 income range are fifth-highest in the country, based on the Minnesota study. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue indirectly cited the Minnesota study in testimony before the Vos-chaired study group. A sub-group of all married couples -- senior couples making $100,000 -- have the fourth-highest. The Minnesota group’s research director, Aaron Twait, said he considers the $100,000 mark for two earners a classic middle-class household, based on average incomes in Wisconsin and Minnesota. In addition, the ITEP study shows only four states collecting a higher average tax rate than Wisconsin in the $57,000-$88,000 range. So Vos has evidence to back up this part of his claim. But when you look at other levels within Vos’s middle-class range of $20,000 to $200,000, the burden is not quite as heavy as Vos said. For example, at the $150,000 level in the Minnesota study, the rankings are No. 10 for singles, No. 8 for married couples filing jointly and No. 9 for single heads of household. Again, that’s among the 41 states with an income tax. At $50,000, we found a mix of rankings between No. 3 and No. 7. Finally, Vos mentioned one other income group, the "successful," by which he meant upper-income. It’s not part of the claim we’re testing, but Vos said that group’s income-tax burden was in the middle of the 41 states. That’s basically on target. We found tax-burden rankings from No. 11 to No. 17 for top earners in categories such as $250,000, $500,000 and $1 million annual income. These rankings were from the Minnesota study. The ITEP study also shows the rankings falling as income rises. Our rating Vos said that when it comes to income taxes, Wisconsin is "one of the best places in the country to be poor" but "top 4 or 5 worst" for middle-income earners. He’s mostly on target here, based on credible tax studies showing a very low burden on the working poor, compared to a very high burden on many middle-income earners. Not all the middle-income earners face a top-5 tax burden, though: It’s top-10 for some in the middle-class as he defined it. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-03090	"Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements."	/florida/statements/2013/sep/25/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridians-pay-far-more-flood-insu/	Some Floridians are about to face a wallop of an increase on flood insurance -- and that’s something Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is campaigning for re-election, hopes to stop. Scott wrote a letter to Florida’s U.S. senators, Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson, urging Congress to delay a planned rate hike on some flood insurance policies and to continue federal subsidies. For that to happen, the Senate needs to vote on a proposal that the House approved in June. Nelson has indicated he supports a delay, while Rubio’s position has been less clear. The Tampa Bay Times reported in September that Rubio "will continue to work with colleagues on solutions to make the flood program sustainable 'without excessively burdening Florida's families,' spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said." Florida has already gotten the short end of the stick on flood insurance, says Scott. "Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements," Scott wrote in a Sept. 17 letter. We wanted to research Scott’s claim about how much Floridians have paid into the program and how much we have received in claims. Flood insurance reform The National Flood Insurance Program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, started in 1968. More than 5 million property owners nationwide hold flood insurance, and about 20 percent are subsidized. After the 2005 storm season -- which included Hurricane Katrina -- the program became indebted to the U.S. Treasury. As of May 2013, it owed about $24 billion. (A recent General Accounting Office report gives a full dissection of the program’s shortcomings.) In an effort to avoid insolvency, lawmakers passed the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act in 2012. The law requires the program to raise rates about 25 percent a year for certain properties until they reflect true flood risk. The increases apply to businesses, second homes and homes that have had severe or repetitive losses -- that’s about 50,000 policy holders in Florida. For policy holders who own just one home, the increases won’t kick in until they sell their home, their policy lapses or they have severe or repetitive losses. The increases don’t apply to about 115,000 subsidized condos or multifamily homes or about 1.8 million policies that aren’t subsidized in Florida. According to a FEMA map, many of Florida’s affected homeowners are in coastal Miami-Dade, Pinellas and Lee counties. For those facing the flood insurance hike, it’s a double whammy on top of increases for Citizens hurricane insurance. Florida’s premiums vs. claims The state’s Office of Insurance Regulation directed us to an issue brief written by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton Center for Risk Management and Decision Processes. (Scott’s office directed us to a 2013 Tampa Bay Times article that cited the Wharton Center’s research.) The 2010 study showed that in some states policyholders paid far more in premiums than they collected in claims between 1978 and 2008 -- a 30-year stretch. (That's five years fewer than Scott claimed, but as we’ll see, the numbers likely hold true through 2013, for a total of 35 years.) In Florida, "policyholders paid $16.1 billion in premiums but collected only $4.5 billion in claims reimbursements: that is, premiums paid over time were about 3.6 times the insurance reimbursements," according to the study. Florida wasn’t alone in paying more into the program than receiving back in claims. Thirteen states had an even higher ratio, and Colorado was the highest. (Florida was tied for 14th with Montana.) "The situation is reversed in Texas, where flood insurance policyholders paid $4.5 billion in premiums but collected a larger $6.7 billion in claims," the study states. The study was based on data from the flood insurance program, so we went directly to the program and FEMA to check the data ourselves. We found fairly similar numbers to the Wharton study. The author of the Wharton study, Erwann Michel-Kerjan, told PolitiFact that his figure of $4.5 billion for claims in Florida through 2008 was higher than FEMA’s of $3.7 billion through mid 2013 because he accounted for inflation. Also, it’s worth noting that many of our big storms were in 2005-06, not in more recent years. So the trend in payments from 1978 to 2008 likely continues today. We asked Michel-Kerjan if we should expect Floridians to continue paying more in premiums than they receive in reimbursements. "Keep in mind though that if there is a severe hurricane hitting the state and massive storm surge, the situation could well reverse: Florida might become a net beneficiary of the program, rather than being a net contributor," he said. "This is what happened to Louisiana with Katrina in 2005." The Tampa Bay Times explained: "Like any other insurance, flood premiums don't reflect real-life events; they reflect risk. With its 1,200 miles of coastline, Florida is still considered more at risk than any other state. Just one major, slow moving hurricane that hits a populated part of Florida's coast could dramatically increase the state's flood claims. And private insurers have been unwilling to provide flood coverage." Our ruling Scott said "Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements." A study from the Wharton Center concluded that Florida’s "policyholders paid $16.1 billion in premiums but collected only $4.5 billion in claims reimbursements: that is, premiums paid over time were about 3.6 times the insurance reimbursements." That statistic from the study covered 1978-2008, but it’s likely the trend has continued through 2012. The only key point that Scott omits is that this imbalance is common: Lots of states pay more in premiums than they receive in claims. A major storm could change that dynamic, and the purpose of insurance is to protect against such an event. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04116	"A far different picture from the prior eight years, which saw 115 increases in taxes and fees."	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/10/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-taxes-fees-raised-115-times-8-/	Chris Christie hasn’t completed his first term as governor yet but under his leadership, the state is in better shape than during previous administrations, he suggested Tuesday. During his State of the State address, Christie listed a number of accomplishments achieved since taking office in January 2010. Among them: a 2 percent property tax cap, pension and health benefits reforms, balanced budgets (required by state law), no new taxes and job growth. "A far different picture from the prior eight years, which saw 115 increases in taxes and fees," Christie said during his address in the Assembly chamber at the Statehouse in Trenton. That’s a lot of increases, but Christie is right. And this isn’t the first time PolitiFact New Jersey has checked this claim. Let’s revisit our original fact-check on a similar claim made by state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. in an Oct. 7, 2011 news release. At that time Kean said, "Over the past 10 years, Democrats have been in control of the Legislature and have done a disservice to New Jersey workers and their families by raising taxes over 115 times, making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states." Republicans provided us with a list that included tax and fee hikes as well as tax policy changes that occurred between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. It’s worth noting that even though Kean specified increases over a 10-year time frame and Christie specified an eight-year time frame, both were using the same list of tax and fee increases. Kean’s claim was rated Half True. Now let’s look back at the increases in question. Democrats held legislative majorities in the eight years before Christie became governor. His predecessors during that time were Jim McGreevey, Richard Codey and Jon Corzine. Although most of the bills in question during their tenures were sponsored by Democrats, a few had Republican support. Among the many tax increases were raising the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent and applying the tax to things such as tanning and limousine services. Also, the state twice increased the gross income tax on New Jerseyans with six-figure incomes: in 2004 for those with income exceeding $500,000 and again in 2009 for those incomes above $400,000. Also among the increases were hikes in dozens of fees, such as a new $1.50 fee on the sale of new vehicle tires. So while those types of measures cost some residents more money, they are not tax increases. Overall, the list provided by Republicans showed that there were dozens of increases in taxes or fees or other tax policy changes that could result in individuals or businesses paying higher taxes. The key difference between Kean’s claim in 2011 and Christie’s, though, is that Kean specified only tax increases and tied those increases to driving jobs out of state. The governor said taxes and fees were raised 115 times in the eight years before he took office. "The Governor was correct," spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail Wednesday. Our ruling In sharing some of the state’s achievements during his State of the State address Tuesday, Christie talked about a variety of fiscal goals he has overseen since taking office in 2010: balanced budgets (a state requirement),, tax relief, pension and health reforms, and job growth. "A far different picture from the prior eight years, which saw 115 increases in taxes and fees," he said. We have checked that claim before, when Kean made a similar statement in a 2011 news release. Back then Kean mentioned only tax increases, but there were quite a few fee increases, too. While higher fees represent more cost for taxpayers, they are not tax hikes. Christie, however, got it right when he said taxes and fees. We rate the governor’s statement True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04599	"Tim Kaine doubled down in his support of devastating defense cuts, saying the ‘the deal was the right thing to do.’"	/virginia/statements/2012/sep/20/george-allen/george-allen-says-tim-kaine-has-doubled-down-his-s/	In recent weeks, Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen’s website has opened with a picture of a chained iron gate and the headline: "Devastating job losses for Virginia." "Tim Kaine doubled down in his support of devastating defense cuts, saying the ‘the deal was the right thing to do,’" the webpage proclaims. The claim originates from a July 21 debate in Hot Springs between Allen and Kaine, the Democratic senate nominee. Allen criticized last year’s congressional deal to raise the nation’s debt limit, a compromise that could trigger $500 billion in automatic defense cuts to begin in January. "George, the deal was the right thing to do," Kaine said. Allen, on his website and at numerous appearances, has used that comment to argue Kaine supports those looming defense cuts which, according to projections from George Mason University, could cost Virginia 136,000 jobs. So we took a look at Allen’s claim that Kaine not only backed the automatic defense cuts, but has "doubled down" in his support of them. The deal The debt ceiling is the legal limit the federal government can borrow and, since its establishment in 1917, Congress routinely raised it almost 80 times so the United States could continue to meet its obligations. Allen, during his term in the Senate from 2001 to 2007, voted four times to increase the cap. But the comity ended during the summer of 2011 when the U.S. hit its $14.2 trillion limit and neared an Aug. 2 deadline when it would start defaulting on debts if it couldn’t borrow more. Republicans insisted on tying a borrowing increase to passage of a debt reduction plan. Negotiations between Congress and the White House stalemated, with the GOP demanding that all of the debt reductions come from spending cuts and Democrats insisting that a portion come from tax increases. A last-second compromise passed the House by a 269-161 vote on August 1 and, a day later, cleared the Senate on a 74-26 vote. It took a two-step approach to lowering debt. The first part called for an initial $900 billion in deficit reductions over 10 years through a mix of national security and domestic spending cuts. The second part created a bipartisan congressional super committee assigned to come up with at least an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions over nine years through spending cuts, tax revenues or both. If the panel deadlocked, $1 trillion in automatic cuts over nine years -- split evenly between defense and domestic programs -- would be triggered at the start of 2013. While the initial $900 billion in cuts received little attention, the added $1 trillion in automatic cuts, called sequestration, was supposed to be such a dire consequence that it would spur the super committee to craft a bipartisan package of deficit reductions. Although measure passed with bipartisan support, neither Democrats nor Republican were enamored with it. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, voted for the bill although he said it was "not perfect." Still, Cantor said, "This measure that cuts spending and puts in place long-term fiscal reforms marks the first big change we have accomplished." President Barack Obama signed the bill, calling it an "important first step to ensuring that as a nation we live within our means." Kaine’s position When the initial compromise was struck in Aug. 1, Kaine, called it a "flawed but necessary agreement." "While far from perfect, the current approach before Congress maintains economic stability by raising the debt ceiling and enacts important spending cuts that will help preserve our nation’s and Virginia’s credit rating," Kaine said. Kaine expressed optimistic about the panel. "I sincerely hope that negotiating without the specter of default or economic collapse will result in less partisan maneuvering and grandstanding and more pragmatic solutions," he said. But last November, the commission announced it failed to come up with a deficit reduction plan, starting the clock ticking towards the automatic cuts that will begin in January unless the White House and Congress intervene. Kaine said in a November 21 news release that he still hoped that deep defense cuts would be avoided. He suggested Congress turn to bipartisan deficit proposals made by a White House commission in late 2010 and by a group of six senators including, Mark Warner, D-Va. "There are good models on the table -- Simpson/Bowles proposal and the Gang of Six -- that can be the basis of a meaningful solution that will avoid harmful cuts to defense and health care, cuts that have a particularly negative impact on Virginia," Kaine wrote. Fast forward to the July 21 debate, and Kaine basically said the same thing. "I believe Congress can still find a deal to avoid the need for cuts that are going to jeopardize our nation’s defense," Kaine said. "Thank goodness Mark Warner and others in the Gang of Six are working to try to find a path forward that will avoid these cuts." Kaine, on Sept. 17, endorsed several steps to raise revenues that would replace most of the $1 trillion in sequestration cuts. He called for allowing Bush-era tax cuts to expire for those with incomes of $500,000 or more, repealing the prohibition on Medicare negotiating with prescription drug companies and ending tax breaks to the "Big Five" oil companies. Those moves -- all likely to face strong opposition in Congress -- would generate about $750 billion over 10 years, according to federal projections. Allen’s position Allen voted four times to raise the debt ceiling when he was in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007. But while the issue was being debated in 2011, he urged Republicans to hold out. "We conservatives have to say, `If you want us to vote for this, there need to be real cuts...and if we don’t get it, we’re not going to vote for that debt ceiling increase." Allen, during the 2011 debt limit debate, signed a "cut, cap and balance" pledge that was embraced by many conservative and tea party Republicans. It called for $100 billion in immediate, unspecified budget cuts, a Balanced Budget Amendment, a super majority vote to raise taxes, and phasing in of a cap that in 2017 would limit federal spending to 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. Federal spending this fiscal year is projected at $3.8 trillion, or 24.4 percent of the nation’s $15.6 trillion GDP. Allen has signed a pledge not to support any tax increases. In campaign appearances and policy papers, he has endorsed broad, unspecific policies for reducing spending: a federal government hiring freeze that would not include the military, less regulation and the rooting out of waste. He is calling for significant reform to entitlement programs, praising Republican proposals to turn Medicare into a program in which seniors would receive government subsidies to purchase private insurance and calling on Washington to cede control of Medicaid to states. He says aggressive development of U.S. fossil fuels will create jobs and "billions in revenues without raising taxes." We should note that Gov. Bob McDonnell -- a Republican and longtime military man -- supported the debt limit deal in 2011 and recently reaffirmed his position in an Aug. 15 speech to the General Assembly’s money committees. The governor said that the compromise was passed in the shadow of a looming default on U.S. debts. "For that reason, many reluctantly supported the final agreement that passed, not because of what it contained, but because of what it prevented," McDonnell said. The governor, in the same speech, said that the defense cuts would be "devastating" to Virginia. Our ruling Allen said that Kaine, in sticking by his endorsement of the the 2011 debt deal, is "doubling down" in his support of looming defense cuts. There’s no doubt Kaine backed the debt-limit agreement at the time and does not second-guess his support. He said, during a debate this summer, "the deal was the right thing to do." So Kaine cannot divorce himself from the consequences of the deal. The consequences -- $1 trillion in cuts to split evenly between defense and domestic programs was set up as a bitter pill so unpalatable to Republicans and Democrats that it would spur a compromise in slicing the deficit. The cuts were set up as a possibility, not a guarantee. Kaine has consistently said he supported the deal because it was important to raise the debt limit so Washington could continue pay its bills. There’s no record of Kaine calling for the deep defense cuts; to the contrary, he repeatedly said he hoped Congress would strike a compromise to avoid them. That’s the same position that Gov. McDonnell, a Republican, embraced last year and defended this summer. We doubt that Allen would level the same charge against McDonnell that he has against Kaine. That’s because it is possible to have supported the compromise out of a desire to keep Washington solvent and wish no harm to the nation’s defense. So we find Allen’s statement has some accuracy but is lacking in context. We rate it Half True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2012-09-20T10:08:53	2012-09-10	['None']
pomt-06173	"(The Opportunity Scholarship Act) would be funded directly from public school budgets. So it would absolutely take money out of the public school system to transfer to private and religious schools."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/15/julia-sass-rubin/anti-voucher-advocate-claims-proposed-scholarship-/	Thousands of students could receive a private education through corporate donations to a so-called "scholarship" program, but one critic claims the proposed school voucher program would be funded on the backs of public schools. Julia Sass Rubin, a spokeswoman for the anti-voucher group Save Our Schools NJ, explained the funding mechanism within the proposed legislation, known as the Opportunity Scholarship Act, during a recent interview on News 12 New Jersey’s Power & Politics show. "(The Opportunity Scholarship Act) would be funded directly from public school budgets," Rubin said during the show broadcast on Dec. 3 and 4. "So it would absolutely take money out of the public school system to transfer to private and religious schools." After reviewing the legislation, PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Rubin skipped a few elements of the proposed voucher program, but she still has a point that public schools would lose state aid as a result. There’s no direct link between the scholarships and public school budgets, as Rubin said. Students would receive scholarships through donations made by corporations, and use them to pay for tuition at other public schools or private schools. However, those corporations would get tax credits in return, and to make up for that lost tax revenue, the state would withhold aid from the students’ original school districts. In a phone interview, Rubin acknowledged the process involving the tax credits, but argued that public schools are ultimately paying for the program. "It’s like a money laundering scheme," Rubin told us. "It’s a direct reduction in school aid. So the schools are paying for it." Let’s explain how the proposed voucher program would work: The Opportunity Scholarship Act is part of Gov. Chris Christie’s education reform agenda, but the legislation has stalled in the Legislature since early this year. About two weeks ago, opponents and supporters of the bill held competing rallies, one in Jersey City and one in Trenton. The current version of the Act would set up a five-year pilot program to award scholarships to public and private school students residing in 13 school districts with failing schools, including Asbury Park and Newark. Public school students would be able to leave those districts and attend school elsewhere. Three organizations throughout the state would distribute the scholarships to parents or guardians of the selected students. Corporations making donations for the scholarships would get tax credits worth 100 percent of the value of their donations, costing the state millions’ worth of tax revenue. That’s where the school aid dollars come in. According to the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, which analyzed the Senate version of the bill, up to nearly $1.2 billion in state aid would be initially withheld from the 13 districts over the course of the program. Of that amount, about $354 million would be returned to the districts, according to OLS. But the remaining roughly $840 million would be retained by the state to offset the loss of corporate business taxes, according to OLS. So, the scholarships would not be directly funded by public school dollars, but in a roundabout way, education aid would be withheld to cover the tax credits granted to donors providing the scholarships. But Adam Bauer, a spokesman for Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., one of the bill’s sponsors, argued that under the state’s school funding formula, schools would lose a proportionate share of state aid if their enrollment declined for any other reason. "That’s how the formula works," Bauer said in an email. "Why then is it such a travesty when this happens as a result of a student choosing to go elsewhere as part of a scholarship program?" Our ruling In a television interview, Rubin claimed the Opportunity Scholarship Act "would be funded directly from public school budgets" and "take money out of the public school system to transfer to private and religious schools." The program would not make a direct link between public school budgets and the scholarships. But to offset the cost of tax credits awarded to the scholarship donors, the participating school districts would lose state aid. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-06213	Says the congressional ethics investigation against him was conducted by "a very partisan political committee" in a way that "related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/07/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-blasts-1990s-ethics-investigation-hi/	During a Dec. 6, 2011, interview on Fox News, Greta Van Susteren asked Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich for his view about a comment House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had made a few days earlier. On Dec. 5, the liberal website Talking Points Memo published an exchange with Pelosi, who, like Gingrich, has previously served as House speaker. In an article headlined, "Democrats Gleeful At Prospect Of Running Against Gingrich," Talking Points Memo quoted Pelosi saying of the fast-rising Republican presidential hopeful, "One of these days we’ll have a conversation about Newt Gingrich. I know a lot about him. I served on the investigative committee that investigated him, four of us locked in a room in an undisclosed location for a year. A thousand pages of his stuff." Pelosi added -- jokingly, according to the website -- that she would elaborate "when the time’s right." Later, Gingrich responded by calling the taunt from Pelosi -- who’s as much a bogeyman for Republicans as Gingrich is for Democrats -- "an early Christmas gift. It tells you how capriciously political (the House ethics) committee was that she was on it. It tells you how tainted the outcome was that she was on it." Gingrich elaborated during his Fox News interview. Van Susteren brought it up by asking him whether, "in sort of seriousness, this could be rather punishing in a race when someone comes up and says something like, I have secret information about the person." Gingrich responded that he doubted Pelosi had any secret information to release, since the case had been thoroughly aired in public and because it would likely be illegal to disclose anything that had been purposely kept secret at the time. But Gingrich took the opportunity to link Pelosi to the investigation and cite it as evidence of how the process had been biased in a partisan way. The back-and-forth with Pelosi "reminds people who probably didn't know that she was on the ethics committee, that it was a very partisan political committee and that the way I was dealt with related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics. And I think in that sense, it actually helps me in getting people to understand, this was a Nancy Pelosi-driven effort. They filed 85 charges and 84 were dismissed. The only one was a conflicting lawyer's letter. And then the Democrats just held out for partisan reasons." For this item, we’re focusing on the claim that the ethics investigation against Gingrich was conducted by "a very partisan political committee" in a way that "related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics." Gingrich has a long history with the congressional ethics process, both as an accuser (most famously against Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned amid ethics charges Gingrich promoted in 1989) and as the accused. The case primarily involved a course at Kennesaw State College that Gingrich taught while in Congress. The organizers of the course solicited financial support from "individuals, corporations and foundations," promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status. But the ethics committee concluded that the course was "actually a coordinated effort" to "help in achieving a partisan, political goal" -- something that would run afoul of its tax exempt status. A further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which "the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis." Gingrich "should have known" that the information in the letters "was inaccurate, incomplete, and unreliable." The allegations were largely ajudicated by January 1997, with Gingrich agreeing to pay a sum of $300,000 and admitting that he had "engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives." He became the first speaker to be sanctioned in this fashion by the House. (Here’s a time line of the case.) As we’ve noted before, Gingrich’s intensely partisan style and his heavy use of the congressional ethics process ramped up the level of partisan warfare during his investigation. Few observers would disagree that Democrats were gleeful at the prospect of seeing the first Republican House speaker in four decades brought down by ethics charges analagous to those Gingrich himself had used to topple Wright. But in the interview with Van Susteren, Gingrich did more than just say that partisan warriors leveraged his investigation for their own ends. He said that the investigation against him was itself conducted by "a very partisan political committee" in a way that "related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics." In essence, Gingrich is alleging that the investigation of his actions was biased by partisanship and, by extension, that the penalty he agreed to was tainted. To understand whether Gingrich’s assertion is correct requires a look at the venue for the investigation -- the House ethics committee, which was then known officially as the Standards of Official Conduct Committee. The ethics panel is the only House committee with an even number of Republicans and Democrats. By longstanding tradition, the committee does not proceed with a formal investigation unless it has majority support. This means that every ethics case that moves forward -- including Gingrich’s -- required the vote of at least least one member from the same party as the lawmaker facing allegations. In Gingrich’s case, an investigative subcommittee was convened and looked into the case for several months. Like the full committee, it included an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and it hired a special counsel, James M. Cole, to lead the investigation. (Cole was later appointed deputy attorney general by President Barack Obama, but at the time of his appointment in the Gingrich case, Cole had worked as a Justice Department attorney in administrations of both parties.) Gingrich had legal representation during the ethics process. On Dec. 21, 1996, the subcommittee forwarded its findings to the full committee for consideration, recommending "a reprimand and the payment of $300,000 toward the cost of the preliminary inquiry." On Jan. 17, 1997, the full committee held nearly six hours of televised hearings before voting 7 to 1 to accept the subcommittee’s recommendation. Voting to accept it were three Republicans -- Chairwoman Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, Steve Schiff of New Mexico and Porter Goss of Florida. "We are bringing to the floor a very tough penalty, an appropriate one," Johnson said in an interview on NBC’s Today show on Jan. 21, 1997, the day the ethics recommendation went to the House floor. "And we're bringing it to the floor as a bipartisan committee." The full House went on to pass the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans voting for it and just 26 voting against it. "This is a tough penalty," Johnson said after the vote, according to the Washington Post. "I believe it is an appropriate penalty. It demonstrates that nobody is above the rules." Schiff added in a press conference the same day that "being bipartisan doesn't mean you always agree on everything. It means you reach a consensus." This hardly seems like a Democratic kangaroo court to us. And experts we checked with felt the same. "The process had plenty of partisan tension, because he was the speaker," said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. But Cole, the special counsel, "was terrific and thoroughly objective," Ornstein said. To Ornstein, Gingrich "is sanitizing the process and outcome. To be sure, the charges were not so explosive that he merited a ‘death penalty’ (of resignation), but the charges were not wildly different or less significant than those he had brought against Jim Wright, who did resign." Kenneth A. Gross, the head of the political law practice at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, was one of several experts we spoke to who agreed. "I saw that committee at work behind closed doors during that era, and it was certainly divided and partisan, but it is the only committee of Congress that has an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and for anything to move forward, it would require a bipartisan vote." We should add that Gingrich accepted what amounted to a negotiated plea bargain. He agreed to admit one count of wrongdoing and pay $300,000, which was the estimated cost of the investigation. If he didn’t believe in the fairness of the process, he could have refused to admit wrongdoing and taken his chances on the House floor, where he led a sizable majority. According to the Post coverage at the time," J. Randolph Evans, Gingrich’s attorney, said his client "has apologized to the subcommittee, to the House and to the American people." Evans did not respond to an inquiry for this story. Our ruling While it’s true that the Gingrich case became a vicious battlefield between the two parties, contemporary accounts and experts familiar with the proceedings agree that it was not ajudicated by "a very partisan political committee" in a way that "related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics." The ethics panel’s case only moved forward with the express consent of Republicans, including the committee’s chairwoman, and it was led by a special counsel who was not a Democratic partisan and who focused on substantive legal matters. Most notably, when it became time to vote, the House -- including nearly 90 percent of voting Republicans -- voted to support the committee’s recommendation.

pomt-01111	"Since 9/11, right-wing extremists (incl anti-abortion, anti-gov) have killed more Americans than Islamic extremists."	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/08/sally-kohn/kohn-911-right-wing-extremists-killed-more-america/	The cold-blooded killing of a dozen people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical weekly in Paris, has inflamed the debate over the ties between Islam and extremist violence. The gunmen’s motive is hardly in doubt. A video captured one of them shouting "Allahu Akbar!", or "God is great" in Arabic. Liberal pundit Sally Kohn waded into the firestorm on Twitter. At one point, seeing what she called "repeated condemnation of Islam as a whole," Kohn wrote, "Since 9/11, right-wing extremists (incl anti-abortion, anti-gov) have killed more Americans than Islamic extremists." We decided to check Kohn’s numbers. Kohn’s tweet linked to a CNN opinion piece that in turn was based on data gathered by the New America Foundation, a Washington think tank that promotes data-driven innovation to social and economic policy. By the New America count, in the time since 9/11, jihadists have killed 26 Americans on U.S. soil, while those with right-wing leanings have killed 39. The single-most deadly event by an Islamic extremist was the 13 people killed at Fort Hood. On the right-wing side of the ledger, the worst was the six people slain at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin. The first thing to note is that Kohn’s tweet failed to specify that the deaths took place in the United States. Kohn explained that she counted on people to use the link in the tweet to fill in that detail. We hunted around for a count of Americans -- aside from military and such -- who were killed by terrorists while overseas and came up dry. Judgment calls Conservatives have challenged the New America tally. An article on Breitbart charged that the analysis wrongly attributed some of the killings to right-wing zealots when the ideological connection was weak. For example, in 2009, Joshua Cartwright shot and killed two police officers in Fort Walton Beach, Fla. Cartwright had beaten his wife and then driven to a local shooting range. When two deputies found him there, he shot them, fled, and was later killed in a shootout with police. Cartwright’s ties to right-wing extremists? The sheriff said Cartwright was interested in militia groups and thought the government was conspiring against him. His wife said he held anti-government views and was disturbed by the election of Barack Obama. All told, the Breitbart article questioned enough deaths to tip the count. In order to reach that point, however, it needed to add in the 10 victims of John Allen Muhammad, the so-called Beltway Sniper who terrorized the Washington metro area with his random shootings in 2002. Muhammad attended a mosque in Seattle, but financial setbacks and the loss of custody of his children seemed to have triggered his killing spree. Leave those deaths out of the equation for slayings on American soil, and the edge, however slender, still goes to the right-wing extremists. By our count, the Breitbart article came up three deaths short. For the record, this analysis deals only with fatalities even though some of the Islamic-driven violence in this country, such as the Boston Marathon bombing and the Fort Hood shootings, left many with permanent, life-changing injuries. No easy way to count If this exercise shows nothing else, it is that the number of post-9/11 deaths in the United States from either cause is low, and drawing firm conclusions is dicey. A single event or a change in definitions can shift the balance. The matter of definitions makes a big difference because most of the killers acted on their own. Experts in terrorist and extremist violence told PunditFact that in these cases, it can be difficult to draw the line between ideological and purely personal motivations. Alex Schmid is a research fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism in the Netherlands. "Mental illness plays a role in up to 40 percent of the lone wolf attacks," Schmid said. In contrast, he said most organized terrorists are "clinically normal." William Braniff at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland also said this is the most challenging part of any assessment. Braniff said the best research approach is to include any violence that might be tied to extremist beliefs. But also, be sure to include enough details so others can separate the clear cases from the murky ones. "If I am a law enforcement official or a policymaker, I might want to know if or how violent ideologies attract those who are mentally unstable because ultimately, that suggests that more resources ought to be directed to mental health interventions," Braniff said. Our ruling Kohn said that since 9/11, right-wing extremists have killed more Americans than Islamic extremists. She drew that from a database created by the New America Foundation which found 26 victims of jihadists compared to 39 of right-wing zealots. That count is limited to deaths on American soil. Kohn didn’t include this context in her tweet, though she did include a link that clarified that point. The tally itself is subject to certain judgment calls and has been criticized on that basis. Also, there are times when the motives of the Islamic and right-wing extremists are difficult to separate from underlying mental illness. The evidence suggests that while the margin might be small, it still falls on the side of slightly more deaths due to right-wing extremists. But the experts we talked to led us to conclude that a definitive answer is challenging. Given these uncertainties, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-01868	Says Charlie Crist "raised taxes on the middle class" by $2.2 billion.	/florida/statements/2014/jul/10/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-charlie-crist-raised-taxes-22-bil/	The Republican Party of Florida was quick to respond to Charlie Crist’s first campaign commercial, released on July 7, 2014, with its own ad alleging Crist was not being honest with voters. The party’s ad replayed Crist’s ad with a virtual remote pausing the video and offering reaction. After Crist’s ad claims he cut taxes, the GOP responds: "Fact: Crist raised taxes by $2.2 billion." A voiceover says, "Nice try, Charlie; Crist raised taxes on the middle class by billions of dollars." We handled Crist’s claim about cutting property taxes here, but these stats don’t really match up. Could Crist have cut taxes and raised taxes like the GOP claimed? Time to tally the balance sheet. Budget crunch In the throes of the Great Recession and with home values in freefall, Florida faced a $6 billion budget gap in 2009. The Republican-led Legislature’s answer? Implementing $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees. The panoply of hikes included a $1-a-pack cigarette tax, increased court costs and fees on things like fishing at the beach or off bridges, plus the increase in auto tag fees the Legislature repealed in 2014. The jump in taxes and fees was a necessary evil, lawmakers said, to deal with the holes in the budget. Crist, who was a Republican as governor, signed the budget on May 29. The commercial says these were increases on the middle class, but that’s debatable, since more than just middle-class Floridians were affected by the moves. No definition of middle class is given in the ad, in any case. The commercial also implies that Crist somehow lied about cutting property taxes, when cutting property taxes was actually a separate budget issue in a previous year. Crist did sign legislation that cut taxes for low-income seniors and Florida homeowners. But the tax increases put Crist in critical crosshairs, since he had pledged no new taxes for Floridians while campaigning in 2006. You can’t totally blame Charlie for breaking his promise, however. Lawmakers tied the various increases to funding for schools and Medicaid, to make sure Crist wouldn’t take them out of the budget with a line-item veto. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said, "Crist raised taxes on the middle class by billions of dollars." Crist did sign a budget in 2009 that included $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees, breaking a campaign promise that Floridians would not have to pay new taxes. But the ideas came from the Republican-led Legislature, who made it very difficult for their Republican governor to veto the hikes. This is not specified in the GOP’s commercial in any way, nor is the term "middle class" defined, although the middle class was clearly affected. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-08207	The U.S. House rule barring members from wearing hats while in session dates back to the 1800s and can be waived by the speaker.	/florida/statements/2010/nov/19/frederica-wilson/congresswoman-elect-wilson-says-hat-ban-started-18/	Frederica Wilson was known as the Florida state legislator who owned a massive collection of fancy hats. But when the Democrat was elected to the 17th District in Congress on Nov. 2, 2010, to represent portions of Miami-Dade and Broward counties, her fashion statement ran afoul of the rules. We learned of Wilson's hat woes from a Nov. 17 posting in Naked Politics, a blog by the Miami Herald: "Wilson is hoping to have a conversation with the likely new speaker, John Boehner. At issue: whether or not the longtime lawmaker can wear her signature hats on the House floor. The House bars members from wearing hats while the body is in session, but Wilson said she believes the speaker can waive the rule -- which dates to the 1800s. '"It's sexist," Wilson said. "It dates back to when men wore hats and we know that men don't wear hats indoors, but women wear hats indoors. Hats are what I wear. People get excited when they see the hats. Once you get accustomed to it, it's just me. Some people wear wigs, or high heel shoes or big earrings or pins. This is just me."' The blog post continued: "Wilson had to take her hat off for her official congressional picture, but plans to appeal that ruling as well. She did wear her hat on the House floor the other day -- but the House wasn't in session." She managed to show off at least one of her hats in Washington, D.C.: she arrived for freshman orientation wearing a black cowboy hat with sequins, according to the Washington Post. Roll Call also wrote about Wilson's hat dilemma on Nov. 4: "But while we expect Wilson to become the Hill's newest fashionista -- for better or worse, depending on who you ask -- she likely will have to ditch her trademark headpieces while she's on the House floor. Although there isn't a specific dress code, hats have been banned on the floor since September 1837. Even the late Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) couldn't sport her trademark broad-brimmed hats when she served during the 1970s." This is not a serious heady matter. But the Truth-O-Meter was curiously scratching its head. Was Wilson correct to say that the rule banning members from wearing hats on the House floor dates back to the 1800s? And who can waive the rule? First, a little more colorful background about Wilson and her hats that we gleaned from a May 11, 2009, Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article: "In a political universe dominated by men in dark suits, Sen. Wilson is the rainbow that cannot be ignored. She walks the halls of the Capitol flashing her custom-made, bedazzled cowboy hats and perfectly matched suits -- her own runway of eye-popping colors that are more suited to the Miami district she represents than to good ol' boy Tallahassee. Canary yellow. Five-carat turquoise. Cotton-candy pink. Cherry red. Rhinestone-studded black and gold. Here in the center of Florida's political universe, the loud wardrobe of the educator-turned-Democratic lawmaker sends a clear if unspoken message to fellow lawmakers: I am here. And attention will be paid." We reached Wilson briefly by telephone on the morning of Nov. 19 and asked her how many hats she owns. "I've never counted, but I've been wearing them almost 30 years," said the former Miami-Dade school board member and state legislator. "It's almost like a fetish. ... I have hundreds." Wilson said she brought six hats to D.C. and has been researching the rules about hat wearing and still hopes to speak to Boehner about the ban. Wilson said she would get back to us regarding her research on the hat ban and who she believes can waive it, but we did not hear back. Now let's return to our research on the hat ban. The rules of the 111th Congress -- the current one in session -- state under "Comportment": "When the Speaker is putting a question or addressing the House, a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not walk out of or across the Hall. When a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner is speaking, a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not pass between the person speaking and the Chair. During the session of the House, a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not wear a hat or remain by the Clerk’s desk during the call of the roll or the counting of ballots. A person may not smoke or use a wireless telephone or personal computer on the floor of the House. The Sergeant-at-Arms is charged with the strict enforcement of this clause." We consulted Miami Herald reporter Lesley Clark, who wrote the blog item about Wilson and covers Congress. Clark obtained a copy of historic documents kept by the House and also forwarded to us a 2009 copy of the Constitution Jefferson's Manual and Rules of the House of Representatives. That document states: "No Member is to come into the House with his head covered, nor to remove from one place to another with his hat on, nor is to put on his hat in coming in or removing, until he be set down in his place. Scob. 6. In 1837 the parliamentary practice of wearing hats during the session was abolished by adoption of current clause 5 of rule XV11." A document from 1907 in the same link above, sheds more light: we turned to "Hinds' precedents of the House of Representatives of the United States" written by Asher Hinds who was the clerk to the speaker. That document states that the hat rule was "the fruit of considerable agitation. In early years, following the custom of Parliament, Members wore their hats during session." That practice however was challenged when Charles F. Mercer of Virginia proposed a rule "as early as March 13, 1822: 'Nor shall any Member remain in the hall covered during the session of the house.' " Mercer's proposal wasn't adopted, but other members of Congress also proposed similar bans during the next several years. A ban proposed in 1833 was rejected because "Members would have no places in which to put their hats if they should not wear them, and also that the custom of wearing hats was a sign of independence of the Commons of England, and therefore a good usage to preserve the American House." A historical highlights document from the House provides a short summary of the history of the hat ban. That document states that member John M. Patton of Virginia defended "the really harmless but apparently indecorous practice of wearing our hats ... Regarding then this usage as merely ‘the outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual’ freedom of this body from all executive control or interference, let us preserve it. And whenever, if ever, our executive magistrates shall attempt to employ any improper influence on this body, let us be found with our hats on." But on Sept. 14, 1837, the House adopted the rule banning members from wearing hats during the session or by the Clerk's table during the call of the roll. So far, Wilson is correct: the House ban dates back to the 1800s. But she also said in the interview that she thought that the House speaker could waive the rule. She said she wanted to talk about it with Boehner, chosen by his peers to be speaker of the House when the 112th Congress convenes in January. We contacted Boehner spokesman Michael Steel to ask if he had the power to waive the rule, if any leader could waive it, or if it requires a full vote by the House when it adopts rules in January. Steel said he didn't know the answer. We turned to the House Practice, Assembly of Congress (Chapter 5), which includes a section on Adoption of Rules. That section states that the House can adopt its own procedural rules -- and "ordinarily the House adopts the rules of the prior Congress but with various amendments." So it appears that the House in January could adopt a new rule -- say, allowing all hats or dress hats. But this document doesn't address either way whether any leader can waive a rule. We asked Vincent Morris, spokesman for the House rules committee. He wrote to us in an e-mail: "Current Rules prohibit hat wearing so anyone showing up with a hat would likely be told to take it off. For the Rules to change, members would need to approve revisions when the next Congress starts in January." So for now, it appears that Wilson will need to persuade her peers to change the rule in January. The good news for Wilson is that if she ever wins a U.S. Senate post, she won't encounter this headache. Unlike the House, the Senate doesn't have a formal written rule banning members from wearing hats. "People don't wear hats in the Senate," said Senate historian Donald Ritchie. "The Senate sort of adheres to an unofficial dress code but it's not specifically in the rules." The News Service of Florida wrote Nov. 17, 2010, that "Wilson, not known for being shy, plans to tell Boehner she intends to wear hats -- not ask him for permission." "I’m not going to ask anyone," Wilson was quoted as saying. This would not be the first time that Wilson ran into roadblocks to her hats. When she wore Davy Crockett style hats in middle school, the dean called her father to complain, but she and her father didn't give in, the St. Petersburg Times wrote May 11, 2009. In 2002 after she was elected to the state Senate after serving in the House, a senator -- not identified in the article -- complained about her hats at a Senate retreat. (The News Service article identified that senator as Republican Anna Cowin.) "I thought, with all these problems we have, she's worried about me wearing a hat? Well, I just smiled through it," Wilson was quoted as saying in the 2009 St. Petersburg Times article. "Sen. (Jim) King took care of it." An aside: we wondered if the current hat ban rule would prohibit religious Jews from wearing yarmulke or Muslim women from wearing the hijab or headscarf. Steel, Boehner's spokesman, said in an e-mail: "The rule regarding hats has never been interpreted to apply to religious headcoverings." So does the headstrong Wilson have her facts right? She is correct to state that the ban on House members wearing hats started in the 1800s -- Sept. 14, 1837, to be precise. But can Boehner or any individual "waive" the rule? It appears that the House would have to vote on a new rule in January 2011. At this point, Wilson has not provided any proof that any individual could simply waive the rule. If she provides us such proof from her research, or if Boehner later responds with evidence that he does have that power, we could revisit this topic. But for now, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02499	"300,000 Floridians will lose their current health plans" because of Obamacare, a plan Alex Sink supports.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/300000-florida-lose-health-plans-more-story/	Critics of the health care law like to throw around talking points that give the idea that the law will increase the ranks of the uninsured. The evidence, though, tends to contradict that. That hasn’t stopped political ads from continuing to push the point. The latest case: The race to replace the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla. Democrats are hoping to pick up the seat with Alex Sink, a former banking executive who’s previously held statewide office as Florida’s chief financial officer. Her opponents are David Jolly, a Republican and one of Young’s longtime aides, and Libertarian Lucas Overby. The National Republican Congressional Committee recently began airing ads attacking Sink for her support of President Barack Obama’s signature health law. The ads begin with photos of Obama and House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. "Alex Sink’s loyalty is to them, not Florida. Why else would she continue to support Obamacare? 300,000 Floridians will lose their current health plans," the ad claims in part, concluding, "She’s fighting for them. Not us." The ad phrases its claim very carefully, but its statement still leaves out much of the story. And where does that 300,000 number come from anyway? The number comes from 300,000 policyholders that insurance company Florida Blue identified back in October. That was when insurers were required to notify policyholders if their insurance plans didn’t meet the rules for new plans requiring comprehensive coverage. The rules were intended to phase out "bare bones" plans that didn’t include things like prescription drugs or hospital stays. Florida Blue had 300,000 customers whose plans didn’t meet the new rules. So Florida Blue sent them letters informing them that their plans would end and offering guidance on how to get signed up for a new plan. "Florida Blue is proactively communicating to these members to help them understand how this transition affects them," the company said at the time. "Prior to their 2014 renewal date, each member will receive a letter that instructs them to contact Florida Blue to review their migration options. These new plans will offer members access to more comprehensive benefits in 2014." We should note that there’s a lot we don’t know about these 300,000 policyholders. For example, some of them may have gone to the federal marketplace to buy insurance. If their income was below 400 percent of the poverty level (below about $94,200 for a family of four, for example), they would have gotten a subsidy to buy insurance. Some of these people may end up paying more but getting more robust coverage. It’s unclear how many, if any, would simply stop buying coverage altogether. Back in October, Florida Blue told PolitiFact Florida that it intended to work with customers to get them into new plans. Spokesman Mark Wright said that when it comes to getting new plans, "nobody is throwing anybody off a cliff." We reached out to Florida Blue to see if it could tell us anything more about how the letters have played out. Spokesman Mark Wright said the company was giving their policyholders another year to keep their coverage after President Barack Obama asked insurers to allow customers who wanted to keep the old plans to keep them for an additional year. One final note: PolitiFact Florida rated a similar but not identical statement claim from Sen. Marco Rubio back in October. Rubio said, "300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance." PolitiFact Florida found that claim Mostly False because Rubio failed to fully explain the situation behind the number and wrongly insisted that the people wouldn’t have insurance in 2014. The NRCC’s claim doesn’t go quite as far. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee said in an ad that "300,000 Floridians will lose their current health plans." We know that the insurer Florida Blue had to end plans for 300,000 customers when their plans didn’t meet the law’s new requirements for health insurance. But Florida Blue also said it intended to help its customers select and sign up for new health care plans, not leave them without options, and the customers got an additional year, if they needed it, to make a transition. The ad makes it sound as if people would lose their plans without any replacement. Overall, we rate the ad’s claim Half True.

pomt-10295	Obama "promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/12/john-mccain/for-the-most-part-only-if-youre-high-income/	New political ads from Sen. John McCain accuse Sen. Barack Obama of raising taxes on the middle class. "He promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family," according to a television ad. The ad bases its claim on the fact that Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the upper-income brackets. So the claim is true if you happen to be a small business, a senior or a family making more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for a single person. Otherwise, it's generally not the case. In fact, Obama advocates eliminating income taxes for seniors with incomes less than $50,000. An important note about seniors: Some seniors will be affected indirectly by Obama's plan to raise corporate taxes. Corporate taxes are expected to depress profits from stocks and dividends, which seniors tend to rely on for retirement income. An analysis from the Tax Policy Center concluded that about a third of seniors would see higher taxes, either because they have high incomes or because of slight increases due to the indirect effect of the corporate tax rate. Overall, seniors would see their federal tax rate go up about 2.5 percent, and that includes steep increases to the top brackets. The "life savings" statement, according to the McCain campaign, applies to Obama's plan to raise taxes on dividends and capital gains. Increases to dividends and capital gains taxes will affect people in upper income brackets who have investments in the stock market or mutual funds. But those taxes do not apply to tax-deferred investments like 401(k)s, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and some tax-deferred college savings plans. (We've checked a similar statement previously and found it False .) Capital gains and dividends taxes would stay the same for people in income brackets of $250,000 or less, according to the Obama plan. Those higher incomes constitute a small percentage of U.S. taxpayers, mostly the top 1 percent. The ad says that Obama "promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family." That sounds like a broad-brush statement of Obama's taxation philosophy. But Obama does not promise those things; in fact, he promises more taxes for taxpayers with the highest incomes. McCain's statement is a distortion of Obama's proposals, and we find it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07372	"Polls show that Floridians don't want to repeal the Affordable Care Act."	/florida/statements/2011/may/05/joe-gibbons/democratic-state-rep-joe-gibbons-says-floridians-d/	A proposed constitutional amendment that takes aim at the new federal health care law passed the Florida House of Representatives 80-37 on May 4, 2011. The measure, SJR 2, prohibits laws that force people to buy health insurance and was a top priority of Senate President Mike Haridopolos, who is running for the U.S. Senate. The Florida Senate voted earlier in the legislative session to put the amendment on the November 2012 ballot -- assuming it survives any court challenges. While it's unlikely the amendment could trump the impact of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the proposed change is seen as a straw poll on the popularity of the health care law. Democratic Rep. Joe Gibbons, D-Hallandale Beach, argued against the amendment, saying that it goes against the wishes of the majority of Floridians. "Polls show that Floridians don't want to repeal the Affordable Care Act," Gibbons said shortly before the amendment passed. We wanted to know how Floridians feel about the health care law. While there are dozens of polls about the popularity of the federal health care law on the national level, state-level polling data is more difficult to come by. The most recent Florida polls come from Quinnipiac University, a nonpartisan polling group. It surveyed 1,499 registered voters from March 29-April 4 and asked two questions about the federal health care law. When asked, "Do you support Congress repealing the health care law that passed last year," 49 percent of respondents said yes and 41 percent said no. When the question was phrased slightly differently to call the law the "health care reform law," 54 percent said yes and 40 percent answered no. In another Quinnipiac survey of 1,160 voters conducted Jan. 25-31, 50 percent of Floridians said the health care law should be repealed; 43 percent said it should not. The recent polls show more favorable views of the law now than in earlier surveys we found, including a March 2010 poll conducted by Mason-Dixon. That poll found that 34 percent of Florida voters support the law while 54 percent opposed it. On the national level, the polls asking about repeal are slightly different. A Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll from April 7-12, 2011, found that 52 percent of Americans want to expand the law or keep it as is, 35 percent want to repeal the law and replace it with a GOP alternative or repeal it altogether, and 14 percent are unsure. A poll for Fox News conducted April 3-5 found that 60 percent of Americans want to repeal at least parts of the health care law, compared to 34 percent who want to expand it or leave it as is. And a CBS/New York Times poll from January found that 48 percent of Americans want the bill to stand, 40 percent want it repealed, and 12 percent say they're unsure. So -- on the national level at least -- the poll results vary widely. And sometimes, that's what makes claims about polls complicated. But in this case, we're addressing Gibbons' claim specifically about Florida. He said: "Polls show: Floridians don't want to repeal the Affordable Care Act." On a completely literal hearing of his comments, we guess Gibbons is right -- some Floridians do not want a repeal. But really, the question is, where do most Floridians stand? We found two reputable recent polls from Quinnipiac University that both found -- though narrowly -- a plurality of Floridians support a repeal of the health care law. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12248	Says "CNN host Fareed Zakaria calls for jihad rape of white women."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/12/blog-posting/recycled-parody-cnns-zakaria-calls-jihadi-rape-whi/	CNN’s Fareed Zakaria presents himself as an urbane observer of the global scene and not the sort of person to call for violence against women. But the website teoinfo.com sought to cast Zakaria in a much different -- and false -- light. The website ran an article June 30 with the headline: CNN Host Fareed Zakaria Calls For Jihad Rape Of White Women. Facebook readers flagged the story as being potentially fake, so we decided to investigate. For fake news watchers, the opening paragraph of the story was a stroll down memory lane. It said, "Fareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ a program focusing on international events, has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in the Washington Post." Not only is that bizarre, it is a word-for-word copy and paste from an article over a year ago on the satirical website The People’s Cube. The self-described site for "political humor" once touted that it ranked No. 13 on a list of humor blogs. Among its recent headlines, it announced, "Russia adds St. Patrick’s Day to list of excuses to get drunk," as part of the country’s "Day Without Sobriety" campaign. The website adopts a faux-Soviet style, purportedly the brainchild of "a former Soviet agitprop artist." When the article first appeared Jan. 2, 2016, Zakaria complained that he was the victim of internet trolls. In response, the People’s Cube (it features a Rubik's cube with red on all sides) published an open letter on Jan. 18, 2016. "This parody wasn't meant to be taken as factual reporting, given the context of our website and especially considering the author's credentials at the top: Chedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth." (The author’s avatar is a cheeto with a Che Guevara face, which makes sense if you say Chedoh the "right" way.) According to the Teoinfo/People’s Cube article, Zakaria wrote, "The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes," and went on to say "thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves." The rumor-busting website Snopes declared it false in January 2016. Despite the article’s satirical roots, warning labels or disclaimers were lost as it moved from site to site. Reclaim Australia Rally, a group that asks "all patriotic Australians to stand united against Islamisation and home grown terror threats," shared the Teoinfo post on its Facebook page on July 2.

pomt-06795	Says the state’s pension and health benefits reform includes "the destruction of public sector collective bargaining rights."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/15/nj-can/democratic-group-claims-new-jerseys-pension-and-he/	The roar of the protests outside the Statehouse has faded, but a new group of Democratic activists is going after the Democratic legislators who sided with Republican Gov. Chris Christie in supporting New Jersey’s pension and health benefits reform. Referring to its targets as "Christie-crats," NJ-CAN kicked off a petition drive last week calling for the removal of Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester) and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) from their leadership posts. Both legislators helped craft the pension and health benefits legislation, and voted for the bill. The petition, which was posted on the group's website on Aug. 9, states: "Sweeney and Oliver betrayed core principles of the Democratic Party by engineering the passage of Governor Christie’s State Pension and Health Benefits Bill, including the destruction of public sector collective bargaining rights." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether the bill includes "the destruction of public sector collective bargaining rights," and found that NJ-CAN is exaggerating the impacts on unions’ rights. The legislation weakens collective bargaining rights, but doesn’t destroy them. "It is destructive to all collective bargaining without being the destruction of it all," said Hetty Rosenstein, state director of the Communication Workers of America, the largest union representing state workers. Now, let’s talk about how the pension and health benefits bill affects union workers. Signed into law by Christie on June 28, the legislation mandates higher payments from workers for pension and health care expenses, but the impact on union negotiations concerns the health care piece. Pension contributions have not been collectively bargained, but instead set by state statute. Health care expenses have been part of negotiations, but the higher health care contributions outlined in the legislation are non-negotiable for four years. For workers under an existing union contract, the higher contributions and four-year time frame begin when their contract expires. But the legislation doesn’t take away all bargaining rights, and the health care contributions are scheduled to become part of negotiations once the four-year period is complete. Newark-based labor union attorney Bennet Zurofsky, an NJ-CAN member who helped write the petition, acknowledged the statement may include "a small amount of hyperbole in it." But Zurofsky argued that without the health care piece, collective bargaining will not be meaningful. "You’re bargaining over the crumbs," Zurofsky said. Rutgers labor professor Jeff Keefe agreed the legislation gives unions much less to bargain with, but he said the word "destruction" is "overkill." Unions can still negotiate wages, uniform allowances and other issues, Keefe said. However, without health care as part of negotiations, an employer can demand wage cuts and a union has nothing to counter with, Keefe said. Philip Harvey, a labor law professor at Rutgers, said in an email that the legislation amounts to a "’‘destruction of bargaining rights’ vis a vis health care expenses," but not all bargaining rights. The elimination of bargaining for health care expenses will have indirect effects on other issues, Harvey said. Public-sector unions will enter negotiations in an ugly mood, making them go less smoothly, he said. Also, the unions will resist demands for other concessions more strongly in light of how the health care contributions are non-negotiable, he said. Oliver and a spokesman for Sweeney both pointed out that collective bargaining for health care payments will be restored after the four-year period. "The bill clearly does not destroy collective bargaining rights. In fact, I insisted upon the sunset provision that protects collective bargaining rights going forward, and the bill would not have advanced in the Assembly unless collective bargaining rights were protected," Oliver said in a statement. "Collective bargaining for health care resumes in 2015." The ruling NJ-CAN claimed the new pension and health benefits reform includes "the destruction of public sector collective bargaining rights." The legislation eliminates negotiations over health care contributions for a four-year period, a move that some experts said would make bargaining over other issues more difficult. But you can’t say bargaining rights have been destroyed when unions can still negotiate wages and other issues, and when the health care negotiations are scheduled to resume at the end of the four years. Since "destruction" is too strong of a word to explain the impacts on unions, we rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12510	The Ninth Circuit has an overturned record "close to 80%."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/26/donald-trump/does-ninth-circuit-have-overturn-record-close-80/	President Donald Trump, upset by a district judge’s decision to temporarily block one of his immigration orders, went on Twitter to criticize the court. "First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court! See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the ‘ban’ case and now the ‘sanctuary’ case is brought in ... See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com ...the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this ‘judge shopping!’ Messy system." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com District judges within the 9th Circuit have halted two versions of executive orders signed by Trump seeking to temporarily halt the U.S. entry of refugees and nationals from several countries in the Middle East and Africa. On April 25, another judge within the 9th Circuit granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against a different Trump order, one aiming to cut federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities. Given Trump’s record in the 9th Circuit, we wondered if his tweet was accurate – does the circuit have an overturn rate close to 80 percent? There are at least two ways to calculate that record, and by one metric the answer is yes. By another, it’s far less than 1 percent. The 9th Circuit Broadly speaking, the 9th Circuit includes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and district and bankruptcy courts in 15 federal judicial districts (among them Hawaii, and districts in Washington, California). It was a district judge in Hawaii who on March 15 blocked Trump’s revised travel ban. On Feb. 3, a district judge in Seattle granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on the first version of Trump's travel ban. Trump’s Justice Department filed a motion appealing that district court's decision – the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the motion but asked for more information. On Feb. 9, in a 3-0 decision the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Seattle judge's decision. An overturned record is a reflection of cases in which the Supreme Court ruled contrary to a lower court. The 80 percent Trump tweeted about was in reference to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals’ record, and does not exactly apply to the district courts. The Supreme Court typically only hears 100 to 150 of the estimated 7,000 cases it’s asked to review per year. At least four of the nine Supreme Court judges must agree to hear a case, which come from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there’s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court’s decision was wrong. We previously looked at the 9th Circuit’s record when Fox News’ Sean Hannity falsely claimed it was the most overturned in the country. Here’s what we found then, using data from SCOTUSBlog’s Supreme Court statistics archive on circuit scorecards. The Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent. The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate is higher than average, but it’s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit placed third. 6th Circuit - 87 percent; 11th Circuit - 85 percent; 9th Circuit - 79 percent; 3rd Circuit - 78 percent; 2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent; 8th Circuit - 67 percent; 5th Circuit - 66 percent; 7th Circuit - 48 percent; DC Circuit - 45 percent; 1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent; 10th Circuit - 42 percent. The 9th Circuit overturned rate is similar to the findings of a 2010 analysis by Roy E. Hofer, a former president of the Federal Circuit Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association. Hofer found that from 1999 to 2008, the Supreme Court reversed or vacated (ruled null or void) 80 percent of the cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit. But he pointed out that the percentage of reversed or vacated cases for each circuit would be significantly lower if calculated in a different way. "Reversal rates for each court of appeals would be very small, in the range of a tenth of a percent, if calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of appeals terminated by that court," Hofer wrote in his article published by the American Bar Association. "Conversely, if the reversal rate is calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, the ratio increases dramatically." In comparing courts’ "performance," it makes more sense to compare reversal rate in terms of the ratio of cases reversed over cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, Hofer said. Over the 10-year period analyzed by Hofer, the 9th Circuit terminated 114,199 cases, in comparison, the 1st Circuit had 16,620, he found. It’s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more "outlier decisions," which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits — leading to a higher reversal rate, University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt previously told us. Our ruling Trump tweeted, the 9th Circuit has an overturned record "close to 80%." An overturned record can be calculated in at least two ways. By one measure, Trump’s tweet is correct if examining only cases reviewed by the Supreme Court. But by factoring in cases reversed over the total number of cases ruled by the circuit court, then the percentage is significantly smaller, far less than 1 percent. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

pomt-11827	"Underreported fact: President @realDonaldTrump raised more in small dollar donations than Obama in 2012 and than Clinton and Bernie combined!"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/13/kayleigh-mcenany/trump-raised-more-dollars-small-donations/	Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany wanted to highlight some good news: Trump’s "underreported" success with small dollar donations in the 2016 presidential election. She tweeted on Oct. 11, "Underreported fact: President @realDonaldTrump raised more in small dollar donations than Obama in 2012 and than Clinton and Bernie combined!" We hadn’t heard that, so we decided to look into it. Cassie Smedile, Republican National Committee national press secretary, said that McEnany got her information from a Washington Post article that cited a Campaign Finance Institute report. The institute used data from the Federal Elections Commission disclosure reports to analyze campaign contributions. It focused on donations from people who gave less than $200 over the course of the entire campaign to both the campaigns and the joint fundraising committees. The $200 limit comes from the FEC. A quirk in the campaign reporting process means the FEC only records each individual donor who donates more than $200, while tracking the sum of contributions of $200 or less to the campaigns. This is important to remember, because over the course of the campaign, donors could have given smaller amounts repeatedly that added up to more than $200. These donors technically gave small amounts, but they would not be captured in the institute’s report because the report focused on donors who gave less than $200 total. "I've reviewed the CFI report but I can't replicate their methodology, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the report," said Doug Weber, senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics. "I can’t match up the numbers for you, but the Campaign Finance Institute does good work," said Judith Ingram, press officer at the Federal Elections Commission. Here is the breakdown of how much each candidate received from small donors, according to the institute's report: Trump received about $239 million from donors who gave less than $200 in total. That amounts to 69 percent of the Trump campaign’s individual contributions; Hillary Clinton received about $137 million from $200-or-under donors. That made up 22 percent of the campaign’s individual contributions; Bernie Sanders received about $100 million, or 44 percent of his campaign’s individual contributions. Going back further, President Barack Obama received about $219 million from small-dollar donors in 2012, or 28 percent of his campaign’s individual contributions, In 2008, Obama received about $181 million, or 24 percent of his total individual contributions. So, according to the Campaign Finance Institute, Trump raised $20 million more from small-dollar donors than Obama in 2012 and $2 million more than Clinton and Sanders combined in 2016. A few more details: Obama ran unopposed in the 2012 Democratic primary election. Sanders was not the Democratic party nominee in 2016 and did not run in the general election. The report only looked at Sanders’ fundraising through June 30, 2016. Aspects of the campaign calendar contributed to Trump’s success with under-$200 donors. Sanders, Obama and Clinton raised money over a longer period of time so that some of the small donors may have donated more than once and exceeded the $200 threshold. Trump, by contrast, raised more money in a shorter time frame. "Because Trump raised most of his money over four months, fewer of his donors had this experience (of donating more than once). Even this caveat, however, does not negate the fact that his small donor numbers were record shattering," said Brendan Glavin, data and systems manager at the Campaign Finance Institute. The institute looked at not only how much each candidate received, but also how much the candidates’ joint fundraising committees helped raise as well. Glavin said that the RNC and the Trump campaign made a deal and split the fundraising from committees. "The main joint fundraising committee was the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, which raised in 2016 $263 million," said Glavin. Here’s a breakdown of how much each campaign raised from donors who gave $200 or less, without the help of the joint fundraising committees, according to FEC reports: Trump raised $86.6 million, or 64 percent of the campaign’s total individual contributions. Obama in 2012 raised $234.4 million, or 42 percent of the campaign’s total individual contributions. Sanders raised $134.6 million, or 58 percent of the campaign’s total individual contributions. Clinton raised $105.5 million, or 26 percent of the campaign’s total individual contributions. Rick Hasen, campaign finance legal scholar at University of California Irvine School of Law said, "This seems like a correct tweet. The only caveat is the point at the end of the report about some donors being so enthused they went over the $200 threshold." The Clinton campaign encouraged this enthusiasm in the fundraising emails they sent out to their supporters. This is an example of the language used in the emails: "FEC policy is that only supporters who have contributed more than $200 are included on the record. Your support has been above average, but you're a few donations away from that threshold. Donate before Wednesday's deadline to get your support on the official record." Our ruling McEnany said Trump "raised more in small dollar donations" than his Democratic competitors. Trump, in conjunction with his joint fundraising committees, did raise more money from people who donated less than $200. Because McEnany did not mention what constitutes a small donation and that the institute also was looking at contributions to joint fundraising committees, we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-03718	A proposed bill in the Florida Legislature "would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists."	/florida/statements/2013/apr/16/american-bird-conservancy/bird-group-cries-foul-about-feral-cat-bill/	Florida legislators are taking up the usual public policy topics this session: health care, taxes and campaign finance reform. Then there’s the bill about feral cats. Don’t call them feral cats, though. Bills in the Legislature are re-branding them with a more user-friendly name: "community cats." Not so fast, say the bird lovers. The American Bird Conservancy is crying fowl, er foul. The bills "would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists, in the face of potential public health and property value impacts, as well as predicted high mortality for native animals," the groups said in a press release. The conservancy says passage of two bills (HB 1121/SB 1320) would make it easier for people to dump unwanted cats in areas where they roam aplenty. "This is shocking," said Grant Sizemore, the conservancy’s Cats Indoors program manager. "Hoarding of animals in homes is prohibited in most places, but we now have Florida encouraging it in public places such as city parks. There is no question that the health of local citizenry -- including children -- is being put at risk, property values in the hoarding areas will be impacted and local wildlife will continue to be devastated." PolitiFact Florida wanted to research whether this bill would allow cat hoarding. The cat bills The "Community Cats" legislation, sponsored by Rep. Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, and Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando, attempts to rein in cat overpopulation. Several communities have established programs to spay and care for feral cats and release them, however there were concerns among some involved in such programs that the release of cats would constitute abandonment and violate state animal cruelty laws. The bill amends the state’s animal cruelty law to state that someone who spays or neuters a feral cat and then releases it is not abandoning the cat or breaking the law. The bill also states that counties and cities can still adopt their own ordinances to curtail the feral cat population. The bill defines a community cat as an "outdoor, free-roaming cat that lacks visible owner identification" and defines a "community cat owner" as someone who gives that cat food or water. Cat and wildlife activists have been battling each other about how to handle feral cats for years. A 2003 Tampa Bay Times article described a cat vs. rat battle at the Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive community of multimillion-dollar homes near a state park and wildlife refuge. Homeowners set up a program to take care of hundreds of stray cats, but meanwhile the populations of the Key Largo wood rat and cotton mouse, both endangered, dwindled. Wildlife experts pointed fingers at the cats. "It's a very serious problem for Key Largo wood rats," University of Florida wildlife scientist Frank Mazzotti said at the time. "Releasing a feral cat in a natural area is like releasing a serial murderer in a maternity ward." Central to the bill debate is whether programs that encourage the trap, neuter and release of feral cats reduce the feral cat population and the dangers to wildlife and humans. A study by scientists including from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year, and found no connection between the programs (called TNR) and fewer bird deaths. "Claims that TNR colonies are effective in reducing cat populations, and, therefore, wildlife mortality, are not supported by peer-reviewed scientific studies," it said. A 2003 Florida International University study concluded that TNR cat programs at two parks encouraged illegal dumping of cats and led to a population increase at one park, while the other remained stable. The Florida Department of Health, which remains neutral on the cat bill, stated in a 2012 rabies prevention report that managing feral cats "is not tenable on public health grounds because of the persistent threat posed to communities from injury and disease." Bill supporters point to a study published in the journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association that concluded a TNR program at the University of Central Florida reduced the population. They also point to this research about the benefits of vaccinating cats. Would this lead to hoarding? So there is evidence that feral cats carry diseases and kill wildlife. But would this bill allow animal hoarding? A spokeswoman for the Humane Society, a group supporting the bill, said bill opponents are misusing the word "hoarding." "Animal hoarding is a serious mental illness," Humane society spokeswoman Katie Lisnik told PolitiFact. "It is a severe case of neglect and abuse of animals." That’s different from programs that care for cats, she said. Hoarding -- generally speaking, not exclusively to animals -- will be listed by the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and statistical Manual for the first time this year, said Smith College psychology professor Randy Frost who studies hoarding. We asked Frost if Florida’s bill could lead to increased hoarding. "I don’t know that there is any way to tell," he said. "I think it would be hard to hoard in a field or public place. ... I don’t know of many cases of hoarding where hoarding occurred in public. I’d have to think about that." Brevard County recently placed a moratorium on registration for cat colonies -- county officials know of several hundred colonies. Bob Brown, captain of enforcement for Brevard County animal services, said he doesn’t think he would call these cat colonies hoarding. In a cat colony, "they have no control if the cat comes or goes. Usually cat hoarders want to keep things confined within their control." An outdoor colony is different than the homes where there are cat urine stains all over the walls or cat feces dripping out of cabinets. "We’ve seen some real doozies," he said. Robert Johns, a spokesman with the bird conservancy, said the law removes penalties for people who abandon animals to public places. "Instead of having a hoard of cats in a house, which is illegal in many places, we would simply have dozens or hundreds of them outdoors in many places, essentially taking over public land to be used by feral cats," he said. Our ruling The American Bird Conservancy said a bill "would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists." The bill would authorize people to neuter and release feral cats. But it’s difficult to predict how these future cat colonies will be managed and controlled by local ordinances. Is it possible that someone could hoard feral cats outdoors? Sure. But animal hoarders typically want to be able to control their cats, so that’s why they hoard inside their own homes. The research we reviewed about feral cats focused on numbers, health problems and threats to wildlife they pose -- not whether it constitutes hoarding. That could be because hoarding isn’t the central debate about these feral cats, but it is a heated word that draws attention. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-12388	President Trump greenlighted Congress to ramp up Clinton investigation.	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/31/blog-posting/fake-story-about-president-trump-greenlighting-con/	A fake news story makes the explosive claim that, on the heels of his inauguration, President Donald Trump personally greenlighted the chairman of a powerful congressional watchdog committee to pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. The story appears on the website Federalist Tribune alongside a video clip in which Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, recalled Trump speaking in general terms about Chaffetz’s oversight authority during a backstage meeting at the Jan. 26 Republican retreat in Philadelphia. But at no point does the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee claim that Trump even mentioned Clinton’s name -- much less that Trump urged him to ramp up an investigation into the 2016 Democratic nominee, as the story claims. The Federalist Tribune story, which has more than 5,000 page views at the time of this writing, is just one of several websites to use the Chaffetz video to advance the unsubstantiated claim that Trump encouraged Congress to aggressively pursue charges against Clinton. And it’s worth noting that as it stands now, we’ve rated Trump’s campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton as Stalled. The fake article opens with the inflammatory allegation that Trump has "finally given Congress the authorization" to pursue charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. It then mischaracterizes Chaffetz’s recollection of his meeting with Trump by claiming Chaffetz’s statement "hint(s) that charges against Hillary could be happening soon" -- before promising that "Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted." In truth, the video shows Chaffetz merely recalling how Trump offered him words of encouragement about staying focused on his oversight mission, without mentioning any specific investigations. Chaffetz recalled Trump telling him, "‘I understand that I’m the president. But you have a job to do. You do the oversight. You don't slow down. You go after everything you want to go after. You look at anything you want to look at.’" Chaffetz said Trump’s words at the Philadelphia convention were an inspiring message about how Trump views his committee’s government watchdog role. "If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight of the government and the function that we fulfill, you’d be pretty inspired," Chaffetz said. "And for him to convey a message of 'Don't slow down, go do your job, there’s a lot to get after with the government,' I think was a good message." It’s wrongheaded to extrapolate from Chaffetz’s statement that Trump gave his imprimatur to a ramped-up investigation into Clinton. Chaffetz’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For his part, Chaffetz said after the election that Clinton’s defeat would not signal an end to his committee’s investigation of her email practices and handling of classified information while in government. But there’s no evidence Trump has personally urged him to keep the pressure up. Our ruling A number of bloggers said President Trump greenlighted Congress to ramp up the Clinton investigation -- and used a video clip of Chaffetz to advance this claim. But these bloggers have mischaracterized the video. In it, Chaffetz describes a meeting in which Trump offered general words of encouragement and emphasized the importance of Congress’ oversight function, without reference to Clinton, or any specific investigation. At no point in the video does Chaffetz say Trump greenlighted, encouraged or even hinted at the need to ramp up an investigation into Clinton. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-01889	Says Rick Scott "cut education to pay for even more tax breaks for big, powerful, well-connected corporations."	/florida/statements/2014/jul/07/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-cut-education-pay-tax-breaks-democratic/	A new Florida Democratic Party TV ad accuses Gov. Rick Scott of siding with big business rather than public education. "He didn’t side with students and parents when Rick Scott cut education funding by over a billion dollars," the narrator says in the ad, which began airing in the Tampa, West Palm Beach and Orlando markets in early July. "Working and middle-class families? Nope. Not on their side when Scott’s cuts forced tuition increases at 11 Florida universities. Why would he do it? Whose side was Rick Scott on? Scott cut education to pay for even more tax breaks for big, powerful, well-connected corporations. With his education cuts and tuition increases, Rick Scott’s not on your side." We’ve already fact-checked claims about education cuts and tuition in the gubernatorial battle between Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, the Democratic frontrunner. Here we will fact-check the claim that "Scott cut education to pay for even more tax breaks for big, powerful, well-connected corporations." Education cuts Scott entered office in 2011 facing a $3.6 billion shortfall which led him and the Legislature to cut K-12 by $1.3 billion. (Scott actually wanted a bigger cut.) After facing a backlash, Scott sought increases in later fiscal years. The amount of K-12 spending approved by the Legislature this year will be a record in terms of total dollars. However, per-pupil spending is less than the amount in 2007-08, when Crist was governor. In 2012, the state cut about $304 million for universities, under the assumption that they would increase tuition by as much as 15 percent. The following year, lawmakers restored that money. This year, the Legislature and Scott lowered that cap to 6 percent and eliminated it for all but University of Florida and Florida State University. Business tax breaks So that’s how Scott handled education spending. What about tax breaks for corporations? A spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party pointed to a Miami Herald article about business tax breaks approved in 2012. However, it’s worth noting that those tax breaks benefited a broad array of businesses -- not only ones that were big, powerful or well-connected, as the ad claims. "From shop owners, who know little about Tallahassee politics, to the powerful business lobby that thought up many of carefully crafted tax breaks, the Legislature this year proved a friendly place," the Herald wrote. This business tax relief totaled about $750 million in the first year, and more than $2.5 billion over the next three years, the Herald reported. That fit in line with Scott’s campaign promises to expand employment as Florida continued to bounce back from the recession. The cuts included a $50,000 exemption to the corporate income tax and tax breaks for manufacturing equipment and for private planes. The Herald cited a couple of examples of businessmen who would benefit, including Frank Stronach, a billionaire horse breeder whose Gulfstream Park racetrack casino had a team of nine lobbyists in Tallahassee. "He is likely to benefit from corporate tax cuts for his businesses and a $1.2 million tax break carved out specifically for a slaughterhouse he is building near Ocala," the Herald wrote. The Orlando Sentinel cited other beneficiaries, including big telecom companies that won tax breaks and a Palm Beach Gardens-based engine manufacturer that got a sales tax break that could save it $900,000 a year. Did Scott cut money for schools to bail out corporations? Finally, is there any connection between the cuts in education spending and the tax breaks Scott implemented? The K-12 education cut did occur in 2011, and so did the university cut in 2012 -- the same year the tax breaks passed. Joshua Karp, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, told PolitiFact Florida that the two are inevitably linked. "If you increase funding in one part of general revenue, you inevitably have to cut from somewhere else," he said. "He could have chosen to put education first and found other places to cut." Independent analysts see greater room for nuance. The chronology of the cuts makes it difficult to draw any cause-and-effect conclusions. "I don’t think it is a one-for-one comparison, in that they didn’t stand around saying we will cut education to give these tax cuts," said Kim Rueben, state finance expert at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. "But given balanced budget rules and a need to pay for all spending with revenues, the folks who passed the tax cuts must have had some idea that some spending would need to be cut." Kurt Wenner -- vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a group that takes a critical look at state spending with an eye toward long-term savings -- also saw a gray area. "At best, it is an oversimplification of a very complex budget process to say education funding was reduced to pay for tax cuts," Wenner said. "There are so many factors that affect funding levels. The 2012 Legislature also swept $542 million from trust funds into general revenue. It could be argued that this more than paid for any tax cuts. Conversely, the Legislature, wisely, chose to significantly increase reserves that year. That had a much bigger impact on available funding than the tax cuts did." Our ruling A TV ad by the Florida Democratic Party says Scott "cut education to pay for even more tax breaks for big, powerful, well-connected corporations." Scott and the Legislature did cut K-12 in 2011 and money for universities in 2012. And Scott and the Legislature implemented a series of business tax breaks in 2012. However, the ad exaggerates when it focuses attention on tax breaks for "big, powerful, well-connected corporations." Some such companies benefited, but so did many other types of businesses. And the question of whether the tax cuts and the education cuts had any causal relationship is murkier than the ad lets on. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06095	Says Milwaukee County buses are no less safe now than a year or two ago.	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/05/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-chris-abele-says-county/	A spate of diametrically opposed claims about safety on Milwaukee County buses is the latest product of the increasingly bitter battle between Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. and County Executive Chris Abele. The sheriff, whose agency helps police buses, released videos of student fights to dramatize that, as he put it, "a ride on a Milwaukee county bus has become a frightening experience." The bad news aboard or around buses in December 2011 included a fight culminating in an attack against a mother who was with a 2-year-old child, an assault against a driver, a road-rage episode and stunning footage of beatings of students. Taking a somewhat longer view, Abele told reporters there is no disturbing new trend. "I think he’s misrepresenting the facts," Abele told CBS 58 TV reporter. "If the sheriff has given you the impression that transit is less safe than it was a year ago or the year before that, then he’s giving the wrong impression." We’ll focus on that two-year time period, but also peek at how Clarke can say incidents on buses have spiked five years in a row since 2006, while Abele cites a big drop comparing 2011 to 2006. This dispute escalated to the point that Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn stepped in to have his officers patrol buses, which prompted Clarke and Flynn to hammer at each other. Both Clarke and Abele referred to data on "incidents" when we asked. But Clarke couldn’t show us numbers to back up his assertion of a five-year rise. Abele did produce transit system figures, but his claim of a drop comparing 2011 to 2006 is misleading because he compared the present to a high point. In any event, the "incidents" figures are highly diluted. They include many hundreds of problems so minor -- sleeping on the bus, for example -- that neither law enforcement nor the transit system’s private security force was called in to deal with them. So let’s stick to more serious incidents -- and Abele’s statement about the last two years. We’ll look at violence, lawbreaking and other security problems that required intervention by law enforcement or G4S, the private security company formerly known as Wackenhut. Here’s our analysis of figures provided by the Milwaukee County Transit System (2011 figures are through Dec. 20). Law enforcement responses: This is arguably the most important measurement, and the trend line goes up -- though in roller-coaster fashion around 600 responses per year. Police were called in 12 percent more often in 2010 than in 2009, but those cases were on pace to fall about 5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. So, buses were less safe this year than in 2009, but more safe this year than in 2010. But if you look at the last two years mentioned by Abele, and compare the responses from the previous two years, they are up slightly, about 4 percent. All responses: Counting all instances when police and/or private security was needed, incidents went up the last two years. This year, compared to 2009, they are up more than 13 percent. Those are the broad numbers for police and private security responses. But there are hundreds of non-criminal episodes such as fare disputes included, though, so let’s take a closer look at the violent incidents. Assaults and verbal altercations against passengers: Security was called -- and law enforcement sometimes dispatched -- in 150 such cases in 2011, up from 139 in 2010 and 106 in 2009. That’s two years in a row of increases, though it moderated in 2011, according to a report MCTS ran for us. Assaults against drivers: This counts drivers struck by a person, but mainly by objects or fluids (such as spittle). There were 29 such incidents in 2009, 24 in 2010 and 25 this year. It’s fallen off more compared to 35 in 2008. There were six drivers struck by individuals in 2011, though not all of these cases were serious enough to warrant medical attention. Non-violent lawbreaking: We only have two years of data here. It was virtually unchanged at nearly 900 incidents per year, this category includes threats, weapons incidents, off-bus fights and disorderly conduct, vandalism and profane/drunken behavior. The number represents how many time private security -- and police in some cases -- were called in. Those are the numbers. A transit spokeswoman sees no red flags in the fluctuations and mixed trends. "There’s not an increase in crime, there’s an increase in attention," said Jacqueline Janz of MCTS. The numbers are a bit of a mixed bag, but show lawbreaking and violence is a consistent, if relatively uncommon, phenomenon on county buses that -- MCTS officials are quick to point out -- provide 44 million passenger trips a year on 411 buses, most without incident. Broadly speaking, it’s happening less now than five years ago, but more than it was two years ago, based on total responses by police and security. The Abele statement we are checking referred to the last two years. Assaults on drivers are notably down over two to three years. But looking at the broadest measure of serious problems (altercations among passengers), the history shows a significant increase two years in a row. That’s the time frame Abele referred to, and we think Clarke’s critique focuses mainly on these kind of serious incidents. To be sure, there’s no dramatic swing up, as Clarke’s rhetoric implied. And the picture improves when the longer view is taken, though as we noted that’s selectively taking a high point as the starting point. But Abele’s claim about buses being no less safe than a year or two ago flies in the face of the passenger altercation stats. Plus, Abele makes use of overly broad "incident" numbers that are highly misleading as a measure of crime. There’s enough counter evidence -- the declining number of bus drivers struck -- to give Abele’s claim an element of truth. But it also gives a wrong impression. That is our definition of Mostly False.	None	Chris Abele	None	None	None	2012-01-05T09:00:00	2011-12-15	['None']
pomt-12998	America’s federal business tax rate is the highest "in the world."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/15/donald-trump/pledging-cuts-donald-trump-says-wisconsin-rally-us/	During a speech in which he warmed up to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, gave a shout-out to Vince Lombardi and even name-dropped Kanye West, president-elect Donald Trump also reaffirmed his promise to cut taxes. Trump appeared Dec. 13, 2016 with vice president-elect Mike Pence and a host of Badger State Republicans, including Ryan, at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center. This stop on his multi-state "thank-you tour" was mostly a campaign-style rally, but there was some policy, too. Midway into his remarks, Trump said: "We’re going to undertake one of the great tax reforms and simplifications in American history. This includes a massive tax cut for the middle-class and middle-class families from Wisconsin, too. "We’re also going to lower our business tax rate so that new companies will come to our shores and hire workers in cities like right here. Is that OK? That’s what we want. We’re going to bring our rates down from 35 percent, we’re going to try to get it down to 15 percent. So, right now -- and by the way the jobs will pour in -- so, right now, we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And when we finish, we’ll be one of the lower taxed, one of the lower." Whether the president-elect keeps his promises on taxes will be something to be determined by PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter, which will be launched in 2017. But we can answer now whether America’s business tax rate is the highest in the world. Top U.S. rate: 35% The corporate income tax rates in the United States range from 15 to 35 percent. And that 35 percent top rate -- at least as a "statutory" rate (more on that below) -- is relatively high. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publishes the top corporate tax rates for the 35 countries that belong to its organization, which includes most advanced, industrialized nations. The U.S’ top rate of 35 percent ranks first, just ahead of France, 34.4 percent; Belgium, 33 percent; and Australia and Mexico, 30 percent. On the low end: Switzerland, 8.5 percent; Ireland, 12.5 percent; Latvia and Canada, 15 percent; and Germany, 15.8 percent. Sometimes references are made to a combined corporate tax rate, which includes federal and state corporate taxes; the U.S.’ combined rate is 38.9 percent. But Trump was referring to the 35 percent federal rate, the one he vows to reduce. There are, however, two clarifying points to make. Other nations, and what is paid To back Trump’s statement, his campaign cited a Forbes article that noted the United States has the highest corporate rate among industrialized nations. But Trump didn’t limit his statement to industrialized nations. The accounting firm PwC tracks the top federal corporate tax rates for 155 countries. That list shows five other countries that also have a top rate of 35 percent: Argentina, Chad, Congo, Malta and Zambia. And there are two countries with higher top corporate tax rates: United Arab Emirates, 55 percent; and Puerto Rico, 39 percent. It also needs to be understood that America’s 35 percent top rate is the statutory rate -- before deductions -- but U.S. companies aren’t actually taxed at that rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. Indeed, a March 2016 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that in each year from 2006 to 2012, at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability, although larger corporations were more likely to owe tax. And a May 2016 paper by Reed College economics professor Kimberly Clausing found U.S. multinational firms have used tax planning to generate effective tax rates "that are far lower than the statutory rate, and often in the single digits." Our rating Trump said America’s federal business tax rate is the highest "in the world." The top corporate tax in the United States is 35 percent, highest among the world’s industrialized nations. But five smaller nations have the same rate and two smaller ones, United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico, have rates above 35 percent. Also, the 35 percent U.S. rate is only the starting point, given that corporations can use exemptions and deductions to effectively reduce that rate and pay lower taxes. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/077f53a2-c756-458f-b4f3-4f872d820085	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-12-15T15:07:59	2016-12-13	['United_States']
pomt-03034	Says Sen. Mark Pryor voted for "special subsidies" for lawmakers and staff in Congress "so they’re protected from Obamacare."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/09/tom-cotton/cotton-says-pryor-voted-give-congress-special-subs/	Republicans have high hopes that they will topple Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas in 2014. The campaign of U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., poses a real threat in a state that has gone Republican by ever wider margins in the last four presidential elections. In 2012, President Barack Obama got just 37 percent of the vote. Cotton’s ads aim to tie Pryor to Obama, and the latest one titled "Good for the Gander" focuses on Obamacare. The tone is jaunty with geese popping up on the screen, but the message is sharp. Here’s the text: What’s good for the goose ought to be good for the gander. But not in Washington. Mark Pryor cast the deciding vote to make you live under Obamacare. But Pryor votes himself and everyone in Congress special subsidies so they’re protected from Obamacare. Exceptions and special subsidies for Mark Pryor. Higher insurance premiums for you. Mark Pryor. Voting with Obama. Voting against Arkansans. Like you. The charge that this or that Democrat cast the deciding vote for the Affordable Care Act has shown up before. In June, a conservative group leveled it at Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla, (PolitiFact Florida rated that Mostly False), and in 2012, a Republican challenger made the same claim about Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio (PolitiFact Ohio rated that False). The reality is that if any Democratic senator deserves the distinction of clearing the way for the health reform law, it is Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. As was widely reported at the time, Nelson delivered the 60th vote needed to send the bill to the floor for a vote. We spoke with Cotton’s staff and they didn’t actually say that Pryor played a unique role. They hold Pryor accountable because, "All of the votes were critical." But Pryor’s support for the Affordable Care Act was known well before the final vote. However, in this fact check, we wanted to look at the weightier claim that Pryor voted to give everyone in Congress a special subsidy to protect them from Obamacare. Not so special The "special subsidy" has its roots in a wrinkle in the Affordable Care Act. The law has a provision, pushed by Republicans, that requires members of Congress and their staff to buy health coverage through the government marketplaces that opened for business on Oct. 1. This clause treats lawmakers and congressional workers unlike any other workers in the country. At least three-quarters of Americans get insurance through their jobs, with employers paying part of the insurance premium. For the most part, Obamacare doesn’t touch that relationship. The clear exception is lawmakers and congressional workers. They must drop their current coverage and find something equivalent from insurance companies participating in the Marketplaces. But within the marketplaces, there is no explicit provision for the federal government to continue to pay the share of the premiums that it had before. The full cost would fall on the congressional workers with a price tag of thousands of dollars for each person. Even the National Review, the conservative magazine that is none too fond of Obamacare, recently wrote that the provision treats lawmakers and staff "particularly badly...People who happen to be paid by the federal treasury don’t deserve to have the entire value of their existing coverage stripped away, as almost no Americans will experience." As a fix, the Office of Personnel Management, the agency in charge of federal worker benefits, ruled that it would take the same money that it would have spent on the government’s old health insurance and spend it on whatever lawmakers and their staffs purchased on the Obamacare marketplaces. In other words, it would do what every other employer does. Continuing that cost-sharing is the "special subsidy" the Cotton ad refers to. What Pryor voted for Republicans in the House and Senate proposed language that would block the federal government from splitting the cost of the premiums with congressional workers.The measure passed in the House but died in the Senate on Sept. 30 on a straight party-line vote. Pryor voted with all the other Democrats to table the House legislation. Cotton’s office told us that by blocking the Republican measure, Pryor was allowing Congress to do something that other employers can’t do until 2017. They cited a provision in Obamacare. "Sec. 1312 (f)(2)(B)(i) specifically prohibits large businesses from doing so until 2017 and does not provide an exception for anyone to do so before that date," Cotton’s staff said. "Following OPM's ruling, only members of Congress and their staff can receive an employer contribution from a large business on the small business exchange in 2014." That interpretation is questionable. The law says, "Beginning in 2017, each state may allow issuers of health insurance coverage in the large group market in the State to offer qualified health plans in such market through an exchange." Timothy Jost, professor of law at Washington and Lee School of Law and a national expert on the text of the health care law, said Cotton’s office misreads the law. "The provision doesn’t say large employers can't contribute," Jost said. "It says large group insurance through the exchange won’t be offered to them." Another specialist in health care law, Mark Hall at the Wake Forest University School of Law, is equally emphatic. "This provision does not prevent the Office of Personnel Management or the federal government contributing to government worker’s premiums on the exchange prior to 2017," Hall said. "And doing so does not give them a special exception beyond what the ACA allows." Jost said in one place, the Affordable Care Act tells Congress to offer members of Congress and staffers insurance through the marketplace, and in another, it blocks states from offering large group insurance plans through the marketplaces for several years. "The two are completely unrelated," Jost said. Our ruling Cotton said Pryor voted for "special subsidies" for lawmakers and staff in congress "so they’re protected from Obamacare." The subsidy referred to is the government continuing to share the cost of insurance premiums as is standard practice in every establishment that offers insurance to its workers. There is nothing special about that. The only thing special about Obamacare and Congress is that the law treated Congress and its workers differently than any other group of workers. Cotton relies on an interpretation of the law that independent experts say is wrong. The assertion falls wide of the facts, and we rate this claim False.

pomt-10006	"As a percentage of gross domestic product, we are reducing nondefense discretionary spending to its lowest level since the '60s, lower than it was under Reagan, lower than it was under Clinton, lower than it was under Bush, or both Bushes."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/25/barack-obama/obamas-claim-about-government-spending-chooses-mos/	Under fire from Republicans for his proposed budget, President Obama has been using a couple of comebacks. He says his proposed budgets would cut the deficit in half in five years (a claim we rated Mostly True ) and that they would reduce "nondefense discretionary spending" (a key phrase that we'll explain shortly) to historically low levels. At a White House news conference on March 24, Obama said that under his plans, the NDD spending (we're not fond of acronyms, but we'll use NDD because nondefense discretionary spending is such a mouthful) will fall to its lowest level since the 1960s. Asked by a reporter about long-term estimates that show growth in spending under his budget, Obama said much of the growth is in mandatory programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that go up automatically. "We're very serious about working on a bipartisan basis to reduce those deficits, or reduce those costs — you're not going to see those savings reflected until much later." But he indicated that his administration was also being fiscally responsible. "Just to give one other example — as a percentage of gross domestic product, we are reducing nondefense discretionary spending to its lowest level since the '60s — lower than it was under Reagan, lower than it was under Clinton, lower than it was under Bush — or both Bushes." We wondered if that was true. But first, we should explain a couple of basic concepts. Policymakers focus on the NDD spending because it's the part of the budget that the president and Congress can most easily control. The mandatory programs are just that — mandatory. They include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, programs that go up automatically based on how many people are eligible. Defense costs are often excluded because they are subject to outside forces such as whether the United States is at war. So that leaves NDD as everything else the government spends money on — education, agriculture, transportation, social programs, NASA, and a host of other things. Policymakers often measure government spending against the gross domestic product, the total output of the U.S. economy, to show the relative share of government spending in the overall economy. So now let's examine Obama's claim. First, we should note that although it was clear Obama was talking about the long-term impact of his budget, he didn't specify a time frame. A listener might not know if he was talking about the first five years or the last five, or some other period. That allowed him to do some cherry-picking, to rely on the one number that supports his point when others do not. Indeed, he achieves that historic spending level only once in his 10-year-projection — in 2019, the final year, according to numbers from his Office of Management and Budget. (We should note that, unless the constitutional term limit is changed before then, even if he wins a second term, Obama will be out of office in January 2017, two years before we can see if his budget projections came true.) Also, it's important to note that these are White House estimates. Administration officials say they are based on realistic policy decisions for future years, but the numbers have been criticized for being too optimistic. Brian Riedl, a budget analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said Obama is using unrealistic numbers to make his spending appear lower. "This is a complete gimmick," Riedl said, adding that "President Bush played the same game." Indeed, this is a standard ploy for presidents to promise to meet goals in later years when the circumstances are beyond their control. Presidents assume very low growth in government spending for the long-term to make their budgets look more lean. But when those years come, they usually propose much higher spending, Riedl said. At the news conference, Obama acknowledged that his analysis was relying on GDP projections that are more optimistic than the ones from the Congressional Budget Office, a well-respected nonpartisan group. But he said his numbers were in line with other prominent economists. So where does this leave us? Obama's claim is that "we are reducing nondefense discretionary spending to its lowest level since the '60s." Although his statement suggests broad success, he achieves the historic level only in the last year. Yes, it would be lower than the other presidents, but it would beat the lowest number only in 2019 — a year when Obama will be out of office. And he relies on economic assumptions that are slightly more optimistic than the ones from the well-respected CBO. So we find Obama's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11876	The University of Missouri saw "the biggest drop in enrollment of any major university in the country" since the 2015 protests.	/missouri/statements/2017/oct/30/eric-greitens/greitens-mostly-false-about-mu-having-biggest-enro/	November marks the two-year anniversary of the height of protests that took place on the University of Missouri’s campus. Protests over multiple racial issues culminated with a boycott by football players, a six-day hunger strike and, on Nov. 9, the resignations of the university system president and the MU chancellor. The University of Missouri has since experienced a noticeable dip in enrollment. Gov. Eric Greitens even went as far as to say in a Facebook Live video on Aug. 23, 2017, "I believe that this is the biggest drop in enrollment of any major university in the country." Big decline, yes. But is it the worst drop in enrollment in the country? Is it just MU? In his video, Greitens goes on to state that freshman enrollment has dipped by 33 percent since protests in 2015 brought national media attention to the SEC school. The governor’s office didn’t respond to our request for clarifications. Because Greitens referred to major universities, we decided to take a look at four-year public universities containing 20,000 or more students. We chose these universities because the Department of Education lists MU in this group. According to the Department of Education data, MU was not the only university to experience a drop in enrollment. Departmental data show that MU's total enrollment declined from 35,424 in 2015 to 33,239 in 2016, or 6.17 percent. That puts the university in fourth place for enrollment decline. The top three: --Florida State University at Jacksonville, which is predominantly a two-year college, came in third with a 7.97 percent decrease in enrollment. --The University of Akron main campus fell 8.66 percent. --The largest decline was at Miami-Dade College, also predominantly a two-year college, which saw enrollment drop 11.43 percent. Greitens spoke before this year’s official enrollment figures were out, but the decline has continued. The Department of Education hasn’t finished gathering numbers for 2017 enrollment. On Sep. 20, MU announced an enrollment of 30,870, according to the MU News Bureau. That’s a drop of 12.9 percent from 2015. Freshmen enrollment is down even more. Since the protests on campus, MU experienced a 36.5 percent drop in freshman enrollment, more than the 33 percent decline Greitens mentions. According to the Department of Education, first-year student numbers for 2016-2017 are still not yet available for all universities, so there is no way to tell if MU experienced the largest drop in freshman enrollment. Our ruling Greitens said, "I believe that this is the biggest drop in enrollment of any major university in the country." MU has undoubtedly experienced a drop in overall enrollment since protests that took place two years ago. However, MU’s overall enrollment decline did not top other universities like Miami-Dade College or the four-year University of Akron. As far as freshman enrollment, numbers for 2016-17 have not yet been made available, so there is no way to tell if MU experienced the biggest drop in enrollment. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12110	"Crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor."	/california/statements/2017/aug/22/john-moorlach/has-crime-been-getting-worse-jerry-brown-was-elect/	Republicans including California State Sen. John Moorlach have railed against Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown for signing a gas tax increase earlier this year. The Orange County lawmaker took his criticism a step further in a recent op-ed in which he predicted the gas tax hike, combined with California’s cap-and-trade extension, would boost gas prices so much that thieves would start siphoning fuel from cars. Moorlach went on to declare that crime has been on the rise under Brown. "Crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor," Moorlach wrote in the Aug. 4 piece in the Sacramento Bee. "The Bee reported, three-quarters of California’s largest cities saw violent crime rise in 2015, with Sacramento’s up 25 percent." We’ve fact-checked similar claims about increasing crime rates from other California lawmakers including State Sen. Jeff Stone of Riverside County and Assemblyman Travis Allen, an Orange County Republican running for governor. There’s been some truth in those claims, but those who made them also ignored key context or distorted the facts. We wondered how Moorlach’s statement, specifically the portion about crime getting worse since Brown was elected, stacked up. California crime trends Before diving into the senator’s claim, here’s some background on California crime trends. Like the rest of the United States, California has experienced a dramatic long-term reduction in crime over the past several decades. Between 1980 and 2015, the state’s overall crime rate declined by about 60 percent, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. SOURCE: California Legislative Analyst's Office. The property crime rate peaked in California at nearly 7,000 crimes per 100,000 population in the early 1980s. Three decades later, it had dropped by more than half. The violent crime rate saw a similar dramatic drop during this period. Moorlach’s claim In his op-ed, Moorlach focuses on crime "since Jerry Brown was elected governor." We took that to mean Brown’s current stretch as governor, which started with his election to a third term in 2010 and continued with re-election to a fourth term in 2014. Brown served his first two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983. For this current stretch, we looked at crime data from 2010 through 2016, the most current year available. We also considered the period 2010 through 2015 because Moorlach’s spokesman said the senator did not have had access to a California Department of Justice report on crime for 2016, given that it was released two weeks after his op-ed published. No matter the exact years selected, California’s crime story during over the past half decade is not as simple as Moorlach’s statement implies. The statewide crime rate, which measures both violent and property crimes, ticked up in 2012 and 2015. It decreased, however, in the other four years during Brown’s current stint. This overall crime rate includes violent and property crimes. Violent crimes are homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Examples of property crimes include burglary, theft and vandalism. Jonathan Peterson, a fiscal and policy analyst at the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, cautioned that year-over-year changes can make it look like crime is growing rapidly, "but it could be a blip." Peterson said the past six to seven years have been marked by fluctuations in California’s crime rate, not a steady increase or decrease. Stanford Law School Professor John Donohue, who researches crime trends, said Moorlach's claim might contain an element of truth but overall is flawed. "One has to be very cautious about politicians making statements about crime because they will often try to make the numbers say something that isn’t quite representative," said Donohue. "The broad trend for the last 25 years has been down and very benign. Crime is at a much lower level in practically every place today than it was 25 years ago. But in the last couple years there has been an uptick (in California and nationwide), and that’s a reason for concern." Deeper look at crime data To fact-check Moorlach’s claim about crime getting worse, we examined statistics from the California Department of Justice’s recent report Crime in California 2016. It includes crime rate data from 1966 through 2016. The data show that from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year from which Moorlach likely drew his conclusions, California’s overall crime rate declined slightly from 3,069 crimes per 100,000 population to 3,047 crimes per 100,000. This casts doubt on Moorlach’s claim that crime has been getting worse. Even when examining the violent crime rate alone, the results are mixed. In three of the years since Brown was elected, the violent crime rate notched up, while it dipped in the the other three years. Had Moorlach narrowed his claim to 2011, Brown’s first year back as governor, through 2015, the crime story would be slightly different. California’s overall crime rate inched up between those years, from 3,007 crimes per 100,000 population to 3,047 per 100,000. Moorlach’s response Sen. Moorlach’s spokesman provided us with links to about a half-dozen news articles that detailed crime increases across California. None of the articles, however, showed a sustained increase from 2010 through 2016. In his op-ed, Moorlach cited a spike in violent crime in 2015. He’s right for that single year for that type of crime: state justice department figures show an 8.4 percent rise in violent crime in 2015 compared with the prior year. In recent months, politicians such as Assemblyman Allen have pointed to this period as evidence for growing crime concern in California. Many have cited a PPIC analysis comparing the first half of 2014 to the same period in 2015. It found widespread increases in crime rates in California cities with a population greater than 100,000. Of the 66 California cities that size, 49 saw an increase in violent crime and 48 experienced increases in property crime. Many saw double digit percent increases. A subsequent report comparing the first half of 2016 with the first half of 2015 showed overall crime decreasing, driven by a drop in property crimes. That report was published by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a policy research group that makes recommendations on alternatives to incarceration. Two weeks after Moorlach’s op-ed was published, the California Department of Justice released statewide crime statistics for 2016. That report showed a slight decrease in the total crime rate, driven by a nearly 3 percent decline in the property crime rate. Violent crime, meanwhile, increased about 4 percent in 2016. We won’t use these statistics as a determining factor in our rating for Moorlach’s claim since his spokesman said the senator didn’t have the report. The 2016 data, however, appear to support the idea that crime has not followed a consistent pattern in California over the past half dozen years. Our rating Republican State Sen. John Moorlach recently claimed "crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor." His spokesman pointed to news articles that cite an uptick in crime in 2015, when many large cities in California saw double-digit increases in violent crime. But neither those articles nor state crime reports show a sustained increase from the time of Brown was elected governor in 2010 through the current period. In fact, there was a slight decrease in the state’s overall crime rate from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year Moorlach was likely referring to. Crime researchers emphasized that California and the nation have experienced a dramatic decrease in crime in recent decades. They say California’s crime rate increases in 2012 and in 2015, however, are reason for concern but are not evidence that crime has gotten worse over the past half dozen years. We rate Moorlach’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. After the Fact: Moorlach responds to crime fact check After our fact-check published, Sen. Moorlach responded by saying crime has increased in California under Gov. Jerry Brown if one looks at a more narrow period, from 2011 through 2015. We used 2010 as a baseline for our research given that Moorlach’s original statement said "crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor." Voters elected Brown governor in November 2010 and he took office in January 2011. Using 2010 as a baseline both adhered to Moorlach’s original timeframe and gave us a chance to examine how the crime rate had changed under Brown compared with the year immediately preceding his governorship. Moorlach correctly points out on Twitter that: "Your own report admits crime increased from 2011-2015, a very large period of Gov. Brown's time in office." He also emphasized this point in a blog post on Medium.com. As we pointed out in the fact check, the crime rate has fluctuated during Brown’s tenure. It increased in 2012 and again in 2015, provoking concern from politicians and those who research crime trends. The other four years under Brown, however, the crime rate has decreased. In the end, when one measures the overall crime rate from 2010 through 2015 and through 2016, both fuller pictures of Brown’s time in office, there’s a slight decrease. Our rating remains the same.

pomt-04475	Says Texas lawmakers last year expanded public education’s share of state spending.	/texas/statements/2012/oct/08/joe-straus/joe-straus-says-lawmakers-increased-share-state-sp/	Asked if public school advocates should prepare for lawmakers to wield knives afresh next year, the speaker of the Texas House challenged the premise. Joe Straus, featured at a Texas Tribune Festival breakfast, said: "We worked really hard to ensure that public education, higher education, is the largest piece of the budget pie. We did that in this last session too. The pie got smaller, but the piece for public education actually got larger." His comment was noted for us by Joshua Fechter, a University of Texas journalism student. We’ve previously checked Straus, a San Antonio Republican, summarizing legislative decision-making by the Republican-steered 2011 Legislature. In May 2011, he said a House-Senate deal on the state budget "funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities, and provides financial aid for college students while keeping substantial revenue in reserves and avoiding any new taxes." Unsaid: Public schools were poised to field $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would have gotten under established funding formulas. Higher education, except for community colleges, was likewise due to sustain funding cuts and nursing homes were about to be left with lower rates than they had after the 2009 legislative session. Such reductions were put into play as lawmakers wrapped up a total 2012-13 budget, counting state plus federal funds, of $173.5 billion, down $14 billion from the 2010-11 total, according to the advisory Legislative Budget Board’s January 2012 "Fiscal Size-up" report. The latest budget reduces state general-revenue spending to $81.3 billion, a nearly 1 percent drop from 2010-11, the report says. So, Straus was correct the agreed-upon budget "funded" the cited items, but his statement failed to acknowledge the funding levels were mostly ratcheting down. We rated his statement as Half True. Other leaders subsequently distorted legislative actions affecting public schools. State Rep. Myra Crownover, for instance, said lawmakers increased state education spending by $1.6 billion. That was about right solely per the state’s Foundation School Program, which is supposed to ensure each school district has adequate resources. But her claim did not account for more than $5 billion in school funding reductions, leading us to rate her statement as Pants on Fire. Specifically, lawmakers did not fund the costs of projected enrollment increases and cut by $2 billion a year what schools were accustomed to drawing down via longstanding finance formulas. Members also postponed to the next two-year budget period a regular distribution of state education aid, lately estimated to total $1.9 billion. Finally, schools were hit by a $1.3 billion reduction in funding for targeted programs including teacher incentive pay, dropout prevention funding and grants for pre-Kindergarten Early Start. A similar claim by State Comptroller Susan Combs also caught fire on the Truth-O-Meter. Combs, who oversees state finances, incorrectly told a Brazos County group that lawmakers had not cut school aid. Conversely, we rated as True a March 2012 statement by state Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, that the legislative decisions mean the state’s public schools are spending, on average, $500 less per student than before. Back to Straus’s recent statement: Could it be that despite the much-noted reductions, the 2011 Legislature devoted a bigger piece of state spending to public education than before? Straus spokesman Jason Embry, drawing from the "Fiscal Size-up," told us by email that state money flowing to schools through the Texas Education Agency in the two-year budget exceeds the comparable share of such funding in the 2010-11 budget. In the previous budget, Embry said, the agency accounted for $30.3 billion, or 37 percent, of $81.9 billion in all state spending. He said lawmakers budgeted $30.5 billion for the agency in 2012-13, accounting for 37.4 percent of all the general-revenue spending. Curious, we also checked on whether public education comprised a greater share of all spending in the budget, meaning state general revenue plus federal aid. It did. Some $47 billion in education agency funds comprised 27.3 percent of all spending, compared to 26.7 percent of the full 2010-11 budget. Finally, we asked the Texas Association of School Boards, which represents school districts, for a longer look at the share of state spending devoted to public education over recent years. Spokesman Dominic Giarratani, drawing information from budget-board reports, said by email that since 2002-03, the public education share of state spending topped out at 40 percent in 2008-09. He said the period’s low-water mark, set in 2004-05, was 36 percent -- or 1.4 percentage points below education’s share of state general-revenue spending as described by Straus. Our ruling As Straus says, public education made up a greater share of state spending in the 2012-13 budget than in the 2010-11 budget. Bur this statement lacks vital clarifying information -- that school funding still took a substantial hit. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-00891	"Contrary to popular belief, we actually don’t have that many public employees…We are well below average in the number of public employees.’’	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/08/gina-raimondo/gov-gina-raimondo-says-ri-well-below-average-numbe/	Governor Raimondo sounded an alarm about state spending and looming budget deficits at a news conference last month. "Out of whack … Alarming … Scary," she said. Her presentation included facts and figures about public employees and their salaries. "Contrary to popular belief, we actually don’t have that many public employees…We are well below average in the number of public employees," she said. When we called Raimondo’s office, Marie Aberger, the governor’s spokeswoman, told us that Raimondo was referring to all federal, state and municipal employees, including educators, when she said "public employees." The governor’s office forwarded a chart to us that was compiled using U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics information from November 2013. It showed that Rhode Island had the lowest percentage of government employees in New England. According to the chart, a total of 59,800, or 11.6 percent, of the state’s 514,100 jobs are in the public sector. New Hampshire was second lowest, with 12.5 percent, followed by Massachusetts (13.1 percent), Connecticut (13.3 percent), Maine (15 percent) and Vermont (16.3 percent). But those are just the New England numbers. Where does Rhode Island rank nationally in percentage of public employees? We got those figures when we reached out to the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. Spokesman Michael J. Healey provided us with calculations from its labor market information division. Donna Murray, assistant director of the division, compared the number of government jobs -- including federal workers and educators -- to the number of non-farm jobs in every state and determined what percentage the public-sector jobs made up. Those calculations indicated that as of December 2014, the state had a total of 59,700 government jobs, which accounted for 12.5 percent of the state’s 478,900 total positions. Of the state’s public sector jobs, 10,500 are federal, Murray said. This ties Rhode Island with Nevada as the states with the second lowest percentage of public employees in the nation. Pennsylvania was the sole state with a lower percentage, at 12.3 percent. By contrast, Wyoming had the highest percentage of public employees at 24.2 percent. Nationally, government jobs make up an average of 15.9 percent of total non-farm jobs, according to the department’s calculations. We wondered how Rhode Island compares when federal jobs are excluded, and only state and local workers are counted, since those are the jobs that impact state and municipal budgets. We contacted Governing, a non-partisan magazine and website that tracks politics, policy and management for state and local government leaders. It published its own analysis, entitled "States With Most Government Employees: Per Capita Rates By Job Type". (The governor’s office also referred us to this analysis.) The Governing analysis was published last March, using 2012 numbers. Mike Maciag, the data editor at Governing, agreed to run more current numbers for us to determine how Rhode Island’s rate of state and local public employees compares with rates of other states and the national average. Maciag used 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll for his calculations. According to the analysis, Rhode Island had 458 state and local employees -- including teachers -- per 10,000 residents, he said. This placed the Ocean State as the state with the seventh-lowest number of public employees in the country. Wyoming had the most public employees per 10,000 -- 866. Nevada had the least -- 368 . The national average was 538. For the record, according to Healey, Rhode Island had a total of 16,100 state employees as of December 2014. That includes 10,805 in state government, 4,612 in higher education, and 683 in the judiciary. Our ruling Governor Raimondo said that Rhode Island was "well below average" in the number of public employees. Information provided to us by the governor’s office and the state Department of Labor and Training support that claim, as does an analysis done by Governing, the non-partisan magazine and website We rate her claim True.

pomt-03639	"Just about everyone everywhere is spending more hours on the job, less time with their families, bringing home smaller and smaller paychecks, while they're paying more and more at the gas pump and the grocery stores."	/ohio/statements/2013/may/03/ed-fitzgerald/ed-fitzgerald-says-people-are-working-longer-hours/	Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald formally announced his candidacy for governor last month, kicking off his campaign with speeches in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. The Democrat, taking aim at the man he hopes to unseat next year, portrayed Republican Gov. John Kasich as a politician whose policies hurt middle-class Ohioans. "Just about everyone everywhere is spending more hours on the job, less time with their families, bringing home smaller and smaller paychecks, while they're paying more and more at the gas pump and the grocery stores," FitzGerald told supporters. PolitiFact Ohio wondered about the basis for the statement and asked for sources. For the claim about "more hours on the job, less time with their families," FitzGerald's staff cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to its American Time Use Survey, the average employed American spent an average of 7.6 hours per day working on days that they worked in 2011, the most recent year available. That's an increase from 7.48 hours in 2010. They also cited an article from the news service The Fiscal Times that reported Americans are logging in more time at work, skipping vacation time and increasingly handling work-related email on vacation and weekend time. As for the "smaller paychecks," FitzGerald's camp said that "the real hourly wages of Ohio workers have failed to keep pace with inflation" since 2010, decreasing the salaries of workers in inflation-adjusted dollars. Their source was the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its data show that the mean and median hourly wages of Ohioans rose from $19.66 and $15.45 in 2010 to $20.52 and $16.03 in 2012. When adjusted for inflation and measured in current dollars, however, using the CPI inflation calculator, mean and median hourly wages fell from $20.99 and $16.49 in 2010 to $20.52 and $16.25 in 2012. PolitiFact has always stipulated that the ability of an individual governor to influence the economy is limited. Determining how credit or blame should be apportioned is seldom clear. We did not assign credit to Kasich for his statement in March that Ohioans' wages have risen by more than $10 billion since 2010. But we rated the statement as True. We can't rate FitzGerald's linking of Kasich to his statement about people spending more hours on the job and bringing home smaller paychecks. But his statement is accurate, with the point of clarification that "smaller paychecks" are in inflation-adjusted current dollars. Because that additional information is needed, we rate the statement as Mostly True.	None	Ed FitzGerald	None	None	None	2013-05-03T06:00:00	2013-04-24	['None']
pomt-11877	"The six wealthiest people in the world (have) as much wealth as the bottom half of the world’s population, 3.7 billion people."	/missouri/statements/2017/oct/30/bernie-sanders/sanders-token-claim-economic-disparity-accurate-ca/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., spoke Sept. 21 at Westminster College in Fulton, where he laid out his vision for foreign policy. Like many of his other speeches, he touched on economic disparity and said, "There is no moral or economic justification for the six wealthiest people in the world having as much wealth as the bottom half of the world’s population, 3.7 billion people." We wanted to know if it is possible that the collective wealth of the six richest people could equal more than that of half the world’s entire population. Where is this coming from? Sanders’ source is a 2017 Oxfam report that is put together using numbers from Forbes and Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Databook, according to Joshua Miller-Lewis, Sanders’ press secretary. The Oxfam report states that the eight richest men in the world had as much wealth as 3.6 billion people in the world, or half that population. But since that report, the numbers have changed: The rich have gotten richer while overall global wealth has decreased, according to the underlying data used by Oxfam. Oxfam’s calculations come from wealth estimates by Credit Suisse, a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, said Laura Rusu, policy and campaigns media manager for Oxfam America. Based on the latest data from Credit Suisse, the wealth of the bottom 50 percent of the global population is $409 billion. The six wealthiest people in the world add up to about $416.2 billion, according to Forbes. "The 1 percent now controls more wealth than the 99 percent of the rest of us combined, and it’s only getting worse," said Rusu. The six richest people, according to Forbes billionaire list, are Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Amancio Ortega, Mark Zuckerberg and Carlos Slim Helú . Some caveats While Sanders’ claim is accurate, there are some notes of caution. "I think this statement is correct but it is not very meaningful because the bottom 50 percent has essentially no wealth," said economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley. While many of the economists we spoke to agreed that the statement is technically correct, the issue lies with wealth measures. Most of the wealth of the rich is from fungible private wealth, which is an asset’s interchangeability with assets of the same type. "It is probably the case that one-half the world’s population has almost no fungible private wealth. So by that measure, Bernie Sanders may be right," said Richard Burkhauser, professor emeritus of policy analysis at Cornell University College of Human Ecology. Rusu further explained that the Oxfam reports have seen a drop in private wealth, compared to the world’s collective wealth, but this has to do with an improved data collection method and not necessarily a change in people’s wealth. "The dramatic drop isn’t due purely to a sharp increase in inequality, but rather the availability of better data," Rusu told PolitiFact Missouri. Our ruling While giving a speech in Fulton, Missouri, Bernie Sanders stated that the six richest people in the world had as much wealth as the bottom half of the world’s 3.7 billion people. According to global wealth disparity research, it is factually accurate to say that six men are, collectively, richer than the bottom 50 percent of the world. However, an expert cautioned about reading too much into this specific statistic because of the way wealth is measured and improvements in data collection. Sanders’ statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2017-10-30T23:16:48	2017-09-21	['None']
pomt-08026	The state is able to sharply curtail contract bargaining rights for state employee unions.	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/07/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-state-can-severely/	There’s little doubt about where Gov. Scott Walker is coming from when it comes to public employees and the size of state government. With a hole of about $3 billion in the state budget, Walker aims to wring as many concessions as possible from state workers. In a Jan. 3, 2011 New York Times article, Walker called public employees "haves" and taxpayers "have-nots." And he has vowed to restore balance for taxpayers. In December 2010, even before he took office, the door opened wider for Walker when the Democratic-controlled Legislature could not muster enough votes to approve contracts for 39,000 state workers negotiated by outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat. Those contracts, which cover 2009-2011, and future deals are now in the hands of Walker, a Republican, and the GOP-controlled Legislature. In early December, at a Milwaukee Press Club luncheon, Walker indicated that when he took office he would take a broad view of his authority. Walker said he was open to considering "anything from the decertify all the way through modifications of the current laws in place." He added: "The bottom line is that we are going to look at every legal means we have to try to put that balance more on the side of taxpayers and the people who care about services." If anything, now that Walker’s in office, the question of what authority he and like-minded lawmakers have to change bargaining rules is more important. Could Walker, as he claimed, take action to sharply curtail the bargaining rights of state employee unions? Let’s start with the question of "decertifying" unions. That phrase refers to a decision by union members to disband. Government cannot decertify a union; only the members can. Walker clearly incorrectly used that term -- he repeated it after it was included in a question by a reporter at the Press Club event. In the wake of Walker’s comment, some critics seized on that word to declare Walker was flat-out wrong about what he could do as governor. However, focusing on the word "decertify" ignores the entirety of the full statement, which is what we are evaluating in this item. "He can’t decertify a union per se," labor historian Ken Germanson said in a radio interview with WUWM. But Germanson and other labor experts agree that Walker and the Legislature have control over bargaining parameters because it is the state that sets the rules for the areas subject to negotiations. That is, Walker can change the rules if the Legislature goes along. And with Republicans holding both chambers, he may have support on those fronts. What would Walker have to do? It’s as simple -- and complicated -- as amending the state Employee Relations Act, said Peter Davis, general counsel at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. While federal labor law covers unions at private employers; state employees are covered by that piece of state law. Though it has not changed much over the years, it could be changed. "The rights established by the State Employment Labor Relations Act have not been amended in any significant way for at least the last 30 years -- aside from expanding/adding the types/numbers of employees who have (the) rights," Davis said. Davis and other experts say Walker and the Legislature probably could not do away with labor unions entirely, but they could modify what’s subject to negotiations. For instance, they could eliminate subjects like health insurance and pensions from collective bargaining. That would allow the administration to impose changes in those areas. Walker has said requiring employees to pay 5 percent of wages toward their pensions and 12 percent of their health care costs could save the state $150 million between January and June. Other permitted topics for bargaining include wages, vacation time and work conditions. State employee unions do not have a right to binding arbitration to settle impasses. And the labor act forbids strikes -- something the state likely would not want to give up. Without arbitration or a credible strike threat, Davis said, when compared to other public employee unions "state employee unions have always had less power at the bargaining table." Marty Beil, executive director of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, told the Journal Sentinel that the state law "assures the uninterrupted delivery of high-quality public services and has kept labor peace for more than three decades." Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor would not include a rewrite of the state law as part of the emergency special session of the Legislature called to deal with the economy and jobs. He said there are a number of options available, including immediately beginning talks with state employee unions. "There are two parties in contract negotiations, the state and the unions," Werwie said. "My guess is that union leadership will stay the same, the state negotiator will change (under Walker), which I would argue is a 50 percent change in participants. That 50 percent change will provide the incoming administration with greater latitude in contract talks." All that remains to be seen. Where does that leave us right now? In his response to a question, Walker misused the phrase "decertify" -- he can’t make state employees unions vanish. But labor experts agree with the central part of Walker’s statement -- the Legislature could rewrite the laws governing what issues are subject to negotiation, which could tilt the bargaining table in the administration’s favor. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-01-07T09:00:00	2010-12-07	['None']
pomt-01853	Fox News is "banned in Canada" because it violates a law that "prevents ‘news’ channels from lying to their viewers."	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/14/facebook-posts/fox-news-banned-canada/	Red foxes may roam all over Canada but you won’t catch the conservative news network there, according to an Internet meme circulating since 2011. One version of the meme states that Fox New Channel is "banned from operating in Canada" because "it’s illegal in Canada to lie on airwaves." A reader sent the message to us and asked us to check it out. A mountie of lies We weren’t able to verify the origins of the meme, though Bill O’Reilly himself said in 2004 that Fox wasn’t allowed in Canada -- not that he agreed with the lying part. The earliest iteration of the full claim we found comes from a Feb. 28, 2011, Huffington Post blog post by liberal radio host and activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. "The (false news) provision has kept Fox News and right wing talk radio out of Canada and helped make Canada a model for liberal democracy and freedom," wrote Kennedy. "As a result of that law, Canadians enjoy high-quality news coverage including the kind of foreign affairs and investigative journalism that flourished in this country before Ronald Reagan abolished the ‘Fairness Doctrine’ in 1987." What Kennedy is likely referring to are provisions in Canadian broadcast policy, include the Radio Act and other policies, that prohibit "any false or misleading news." These provisions against spreading misinformation used to be part of Canada’s criminal code, according to Canadian media lawyer Paul Schabas. They were famously evoked to send Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi publisher Ernst Zündel to trial in the 1980s. After the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the code violated freedom of expression rights and thus was unconstitutional, the false news provisions were just regulations. How does this relate to Fox News? It doesn't. Fox News first bid for broadcast in Canada -- filed by private Canadian operators, along with HBO, ESPN, and other American channels -- was rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the federal body that regulates the airwaves, in 2003. But the regulators were concerned with the effect of foreign competition on Canadian networks, not with Fox News’ truthfulness. Years earlier in 2000, regulators approved a proposal for Fox News Canada, which was to include content from both countries under media content law. But the channel never got off the ground. According to a commission report, Fox News told the Canadian network Global News Network that it "did not wish to have its signal interrupted by the insertion of Canadian programming as would be required under the licence for Fox News Canada." Fox News executive Janet Alshouse said there were no serious discussions with Global nor was there ever a partnership. After the project fizzled out in 2004, the regulators approved Fox for broadcast on Canadian airwaves via satellite in the same year. So right now, Canadians can watch Bill O’Reilly, Megyn Kelly, Fox & Friends and everyone else through several private dish providers. "I live in Toronto, where Fox is pumped into cable from Buffalo. Canadians also get ABC, NBC, CNN. But you know, we also watch (Canadian channels) CBC, CTV, Global," said Schabas. More on the Canadian policy Any network that wants to broadcast in Canada must get approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. And Canadians who take issue with the truthfulness of their programming can file complaints to the commission. If a network amasses enough complaints and is found to have knowingly and deliberately broadcasted false news, its license can be limited or revoked. But that has never happened before, commission spokesperson Eric Rancourt said "Based on the history of these kind of complaints, it would have be very, very egregious for the commission (to revoke or deny a license). That’s all speculative, since it hasn’t happened before," Rancourt said. The commission has only taken serious action a couple of times in its history, and not against Fox News, but Al Jazeera, according to commission regulator Sheehan Carter. The commission approved the Arabic-language news channel in 2004, with the condition that distributors must edit out abusive content. The condition doesn’t apply to Al Jazeera English. The ruling The meme claims that Fox News is "banned from operating in Canada" because it violates a law that "prevents ‘news’ channels from lying to their viewers." That’s incorrect. Fox was denied broadcast in 2003, but not because Canadians found it to be untruthful. And Fox News got its approval to broadcast via satellite in 2004 and certainly has a dish presence up north today. This claim rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-00208	Says U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters "took $213,000 from insurance interests" and that she supported a plan that "strips protections for people with pre-existing conditions and slaps an age tax on older Californians."	/california/statements/2018/oct/16/house-majority-pac/did-mimi-walters-get-over-200000-insurance-industr/	It wasn’t that long ago that Republicans were attacking Democrats for supporting the Affordable Care Act. Now, it’s Democrats who are taking the offensive and attacking Republicans for their efforts to repeal the ACA, also known as Obamacare. The latest target: Rep. Mimi Walters, a California Republican representing an Orange County district that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. A new TV attack ad by the House Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, claims that "Walters took big bucks from insurance interests," with an image on screen saying Walters took $213,000 from the insurance industry. The ad also claims that Walters supported a health care plan that "strips protections for people living with pre-existing conditions and slaps an age tax on older Californians," and that Walters voted with Trump 99 percent of the time. We fact-checked whether Walters voted 99 percent of the time with Trump in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll take on the claims about Walters’ ties to insurance interests, and her votes to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions and whether she supported an "age tax." What we found is that the ad is slightly misleading on the amount insurance donations Walters has received, and overstates what it describes as an "age tax." Walters did not respond to a request for comment. Walters, pre-existing conditions and an "age tax" The pre-existing conditions and age tax portion of the ad is in reference to Walters’ 2017 vote to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, often shorthanded as Obamacare, and to replace it with the American Health Care Act. (The AHCA passed the House but ultimately failed in the Senate.) Obamacare prohibits insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, a provision that had been threatened by Republican efforts to repeal the law. Under Obamacare, if you don’t have health insurance through an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market, regardless of your health status, and you can’t be billed higher rates for a pre-existing medical condition. Under the GOP’s American Health Care Act, it would have kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions must be offered health insurance – but it would have dropped Obamacare’s rules capping how much extra those people could be charged. In short, insurers would have been required to offer everyone a plan, but insurers would have more control over how much they could charge. Experts say that would have effectively priced many people living with pre-existing conditions out of the insurance market. When Republicans claimed that the AHCA would not threaten coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, we rated those claims Mostly False. The ad also claims that Walters’ vote for the AHCA imposes an "age tax" on older Californians. The bill would have allowed insurers to hike premiums for certain older enrollees from up to five times more than what they would charge younger adults. The current law, Obamacare, sets that cap at up to three times as much. The legislation also would have allowed states to set a different ratio. The "age tax" also doesn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or to people over the age of 50 with medical covered sponsored by large employers. It is important to note, though, that it would impact people in the 50-64 age range who weren’t covered by an employer as they are not yet eligible for Medicare. The $200,000 from insurance interests The ad claims that Mimi Walters took $213,000 from insurance interests, citing the Center for Responsive Politics, an authoritative database that tracks campaign finance. In the report, the CRP found that Walters received $213,575 from the insurance industry from 2013 to 2018. In the 2017-18 election cycle, she has received $68,500. There's an important caveat to this number, however. While the ad is talking about health care, the Center for Responsive Politics says it groups donations from health, life, property and car insurance companies, agents and brokers in its totals. The ad may leave viewers with the wrong idea that all the donations were related to health care, or that somehow those donations influenced her vote. There is no evidence of that. Our ruling The House Majority PAC says that Mimi Walters received $213,000 from insurance interests in her campaign for Congress, and claims she supports a plan that strips health care for people with pre-existing conditions and imposes an age tax on senior Californians. It is accurate that Walters supported legislation that would have likely resulted in less coverage for those with previous medical conditions and hiked premiums for older enrollees. Though calling the vote an "age tax" is misleading. Walters did take in over $213,000 from the insurance industry. But that was over five years and includes donations from property and car insurers.

pomt-13993	"It is a fact that the economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House."	/california/statements/2016/jun/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-repeats-half-true-claim-about-nati/	Does the nation’s economy do better when a Republican or Democrat is in the Oval Office? In her recent campaign stop in Sacramento, Hillary Clinton declared Democrats have the magic touch. "It is a fact that the economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House," Clinton said on June 5, 2016, speaking at Sacramento City College during her final push in the California primary. It’s similar to a statement the likely Democratic presidential nominee made on March 21, 2016 in Phoenix, when she said: "The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House." PolitiFact Arizona checked out that claim and rated it Half True. Here’s what they reported: The Clinton family love these comparisons, by the way. In 2015, PolitiFact ruled Mostly True claims from Hillary Clinton a claim that, "Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats," and another that, "The stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House." At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton had this statement rated True: "Since 1961 … our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)." The score, however, isn’t as good for this particular Clinton claim. Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally, Monday, June 6, 2016, in Lynwood, Calif. Other factors involved Clinton’s Arizona spokesman, Tim Hogan, pointed us to a July 2014 study on the topic from Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. The study concludes that Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947, when the data was first tracked. However, the economists point out that there are other factors, such as better oil prices and international conditions, that could be driving these better numbers for Democratic presidents. In short, Democrats occupying the Oval Office tend to have a little better luck. Experts we spoke with largely held the same views. Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the statistics, from GDP to the unemployment rate, are striking, but noted that the president does not have "all that control." "That doesn’t prove what the cause is," Frankel said. Christian Weller, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, did his own math on the GDP data since 1947. He found that the economy, through the last quarter of 2015 and after inflation, grew 3.8 percent under Democrats and 2.4 percent under Republicans. For President Barack Obama, the growth rate in his first term was 1.8 percent. His current growth rate is 2 percent, but that’s still higher than his predecessor, George W. Bush. And his second term hasn’t ended yet. Based on estimates, Weller said Obama should hit the 2.4 percent Republican average. Still, Ronald Reagan’s 3.4 percent growth rate is well ahead of the economy right now under Obama. "Other than Obama, every Democrat had a faster growth rate, even (Jimmy) Carter had a slightly higher growth rate than Reagan," Weller said. "This is one of the safest talking points for a Democratic contender." However, the asterisks bother Arizona State University presidential historian Brooks Simpson. "Secretary Clinton is not exactly telling the whole truth,’" Simpson said. Simpson referenced Bill Clinton’s administration, noting that he benefited from some of the economic policies of his predecessor, Republican George H.W. Bush. A 2011 report from the right-leaning Heritage Foundation notes that the economy was already in its "22nd month of expansion" when Bill Clinton took office in January 1993. We asked the Clinton campaign for a response. A spokesman pointed PolitiFact California to previous fact checks on the topic, including PolitiFact Arizona’s. The spokesman also pointed to a blog by the Washington Post that says Clinton was right on the numbers but questions whether Democrats were responsible for the better economic times or "just got lucky." Our ruling Hillary Clinton said in Sacramento, "It is a fact that the economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House." It’s similar to her March statement in Phoenix that "The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House." Yes, Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947. But Clinton's comments require several caveats. The current growth in the economy under Obama is lower than the Republican average. Factors such as oil prices also reflect the higher GDP growth under Democratic presidents. On top of that, comparing one period of time to another or one president to another can be problematic. We agree with PolitiFact Arizona’s findings and rate Clinton's claim in Sacramento Half True.

pomt-10616	Says McCain was a "Hanoi Hilton songbird" who collaborated with the enemy.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/17/vietnam-veterans-against-john-mccain/no-evidence-mccain-was-a-traitor/	In an echo of the attacks from the 2000 South Carolina primary that dealt a critical blow to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, a new flyer says the Arizona senator is a traitor. It says that when he was a POW, McCain was a "Hanoi Hilton songbird" who collaborated with the enemy. But it provides scant evidence to back up this claim and it is strongly contradicted by many other accounts reviewed by PolitiFact: interviews with other POWs, an author who has written a McCain biography and the senator's own accounts. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Robert Timberg, author of John McCain: An American Odyssey , who has interviewed many POWs who served with McCain, said there's no evidence that he ever collaborated with the North Vietnamese. "I've never known of any occasion in which Sen. McCain provided the North Vietnamese with anything of value," Timberg said. The flyer was sent to about 80 media organizations in South Carolina and is posted on the group's Web site. The flyer probably would have been ignored, but the McCain campaign issued a statement calling it "a vicious attack." The flyer has a caricature of a surly-looking McCain in a prison cell under the words, "Hanoi Hilton Songbird." The second page is headlined "FACT SHEET: Military Record of John Sidney McCain III" and it begins with some accurate biographical information. The flyer contains 1 pages of criticisms of McCain, but only a few support the accusation that he was helping the enemy: • That he told his captors "Okay, I'll give you military information if you will take me to the hospital." • That the Hanoi news media reported he had given information about his flight, rescue ships and the order of U.S. attacks. • That he broke the military code because he answered questions from a Spanish psychiatrist who had apparently been cooperating with the North Vietnamese. There is some truth to these claims, but collectively they do not prove McCain was involved in "collaborations with the enemy," as the flyer alleges. In his memoir Faith of My Fathers, McCain says that he initially offered the information because he was badly injured and afraid of dying. But, he wrote, "I didn't intend to keep my word." When he was later interrogated, McCain gave his ship's name and squadron number and confirmed the target of his failed mission, he wrote. He also gave the names of the Green Bay Packers' offensive line and said they were members of his squadron. Asked to identify future targets, he mentioned North Vietnamese cities that U.S. planes had already bombed. George "Bud" Day and Orson Swindle, fellow POWs, told PolitiFact that POWs sometimes were forced to talk when they were tortured, but they tried to tell lies to mislead their captors. "We were all tortured and we wrote confessions under the pressure of torture," said Swindle, who was a cellmate with McCain and is active in his campaign. "John McCain never collaborated with the enemy. He, like every one of us, submitted to severe torture. John McCain did nothing dishonorable. He was heroic." At one point, McCain broke down and signed a confession. But Timberg, the biographer, said McCain deliberately used misspellings, grammatical errors and Communist jargon to show he was writing under duress: "I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life . . . " Day, a Medal of Honor winner who also is supporting McCain's campaign, said the flyer is "the most outrageous f------ lie I've ever heard." The man behind the flyer is Gerard "Jerry" W. Kiley, 61, of Garnerville, N.Y., who says he served in Vietnam for about a year. He describes his group as a one-man operation unaffiliated with any political party or campaign. He says he opposes McCain because of the senator's efforts to normalize relations with the Vietnamese communist government and because, in his view, McCain has helped the U.S. government keep information about POWs classified. "John McCain has made sure the information concerning the lives of Americans we clearly abandoned after the war remain in government files 40 years later," he says. He teamed with political activist Ted Sampley of North Carolina to distribute the fliers to South Carolina media outlets this month. Sampley did not respond to requests for comment. Sampley also is a longtime McCain opponent. In 2000, he gained attention when he called McCain a "Manchurian candidate" on his Web site and said that he was an agent of the Vietnamese. In 1993, Sampley was convicted of misdemeanor assault and sentenced to 180 days' probation for attacking a McCain aide, according to a 2004 article in the New York Times. McCain is not the first politician to draw the men's ire. In 2004, they formed Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry. Kiley has twice interrupted events featuring Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, forcing an American flag in his hand on one occasion and throwing red wine at him on another, according to a Secret Service agent who later arrested Kiley. He admits he threw the wine, but he was later acquitted in federal court of threatening Khai. Kiley says he bases his most damning charges against McCain — that McCain gave information about the schedule of U.S. attacks in Vietnam in 1967, the year his plane was shot down and McCain was captured — on the word of Earl Hopper, a retired Army colonel. In an interview, Hopper's wife, Patty, said that Hopper wasn't able to address the charges over the phone because of poor hearing. She said that Hopper has long been involved in the POW movement and that Earl Hopper's son, Earl Jr., is missing in action in Vietnam. She cited as evidence for Hopper's charges a 1973 article by McCain that ran in U.S. News and World Report and what she said were "declassified U.S. military documents" she claimed to possess describing McCain's collaboration. Patty Hopper said she was away from her Arizona home and could not fax those documents. But the 1973 article does not back up the charges made in the flyer. It provides the same basic account as McCain's book, corroborated by Timberg's book, which was based on interviews with many POWs. Timberg, Day and Swindle noted that McCain, the son of a Navy admiral, was offered an early release from the prison but refused so that he could adhere to the military's code of conduct. Timberg said he was perplexed by the allegations. "Why do they hate him? There can be lots of issues you disagree with him about. But why try to destroy him?" Because of the seriousness of the charge, the utter absence of evidence and the clear intention to harm McCain just days before a critical Republican primary, we find this claim to be Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-15057	"We've had examples like in Yuma County, where we've been able to stop 97 percent of the illegal (immigration) flow, and those programs, they abolish."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/27/ben-carson/ben-carson-claimed-program-let-97-illegal-immigrat/	With a new poll showing him in a virtual tie with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, Ben Carson went on the Sunday news shows to talk politics. On ABC’s This Week, host Martha Raddatz grilled Carson about some of his comments on immigration. Carson, a resident of West Palm Beach, Fla., said he gets his information on immigration from local sheriffs and that he doesn’t trust figures from the federal government. "You know, a lot of these people who are captured, it's ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) who comes along and says, you must release these people. And that's not helpful to the American people. They need to be working for the American people, not against them," Carson said. "We've had examples like in Yuma County where we've been able to stop 97 percent of the illegal flow, and those programs, they abolish," Carson added. "They don't want that. What is wrong with them?" We too wondered why the government would abolish programs as effective as Carson said. So we checked it out, and found a lot more to the story of what was going on in Yuma County, Ariz. 97 percent The first thing we noticed about Carson’s statement was that it didn’t include a time frame. As we reviewed statistics about border apprehensions, we did find a precipitous drop in immigration for Yuma County, but it took place over at least a decade. And the drop matched the movement of the U.S. economy as it went from economic good times to deep recession. The U.S. Border Patrol reported that total illegal alien apprehensions in the Yuma area went from 138,438 in 2005 to 5,902 in 2014, a decline of 96 percent. (The entire Southwest border saw a decline of 59 percent during the same time period.) A report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, documented the decreases at Yuma and in other places since 1986; it noted that pinning down the precise causes of the decline in illegal immigration are difficult. "The only significant decrease in unauthorized migration appears to have occurred since 2007, and it is unclear how much of the drop-off is due to increased enforcement and how much is a result of the U.S. economic downturn and other systemic factors," the report noted. A 2014 report in the Yuma Sun noted the low number of apprehensions in the Yuma sector, but credited it primarily to increased funding for border security, specifically more money for border fencing with special technology and more agents. Abolished program Carson made reference to effective programs that had been "abolished." The closest thing we could find was a federal program aimed at prosecuting illegal immigrants that was scaled back, but not abolished. The program, called Operation Streamline, aimed to aggressively prosecute all those who attempted to illegally cross the border, including nonviolent, first-time offenders. Yuma County Sheriff Larry Leon Wilmot said he received notice from the U.S. attorney’s office that the program was being scaled back to focus on repeat offenders and those engaged in criminal activities. Wilmot notified members of the Arizona congressional delegation of the change, complaining it would undermine efforts at border control and would cause border patrol agents "to feel betrayed by the very government that they serve." "This practice undermines everything that we have worked hard to achieve over the years for the citizens of Yuma County," Wilmot wrote. Others saw the program differently, with the main criticism being it was creating backlogs in federal courts for questionable reasons. "The program, which mainly targets migrant workers with no criminal history, has caused skyrocketing caseloads in many federal district courts along the border," argued a 2010 policy brief from the Berkeley Law School’s Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity & Diversity. The Carson campaign told us that he wasn't singling out a single factor for what caused the drop in Yuma, and that the campaign stood by his statement. Our ruling Carson said that Yuma County has been able to reduce illegal immigration by 97 percent, but that the federal programs that allowed them to do that had been "abolished." Carson didn’t mention the time frame on the reduction in Yuma County -- those numbers dropped from 2005 to 2014, and experts have credited the reduction to several factors, including a U.S. economic recession. Other factors receiving a share of were fencing construction and the number of border agents As for the federal programs that have been abolished, we found one program involving prosecutions that fit the bill, but it had been scaled back rather than eliminated, and it was, at most, one factor among many that are believed to have led to the drop. So while Carson has a point that illegal immigration has fallen significantly in Yuma County, he glosses over the time frame and incorrectly credits a program that was scaled back but not abolished. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-09-27T15:43:09	2015-09-27	['Yuma_County,_Arizona']
pomt-01172	"Mike Martinez cut a deal with prosecutors to avoid facing possible jail time and stuck us with his $24,657.50 legal bill."	/texas/statements/2014/dec/10/progress-austin-pac/mike-martinez-pac-says-cut-deal-avoid-possible-jai/	This message may have landed in your mail: The Austin City Council member in the hunt for mayor may have averted imprisonment with taxpayers’ assistance. "Politician Mike Martinez cut a deal with prosecutors to avoid facing possible jail time and stuck us with his $24,657.50 legal bill," the Progress for Austin PAC’s mailer says. Does that statement about Martinez, who faces lawyer Steve Adler in a Dec. 16, 2014, runoff, hold up? To our inquiry, Marc Winkelman, an Austin businessman listed in the PAC’s campaign treasurer paperwork, said by email the claim was based on news stories in the Austin American-Statesman and Austin Bulldog and government documents. From the cited information and interviews, we confirmed the city paid that much in attorney costs for Martinez after a nearly two-year investigation of council practices. Also clear, Martinez wasn’t alone in reaching an accord effectively ending the inquiry. In 2011-12, the Travis County attorney, David Escamilla, oversaw the investigation touched off by a complaint that council members were routinely meeting privately, in groups of two or three, to discuss city business. Escamilla wanted to know if the council was trying to circumvent the Texas Open Meetings Act, which prohibits elected officials from secretly deliberating about upcoming votes. At issue was whether members were creating "walking quorums," in which they relayed information to each other to work out a vote’s outcome in advance of the body’s public meetings. According to an October 2012 Austin American-Statesman news story, agreements signed by Mayor Lee Leffingwell and six fellow council members who had been in office when the inquiry started spared the members from misdemeanor charges that could have led to jail terms of up to six months and $500 fines. Per the agreements, the signers agreed to take open-government courses and keep following such laws, the story said. At the time, Escamilla said his office had found "multiple violations" of state open-meeting laws. Council members "regularly deliberated outside of the public’s purview by use of almost every modern communication medium that exists. We found probable cause to believe that multiple violations" occurred, he said, though he also noted the practice had existed before the affected council members were in office. But criminal charges weren’t filed, he said, in part because the council had taken open-government steps, notably ending the private meetings, instead holding public work sessions — long, wide-ranging discussions — two days before each council meeting. In a press release, Escamilla said that if council members didn’t comply with the agreements, "we will file criminal charges based on the alleged violations that were the subject of the investigation" with convictions possibly leading to fines of $100 to $500 and/or "confinement" of 30 to 180 days. We contacted Martinez’s attorney through the investigation, Joe Turner, who said by phone the statement in the mailer misrepresented events in that "there never was a prosecution, there was never a criminal case filed," Turner said. In contrast, Escamilla told us of Martinez: "It is true that he entered into an agreement where my office deferred prosecution for two years on the condition that he agree and abide by the terms of the agreement, which had multiple terms designed to prevent him or the city from violating the public information, records retention and open meetings acts." The agreement signed by Martinez, which we downloaded from the Bulldog, said that since Martinez joined the council in June 2006 until the investigation, Martinez had routinely participated in private meetings with fellow council members in advance of public council meetings. "The aforementioned meetings or one-on-one's" between council members "were calendared on the mayor's and each member's public calendar. A number of these were posted on the Internet. There was no attempt to hide them nor keep them a secret," the agreement said. In the agreement, Martinez said he hadn’t violated the open-meetings law and wasn’t admitting guilt to any offense. The agreement "is a good-faith effort by both parties to resolve the county attorney's office investigation, and in consideration of the county attorney's legitimate effort to enforce the Open Meetings Act and Mike Martinez's efforts to ensure that even the potential for appearance of impropriety is avoided by implementing best practices related to and open government," it said. Escamilla elaborated to us that if a member had refused to sign the "plea bargain" agreement, he or she would have been charged with violating a provision in the state’s government code barring a member or group of members of a governmental body from knowingly conspiring to circumvent the open meetings law by meeting in numbers less than a quorum for the purpose of secret deliberations. "The" PAC’s "statement is accurate with respect to the fact that Mr. Martinez entered into an agreement deferring prosecution on the condition he abide by the agreement," Escamilla said. Taxpayers stuck with legal tab? Next, we looked into city taxpayers getting "stuck" with Martinez’s legal costs, as the mailer says. When the investigation closed, the city had generally spent about $383,000 out of contracts worth $444,000 in hiring three law firms to advise city officials and the council on the investigation and open-meetings matters, the Statesman then reported. One of several web links in the mailer’s fine print led us to an April 2013 Austin Bulldog news story stating $157,636 was paid by the city to attorneys who had represented council members in connection with the inquiry. And that story included a link to what appeared to be a Dec. 7, 2012, city document showing $24,657.50 paid to Turner, who reported 69.75 hours of work serving Martinez from March 25, 2011, through Oct. 24, 2012, at a fee of $350 an hour. Turner’s tabulation also showed $245 in charges for a paralegal to copy 440 notebook pages. In our conversation with him, Turner said the city was obligated to represent Martinez and other council members because the inquiry concerned their official actions. To our inquiry, city officials didn’t say if a particular ordinance requires as much. Martinez and Adler By phone, Martinez said any insinuation council members cut a deal to avoid jail time isn’t accurate in that no charges were filed. If charges had been leveled, he said, a judge or jury would have determined guilt or innocence as well as any penalties, he said, not the county attorney. Finally, we wondered whether Adler would have signed one of the agreements if he’d been on the council. His campaign manager, Jim Wick, replied by email: "We'd prefer not to comment on this issue as it is not one that our campaign has ever raised." Our ruling The PAC said Martinez "cut a deal with prosecutors to avoid facing possible jail time and stuck us with his $24,657.50 legal bill." Martinez, like fellow council members who’d routinely conferred before public meetings despite restrictions in law, signed an agreement arguably heading off the possibility of jail time, though the county still would have had to file charges before winning a conviction and a sentence. Council members including Martinez also went along with the city paying related legal bills. We rate the statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-04536	Brendan Doherty wants "to repeal Obamacare, increasing drug prices for seniors."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/30/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-republican-opponent-br/	If you vow to repeal a law but then promise to preserve some of its key provisions, are you really promising to repeal the law? That's the question surrounding an advertisement in support of Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline's attempt to hold his 1st District seat against a challenge by Republican Brendan Doherty. The 30-second television ad, produced by Cicilline’s campaign, shows video of Doherty praising GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and lists some ways in which the two agree on key issues. It is available on YouTube. One issue is the Affordable Health Care Act, the controversial legislation often referred to as Obamacare. "Doherty and Romney both want to repeal Obamacare, increasing drug prices for seniors," the ad says. Romney has already made it clear he wants to repeal the law. In looking at the assertion, we will focus on Doherty’s position. Doherty has said repeatedly that he wants to repeal Obamacare because it places too much of a burden on small businesses. One element of the law was crafted to save Medicare recipients a lot of money because it closes the so-called "doughnut hole," the gap in prescription drug coverage that has forced elderly people with health problems to shell out thousands of dollars per year. If Obamacare were simply repealed, the hole would reopen and its effect would be as Cicilline describes it. But if Doherty were elected and a new federal law were passed that closed the doughnut hole, Doherty could then vote to repeal Obamacare without increasing drug prices for seniors. Doherty has repeatedly said he wants to keep the doughnut hole closed. He also has said that he wouldn’t repeal Obamacare without preserving that popular feature, and others. In a July 2, 2012, appearance on "The Helen Glover Show," Doherty said "I would vote to repeal it. But I think we need to find better solutions even before we repeal it." A bit later, he specifically referred to continuing coverage for young adults and people with pre-existing conditions and protecting people in the doughnut hole as "good points" in the law. He said those are areas "to have real health care reform." Separately, the Doherty campaign sent us a July 12, 2012, news release in which the candidate criticized House Republicans for voting to repeal Obamacare "without offering any alternative proposal." And we put the question to him directly, asking Doherty if he would, if elected, cast any vote to repeal Obamacare if the government hadn't first passed a law closing the doughnut hole. He said, "No." But he said the safeguards could be part of a repeal bill. "I wouldn't vote for any repeal of Obamacare if we didn't have the doughnut hole closed," or protection for children up to 26 years old and coverage "for preexisting conditions in that," he said. Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers, asked about the ad and Doherty's support for some elements of Obamacare, said in an e-mail: "Simply because [Doherty] says he wants to find a bipartisan solution or that he has started mentioning parts of the bill he likes, is irrelevant. As soon as the bill is repealed, the benefits are gone and closing the doughnut hole, (or allowing young people to stay on their parents' insurance or whatever else), would have to be re-fought. Saying, 'He thinks there should be a solution before repeal,' is nice, but it doesn't change the real world implications of voting for repeal." Our ruling David Cicilline, in a campaign ad, says Brendan Doherty wants "to repeal Obamacare, increasing drug prices for seniors." Doherty does want to repeal Obamacare, and a repeal would do precisely that. But Doherty, at least as far back as July 2, has repeatedly said he would not vote for repeal until "better solutions" are found. Such subtlety is lost in the Cicilline ad. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11411	Says Donald "Trump decided to *not* work with Cambridge Analytica during the election."	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/21/jack-posopiec/trump-campaign-used-cambridge-analytica-final-mont/	Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining consultancy, has quickly become the albatross around the necks of Republican political operatives. It is under investigation in the United States and Great Britain for, among other things, allegedly harvesting the personal profiles of 50 million Facebook users. The firm got a national reputation for its work during the 2016 elections with a client list that included the Donald J. Trump for President campaign. A popular promoter of the "Make America Great Again" brand on Twitter, Jack Posobiec came to Trump’s defense. "How many outlets are reporting the fact that (Brad) Parscale and Trump decided to *not* work with Cambridge Analytica during the election," Posobiec tweeted March 20. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Parscale is now the head of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign. In 2016, he led the Trump campaign’s digital strategy. Cambridge Analytica boasted that it had 5,000 data points on every American, information that allowed hyper-accurate online targeting of voters likely to line up behind Trump. Plenty of skeptics doubt that the company could actually deliver on that promise, but that’s neither here nor there for this fact-check. For us, the key question is whether Cambridge Analytica did no work for the Trump during the election. Posobiec told us he based his tweet on a CBS News article that said the Trump campaign relied on voter files from the Republican National Committee to target voters. The CBS article said: "The crucial decision was made in late September or early October when Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's digital guru on the 2016 campaign, decided to utilize just the RNC data for the general election and used nothing from that point from Cambridge Analytica or any other data vendor." So according to the CBS article, the key data used to identify supporters and run the election ground game came from the RNC about a month before Election Day. CBS did not name its source for this point. Posobiec said he was referring to the voter data. But his tweet was more sweeping. It said the campaign did not work with Cambridge Analytica at all. The CBS News report does not go that far. It notes, "Cambridge Analytica data was used for some targeted digital advertising and a large TV buy, but the main source of ‘get out the vote’ and matching digital outreach data came from the RNC." Further, Federal Election Commission filings show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica in September, October and December. Here’s the FEC data: The final payment in December 2016 for $312,500 is second only to the campaign’s $5 million payment on Sept. 1, 2016. Now, the filings only show when the firm was paid, not when it provided its services. However, well before the current controversy, former Cambridge Analytica staffer Matt Oczkowski and Parscale described for Wired magazine the work the firm did in the final months of the campaign. Oczkowski told Wired, "The RNC was the voter file of record for the campaign, but we were the intelligence on top of the voter file." "Matt Oczkowski and his team created a daily tracker of polling, so that I could see how Trump was doing in key swing states," Parscale said. "They provided that to me daily." Plus, Parscale said Cambridge Analytica helped with "persuasion online media buying," and "they created a visualization tool that showed in each state which areas were most persuadable and what those voters care about." It bears noting that while the Trump campaign didn’t rely on Cambridge Analytica’s voter data for core voter outreach, the firm stayed busy attacking Trump’s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. In the final months of the election, the firm was paid about $850,000 by the Make America Number 1 Super PAC. The group’s self-declared aim was "to make clear to the American voter the full extent of the untrustworthiness of Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC) by focusing on the corruption of the Clinton Machine and especially the corruption of the Clinton Foundation." Robert Mercer, a conservative billionaire, was the PAC’s primary financial backer. So, while Cambridge Analytica played a lesser role in its direct work for the Trump campaign, it actively aided Trump’s candidacy in other ways. Our ruling Posobiec tweeted that "Trump decided to *not* work with Cambridge Analytica during the election." There is an element of truth in that the campaign reportedly relied on the RNC’s voter files, and not Cambridge Analytica’s data, to identify likely supporters. However, even the news report behind Posobiec’s tweet said that the firm continued to provide some services to the campaign. FEC filings show the Trump campaign continued to pay Cambridge Analytica through the final months of the campaign, and key operatives from Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign described the firm’s ongoing work.

pomt-06600	Says the Panhandle has had its highest-ever bed tax collections in 2011.	/florida/statements/2011/sep/23/rick-scott/gov-scott-says-panhandle-set-bed-tax-record/	Not long after the April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, Florida's tourism industry faced a crisis: How would it lure tourists amid images of oil slicks and tar balls on beaches? Under pressure to stem the flow of economic damages, BP started writing checks to tourism agencies for marketing. Now a little more than a year after the explosion, have the marketing dollars led to cha-ching for the Panhandle? Speaking on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Sept. 14, 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott claimed that the Panhandle had a record year. Host Joe Scarborough, a former member of Congress from Pensacola, started off the conversation: "I'm going to start with Pensacola, Florida. BP that was a nightmare for the region. Even if oil didn't spill on the Pensacola beaches it scared people away for awhile. A lot of friends of mine that had family businesses for years were ravaged in the middle of a recession. But great news this year for Panhandle and for Florida." Scott responded: "We've got I think the highest bed tax ever in the history of the state in the Panhandle this year. BP came up with ..." Scarborough interjected: "Which means tourism, tourism is flooding in..." Scott: "This summer it was hard to get a room, restaurants were packed. I sat down with BP and they gave us $30 million to market the Panhandle. We used it well. Tourism has come back. ...'' Did the Panhandle break its record for the highest bed tax ever in the history of the state? For starters, Scott said "highest bed tax ever" and omitted a key word: "collections." Having the highest "rate" wouldn't be something that a governor brags about if he wanted to lure more tourists to the area. Bed taxes refers to the tax tacked onto visitors' hotel bills that help fund activities that promote tourism. In Florida, they can add between 0 and 6 percent to an overnight stay. BP gave $25 million tourism dollars in 2010 to then Gov. Charlie Crist who dispersed various amounts to counties. The Northwest Florida Tourism Council which represents tourism development organizations in the Panhandle -- Bay, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa and Walton counties -- received $7 million in August 2010. In April 2011 the council got an additional $30 million, according to Craig Savage, BP spokesman. The BP money allowed tourist development councils to do additional outreach -- for example Visit Pensacola used marketing dollars in more expensive media markets such as Chicago and Washington, said spokeswoman Laura Lee. To back up the claim, Scott's office pointed us to a Sept. 2, 2011, press release from the Northwest Florida Tourism Council which boasted about summer bed tax collections. "Summer 2011 has been a season of remarkable recovery for the tourist destinations of Northwest Florida, which are recording all-time highs in bed tax revenue ..." the press release said. The claim was backed up by the University of West Florida's Office of Economic Development and Engagement, which compiles information on the bed tax for five of the counties -- Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton and Bay. University of West Florida researchers found that the counties took in $8.7 million in bed tax revenue in June 2011, more than any other month since December 2008. But Scott said "this year," not "June" or "this summer." So we decided to compare 2011 to past years. Those figures come from the state's Department of Revenue, which tracks bed tax collections across the state. Using the state's most recent data, which covers January-July 2011, we compared bed tax collections in the seven Panhandle counties to previous years. There, too, the Panhandle performed well. 2011 bed tax collections have totaled about $33.9 million through July, compared to about $27.5 million for the same period in 2010. We also checked the numbers against 2006 and 2007 -- before Florida dipped into an economic slump -- and found that the first half of 2011 remained higher. Some of the increase can be attributed to the fact that most of the counties increased their bed tax rates in recent years. Bay County, for example, raised its bed tax rate from 3 percent to 5 percent in 2009, meaning that if all other factors were equal (room rates, and number of overnight stays), Bay County's bed tax collections would have increased 67 percent. To compensate for rate changes, the University of West Florida created a bed tax collection analysis built around hypothetically holding the bed tax rate constant at 2 percent. The study did not include Franklin and Gulf counties but found that bed tax collections, when normalized, remain highest in 2011, said Phyllis Pooley, associate director of the university's Office of Economic Development and Engagement. Are there any other ways to measure tourist economy in Panhandle? Smith Travel Research, a company that tracks supply and demand of hotel rooms for hotels and tourism agencies, collects data on hotel occupancy and the average daily rate for the Panhandle. STR sent us a copy of their data between 2005 and 2011 for the Panhandle but asked that we not publish their full report (which you normally have to pay for). STR's data showed that January through August 2011 was not a record year for the Panhandle. The year to date occupancy rate was 56.4 percent -- a figure that was higher in 2005, 2006 and 2007 ranging between 59.7 percent and 70.6 percent. The average daily rate year for 2011 was $100.16 -- less than it was in 2007 ($103.45) and 2008 ($103.87). The STR report contains data from hotels in several cities within the Panhandle including Lake City, Panama City, Pensacola, Destin, Tallahassee and Fort Walton Beach. Occupancy data isn't a perfect measure of tourism expenditures either -- for example during the oil spill some Panhandle hotels had high occupanices filled by clean-up workers or reporters rather than more income-generating tourists. After Hurricane Katrina, many New Orleans residents stayed in Panhandle hotels. "Occupancy isn’t a record, but we’ve increased inventory," said Lee, speaking for Visit Pensacola. "For example, we’ve gone from 6,500 hotel rooms in 2008 to 7,100 today." We asked Pooley, the University of West Florida researcher, about the different sources of data to measure the tourist economy. She said hotel occupancy rates must be adjusted to take into account new units since if the units increase occupancy rates can decline even with more visitors. Average room rates also don't reflect the number of visitors. "Bed taxes, adjusted for differing collection rates, are typically the choice of economists because they represent the best proxy for overall industry sales," Pooley said in an e-mail. "Ideally, you would want a study that would adjust for all of the factors -- occupancy, average rates, inflation, number of rental units available of all types, etc. to truly compare visitation from one year to the next." Will the record high bed tax collections in the Panhandle continue? That's unlikely once the positive buzz created with the BP marketing dollars fades. "We do know that we are going to plateau,'' said Dawn Moliterno, chair of the Northwest Florida Tourism Council. "We will not see these kind of numbers posted year after year." Our ruling Scott stated: "We've got I think the highest bed tax ever in the history of state in the Panhandle this year." The bed tax collections have set records but that isn't the only measure of how hotels or other businesses dependent on tourists are faring -- the occupancy and average daily rate for hotels have been higher in past years although those sets of data come with their own caveats, too. And those bed tax collections will likely decline after the positive spinoff effects of the BP marketing dollars fade in future years. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-05184	Says "Oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters."	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/14/stop-gillnetting-now/oregon-one-three-states-allow-commercial-gillnetti/	CORRECTION appended: This following has been revised to clarify that rules for keeping native fish, and the number of native fish that can be killed, vary according to run. The details given are for spring chinook. PolitiFact Oregon enjoys tasty Columbia River spring chinook as much as the next Oregonian, but honestly, we don’t know much about catching them. We suspect many readers don’t either, and yet, this November, we probably will vote on a ballot measure to ban the use of commercial gillnets in the Columbia. An alternative method would be allowed. Gillnets vary in mesh size and length but generally work by capturing fish by the gills and smothering them. The people opposed to gillnets say it’s outdated, indiscriminate and harms native salmon and steelhead. And they say Oregon is in the minority when it comes to gillnets. "Currently, Oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters" reads a May 30 press release by the Stop Gillnetting Now campaign. Is Oregon truly that rare? And if so, why? Or were we being snookered by campaign politicking? An administrator with Oregon’s Salmon For All, a group that represents commercial gillnetters, said the number of states that allow commercial gillnetting is much higher, which means Oregon is not so out-of-sync. Who’s right? We turned to Eric Stachon, spokesman with the stop gillnetting campaign. He acknowledged the number was incorrect but maintained that Oregon remains in the minority. "Oregon," the revised statement reads, "is one of only a few states left that allows the use of commercial gillnets on rivers and streams." We wanted to know where non-tribal commercial gillnetting is allowed. Neither side had a definitive figure. Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife didn’t have one either. So PolitiFact Oregon started calling around the country. We had delightful chats with state officials. And we found at least 11 states besides Oregon that allow commercial gillnetting. Like Oregon, the states of Washington, Alaska, North Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana allow commercial gillnets in inland waters, including rivers. California, Virginia and Maryland allow their use in bays. Alabama allows them in the Gulf of Mexico and Michigan in the Great Lakes. Certainly, gillnet use has become more restricted as concerns grow about inadvertently trapping other wildlife. California, as we noted, allows gillnetting in the San Francisco Bay, but campaign proponents point out that in 1990 voters approved a ban on the use of gillnets in coastal waters. And while North Carolina allows gillnets in river, ocean and sound waters, the state moved last month to restrict the use in certain areas. "The quick answer is yes, we do allow them," said David Taylor of North Carolina’s Division of Marine Fisheries, "and the more complicated answer is, with many restrictions." The states of Oregon and Washington issue about 500 permits a year for non-tribal fisheries to use on the Columbia River. Of that, maybe 300 are active. The state agencies decide when and where to allow fishing -- if at all -- for runs of spring chinook, fall chinook, coho, etc. They also determine the types of gillnets allowed. For spring chinook, native fish must be returned to the water, dead, lethargic or alive. Non-tribal fishers are allowed to kill roughly 2 percent native spring chinook among them. (The rules vary for each fish run.) We’re not going to elaborate on the arguments of the two sides, other than to say that recreational fishers and conservationists insist they don’t want to kill off the commercial fishing industry and the gillnetters insist the recreational industry just wants a greater share of the Columbia River fish action. Both sides agree that the river is unique. "You don’t see this kind of large-scale use of gillnets, particularly when you have such a large number of endangered species," Stachon said in arguing for the strangeness of gillnets in the Columbia. Jim Markee, a Salmon For All lobbyist, disagrees with the "large-scale" tag, but acknowledges fishing in the river is special, for the people who eat the salmon as well as those who catch the coveted fish for people to eat. Our limited research found that states have different management needs. There are some states that don’t depend on commercial fishing so gillnets are not an issue. While not comprehensive, we found that the use of non-tribal commercial gillnets is more widespread than originally cited by the campaign. Oregon is among at least seven states that allow the use in inland rivers. Other states allow the use in bay, gulf and ocean water. We rule the statement False.

pomt-08908	Claims that Rep. Sanford Bishop votes similar to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are "inaccurate."	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/29/sanford-bishop/gop-comparison-pelosi-inaccurate-congressman-says/	It seems like no one wants to be associated with Nancy Pelosi these days. Many Republican politicians are using Pelosi, the U.S. House speaker, as the boogeywoman this election season. And there's no place better to do that than in Georgia politics. Mike Keown, a Republican state lawmaker, tried to link the liberal Pelosi to his opponent, incumbent U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), in the Nov. 2 election for Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, which is situated in southwest Georgia and includes Albany and most of Columbus. Bishop "wants to distance himself from Nancy Pelosi," Keown said in one statement. "However, that is going to be difficult after his votes on Obamacare, every stimulus and bailout program and increasing the tax debt on every citizen in the 2nd district over $40,000." A spokesman for the 18-year congressman from South Georgia fired back in a recent news release. "Rep. [Mike] Keown's suggestion that Rep. Pelosi's voting record is similar to Congressman Bishop's is inaccurate," Bishop spokesman Ashton McRae wrote in an e-mail on Bishop's congressional Web site. McRae quickly got in trouble for using the Web site to attack Bishop's opponent. McRae posted an apology two days later. Despite the mea culpa, PolitiFact Georgia wanted to examine the claim the Bishop camp was trying to debunk. Do Bishop and Pelosi vote similarly? Bishop has fashioned himself as a moderate Democrat. He has breezed through his past three elections, winning about two-thirds of the vote against his Republican challengers, but he is apparently taking no chances. His district does not lean one way. Democrat Barack Obama beat Republican John McCain in the district by about 7,000 votes in the 2008 presidential race. Sonny Perdue, a Republican, defeated Democrat Mark Taylor by more than 5,000 votes in the 2006 race for governor. In the 2004 presidential race, Republican George W. Bush beat Democrat John Kerry by about 20,000 votes. McRae correctly points out that Pelosi and Bishop have voted differently on some issues, such as allowing gays to openly serve in the military. Pelosi is for it; Bishop is against it. The Washington Post keeps track of votes by each member of Congress. Bishop voted on more items than Pelosi, so we checked every time they voted on the same issue. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed their records and found that Bishop and Pelosi have voted on the same items 97 times since June 2008. The two voted the same way 92 of those 97 times, according to the Post database. The Post database found Pelosi voted with the majority of Democrats every time during this current Congress. Bishop voted with his colleagues in the Democratic Party 97.7 percent of the time during this Congress, the Post found. PolitiFact Georgia also checked the Web site of OpenCongress, which detailed information of each bill. We found 61 pieces of legislation (we excluded a comparison of how they voted on congratulating the New Orleans Saints for winning the Super Bowl) that both Bishop and Pelosi voted on. The two representatives voted the same way for 58 of those 61 bills. They differed on legislation such as the redeployment of military contractors in May 2007; the DISCLOSE Act, which would require corporations to name the top five donors in their political ads; and a resolution concerning the limitation of liabilities against doctors and hospitals. The OpenCongress database didn't go back further. On Tuesday, PolitiFact Georgia contacted McRae, who works in Bishop's congressional office. He referred us to the Bishop campaign for comment. We spoke late Tuesday to Bishop campaign spokesman Tim Turner, who sent PolitiFact Georgia a statement late Wednesday. Turner argued the Post database is filled with ceremonial bills. He pointed us to the National Journal, which compiles an annual rating of each member of Congress based on his or her voting record. The Journal rated Bishop as a "centrist" based on his votes in 2009. Turner argued that focusing on the percentage of times Bishop voted along with his fellow Democrats is misleading. "It only makes sense that Congressman Bishop would vote with his party to end Republican obstruction," he said. Pelosi and Bishop are not ideological twins, but two separate databases show the two Democrats vote similarly on legislation that came before them. The numbers are pretty similar. We rate the statement from the Bishop camp as False.	None	Sanford Bishop	None	None	None	2010-07-29T06:00:00	2010-07-21	['Nancy_Pelosi']
pomt-12565	Says Florida has "the second-lowest taxes, per capita, state taxes of any state in the country."	/florida/statements/2017/apr/13/rick-scott/yes-florida-has-second-lowest-state-taxes-capita-d/	Gov. Rick Scott travels the state with a rap sheet of talking points laying out all he’s done to lower taxes — a topic, no doubt, on many Floridians’ minds ahead of Tax Day. (Tuesday!) Scott launched into this list during a roundtable discussion in Pensacola on April 7. "We’ve cut taxes 55 times. Our job growth rate is showing almost double the rest of the country. Our labor force is growing four times the rest of our county, and we have the second-lowest tax burden, per capita, state taxes in the country," Scott said. We previously evaluated an earlier version of Scott's 55 tax-cut claim, rating a statement that he cut taxes "more than 40 times" as Half True. We decided to focus here on whether Florida’s tax burden is the second-lowest in the land. Florida taxes near the bottom of pack Almost all credible analyses of Florida’s tax burden have the Sunshine State paying some of the lowest taxes per capita in the country. According to the Florida Department of Revenue, the state collected about $38.6 billion in state and local taxes in fiscal year 2016. In 2016, Florida’s population, according to the U.S. Census, was about 20.6 million. Do the math, and that’s a little more than $1,800 in taxes collected per person, or capita. Other estimates are close to our own. Scott’s office pointed us to the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning. Using the most recent data from the U.S. Census, it found Florida collected $1,836 in per capita state taxes in fiscal year 2015. That amount gives Florida the distinction of having the second-lowest state taxes per capita out of all 50 states. Our own calculation, achieved by comparing the U.S. Census 2015 Annual Survey of State Government Tax Collections (the most recent year) to 2015 population data, also puts Florida as the place with the second lowest state taxes. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A slight wrench in Scott’s factoid is that state taxes are not the only type of taxes that Florida collects. According to Florida Tax Watch, a group that takes a critical look at state spending, Florida ranked 27 out of 50 states for per capita local tax collections in fiscal year 2014. Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of research, said Florida’s local tax burden is far higher than the state’s tax burden. Florida’s low state tax burden combined with a middle-of-the-road local tax burden still leaves Florida with some of the lowest taxes per capita. The same Tax Foundation analysis cited by Scott ranks Florida as having the fifth-lowest state and local taxes per capita. Thinking beyond per capita The problem with per capita figures is context, said Richard C. Auxier, a research associate in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. The per capita figure includes millions of people, namely children, who either pay no taxes or pay a nominal amount (the sales tax on a toy purchased with allowance money, for example). It doesn’t mean that all Floridians pay low taxes. For example, Florida’s lack of an individual income tax is good news for high earners. But low-income residents may feel more of a benefit with living in a state with a lower sales tax (Florida’s is 6 percent, which is about the 16th-highest rate in the country). One more thing: A state’s tax burden is the result of many factors, not just the influence of one chief executive. North Dakota had some of the highest taxes per capita in the latest fiscal year, but that’s not because North Dakota is a high tax state, it’s because the state experienced an oil boom which brought in more tax dollars that year than other years prior. Our ruling Scott said Florida has "the second-lowest taxes, per capita, state taxes of any state in the country." Based on our own calculations, as well as a credible analysis from the Tax Foundation, Florida has the second-lowest state taxes per capita (behind Alaska). When you include our middle-of-the-road local taxes, Florida still hovers around the bottom for per capita taxes, but it’s not the second-lowest. And it’s important to remember that just because a state’s per capita taxes is low, it doesn’t mean everyone in that state has low taxes. Scott’s measurement is accurate but doesn’t quite tell the whole story. We rate Scott’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-10606	"If you are African-American in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/22/john-edwards/black-and-white-family-net-worth-disparity-true/	During a Democratic debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. on Jan. 21, 2008, John Edwards elaborated on his vision of "two Americas" and showed empathy toward an important bloc of Democratic primary voters by pointing out racial disparities in net worth. It came during a discussion about whether subprime lenders were targeting the most economically vulnerable people. He said he didn't know their motivations, but added: "What they have done is targeted the lowest income, most vulnerable families," Edwards said. "And anybody who's paying any attention to what's going on in America today understands, if you are African-American in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have. "This is not an accident. I mean, we can go put our heads against the wall and pretend that the past never happened, pretend that we didn't live through decades of slavery, followed by decades of segregation, followed by decades of discrimination, which is still going on today." It appears the former North Carolina senator was relying on figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2000, the median net worth of a household headed by a non-Hispanic white adult was $79,400. The median net worth of a household run by a black adult was $7,500. The figure for Hispanic households was $9,750. These figures are based on a 2003 report. Net worth is measured as the total value of a household's financial assets — such as bank accounts, property and vehicles — minus the household's financial liabilities. Though the measurement is an oft-used indicator of financial health, it doesn't always tell the whole story because the amount of income generated by a household's assets is a key factor in maintaining a desired standard of living. Still, because Edwards correctly cites Census data showing a tenfold disparity between black and white net worth, we judge his statement True. UPDATE: This corrects our first version, which mistakenly used the term family income when we meant net worth.	None	John Edwards	None	None	None	2008-01-22T00:00:00	2008-01-21	['None']
pomt-06453	"Foster children are disproportionately victims of identity theft."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/20/james-langevin/ri-rep-james-langevin-says-foster-children-are-mor/	Real problem or not? That was the question we faced after we heard U.S. Rep. James Langevin (D-RI) speaking on the House floor about a proposal intended to protect foster children from identity theft. "I, along with many others, was absolutely outraged to find that foster children are disproportionately victims of identity theft since their personal information passes through so many hands," Langevin said during a speech posted on YouTube on Sept. 21. The bill, which has since become law and was the focus of a celebratory news conference Oct. 11, requires social service agencies to run a credit check on foster youth just before they become old enough to leave the system. The goal is to allow them to clear up any problems so they can begin their adult life free of identity problems such as fraudulent loans or credit card debt they know nothing about. The law also requires that they receive help in clearing up any credit problems. But are children in state custody really more likely to be victimized? The news release issued by Langevin's office linked to a report by the Children's Advocacy Institute at the University of San Diego School of Law, which bills itself as "an academic, research, and advocacy law firm." The 44-page report, called "The Fleecing of Foster Children: How We Confiscate Their Assets and Undermine Their Financial Future," asserts in at least five places that identity theft is common, or a growing problem, or disproportionately affects foster children. Then the report says, on the next-to-the-last page of the narrative: "Currently, there is [sic] no available data on how many children have been affected by identity theft." If there are no data, how do you know if foster children are disproportionately affected? Instead of offering real evidence, the report includes two footnotes citing one article in Newsweek magazine. It quotes the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego as saying that half of the 84,000 children in California's foster care system may have been victimized. Newsweek also reported that the problem got so bad in California that the state passed a law in 2006 mandating credit checks for teens in its foster care system. We called Langevin's office seeking data. We were sent links to other articles, some congressional testimony, accounts of individual cases of identity theft. All asserted that it was a big problem but none offered any reliable numbers. Many cited the Newsweek article as a source. When we called the Identity Theft Resource Center to ask how they know that half the foster children in California have been victimized, program director Karen Barney said the organization wishes the oft-cited article would just go away because the number is simply wrong. How does she know? As part of its effort to implement the 2006 California law, the state's Office of Privacy Protection checked the credit history of 2,110 foster children, tried to clear up any problems, and attempted to estimate how many children had been victims of identity theft. Its report on the effort was released in August 2011. When the credit reporting agencies were queried, they reported that the Social Security numbers of 17 percent of the children had been used at some point. But among 12 percent of all the children, the Social Security number wasn't really linked to anything, so it just could have been a clerical error or there's no name associated with it, so it wouldn't be part of the child's credit report and would be unlikely to affect the child's credit rating, according to the California report. "We can say (the remaining) 5 percent of these kids had credit reports and that alone is of concern, because they shouldn't," said Joanne McNabb, chief of the office. But even in that 5 percent group, the problem wasn't necessarily identity theft. For example, three of the largest questionable accounts were for car loans and one was for a $217,000 home loan. But all four turned out to be the result of some type of error, not necessarily a case of identity theft. "We were able to confirm that 1 percent [of that 5 percent] were errors" that didn't involve identity theft, McNabb said. That brings the ratio down to roughly 4 percent. So are foster children disproportionately affected by identity theft, as Langevin said? To determine that, you would need to know the extent of the problem among all children. We found only two studies that examined that. Both used data collected by Debix, a company that sells identity theft protection services -- a potential source of bias -- and analyzed at Debix' request. One, released in 2008, tracked data from 500 children. It concluded that 5 percent -- 26 cases in all -- had problems with their credit file. Six appeared to be due to error, with no sign of fraud. That would bring the ratio down to 4 percent, the same as in the California study of foster children. The other study of children was done by Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab, which looks at cybersecurity issues. It concluded that "identity protection scans" of 42,232 Social Security numbers of children showed that 7.8 percent showed evidence of identity theft -- an alarming number. By that measure, foster children are only half as likely to be victims of identity theft -- not more likely, as Langevin said. But both studies, even as they throw numbers around, emphasize that their numbers should not be used to estimate child identity theft. McNabb agreed: "Neither of those is an appropriate sample to draw big conclusions." Are foster children disproportionately victimized compared with adults? Most sources put the rate of adult identity theft at about 3.5 percent. That may sound like it's in line with the childhood rate, but that's just over one year. The California study looking at foster children found that 4 percent had been victims of identity theft over their childhood. Asked about our findings, Langevin’s spokesman, Jonathon Dworkin, said there’s another element to consider. Foster children, he said, are disproportionately victimized because, without family support, they may have more trouble clearing up their credit histories if they've been victims of identity theft. Nonetheless, we think most people would interpret the context of Langevin's statement as meaning that identity thieves are more likely to victimize foster children. Our ruling Clearly identity theft is a big problem that often isn't recognized among children. Requiring the state to clear a foster child's credit history before he or she graduates from state custody seems like a good policy. Representative Langevin said, "Foster children are disproportionately victims of identity theft." The concept is apparently widely believed and asserted among child advocates. But no study has directly compared identity theft rates between foster children and other children. The California study is the only one to look at identity theft among foster children and it found a rate of roughly 4 percent. Of the two studies we found that looked at overall childhood rates, one showed a rate of identity theft that was similar to foster children. The second found a rate that was higher than the rate seen in the study of foster children. When Langevin asserts that foster children are disproportionately victims, he's making a claim based on evidence that is either scant, unreliable, or contradictory. We rate the claim as False.

pomt-05529	The Keystone oil pipeline "would employ 20,000 people in the United States."	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/11/johnny-isakson/isakson-keystone-pipeline-employ-20000/	Backers of a massive oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico are telling voters that it will flood the U.S. with jobs. President Barack Obama denied a permit to build the 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline in January amid bitter debate over whether it would damage environmentally sensitive lands. The pipeline may still win approval, however, and some lawmakers are trying to push it forward. One of them is U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. In a Feb. 23 speech at Dalton State College, Isakson said the pipeline could employ enough people to populate Decatur. "From Day One, this project [the Keystone pipeline] would employ 20,000 people in the United States," Isakson said. This jobs figure is a well-worn talking point for pipeline supporters. Georgia U.S. Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey used it. U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and House Republican Leader Eric Cantor said it as well. We decided to take a closer look. We reviewed news accounts, read analyses of the company’s job creation figures, interviewed a spokesman for TransCanada, the firm hoping to build the pipeline, and consulted critics. We found that while the TransCanada estimate does say that 20,000 "Americans" will be directly employed by the project, that’s not what the company’s chief executive has said. Furthermore, TransCanada’s numbers clash with lower estimates from critics and the U.S. Department of State. TransCanada has said in a press release that those 20,000 jobs include 13,000 for constructing the pipeline and 7,000 to manufacture steel pipes and other equipment. It predicts it will take two years to complete. But TransCanada’s estimate does not mean they expect 20,000 people to work on the project, a spokesman told us. The spokesman provided little clarification. Fortunately, a Washington Post interview with TransCanada’s chief executive and an email interview with the economist who helped produce the company’s job creation estimates shed some light on the figure. Each "job" represents one "job year" or one job lasting for one year, they said. This means that if a single person works on the project for both years, his or her stint is counted as two "jobs." This could place the number of actual people employed by the pipeline closer to 10,000, or some 6,500 workers in construction and 3,500 in manufacturing. Not 20,000. These construction jobs are not permanent, and for the most part, they aren’t local. The positions will disappear when the pipeline is complete. The U.S. Department of State, which is in charge of evaluating the project, estimates that only 10 to 15 percent of these jobs can be filled with workers from communities in the pipeline’s path. News accounts and independent analyses have explored other shortcomings of TransCanada’s figures. A study released September 2011 by Cornell University’s Global Labor Institute determined that the 20,000 jobs figure is "not substantiated." About 50 percent of the pipe will come from an Arkansas plant owned by Welspun, a company based in India, according to a press release issued by TransCanada. The rest will come from Canada, Italy and India. In 2009, company officials said that for an earlier phase of the pipeline, it imported bare pipe manufactured overseas. It’s not clear how much finish work the pipe will need once it arrives in the U.S. We asked TransCanada whether its manufacturing jobs estimates might include foreign workers, but a spokesman did not provide a response. Other analyses have called into question TransCanada’s jobs figure. A December 2011 report by Bloomberg said the company's estimate that the project would need six or seven construction workers for every mile of the pipeline is higher than the four to five worker average for earlier phases. An August 2011 estimate published by the State Department said that the project will employ "approximately 5,000 to 6,000 workers" in construction jobs. An independent analysis of TransCanada’s jobs estimates also produced lower numbers. Using Cornell’s research, William Wade, president of a consulting economics firm, found that the pipeline would create an average of about 16,100 jobs for each of the two years of construction, or 32,200 "job years." Wade’s figure includes more than the jobs for those who build the pipeline. People such as factory workers and checkout clerks also get jobs when project funds are spent on construction materials and wages. If Keystone were to create 20,000 job years worth of work in construction alone, then those jobs combined with spinoffs should be much higher than 32,200 job years, Wade said. "The 20,000 jobs number seems like a mistake. It seems like an overestimate," Wade said. Our ruling: Isakson said that Keystone "would employ 20,000 people in the United States." While any construction project creates jobs, the number Isakson uses seems misleadingly high. Those 20,000 don’t represent actual people, but one job lasting for one year of a two-year project. The number of construction and manufacturing workers may be closer to 10,000, if you accept TransCanada’s estimate. And there’s strong evidence from credible sources that it may be lower. Finally, it’s an open question how many of the jobs would be in America. We give Isakson a False.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2012-04-11T06:00:00	2012-02-23	['United_States']
pomt-04948	"Mike Dovilla’s big ideas like expanding the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit, which helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland, have helped make our state No. 1 in the Midwest for job creation."	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/27/mike-dovilla/mike-dovilla-touts-his-big-ideas-reason-ohio-job-c/	After seizing control of the Ohio House of Representatives two years ago, Republicans are now working to maintain, and even stretch, their considerable majority over House Democrats in the Nov. 6 election. Among the closely watched House races is a rematch between Republican incumbent Mike Dovilla and Democrat Matt Patten to represent a district that includes Strongsville, Berea and a few other suburbs. Dovilla, a Navy veteran and a small business owner, could be vulnerable because he voted in favor of Senate Bill 5 – the bill to restrict public workers’ collective bargaining power that voters ultimately repealed – and because the 18th House District has a solid mix of Democratic and Republican voters. With an eye on keeping his seat, Dovilla has begun distributing campaign literature that touts the achievements of his first term in office. "Mike Dovilla’s big ideas like expanding the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit, which helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland, have helped make our state No. 1 in the Midwest for job creation," a piece of his recent campaign literature said. "The Avengers" is one of the highest grossing films of all time and had a positive impact on the local economy. A study commissioned by the Greater Cleveland Film Commission estimated the movie spent $25 million in Ohio and employed more than 3,870 state residents. But is Dovilla claiming a role with landing the film in Ohio? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check into his claim. When the movie tax credit was established in 2009, Dovilla was not in office. Lawmakers included the movie tax credit in the state budget passed that year. As a result, producers for "The Avengers" chose to film part of the movie in Cleveland and ended up receiving tax credits created worth about $6.7 million, according to the Ohio Department of Development. Dovilla didn’t take office until 2011. Although he had nothing to do with creating the initial movie tax credit, he did sponsor legislation this year to expand the program. The expansion doubled the money available through the credit from $10 million per year to $20 million per year. When we contacted Dovilla to explain his claim, he said the campaign literature was not meant to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the expansion of the movie tax credit and the decision to film part of "The Avengers" in Cleveland. "It says the tax credit helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland, not the expansion," he said. Dovilla said the phrase "which helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland" referred to the tax credit itself, not the expansion of the tax credit. Dovilla also said he believes the average person in his district would know that the Avengers was filmed in Cleveland well before lawmakers extended the tax credit and, therefore, the average person would understand that the original movie tax credit – passed before Dovilla took office – brought the Avengers to Cleveland, not the expansion that he sponsored. Mike Dittoe, a spokesman for House Speaker William G. Batchelder on a leave of absence to assist the GOP House campaigns, also said Dovilla’s campaign literature was not meant to convey the tax credit expansion attracted "The Avengers." "You could word it this way and have the same meaning as the first: ‘The Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit has helped bring films like ‘The Avengers’ to Cleveland. Mike Dovilla’s big ideas, like expanding that tax credit, have helped make our state No. 1 in the Midwest for job creation," Dittoe said in an e-mail. But that’s not what Dovilla’s campaign literature says. And in PolitiFact Ohio’s view, words matter. The problem with Dovilla’s claim is that there are different ways that a reader could interpret it. One could argue, as he does, that he was championing the success of the motion picture tax credit, and touting his role in pushing for its expansion. Or, one could look at his claim and infer a clear connection between expansion of the tax credit and filming "The Avengers" in Cleveland. Dovilla said the ad isn’t meant to suggest his idea brought "The Avengers" to Cleveland, but a natural reading of his claim could suggest exactly that. The ad is partially accurate – the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit did help bring movie jobs to the state, and Dovilla did champion the movie tax credit expansion. But that it leaves out important details and takes things out of context. "The Avengers" movie came to Cleveland due to the original tax credit, which was established before Dovilla took office. And while Dovilla supported the expansion of the credit, it does not take effect until September. On the Truth-O-Meter, Dovilla’s claim rates Half True.

In 2003, when he began campaigning for the U.S. Senate seat for Illinois, he reiterated his opposition in several debates and meetings. In other words, Obama's sweeping claim to have long opposed Iraq is true. Opponents have attacked Obama's record of opposition on two grounds. They argue that Obama should answer definitively how he would have voted if were in the Senate at the time of the vote. Obama said in 2004 he can't answer that question fully because he doesn't know what intelligence the senators had access to. Opponents also have taken comments of his out of context to suggest he supported the war, particularly his 2004 statement that "There's not much of a difference between my position and George Bush's position at this stage." But that quote is pulled from a story in which Obama expresses a sentiment that now that the war has started, the U.S. should do the best job it can to steer Iraq toward stability. Obama joined the U.S. Senate in 2005. He has voted several times to continue funding for the war, saying that troops in Iraq should be funded even if he disagreed with the overall war. (The measure passed 97 to zero.) In recent months, like other Democratic candidates, he has voted in favor of troop withdrawals and other measures to bring the war to a conclusion.

pomt-02912	"The insurance industry is actually run by mostly Democrats."	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/04/dana-perino/fncs-dana-perino-says-health-insurance-industry-ru/	Fans of the Fox News Channel program The Five are probably familiar with the show’s format. A group of political pundits gathers around a table weekdays at 5 p.m. and shouts back and forth on the topics of the day. Most are professional pundits, though co-host Dana Perino did serve as press secretary for George W. Bush. And many times, the panel offers some harsh criticism for President Barack Obama. On its Halloween episode, co-host Greg Gutfeld broadsided Obama’s health care law and the administration’s sales job. Holding a demon puppet he called Seth, Gutfeld said that if Democrats had "to sell a razor blade" they’d "put it in an apple." "They got to hide the ugliness of their beliefs," Gutfeld said. The comment drew a response from liberal co-host Bob Beckel, who made an effort to defend the law and countered that his conservative colleagues were schilling for the insurance industry. "The insurance industry is actually run by mostly Democrats and gave President Obama a lot of …" Perino jumped in. Before she could finish, Beckel groaned, "Buuulllll …." before trailing off himself. "That is true, Bob, and the associations prove it," countered Perino. Beckel, who wears trademark suspenders, was later seen resting his arms on a pumpkin that had "single payer" written on it in marker. As fact-checkers, we’ll weigh in on Perino’s point, that the insurance industry is "run by mostly Democrats." We reached out to Perino but didn’t hear back. Of course, there is no simple way to determine the political affiliation of the entire health insurance industry. We started by checking Perino’s suggestion that health insurance associations prove her claim to be right. The two largest that we could identify are America's Health Insurance Plans and the National Association of Health Underwriters. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tallies political contributions, America’s Health Insurance Plans political action committee has contributed about $396,000 to Democrats since 2008 compared to $436,000 to Republicans over the same period of time. The CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, Karen Ignagni, has donated to both Republicans and Democrats over the years -- including Eric Cantor and Josh Mandel on the Republican side and Henry Waxman and Charles Schumer among the Democrats. Ignagni has led health industry groups since 1993 and worked for the AFL-CIO before that. We wouldn’t conclude that means the industry is mostly run by Democrats. (We wouldn’t conclude that the industry is run mostly by Republicans, either.) The National Association of Health Underwriters PAC, meanwhile, has contributed $1.74 million to Republicans since 2008 and $494,000 to Democrats. (We found no political contributions from CEO Janet Trautwein.) Overall, the Center for Responsive Politics says that the insurance industry has contributed $94 million to Republicans since 2008 and $62 million to Democrats. (This particular comparison is only modestly helpful, however, as it includes companies that also provide property, life and car insurance.) Another way to consider Perino’s claim is to look at the men and women running the largest health insurance companies in the United States. Here is a list of some of those companies, the number of people they say they serve, and what we know about the political leanings of the chief executives: UnitedHealthcare (70 million people served): The company’s PAC, United For Health, reported that 58 percent of its 2012 federal contributions went to Republicans, while 42 percent went to Democrats. Since 2008, the group has given slightly more to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- $721,000 to Democrats and $704,000 to Republicans. CEO Stephen Hemsley has donated almost solely to Republicans since 2010, including $10,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and $5,000 to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Aetna (50 million people served): Aetna’s political action committee reported that it donated $285,500 to Republican candidates in 2012, compared with $170,000 to Democrats. It contributed more money to Republican candidates in 2010 and 2008 as well. CEO Mark T. Bertolini has donated to both Republicans and Democrats, including Republican U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, Rob Portman, Kelly Ayotte and Roy Blunt, and Democrats Ron Wyden and Max Baucus. WellPoint (36 million people served): The company’s political action committee, WellPAC, contributed about $1.5 million to Republican candidates since 2008 and about half as much to Democrats. Joseph R. Swedish, who was named CEO in March, has only made one contribution to a federal candidate since 2010, $500 to Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Humana (20 million people served): Humana’s political action committee has contributed more to Republicans in every political cycle since 2000. Humana CEO Bruce D. Broussard mainly has contributed only to Humana’s PAC. The Center for Public Integrity reported that from January 2007 through August 2012 "the political action committees of the 11 largest health insurance companies and their primary trade group gave $10.2 million to federal politicians with nearly two-thirds of the total going to Republicans who oppose the law or support its repeal." In the case of America’s largest health insurers, there is little evidence to suggest they are run mostly by Democrats based on their political giving. Our ruling Perino claimed that the health insurance industry is run mostly by Democrats. We could find almost nothing to suggest that’s the case. The way most large businesses and industries show their political stripes, through campaign contributions, suggests that large health insurers and their trade associations are more likely to support Republicans. Or at the least, that they hedge their bets by supporting both sides. We rate Perino’s claim False.	None	Dana Perino	None	None	None	2013-11-04T14:12:14	2013-10-31	['None']
pomt-05096	President Obama’s health-care law will "add trillions of dollars in debt."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/30/barry-hinckley/republican-us-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says/	After the Supreme Court issued its June 28, 2012, ruling upholding key provisions of President Obama's health-care legislation, Barry Hinckley, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., issued a fundraising letter warning that the decision was bad news for the national debt, which is now approaching $16 trillion. "Our country did not want or approve of ObamaCare when it was introduced and they still do not now. Americans oppose it because it will decrease the quality of care, raise taxes, cut Medicare, and add trillions of dollars in debt." Health care is certainly expensive; we wondered if the plan for mandating coverage and expanding insurance would really add that much to the debt. We contacted Hinckley's office seeking the source of their information and received no response. It turns out that PolitiFact National has examined this claim a few times, most recently when Mitt Romney made the same statement in response to the Supreme Court ruling. Here's the bottom line: according to the PolitiFact analysis, it's not going to add to the debt because the legislation also raises money to pay for the costs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected back in 2010 that the health-care law would lower the deficit by about $124 billion over 10 years. In 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health-care law, the CBO estimated that wiping out the law, which Romney is promising to do, would actually increase the deficit by about $210 billion over 10 years. The budget office acknowledges circumstances can change, the CBO isn't infallible, and the issues that come up in making an analysis can be contentious, as PolitiFact found when it looked at a statement from U.S. Rep Paul Ryan, R-Wis., judged Mostly False, that the law was "accelerating our country toward bankruptcy." How much would the new health-care law actually raise? As PolitiFact reported when it gave Rush Limbaugh a Pants On Fire for declaring that "Obamacare is . . . the largest tax increase in the history of the world," the CBO estimates the additional revenues coming into the government will be $525 billion between now and 2019. In addition, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. As an aside, Obama claimed in his 2010 State of the Union speech that health-care reform "would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades." PolitiFact rated that statement as Half True. But for Hinckley's claim, congressional budget experts say he is wrong, so we will give it the same rating that Romney received: False.

pomt-09377	“The bill also provides full federal funding for abortions…”	/texas/statements/2010/mar/28/john-carter/rep-john-carter-says-health-care-law-provides-full/	U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, lambasted the Democratic-approved health care plan signed into law last week as a federal health care “takeover bill.” Among Carter’s concerns spelled out in a March 21 press release: “The bill also provides full federal funding for abortions…” Carter spoke after a clutch of anti-abortion House Democrats agreed to vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act after President Barack Obama said he’d issue an executive order referring to continuation of a ban -- begun in the late 1970s and annually reaffirmed by lawmakers -- on spending federal funds on abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of a woman. The law prohibits federal subsidy funds, intended to help people afford health coverage, from being used to pay for abortions except in those exceptional cases. Obama’s order includes a provision to ensure that insurers offering coverage through state-level insurance exchanges charge customers separate premiums to cover abortion services. Obama's order also revisits past decisions by Congress to bar community health centers from using federal funds to provide abortion services outside of the exceptional circumstances. His order directs federal officials to “ensure that program administrators and recipients of federal funds are aware of and comply with the limitations on abortion services.” We sought Carter's backup for his contention that the law provides full federal funding for abortions. John Stone, Carter’s spokesman, said several aspects of the law support his claim. Let's review them one by one. First, Stone noted that plans offered to patients in the state-level exchanges are permitted to cover abortion services. Unsaid: The law specifies that each exchange must have at least one plan that does not cover abortions and that plans offering abortion services must collect separate premiums from each patient to pay for the services, presumably preventing the expenditure of federal funds on abortions. Second, Stone said provisions promising billions of dollars for community health centers and health co-ops, one vehicle for providing health insurance, lack language that would prohibit spending those dollars on abortion. Others, including representatives of community health centers, have said the promised money isn’t likely to be spent on abortions considering the centers haven’t provided abortion services in their 45-year history. A Jan. 22 Politifact.com article concludes that worrying about the centers providing abortions is “more a political dart than a legitimate concern.” Insurance purchased through co-ops would be subject to the same restrictions on abortion funding as other plans likewise offered through the state exchanges. Of course, who can say whether a court might rule that without a specific prohibition, abortions could be permitted? You can't fault organizations like the National Right to Life Committee for raising concerns about possible loopholes. Third, Stone said, the law creates a federal program to administer two or more national insurance plans, with a directive that at least one plan not provide federally funded abortion services. Stone said the provision implies “that other federally administered plans could cover elective abortions, or perhaps even be required to do so by the federal administrator. This is a sharp break from longstanding federal policy.” Stone was referring to the fact that for decades, health insurance programs offered to federal employees have been forbidden to cover abortions except under the established special circumstances. Under the new law, however, the multi-state plans cited by Stone would be sold like other privately vended plans available through the exchanges--and the law directs that any funding for abortions under the plans come from patient premiums. Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, says the provision for two or more national plans is intended to broaden insurance offerings. Does the multi-state provision imply a federal administrator could require that the plans cover abortion services? No, Jost told us: That's like saying it "implies that you have to cover euthanasia," Jost said. "That's silly." Fourth, Stone said, the law’s provision for separate premiums for participants in plans covering abortion services offered through the state-level exchanges could be problematic. “This requirement would apply to anyone who enrolls in a subsidized plan that covers elective abortions, which would surely include many people who would learn of the abortion surcharge only after enrolling,” Stone said The law states, though, that a plan offering abortion coverage shall notify patients of that feature when they enroll. Besides, the provision doesn’t mean that full federal funding would pay for abortions, as Carter claims. Trying to cover all the bases, we looked at each abortion reference in the 906-page law. This search yielded no language permitting federal funding of abortions outside the previously established special circumstances, though we did find several prohibitions on abortion spending as well as a bar on discriminating against insurers or physicians who don't fund or perform abortions. One section states the law doesn’t pre-empt state laws on abortion. Another states that nothing in the law should be construed to require insurers to offer abortion services. A third section states that school-based health centers can’t provide abortion services. Two independent observers of the health-care debate concur that the law doesn't intend full federal funding of abortions. In January, the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation said: “If a state does allow plans in the exchange to cover abortions, (the law) only permits federal subsidy dollars to be used to pay for abortions that are permitted under the federal law that is in place before the plan year begins … Coverage for other abortions would have to be paid for with non-federal funds.” Indeed, requiring insurers that offer abortion coverage through state-level exchanges to collect two separate payments from customers might reduce the availability of such coverage, according to the foundation's analysis. Some “legal scholars contend that given the size of the potential pool of women and their families that will be eligible for federal subsidies under the exchange and other complexities," the foundation writes. "This (two-part payment mandate) might limit the development of insurance plans that offer either abortion coverage or a rider, and ultimately carry over to products offered in the employer market.” Kaiser’s punch line: “This complex combination of restrictions means that… many women who will obtain coverage under health reform either though Medicaid or an exchange would have to pay for an abortion out-of-pocket.” Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate with the independent non-partisan Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, echoed that view. Sonfield told us the new law bans federal funding of abortion coverage. He added: “In our analysis, the law’s requirements for enforcing this ban are so onerous and stigmatizing that we expect insurance companies to drop coverage of abortion altogether, even for consumers who receive no federal subsidies at all." Last week, PolitiFact.com rated as True a House member’s statement that the new law doesn’t provide for publicly funded abortions. All told, this review leaves us agape at Carter's overreach. That is, the law does not provide full federal funding of abortions--and that's clear. Carter could have edited his blast. Instead, he makes an unsupported ridiculous claim. We rate his statement as Pants on Fire.	None	John Carter	None	None	None	2010-03-28T22:54:50	2010-03-21	['None']
pomt-05358	Says when he was governor, "we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent."	/virginia/statements/2012/may/11/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-pre-kinderdarten-program-expanded-4/	Democratic Senate hopeful Tim Kaine says a key step in building a workforce trained for the future is to ensure all children are prepared to enter kindergarten. And he offers his record as governor as proof of his commitment to that goal. "The research clearly demonstrates high-quality early childhood opportunities help children succeed," he wrote in a paper laying out his economic policies. "That’s why we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent..." We checked whether Virginia’s early childhood programs really did grow by 40 percent during Kaine’s term as governor from 2006 to 2010. During his gubernatorial campaign, Kaine proposed making Virginia’s pre-kindergarten program available to all 4-year-olds -- not just those from families living close to the poverty line. The universal access was estimated to cost $300 million a year. Once in office, Kaine scaled back that ambition in the face of a recession that eroded state revenues. But he did seek increases preschool programs every year during his term. Budget records show he proposed an extra $4.6 million for the 2007-08 fiscal year to add 1,250 children to the program. In his full biennial budget, which covered 2008 through 2010, Kaine sought $56 million in additional funding, according to reports. The request was pared to $40 million, then $22 million, as lawmakers sought to cope with the recession. Over the course of Kaine’s term, the Virginia Preschool Initiative saw a steady rise to its annual budget from $46.3 to $58.6 million. (That trend has continued into the recently approved budget, which provided $68.2 million for 2013 and $68.5 million for 2014.) Virginia Preschool Initiative teaches social and learning skills to 4-year-olds who will become eligible for free or reduced lunch programs when they enter public schools. The pre-K program is open to at-risk children who live above the poverty line. Children below that line qualify for the federal Head Start program. In the 2005-06 school year, when Kaine took office, 11,343 children were enrolled in Virginia’s preschool initiative. By the time his term ended, in the 2009-10 school year, the program had 15,901 children. The increase is 40.2 percent. Our ruling Kaine claimed that he was part of expanding participation in early childhood programs in Virginia by nearly 40 percent. The numbers confirm that. We rate Kaine’s statement True.

pomt-00521	As a senator, Hillary Clinton "has her name on three laws in eight years."	/florida/statements/2015/jun/23/jeb-bush/did-hillary-clinton-have-her-name-only-three-laws-/	As Jeb Bush reels off his accomplishments as governor cutting taxes and slashing state jobs, he says he’s ready to put his record up against Hillary Clinton’s. A day after his announcement speech at Miami Dade College, Fox News’ Sean Hannity asked Bush to comment on the Democrat’s record. Hannity: "Can you name in a serious way one specific Hillary accomplishment, or what would you say that's good about her?" Bush: "She's smart. I think she's smart. I think she loves her country. I don't ascribe bad motives for people that I don't agree with. But as a senator, I think she passed -- she has her name on three laws in eight years." There is some truth to Bush’s claim about laws passed, but it doesn’t tell the full story about her legislative accomplishments as a senator. Laws with Clinton’s name Clinton was first elected as a senator from New York in 2000 and re-elected in 2006. She resigned to become secretary of state, so her Senate tenure was from January 2001 to January 2009. Bush’s spokesman sent us a list of three bills Clinton sponsored that became law. These laws were uncontroversial matters that passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and voice vote in the House and then were signed by President George W. Bush: S. 1241: A bill to establish the Kate Mullany National Historic Site in the State of New York. Bush signed the bill Dec. 3, 2004. S. 3613: A bill to name a post office the "Major George Quamo Post Office Building." Bush signed the bill Oct. 6, 2006. S. 3145: A bill to designate a highway in New York as the Timothy J. Russert highway. Bush signed the bill July 23, 2008. But there are other ways that Senators can influence legislation even if they don’t end up as the sponsor of the final version: Co-sponsored bills: There were 74 bills that became law that Clinton co-sponsored. For example, she was one of 54 cosponsors on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed in January 2009 by President Barack Obama. (The fact that she co-sponsored these bills doesn’t tell us much about her role in their passage, but Bush referred to bills that "she has her name" on, so it’s worth noting those she co-sponsored.) She co-sponsored one version but another version passed: For example, she co-sponsored S.1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in January 2009 while the version that passed was H.R. 1. Sponsored amendments: She put forward amendments that influenced laws sponsored by others. She sponsored three amendments on a bill for security and disaster funding. The amendments passed in 2007 and the bill passed in 2008. Two experts who study Congress -- Norman Ornstein, a scholar at American Enterprise Institute, and Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and Brookings Institution scholar -- said that the number of sponsored or co-sponsored bills signed into law isn’t a thorough measure of effectiveness or productivity for a member of the Senate. "Offering amendments on the floor, holding hearings, contributing to oversight, helping to negotiate agreements, pushing federal agencies to be responsive to constituents back home -- all of these might contribute to making a senator ‘effective,’ but none of these endeavors of course would show up in a count of bills sponsored or passed or enacted," Binder said. As for Bush’s claim about the number of laws "she has her name on," Binder said that it’s fair game to also look at the number of bills Clinton co-sponsored. "Because ‘have her name on’ is so vague, I don't see the grounds on which to exclude co-sponsored bills," she said. Ornstein said that the names that go on bills of any real significance are the committee chairs -- for example the Dodd-Frank 2010 banking reform bill. Sen. Chris Dodd and U.S. Rep. Barney Frank were the major figures behind the law, but other senators also had roles and don’t have their names on the bill. Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act "does not have Al Franken's name on it, but a really important provision, the medical-loss ratio, was his handiwork," Ornstein said. "Effectiveness can be a behind-the-scenes role, adding a serious amendment, working inside to get the language exactly right. By any reasonable standard, including the private comments of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle when she was in the Senate, she was very effective." Our ruling Bush said that as a senator, Clinton had her name "on three laws in eight years." Bush used vague language here, so it’s fair game to look at the three sponsored bills and the 74 co-sponsored ones that passed. Also, congressional experts warn that legislative influence goes beyond having your name as a sponsor or co-sponsor. Senators weigh in with amendments, debate and negotiations. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details so we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57684e12-55f1-4abd-aa03-85984b69d701	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-06-23T10:00:00	2015-06-16	['None']
pomt-06783	Thirty-seven percent of Central Falls’ retired police officers and firefighters are out on disability pensions; in most municipalities, about 5 percent of retirees collect disability pensions.	/rhode-island/statements/2011/aug/18/stephen-lisauskas/consultant-says-37-percent-central-falls-retired-p/	On July 19, during a public meeting at Central Falls High School’s auditorium, state-appointed receiver Robert Flanders Jr. told about 100 of the city’s retired firefighters and police officers that they’d have to give up half their annual pension benefits or the city would face bankruptcy. The retirees ultimately rejected the request and, on Aug. 1, the city became the first in Rhode Island history to file for bankruptcy. Records in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court show that the city, as of Aug. 1, owed $3.6 million to its retirees, who are paid out of the pension fund. That’s equivalent to nearly two-thirds of the city’s projected $5.6-million deficit. During that July 19 meeting, Flanders’ team of financial advisers ran down the pension numbers. Seated on stage with Flanders and a handful of other advisers was Stephen Lisauskas, a consultant at the Collins Center for Public Management at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. The administration of then-Gov. Donald Carcieri hired Lisauskas as a consultant to help sort through Central Falls’ fiscal mess, paying the Collins Center $75,000 in fiscal 2010. At the meeting, Lisauskas talked about the high cost of the Central Falls pension plans -- the city, with an annual budget of about $17 million, faces $80 million in unfunded pension and benefit obligations. According to a story about the meeting that appeared in the July 20 Providence Journal, Lisauskas said that in Central Falls, 37 percent of retired firefighters and police officers are out on disability pensions, compared with a national average of about 5 percent. If that’s true, it would mean Central Falls firefighters and police are retiring on disability at more than seven times the national average. Disability pensions typically offer more generous benefits and cost municipalities more. They also allow employees who otherwise wouldn’t qualify for their maximum retirement benefits to retire early with full benefits, meaning they’re on the pension rolls longer. In Central Falls, for example, retired firefighters on disability pensions can collect 66.6 percent of their former salaries tax free regardless of their years of service. A firefighter who retires on an ordinary pension would need work for 30 to 35 years to collect the maximum 65-percent benefit. We wondered whether Central Falls police officers and firefighters had a disability rate that’s so out-of-whack with the rest of the country. First, we asked Lisauskas where he got his numbers. "We looked at the number of pensions provided on a disability basis and the city arrived at the figure that 37 percent [of retired police and firefighters] are out on disability pensions," he said. "And our pension consultants have informed us that the national average for police and fire is roughly 5 percent." The Central Falls numbers were easy enough to check; the state had provided The Journal with a list of all retired Central Falls police officers and firefighters receiving pensions. Of the 143 pensions on the list, 52 are labeled disability pensions, which amounts to 36.4 percent, very close to the 37 percent that Lisauskas cited. However, the list indicates 15 of the 52 disability pensions have been converted to ordinary pensions because of the age of the retirees. So, to be accurate, it’s currently 26 percent. Now, on the bigger question: How does Central Falls stack up with the rest of the country? First, we tried the Pew Center on the States, which collects information about public employee pensions. The center had no data on disability rates. Then we called the National Association of Retirement Administrators, which also said it was unaware of any data on disability pension rates. Surely, we thought, the International Association of Fire Fighters in Washington, D.C., would know. "I’m not sure there’s a database anywhere that can answer that question," Lori Moore-Merrell, assistant to the association’s general president, said, "because the pension systems are so different and they differ from state to state." So we did some spot checks. The Rhode Island Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS), a collection of plans run by the state, covers some police and firefighters in Cranston, Woonsocket and several smaller communities. Of the 547 recipients of police and firefighter pensions in MERS, 113 -- about 21 percent -- receive disability pensions, according to Dara Chadwick, spokeswoman for the state retirement system. That’s less than the share of disabled retirees in Central Falls -- but nowhere near what Lisauskas said is a 5-percent national average. Then, we checked outside our area code. Not all state or municipal pension systems track disability rates for retired police officers and firefighters, but we found a few that did. (Some figures are from this year, others are from 2010.) In New York state, the share of retired police officers and firefighters receiving disability pensions is 19.25 percent. (The plan does not include New York City.) In Ohio, it’s just under 35 percent. In Indiana, it’s 24 percent. In California, the state pension system lumps police and firefighters with correctional officers and school safety personnel, so it wasn’t comparable. But we learned that San Jose, Calif., had analyzed its pension costs for police and firefighters, so we checked there. Robin Opheim, senior performance auditor in the San Jose’s auditor’s office, said 67 percent of the city’s retired firefighters and 41 percent of retired police officers were receiving disability pensions as of February 2010. Rhode Island, New York, Ohio, Indiana and San Jose all have double-digit disability rates for retired firefighters and police officers. So where did Lisauskas come up with a 5-percent national average? We called him back to find out. The 5-percent average, he told us, came from actuaries he’d spoken to at Buck Consultants, based in New York City. (As it happens, Buck Consultants is the actuary for the City of Providence.) So we called Buck’s headquarters. "I’m not aware of any formal study that Buck’s done in that area," Buck spokesman Ed Gadowski said. "... I’m not sure where he got it from." One of Buck’s actuaries, Daniel W. Sherman, attended the same July 19 meeting in Central Falls where Lisauskas stated that the national average was 5 percent. So we called Sherman to see whether he knew the source of the data. "There’s no study," Sherman said. "I was just asked the question off-the-cuff: What do you think the percentage ought to be?" Sherman said he was giving Lisauskas a benchmark for the share of disability pensions in a city with a well-managed plan. "What I told Steve [Lisauskas] was 5 to 10 percent and I was thinking of all people -- all participants in the plan." By "all," he says, he meant all municipal employees including office workers, who one would expect to have a lower disability rate. In summary, Lisauskas said 37 percent of Central Falls police and firefighters are on disability pensions. That accurately describes the share of police and firefighters who retired on disability pensions, but only 26 percent are currently receiving disability pensions. More importantly, he went on to compare Central Falls with a national average that, we found, doesn’t really exist. In a crucial discussion about Central Falls’ finances, we’d expect better from a consultant hired for his expert advice. We rate the claim False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

His focus on taxes has been a hallmark of his eight years as Milwaukee County executive: He’s slashed county jobs, cut spending on parks and programs, and has returned a portion of his paychecks to the county coffers. So when Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat in the race for governor, uses a TV ad to accuse Walker of being a closet big spender, it raises some eyebrows. In making his claim, Barrett is relying on the Milwaukee County budgets since Walker took office in 2002. For the 2010 budget, total spending was $1,460,291,522. That’s up $349 million, or 31.5 percent, from the 2003 budget -- the first one crafted by Walker. At first glance, the claim appears accurate. But Barrett is making an old apples and oranges mash-up: He compares total spending with the tax levy. The total spending picture includes every penny that comes in the door of the Milwaukee County Courthouse and goes out again, from fees to state and federal aid. Property taxes make up about 18 percent of the total county budget. Of course, that’s the piece John Q. Taxpayer focuses on. Between 2003 and 2010, the county’s property tax levy went up 19.9 percent. Using Barrett’s approach, that was a $43.8 million increase. If you take the amount of the levy from the time Walker took office and adjust it for inflation, the total today would be $259 million. The actual figure is $4 million higher, or $263 million. Of course, Walker does not raise the levy alone. Indeed, he won the county post on a pledge to hold the levy flat. This has been the pattern: Walker submits a budget that holds the property tax levy at the previous year’s level. The County Board, with a veto-proof margin, returns items to the budget or adds new items to the mix, and the levy rises. To be sure, Walker does take the higher property tax levy and uses it as his starting point for the next year’s budget. But it has been the board, not Walker, responsible for the annual increases. That settles the tax side, but the overall argument -- made by Barrett and other Democrats -- remains: Scott Walker is a closet tax and spender. Let’s look at the spending side, too. If total county spending had simply kept pace with inflation from 2003 to 2010, it would now tally about $1.3 billion a year. But the actual total is about $140 million higher. Again, other factors are at work. In that time the county has taken on additional programs, such as Family Care, that add to the budget. The county administers the programs for other units of government and receives revenue to cover the expense. For instance, Family Care alone has a budget of about $257 million to provide services to elderly and people with disabilities. But all of the money comes from state and federal dollars rather than county property taxes. Let’s sum it all up: In his TV ad, Barrett is mixing and matching two very different sets of numbers -- tax increases and overall spending. When it comes to property taxes, it is the County Board that has been increasing the tax levy, over Walker’s objections and vetoes. Walker does, however, build that increase into each future budget. Meanwhile, spending did rise faster than inflation, but mostly because the county took on new responsibilities and state money that went with them. We rate Barrett’s taxes/spending charge Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15319	Says Scott Walker's views on abortion are more restrictive "than any Republican president in recent times."	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/16/tammy-baldwin/scott-walker-more-restrictive-abortion-reagan-othe/	It’s clear that Scott Walker’s views on abortion will get intensified scrutiny now that he has joined the crowded Republican presidential field. In 2014, during the final weeks of the campaign before he won re-election as governor, Walker was attacked in a TV ad by a national political action committee that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. And weeks before his White House run announcement on July 13, 2015, Walker was targeted twice: once in a TV ad by the nation’s oldest abortion rights advocacy group and once on a TV talk show by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, used her June 3, 2015 interview on MSNBC to cast Walker as out of step with other Republicans on abortion. After host Chris Hayes suggested that Walker’s support for a law banning abortion after 20 weeks was mainstream among Republicans, Baldwin agreed. But she drew a contrast, stating: "Yes, but if you look at the history of those who have been elected president, Scott Walker's views are clearly more extreme than any Republican president in recent times -- much more extreme than President George W. Bush with regard to the issues of having exemptions that deal with the health and the life of the mother, and the issues of exemptions for rape victims and incest." On abortion, is Walker to the right of any recent Republican president? Previous claims Some statements about Walker and abortion have missed the mark, including the two we mentioned. The TV ad by EMILY’s List shortly before Walker defeated Democrat Mary Burke in 2014 claimed Walker was "forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion." We rated it Half True. A law Walker signed says women can choose either a transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, though in certain cases a transvaginal probe may be medically necessary. The TV ad by NARAL Pro-Choice America, which aired in June 2015 in Iowa and New Hampshire, claimed Walker had said that "forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.’ " That was rated Mostly False. The "cool" reference wasn’t to forcing some women to get vaginal ultrasounds, but rather to the ultrasound technology that produces images from the womb. Nevertheless, there is no question that for decades -- going back to before his time as governor and as a state lawmaker -- Walker has been staunchly anti-abortion. Baldwin’s office didn’t respond to our requests for information to back her claim, and Walker’s campaign didn’t weigh in, either. But we can compare Walker’s public positions on abortion to those of recent GOP presidents. NARAL, Planned Parenthood We asked NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly known as the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America about how they rate politicians on abortion rights. The groups told us they don’t produce ratings on a continuum. They put politicians into broad categories -- not on a scale that would rank one as more extreme, to use Baldwin’s term, than another. NARAL gave Walker and 13 other Republican presidential contenders a grade of F, for Fail. The group points to Walker’s votes in the Legislature and measures he has signed into law as governor restricting access to abortion services. Planned Parenthood rates the Republican and Democratic 2016 contenders more broadly, on access to abortion, affordable birth control and family planning. Like most of the other GOP hopefuls, Walker was given a red X on each measure, rather than a green checkmark. Planned Parenthood notes that besides wanting to ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest, Walker tried to repeal a law requiring insurance companies to cover prescription birth control and defunded Planned Parenthood, which is something Walker himself highlights in his campaign speeches. The website of the National Right to Life Committee, meanwhile, highlights the records of President Barack Obama and his four most recent predecessors, dating back to the late Ronald Reagan, but doesn’t do any ratings. So let’s look more closely at Walker and the three most recent GOP presidents, dating back to Reagan. Walker vs. Bushes, Reagan Walker’s basic position is clear. In 2010, a week before he was elected to his first term as governor, we rated True a claim that Walker wants to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. He acknowledged that was his position. As Matt Sande of Pro-Life Wisconsin told us, since then, Walker has not contradicted that position in words or actions. In fact, Walker has underscored his support for banning abortion without exceptions commonly accepted by other abortion opponents. In March 2015, Walker released an "open letter on life," which began by noting that he had "earned a 100 percent rating with pro-life groups in Wisconsin." And in June 2015, Walker pledged to sign legislation to ban abortions in Wisconsin after 20 weeks -- with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. That measure was passed by the Legislature the next month and is awaiting Walker’s signature. No recent Republican president has gone so far in opposing exceptions. As president, George H.W. Bush (1989-’93) and George W. Bush (2001-’09) both supported allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest, or to protect the life of the mother. The elder Bush said in 1992 he said: "My own position on abortion is well-known and remains unchanged. I oppose abortion in all cases except rape or incest or where the life of the mother is at stake." The younger Bush declared in 2006: ''My position has always been three exceptions: rape, incest and the life of the mother." Meanwhile, Reagan (1981-’89), an idol of Walker’s, was closer to Walker’s position. He didn’t support an exception for rape or incest, but did support one to protect the life of the mother. In 1987, he promoted a bill with a provision that "no funds appropriated by Congress shall be used to perform abortions, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term." Our rating Baldwin said Walker's views on abortion are more restrictive "than any Republican president in recent times." Walker supports outlawing abortion in all circumstances. The three most recent GOP presidents each supported exceptions, such as allowing abortion to protect the life of the mother. We rate Baldwin’s statement True.

pomt-03778	Says U.S. greenhouse gas "emissions are at 20-year lows."	/texas/statements/2013/apr/01/joe-barton/joe-barton-says-domestic-greenhouse-gas-emissions-/	As President Barack Obama brought up his interest in addressing global warming, a Texas congressman said U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, widely believed to be fueling climate change, are on the decline. "DID YOU KNOW?" Rep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington, wrote on Twitter during Obama’s Feb. 12, 2013, State of the Union address. "U.S. GHG emissions are at 20-year lows while global emissions are rising." Global emissions have been on the upswing. The Environmental Protection Agency says on a web page that global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels "increased by over 16 times between 1900 and 2008 and by about 1.5 times between 1990 and 2008." Separately, the government’s Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center contributed to a December 2012 "discussion paper" stating that in 2011, estimated global carbon dioxide emissions due to burning fossil fuels and making cement were up 3 percent from 2010. We checked on Barton’s claim that domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low. By email, Barton spokesman Sean Brown pointed out an August 2012 web post by the U.S. Energy Information Administration stating that estimated U.S. carbon dioxide emissions resulting from energy use during the first three months of 2012 "were the lowest in two decades for any January-March period." Brown also noted the Environmental Protection Agency saying in an online chart that as of 2010, concentrations of five common air pollutants--carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide--had decreased from 30 years earlier. This information did not speak to all greenhouse gases, as Barton had, but carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Perry Lindstrom, an economist with the Energy Information Administration, emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that the nation’s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were estimated at 1,339 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1992 and at a slightly higher amount, 1,344 million metric tons, for the comparable months of 2012. In the intervening years, first-quarter emissions topped out at 1,580 million metric tons in 2004 and bottomed out at 1,364 million metric tons in 1993, according to the spreadsheet. Then again, the first quarter of 2012 was unusual, the agency said in its post. "Normally," the agency wrote, carbon dioxide "emissions during the year are highest in the first quarter because of strong demand for heat produced by fossil fuels." But such emissions were lower at the start of 2012 thanks to a mild winter, which reduced heating demand and energy use, the agency said, with other factors including a decline in coal-fired electricity generation, due largely to low natural gas prices, and reduced gasoline demand. Still, the 2012 first-quarter emissions were lower than they had been in the first part of the year in 19 years. However, Lindstrom said by telephone, he would hesitate to reach conclusions solely by comparing emissions in part of a year to emissions in part of another year in contrast to looking, say, decade to decade. At our request, he provided a spreadsheet comparing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the 10 months through October 2012 to such emissions over the comparable part of each previous year over two decades. Our thinking was that this would deliver a longer view based on the latest information available when Barton tweeted. And according to this spreadsheet, the estimated emissions from January through October 2012, 4,386 metric tons, were the lowest 10-month total since 1995--17 years earlier--when such emissions totaled 4,385 metric tons. Going forward, Lindstrom pointed out, his agency projects U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to remain below 2005 levels through 2040. Jim Butler, director of global monitoring at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Earth System Research Laboratory, said by phone that such levelling out makes sense due to improvements in energy efficiency and shifts to fuel sources with less of a carbon footprint than coal. Mindful that Barton’s tweet said greenhouse gas emissions were at a 20-year low, we looked next at emissions of methane, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as estimated in the Environmental Protection Agency’s April 2012 inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions--the latest inventory that would have been available when Barton tweeted. (The agency’s 2013 "draft inventory" was posted online Feb. 22, 2013.) The 2012 inventory indicates that total emissions of three gases were higher in 2010 than 1990, while emissions of four others were lower. In keeping with Barton’s 20-year window, we used the inventory figures to gauge the difference between estimated emissions of each greenhouse gas in 2010 and 1990: --Carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 were 12 percent greater than in 1990; --Methane emissions were lower by 0.3 percent; --Nitrous oxide emissions were lower by 3 percent; --Hydrofluorocarbon emissions were higher by more than 200 percent; --Perfluorocarbons were lower by 73 percent; --Sulfur hexafluoride emissions were lower by 57 percent. Taking all the greenhouse gases into account, according to the inventory, overall emissions were 11 percent higher in 2010 than 1990--and also up 3 percent from 2009, when total emissions dipped considerably during the national recession. Aside from 2009, the previous year with lower greenhouse gas emissions than 2010 was 1997, according to the inventory. Our ruling The congressman said domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low. This statement depends on a comparison of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions—not all greenhouse gases--over three unusually warm winter months of 2012 to such emissions in the same months of 1992. But the latest information available when Barton tweeted indicates that total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were higher in 2010 than they were 20 years earlier, though the 2010 emissions were lower than they were 13 years earlier. We rate this claim Mostly False. CORRECTION, 10:42 a.m. April 8, 2013: Thanks to a reader's nudge, this story was amended to say that the discussed levels of carbon dioxide were in millions of metric tons, not metric tons alone. This did not affect our original rating of the claim.	None	Joe Barton	None	None	None	2013-04-01T10:00:00	2013-02-12	['United_States']
pomt-12332	A political map circulated by Sarah Palin’s PAC incited Rep. Gabby Giffords’ shooting	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/15/new-york-times-editorial-board/no-evidence-sarah-palins-pac-incited-shooting-rep-/	After a lone gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers June 14 while they practiced baseball, the New York Times published an editorial that broadly condemned political violence but sparked controversy with a claim about the motive behind a 2011 attack on a Democratic member of Congress. The New York Times has since issued a correction following broad criticism. The original editorial claimed that maps circulated by Sarah Palin's PAC amounted to "political incitement," which the authors said was clearly linked to the subsequent 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz. "In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear," the uncorrected editorial read. "Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs." The editorial, penned amid the frenzy of the mass shooting, sought to connect the attack on GOP lawmakers with the 2011 Giffords shooting to make a broader point about politically motivated violence. The piece reasoned that the latest attack, which left the gunman dead and four injured, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R–La., was probably "evidence of how vicious American politics has become," and that the shooter’s derangement "found its fuel in politics." The editorial ran into trouble when it turned its focus to the Giffords shooting, so we decided to explore why the connection between Palin’s PAC and Loughner’s motivation is problematic. What we know about the Giffords shooters’ motivations According to news reports, Loughner became fixated on Giffords several years before his Jan. 8, 2011, shooting rampage that killed six and injured 14, including the Arizona congresswoman. Loughner first met Giffords in 2007 at a community event where he asked her a question and was "unsatisfied with her answer," CNN reported. It was at this point he developed a fixation for the lawmaker. Several years elapsed between the time Loughner first met Giffords and when Palin posted a note to Facebook that linked to her political action committee. The PAC circulated a map of House Democrats' districts (not individual members) the GOP would seek to recapture. According to the Washington Post, there is no evidence Loughner was aware of Palin's maps. And according to an interview with one of Loughner's high school friends, the gunman did not watch the news. His rampage was akin to "shooting at the world," said Loughner’s friend Zach Osler. Loughner was ultimately sentenced to serve seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years, without the possibility of parole. New York Times’ correction The uncorrected editorial appeared in today’s print version of the newspaper, and was available online between roughly 9 p.m. June 14 and 10 a.m. June 15, a spokesperson said. At some point before 11 a.m. this morning, staffers removed the language about the clear link between political incitement and Giffords’ shooting, and issued the following correction: "An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords," the correction reads. "In fact, no such link was established." The New York Times’ Opinion twitter account also issued a pair of mea culpas. "We got an important fact wrong, incorrectly linking political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Giffords. No link was ever established," read the first tweet from the NYT Opinion account. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A follow-up tweet read: "We're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake. We've corrected the editorial." Around 4 p.m., the New York Times amended its correction to clarify its description of the maps distributed by Sarah Palin’s political action committee. "The editorial has also been updated to clarify that in a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting, electoral districts, not Democratic lawmakers, were depicted beneath stylized cross hairs," it read. Our ruling The New York Times editorial board said a political map circulated by Palin’s PAC incited Rep. Gabby Giffords’ shooting. We were unable to find evidence Loughner was even aware of the maps, and a friend told an interviewer Loughner did not closely watch the news. The New York Times corrected its story some 13 hours after publication to say no such link has been established between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Giffords. At PolitiFact, our rulings are based on when a statement was made. This claim rates False.

pomt-00188	Says Rep. Martha McSally "has repeatedly tried to limit women’s access to birth control, and she even cosponsored a bill to make contraception more expensive for women."	/arizona/statements/2018/oct/19/arizona-democratic-party/it-true-martha-mcsally-backed-bill-make-birth-cont/	The Arizona Democratic Party claims that Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally’s stance on women’s health care is a reason why she shouldn’t be voted into the U.S. Senate. "Martha has repeatedly tried to limit women’s access to birth control, and she even cosponsored a bill to make contraception more expensive for women," said a claim on marthaforsenate.com, a website paid for by the Arizona Democratic Party highlighting "what McSally doesn't want you to know." McSally is facing Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in the Nov. 6 election. We wondered if McSally backed a bill to make birth control more expensive for women. Under the Affordable Care Act, most women don’t have to pay out-of-pocket for prescribed birth control. McSally supported a bill to make it easier for contraceptive drugs to be sold without a prescription — meaning insurers wouldn’t have to pay for those pills, women would. The bill McSally co-sponsored The Arizona Democratic Party is referring to the Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act, introduced January 2017 by Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, and co-sponsored by McSally. The bill seeks to facilitate the Food and Drug Administration’s approval process for contraceptive drugs, and to make them available over-the-counter (without a prescription) for individuals 18 years old and older. (Prescriptions would be needed for women younger than 18.) The proposal also seeks to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to allow the use of health savings accounts and health flexible spending accounts to pay for drugs without a prescription. Under the Affordable Care Act, most women don’t pay out-of-pocket for FDA-approved birth control prescribed by a doctor. Most private health insurance plans can’t charge women a co-pay or co-insurance for covered contraceptive methods, patient education and counseling. (Exceptions apply; certain exempt religious employers don't have to provide the coverage.) The Arizona Democratic Party says that since the McSally-supported bill makes contraceptive drugs available without a prescription, insurers won’t have to pay for them. Women would cover the costs. The Democratic group also noted that McSally voted in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act. McSally’s campaign argued that the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive coverage is "meaningless" for people without health insurance. "Allowing people without health insurance to purchase over-the-counter contraceptives provides a new pathway that was not previously available and may be the only source of affordable contraceptives," said Torunn Sinclair, McSally’s campaign spokeswoman. If contraceptive drugs became available over-the-counter, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and states can still specify that they be covered by insurance, Sinclair added. She said the availability of over-the-counter products could also increase competition in the market and drive down prices, and save time and costs related to doctor’s visits. The bill McSally supports intends for over-the-counter birth control to complement, not substitute for prescribed contraceptives, Sinclair said. Experts weigh in It’s not necessarily that the cost of the contraception would increase or decrease under McSally’s proposal. Rather, it is that the out-of-pocket expenses to the consumer could increase if over-the-counter pills are not covered by insurance, said Britt Wahlin, vice president for development and public affairs at Ibis Reproductive Health, an international organization seeking to expand women’s access to contraceptives. "In essence, it is correct that over-the-counter contraception could be more expensive for a woman if it is not covered by insurance and she currently has insurance covering her pills," Wahlin said. Since there’s no language in the McSally-backed bill saying over-the-counter contraceptives would be covered through insurance, women could end up paying out-of-pocket if they choose over-the-counter drugs, said Usha Ranji, an associate director for Women’s Health Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "There is concern and speculation" that the bill was introduced and backed by conservatives to undermine the Affordable Care Act coverage, said Susan F. Wood, a health policy professor and director of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. "On the surface it appears to be expanding access," Wood said. "But unless you solve the cost problem for insured people, you are in fact reducing access." The McSally-backed proposal seeks to allow women to use health savings accounts to pay for non-prescription drugs, but that’s not how most people pay for their medication and it’s not a substitute for insurance coverage, experts said. "(Flexible spending accounts) put the burden for covering costs entirely on the consumer and don’t have much benefit for lower income people," Wahlin said. Over-the-counter birth control pills can expand access to safe, effective contraception for women who are uninsured, who live far from health care facilities, or who do not have access to a clinic system — but an affordable retail price is also necessary, Wahlin said. As McSally’s campaign noted, some states have passed laws so insurers pay for over-the-counter contraceptives. But experts said that varies per state and per insurer and could still leave some women paying out-of-pocket for birth control pills. Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy nonprofit that supports women’s access to birth control, in 2015 said that a bill introduced in the Senate (similar to the one McSally supports) was "flawed because it rests on the false assumption" that switching a drug from prescription-only to over-the-counter "will inevitably lower its costs." Guttmacher said that the only available example of an over-the-counter hormonal contraceptive was emergency contraception, and that its cost remained high since the prescription requirement was removed. Some experts also say that if the Affordable Care Act’s contraception coverage is eliminated, women would end up paying for other methods that still require prescription. Even if one type of birth control pill is approved by the FDA as over-the-counter, there are other oral contraceptives that would likely remain on prescription, and there are still other forms of birth control that cannot be over-the-counter, such as IUDs (intrauterine devices), said Lucia DiVenere, a government and political affairs officer for The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Our ruling The Arizona Democratic Party said, McSally "has repeatedly tried to limit women’s access to birth control, cosponsored a bill to make contraception more expensive for women." Under the Affordable Care Act, most women don’t have to pay for birth control if its prescribed. McSally voted to repeal the health care law. The bill McSally supports seeks to make contraceptive drugs available over-the-counter, which would increase access. But experts said that without language in the bill saying over-the-counter contraception would be covered by insurance, women could go from not paying to paying. Some states have passed laws to ensure no-cost contraceptive coverage, but that approach could leave women in some states paying out-of-pocket.

pomt-13934	Says "Michael Bennet votes for President Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time. Hardly independent, hardly bipartisan."	/colorado/statements/2016/jun/22/ryan-frazier/gop-foe-close-saying-bennet-votes-98-obama-wrong-c/	At a recent debate, Colorado U.S. Senate candidate Ryan Frazier made a plea for party unity with his opponents. "We as Republicans must unify, because the stakes are that important. And I believe any of us on this stage would be a heck of a lot better than Michael Bennet," said Frazier, a former Aurora city councilman, referring to Colorado’s incumbent Democratic senator. "You see, Michael Bennet votes for President Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time. Hardly independent, hardly bipartisan," Frazier stressed. (Watch debate video clip, courtesy KKTV) It’s a no-brainer for a Republican candidate to portray Bennet as marching in lockstep with a president who’s unpopular with GOP primary voters. Frazier is among five Republicans scrapping to win the June 28 primary and a shot at toppling Bennet in the general election. So let’s look deeper at Frazier’s claim that Bennet votes for Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time, and whether that makes him "hardly independent, hardly bipartisan." Here’s Bennet’s presidential support rate since he and Obama took office in 2009, according to CQ: Year Presidential support rate 2009 96.2 percent 2010 98.4 percent 2011 95.5 percent 2012 98.7 percent 2013 98.2 percent 2014 99.3 percent 2015 89.7 percent We asked the Frazier campaign for evidence supporting the statement. The campaign cited a Jan. 12 online statement by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which cited the annual percentage of Bennet’s votes where he supported the president’s position from 2009 through 2014. The average for those years is 97.5 percent, which rounds up to 98 percent, the figure Frazier cited. The NRSC attributed the data to CQ Roll Call, a nonpartisan news service that tracks congressional data. But the NRSC statement misstated the percentage for Bennet’s 2014 votes with Obama as "100 Percent Of The Time." CQ’s Vote Watch database says Bennet voted with Obama 99.3 percent of the time in 2014. The NRSC also left out data for 2015, when Bennet backed the president’s positions 89.7 percent of the time, according to CQ. When we add the 2015 voting data, Bennet’s seven-year average of voting with the president is 96.57 percent — just a bit lower than Frazier’s claim of 98 percent. However, Bennet’s campaign spokesman Andrew Zucker said it’s easy to use the CQ figures to distort a lawmaker’s overall record in Congress. Zucker noted that Bennet has opposed Obama’s plans when they conflict with Colorado’s interest. He successfully fought the administration’s 2010 plan to slash funding for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in Fort Collins that is working to combat the Zika virus. He also pushed back against the administration’s proposal to cut funding for the Orion aerospace program in Colorado that supported 1,000 jobs in the state. Bennet has also voted against the president on major issues. He was one of nine Democrats to side with Republicans on a bill to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Obama vetoed that bill and Bennet voted for an unsuccessful effort to override the veto. Inside presidential support ratings Here’s some background to keep in mind when sifting through CQ’s presidential support statistics. First of all, they only deal with a fraction of votes cast by Bennet. CQ only counts those votes where the president takes a "clear position" on an issue. For example, according to CQ, Obama only staked out a position on 145 of the 366 votes the Senate took in 2014. And the vast majority of the presidential support votes in 2014 — 125, or 86 percent — involved a glut of presidential nominees for federal posts, because the Democrats controlled the Senate then and had lowered the threshold for approving most nominees from 60 votes to a simple majority, CQ reported. In fact, in every year but 2009 (40 percent), a majority of the votes Obama has supported were on his nominees. Bennet called ‘party loyalist’ and ‘bipartisan problem solver’ While Frazier calls Bennet "hardly independent, hardly bipartisan," there is evidence the senator works across the aisle. Last year, the Washington Post ranked him fifth among Democratic senators who "vote against their party the most." The chart below shows how often Bennet has voted with Senate Democrats, compared to how the party majority voted, according to CQ. Bennet voted closest with the Democratic Party in 2014 -- he voted 98.8 percent to the party’s average of 98.6 percent -- but his support for the party’s position dropped down to 82.9 percent in 2015. Over seven years, Bennet voted with the Democratic Party on average 91.29 percent of the time — a few points less than the average for all Democratic senators voting with the party (94.51 percent) during that period. A CQ profile of the senator said, "Bennet has played dual roles, as a party loyalist and a bipartisan problem solver." As a Democratic loyalist, he’s fought to protect Medicare, saying, "We can’t attempt to balance the nation’s budget on the backs of our seniors," CQ reported. Wearing his problem-solver hat, Bennet worked with Republican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah to win FDA support for "breakthrough therapies" legislation in 2012 that sped approval of new drug treatment for cystic fibrosis, lung cancer and leukemia. Bennet often joins groups seeking compromise Bennet has been a frequent member of bipartisan groups of lawmakers working to find compromise on major legislation, the CQ profile said. He was one of three Democratic senators to oppose the January 2013 "fiscal cliff" deal, which averted income tax increases on earnings under $400,000 but didn’t cut federal spending — a deal-breaker for Bennet. Bennet, a former Denver Public Schools superintendent, has earned praise from Republicans for reaching across the aisle, including for his work on the overhaul of the No Child Left Behind law. "Michael understands that the Senate is a place where you have extended debate on important subjects and work across party lines until you come to a consensus — that’s how you get a result, and that’s how you govern a complex country," Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate education committee, told the Denver Post in 2015. Our ruling Frazier said, "Michael Bennet votes for President Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time. Frazier cited the frequency of Bennet voting with the president as proof he is "hardly independent, hardly bipartisan." In this case, Bennet is close on the available numbers, but they don’t indicate a blind allegiance to Obama’s agenda, as Frazier argues. CQ data show Bennet voting for the president’s position on legislation an average of 96.57 percent over seven years. That’s just over 1 percentage point below Frazier’s figure. However, the CQ data distorts the senator’s voting record, because a majority of the time the president expresses his position is when a vote involves someone he’s nominated for a federal post. There is also independent support for the view that Bennet is a "bipartisan" lawmaker who works with and votes with Republicans more often than the Senate’s Democratic caucus as a whole. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-05839	Says a 1915 referendum on women’s right to vote "went down in New Jersey. And it took the Legislature to pass it."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/16/loretta-weinberg/loretta-weinberg-claims-new-jersey-voted-down-1915/	The results of a referendum nearly a century ago shows the rights of one group should not be determined by public vote, according to a New Jersey senator opposed to a state referendum on gay marriage. Asked in a recent interview about Gov. Chris Christie’s desire to let New Jersey voters decide whether to allow marriage between same-sex couples, Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) said, "we’re not going to do that." "So he can want to do it, but there is a strong feeling, and I know the feeling on the part of our Senate President Steve Sweeney, that we don't put equal justice ideas on the ballot. The last time that happened in New Jersey apparently was around 1915, it was women's right to vote, women's suffrage. And by the way, it went down in New Jersey. And it took the Legislature to pass it," Weinberg said in a Feb. 7 appearance on NJToday. PolitiFact New Jersey found Weinberg is right. In 1915, the men of New Jersey decided a woman’s place was not in the voting booth. Five years later, the state Legislature ratified the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which confirmed a woman’s right to vote. Here’s the history: Under New Jersey’s 1776 state Constitution, women were not specifically excluded from the right to vote. And some women did vote, according to "Reclaiming Lost Ground: The Struggle for Woman Suffrage in New Jersey" by Neale McGoldrick and Margaret Crocco. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 women in New Jersey voted between 1790 and 1807, the year the state Legislature restricted voting rights to men. Suffragists waged state and national campaigns. Though some states succeeded in granting women the right to vote before the federal amendment was ratified in 1920, states on the East Coast struggled, "challenged by political bosses, liquor interests, and others who feared that woman suffrage would result in prohibition," McGoldrick and Crocco wrote. By 1915, suffragists in New Jersey -- as well as in New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania -- managed to put a woman’s right to vote on the ballot. All four measures failed. In New Jersey, more than 184,000 residents voted against the referendum, compared with more than 133,000 who voted for it. Majorities in every county voted the ballot question down, except for Ocean County where it passed by less than 160 votes, according to a breakdown of the vote from the New Jersey Historical Society. "New Jersey law did not permit the amendment to be reintroduced into the Legislature for five years. Since the amendment had to be submitted to two successive Legislatures for approval, this meant that a New Jersey amendment was at least seven years off," according to McGoldrick and Crocco. But women in New Jersey didn’t have to wait seven years. In 1919, Congress passed the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which declared no citizen could be denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. The New Jersey Legislature ratified the amendment in 1920, making the state the 29th to do so. Our ruling Weinberg claimed that when women’s suffrage was put to a referendum in 1915 "it went down in New Jersey. And it took the Legislature to pass it." Nearly a century ago, New Jersey defeated a measure giving women the right to vote by 184,390 to 133,282. Five years later, the state Legislature ratified the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

pomt-10015	AIG "said they were giving $57 million (in retention payments) to people who were being terminated."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/18/elijah-cummings/AIG-retention-bonuses-employees-plans-to-terminate/	Often lost in the raging debate over $165 million in bonuses paid to AIG employees — amid a $170 billion taxpayer-funded bailout — is the fact that these were not performance bonuses, they were "retention awards." Essentially, they were payments made to employees to keep them from leaving the crumbling company. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., has been railing against the retention bonuses for months, but this week he came across a line in a recent AIG filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that really galled him. "Keep in mind, in their filings — AIG's recent filings — they said they were giving $57 million to people who were being terminated," Cummings said in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America on March 16. "I mean, that goes in the opposite direction of retention. And I really do think the American people are being played for fools by AIG." Sure enough, if you go to page 222 of AIG's 10-K filing last month, you'll find this line: "Restructuring expenses include $44 million of retention awards and Total amount expected to be incurred includes $57 million for retention awards for employees expected to be terminated." What? Retention bonuses to people you don't plan to...you know...retain? "As part of restructuring the company, we will ultimately eliminate jobs that are, at the moment, critical to maintaining ongoing operations and winding down certain businesses," Christina Pretto, an AIG spokeswoman, told Bloomberg. "To have one of these positions obviously implies an uncertain future, and creates an incentive to leave the company. To retain such mission-critical people, we are making retention payments to them." In all, AIG committed to $1 billion worth of retention payments. In a Dec. 5, 2008, letter to Rep. Cummings, AIG chairman and CEO Edward Liddy said retaining key employees is critical for the company to maintain its standing in the eyes of reinsurers and rating agencies, and ultimately is essential for AIG to recoup as much as it can for taxpayers. "We would be doing a disservice to the taxpayer — and would place AIG's asset divestiture plan at risk — if we did not act decisively to ensure that our key employees remain with the company," said Liddy, who took over the reins at AIG in September at the government's request. With the company posting monstrous losses, we should note that these retention payments will essentially be paid through the infusion of cash from the taxpayer-funded bailouts. At the moment, the retention payments that have drawn the most scorn are those to employees in the financial products division, the folks that got the insurance conglomerate into the deep mess it's currently in. Those agreements predate the company bailouts by the federal government. Back in April 2008 and "due to the declining market environment," the company established an employee retention plan with financial products employees "to manage and unwind its complex business," according to SEC filings. An installment payment on those retention bonuses came due on March 15 to the tune of $165 million. That's the payment that triggered the recent political storm. According to a letter sent by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to House Financial Services Charman Barney Frank on March 17, 73 employees got retention bonuses of $1 million or more; and 11 of them are no longer working at AIG (including one who got $4.6 million). In all, the New York attorney general's office found that 52 of the 418 employees who got the retention bonuses have left the company. Liddy said the retention bonuses amounted to going to those employees and saying, "You have a job. That job's going to go away after you wind down the book of business that you manage. If you'll stay..." In a congressional hearing on March 18, Frank asked if those who got retention bonuses and then left had to give back their bonus. "No," Liddy said. "The arrangement is, if you stay, wind down your particular business, do a good job of it, and we're comfortable with the job you've done, you'll get that retention bonus." "I'm trying desperately to prevent an uncontrolled collapse of that business," Liddy said. "This is the only way to improve AIG's ability to pay taxpayers back quickly and completely and the only way to avoid a systemic shock to the economy that the U.S. government help was meant to relieve. Make no mistake. Had I been CEO at the time, I would never have approved the retention contracts that were put in place over a year ago. It was distasteful to have to make these payments, but we concluded that the risk to the company and, therefore, the financial system in the economy, were unacceptably high. And if not paid, we ran the risk that we would have happen what everyone has worked so hard thus far not to have happen." Liddy said he has since asked employees of AIG Financial Products "to step up and do the right thing. Specifically, I've asked those who received retention payments in excess of $100,000 or more to return at least half of those payments." Some have already stepped forward, he said, and offered to give up a hundred percent of their payments. Meanwhile, legislators have been scrambling to find ways to wiggle out of the retention contracts, with some threatening to pass legislation such that if the bonuses aren't returned, they will be taxed to nothing. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Liddy vowed to do everything he could to reduce 2009 retention payments by at least 30 percent. But he also warned that messing with commitments to employees could lead to a mass exodus that could threaten the company's ability to make taxpayers whole. "On the one hand, all of us at AIG recognize the environment in which we operate and the remonstrations of our president for a more restrained system of compensation for executives," Liddy said. "On the other hand, we cannot attract and retain the best and brightest talent to lead and staff the AIG businesses — which are now being operated principally on behalf of the American taxpayers — if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury." Cummings isn't buying that. In a statement provided to PolitiFact, Cummings said that while he "understands where AIG is coming from in this argument, when I look at the bigger picture here, I just do not see this as being a reasonable argument for several reasons. First, it is simply unnecessary to give a $4 million bonus to someone who is already making $1 million a year — we are talking about quadrupling an annual salary — to keep someone at a company when the job market is as weak as it is. In these times, a weekly paycheck is all the retention payment anybody needs. Second, AIG is losing employees anyway, despite offering these retention payments. And, if you think about it, this makes sense. What employee is going to stay with a company when the company announces that it is liquidating its assets? This company has suffered the greatest quarterly loss in the history of corporate record-keeping in this country. Third, I just do not believe that the company is implementing the retention program in the most efficient and effective manner. I could possibly understand giving retention payments to a handful of top employees to keep them — but thousands of employees? I just cannot fathom how there can be thousands of indispensable employees right now, when there are hundreds of thousands of people in the financial sector who have lost their jobs." David Schmidt, a consultant at executive pay firm James F. Reda & Associates, said retention award programs are fairly common for companies that are in trouble. "That doesn't mean you can't be annoyed by it," he said. But the bottom line, he said, is that if the government figures out a way not to pay the bonuses, it likely means "a lot of these folks are just going to leave." The reality, Schmidt said, is that many of these employees are in high demand. This is a complex issue, and much of the detail about the retention bonuses has not yet been publicly revealed. And it's certainly debatable whether the company needs to be paying such large retention bonuses to so many employees. But the fact we are checking here is whether AIG plans to spend $57 million on retention awards for people it expects to terminate in the future. And the answer, according to the company's recent SEC filings, is yes. We rule the statement True.	None	Elijah Cummings	None	None	None	2009-03-18T17:27:19	2009-03-16	['None']
pomt-04811	Ted Cruz is "unknown to the vast majority of Texans."	/texas/statements/2012/aug/20/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-ted-cruz-unknown-vast-majority-te/	The night that Ted Cruz won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, the Democrats’ nominee characterized Cruz as an inexperienced man of mystery. In his July 31, 2012, statement, former state Rep. Paul Sadler, who also won a runoff that night, said: "Because of low turnout and outside money, a loud angry mob inside the Republican Party... nominated Ted Cruz who is untested, untried and unknown to the vast majority of Texans." Cruz, an attorney and the state’s former solicitor general, is making his first run for office. Voters can judge how tested and tried he is. Is it accurate to say he's widely unknown? By telephone, Sadler said he was trying to underscore Cruz’s lack of a legislative voting record and his belief that "we don’t know how he’ll react in the legislative process." Cruz, he said, is unknown in that way. "If that’s not said properly, I’ll concede that," Sadler said. An alternative read of Sadler’s statement is that he was saying that Cruz is unknown, in all ways, to most Texans. According to poll results, in contrast, Cruz’s name recognition grew in the months leading to his runoff against the previously front-running hopeful, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. In the run-up, those candidates and outside groups spent more than $35 million, according to a pre-runoff Texas Tribune analysis posted July 30, 2012. Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning North Carolina firm, and the University of Texas/Texas Tribune each conducted relevant polls of voters. In an April 2012 poll of 591 Texas voters, most of them Republican, Cruz had 41 percent name recognition, Public Policy Polling spokesman Tom Jensen told us by email. Poll respondents were asked if they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Cruz. Some 19 percent said favorable, 22 percent said unfavorable and 59 percent had no opinion. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points. So, a majority of voters may have then been unaware of Cruz, though a poll taken the next month, before Cruz finished second to Dewhurst in the May 29, 2012, primary, suggests Cruz’s profile was on the rise. In the May 2012 UT/Texas Tribune poll of 800 randomly selected registered voters, each respondent was asked "whether you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of Ted Cruz." Some 58 percent of the respondents, who were not just Republicans, had an opinion, while 42 percent said they did not know enough to have an opinion. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. (In the poll, 36 percent of respondents had an opinion of Sadler, 63 percent said they did not know enough about him to have one.) UT professor Daron Shaw, who helped conduct the poll, told us by email that he is unaware of empirical evidence supporting Sadler’s claim. Cruz became especially well known among active Republicans, later polls indicate. An Ohio pollster, Fritz Wenzel, polled 600 likely Texas Republican runoff voters on behalf of Citizens United, a group backing Cruz. Wenzel told us by telephone that 93 percent of the respondents in the July 2012 poll had an opinion of Cruz, while 7 percent did not know enough to have one. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.98 percentage points. Wenzel said it makes sense that likely GOP runoff voters are the most likely to know Cruz. "The people least likely to know him are Democratic and independent voters, and we did not sample them," he said. Still, Wenzel called Sadler’s claim "badly overblown. (Cruz) is clearly known to most Republican voters and that is a universe that comprises at least close to, if not more than, half the Texas electorate. Republicans have not lost a statewide race since 1994. Also in July, Public Policy Polling polled 665 likely Republican runoff voters; 85 percent had an opinion of Cruz with 53 percent favorable, 32 percent unfavorable. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. Broadly, PPP spokesman Jensen said, he imagines the current share of Texans familiar with Cruz falls between 41 and 85 percent -- "in the 60s," he said, "but I don’t know for sure." Our ruling Sadler said Cruz is unknown to the vast majority of Texans. He told us this was a reference to Cruz’s lack of a legislative record, not his name recognition. We’ll grant that intention, though Sadler’s claim did not read that way to us. The facts are that Cruz is widely known among Republican voters and may be known by around 60 percent of all voters. This claim has an element of truth -- Cruz’s lack of a legislative record. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Paul Sadler	None	None	None	2012-08-20T06:00:00	2012-07-31	['Ted_Cruz', 'Texas']
pomt-01152	"Site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/17/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wmcs-kurt-bauer-says-businesses-favor-right-work-s/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s first term was marked by a flood of pro-business legislation. With Walker poised to start a second term in January 2015, the state’s leading business lobby -- Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce -- wants Walker and Republicans to press further in the name of creating a better business climate. Tops on the legislative agenda for the group, at least based on a Dec. 8, 2014 opinion piece by its president and CEO Kurt Bauer, is so-called right-to-work legislation. "Should joining a private-sector union be voluntary as it is in 24 states or should it be mandatory?" Bauer wrote. He added: "Beyond the personal freedom component to this debate is the economic development argument. It is well-known that site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan." Iowa’s right to work law dates to 1947. Indiana and Michigan approved the change in 2012. One four-letter word caught our attention in Bauer’s piece: "shun." Is Wisconsin getting shut out of business expansion because it allows private employers to sign contracts with unions that require all covered employees to join the union? A closer look We started by asking Bauer about the term "site selectors." Bauer told us it refers to CEOs and consulting firms who help companies search for new locations. He pointed to a 2012 survey of U.S. corporate executives regarding factors they consider when choosing sites for expansion or relocation. In that survey by Area Development magazine, 72 percent said it was important or very important that a state has passed "right-to-work" legislation. Bauer noted that in a November 2012 article in the magazine, one consultant estimated that three-fourths of his firm’s clients want only locations that are in right-to-work states. That kind of anecdotal evidence was mentioned repeatedly by site-search consultants quoted in the magazine, as well as in another publication, Site Selection. Estimates vary on the strength of the preference. States will be eliminated at the first stage in "about half" of projects, one consultant told Site Selection. After Michigan passed right to work, another consultant told the publication that "it will get Michigan a few more looks on site searches, mostly industrial ones. It’s hard to know what percentage." Some consultants say manufacturing companies are more likely to steer clear of unions when compared to firms in other sectors. Wisconsin is a manufacturing-rich state. Area Development magazine framed the right to work debate this way: Businesses tend to support right-to-work because it makes unionization less likely and in turn often means lower labor costs. Unions oppose them because right to work weakens union membership and wages. "In a right-to-work state, any worker choosing not to join the union or pay for the services still gets the benefits," the magazine noted. "Unions often refer to those workers as ‘free riders,’ and because wages tend to be lower in right-to-work states, unions famously refer to the concept as ‘right-to-work for less.’ While "shun" suggests Wisconsin simply loses out when businesses are deciding where to build, even a quick peek at the state jobs agency’s website yields examples to the contrary. Global food ingredients company Kerry expanded here as did Seneca Foods; Plexus Corp. built a global headquarters in Neenah; Amazon is opening a new facility in Kenosha. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation "does not track whether unionization or Right to Work Laws are a factor in a company’s decision to relocate or expand in Wisconsin," jobs agency spokesman Mark Maley said. The same 2010 article Bauer cited noted that "choosing a state with a low-union profile or locating in a (right to work) state only ranked 10th and 12th respectively among a list of 26 different site selection factors," according to Area Development’s 26th Annual Corporate Survey. In the most recent Area Development survey, published in 2013, these factors were ahead of union issues: taxes, availability of buildings, energy costs, building costs, telecommunications infrastructure, skilled workforce, highway connections, government investment in workforce development. Bauer acknowledged many factors can come into play when businesses make such decisions. Responses from his group’s own survey of members show that some executives are concerned about the lack of a right to work law. But the number (15 percent) was well short of a majority. In past years, the WMC did not ask specifically about attitudes toward unionization. But that changed in 2014, the group said. Some 260 executives participated in the survey. "When asked what one thing state government can do to improve Wisconsin’s business climate, 35 percent said reduce taxes, 15 percent said become a Right to Work state and 14 percent said reform employment laws, like harmonizing the state and federal versions of family medical leave," a WMC news release noted. Our rating Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce said: "Site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan." There’s anecdotal evidence that some firms screen out states without right to work laws when seeking to expand, and surveys of site selectors say this issue is important. But its far down the list of top concerns for many site selectors, suggesting that "shun" is too strong a term. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-10679	"George Bush ... used a signing statement (on a FEMA bill) to say, 'I don't have to follow that, unless I choose to.' "	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/17/hillary-clinton/indeed-bush-did-it-his-way/	"(Bush) used (signing statements) as essentially a form of veto," Sen. Hillary Clinton said during a Democratic debate in December 2007. "He did it through a piece of legislation I passed, where it was pretty simple. I said: 'If you're going to have a FEMA director, it should be somebody with experience handling emergencies.'... And when George Bush signed the bill it was part of, he specifically used a signing statement to say, 'I don't have to follow that, unless I choose to.''' The legislation Clinton refers to came after the federal government's lackluster response to Hurricane Katrina. Included in a 2006 spending bill for the agency, a new requirement was added that said future Federal Emergency Management Agency directors must have a "demonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management" and "not less than five years of executive leadership." Bush had appointed Michael "You're doing a heckuva job, Brownie" Brown to the top FEMA job in 2003, even though he didn't have much emergency experience. Brown was removed from his position in the poorly managed aftermath of Katrina and the background requirement for future directors was added to FEMA's budget bill. Essentially, Bush rejected the hiring requirements added to the bill. Choosing to forgo a veto, he interpreted the new law with a "signing statement," something his administration has done to challenge more than 1,100 laws — more than all previous presidents combined. (By comparison, Bush has vetoed seven.) The administration says the statements give Bush the right to ignore parts of the bill he deems unconstitutional, usually when power of the executive branch is at issue. In this Oct. 4, 2006, signing statement, Bush took exception to the minimum standards for the FEMA director because they ruled out a "large portion of those persons best qualified by experience and knowledge to fill the office." Bush said he would "construe (the qualifications section) in a manner consistent with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution," which gives presidents wide authority to make appointments that must be approved by the Senate. It was a formal way of saying Bush believes Congress has no business trying to dictate standards for presidential appointments and that he would ignore them. So, in effect, Clinton correctly characterized Bush's response to the FEMA minimum standards. He really was saying he wouldn't follow this requirement unless he chose to do so. But there's a larger context to Bush's refusal. The Bush administration has defended and expanded the powers of the executive branch. So it's no surprise that he doesn't want Congress meddling in his hiring decisions. Historically, aside from the occasional scandal (see Teapot Dome, Watergate, Lewinsky), nothing pits the legislative branch against the executive branch more than a president's hiring and firing of personnel. In 1868, when President Andrew Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, an angry U.S. Congress impeached him. In 1989, Bush's father got acquainted with this tension when he tried to appoint Sen. John Tower as defense secretary. The confirmation hearings got so ugly, reports of Tower's heavy drinking were made public and the Senate ultimately rejected him. In 1993, Bill Clinton encountered troubles of his own, especially when he tried appointing an attorney general. Janet Reno was his third choice after Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood withdrew during a bruising confirmation process. So it's through this presidential powers prism that the Bush administration resisted the limit on hiring FEMA's chief. "The president has the authority to choose which of his subordinate officers he'll rely on," White House spokesman Tony Fratto told the Washington Post last year. "The president has the authority to determine what the relationship is between them." We're not going to try resolving the constitutional dispute that's raised here. Bush may very well be right. But just because he is, doesn't mean Clinton isn't. Her statement about how Bush viewed the background requirements for a FEMA director is True.

pomt-03084	"(Obamacare) is a bill which has never once had a majority of Americans favor it."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/26/newt-gingrich/obamacare-has-never-been-favored-majority-american/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made waves this week with his 21-hour Senate speech against Obamacare. While he’s the only one reading Green Eggs and Ham to his colleagues as a form of protest, he’s far from alone in his criticism of the law. CNN Crossfire host Newt Gingrich referenced public opinion on the Sept. 24, 2013, show while criticizing President Barack Obama’s health care reform. "It is a bill which has never once had a majority of Americans favor it," he said. Gingrich’s claim comes while Congress evaluates Republican-written legislation that proposes funding the government only if Obamacare is defunded. We looked at a similar claim in 2011, but it’s time to dive into the polls again. Since the Affordable Care Act was drafted in 2009, the poll numbers have been more or less consistent across different months and polling organizations: The approval rating has hovered around 40 percent recently, with about 50 percent disapproval and 10 percent no opinion. Not much has changed since then, according to a recent CNN and ORC report of all their Obamacare polling. That’s consistent with Gallup and other polling agencies. As best as we can tell, a credible poll has never turned up a figure over 50 percent. Bigger picture Gingrich was onto something with the poll results, confirmed Larry Jacobs, a University of Minnesota professor who specializes in public opinion and polling. "It’s one of those things where when you look at the number of polling organizations, the variety of question wordings, I consider that an impressive finding and a robust one," Jacobs said. However, there’s a disconnect between the poll results themselves and Gingrich’s implication that most Americans don’t want Obamacare, Jacobs added. Although the poll results are consistent with each other, they produce lower favorability ratings than polls about health care reform that refer to the "Affordable Care Act" as opposed to "Obamacare," according to CNBC. That’s because using the president’s name in a poll is "more likely to invoke a partisan prism for evaluation," said Michael Traugott, a University of Michigan professor who specializes in public opinion and polling. In those studies that ask more generally about health care reform, Republicans respond more favorably. When pollsters ask the public about individual elements of Obamacare, like coverage for pre-existing conditions, the majority favors them, Traugott said. The main exception to this rule is the individual mandate. Another caveat to the poll results Gingrich references is the fact that a sizable segment of the public is misinformed or uninformed about the details of Obamacare. In fact, four in 10 polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April were unaware that the Affordable Care Act is still law. So many people indicate that they don’t favor Obamacare not because they don’t agree with the policy, but because they don’t understand the policy. "Low levels of knowledge about the details of the legislation make it unlikely that there would be widespread support for it," Traugott said. Our ruling Gingrich claimed that Obamacare has never been supported by a majority of the nation. The polls themselves show that yes, approval has hovered around 40 percent for the past few years. But Gingrich eliminates the context of other polls, which show that a majority of people do approve of individual components of Obamacare. Because the statement needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5247c883-0e44-4a72-960c-aeb0178d3048	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2013-09-26T17:31:35	2013-09-24	['United_States']
pomt-03335	A "hidden" provision in the health care law taxes sporting goods as medical devices.	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/23/chain-email/errant-email-health-care-law-comes-georgia/	There’s been a lot of confusion and controversy surrounding the federal health care law, otherwise known as Obamacare. And now there’s an email being circulated that is adding to the turmoil. Gwinnett County resident Don Smith shared the email with us and asked if it was accurate. The email contained a photo of a receipt from Cabela’s, a Nebraska-based retail store that sells sporting goods, guns and camping gear. Cabela’s is not in Georgia. Underlined in yellow on the receipt is the amount charged for a "medical excise tax." "The 2.3 (percent) Medical Excise Tax that began on January 1st is supposed to be ‘hidden’ from the consumer, but it’s been brought to the public’s attention by hunting and fishing store Cabela’s who have refused to hide it and are showing it as a separate line item tax on their receipts," the email says. The email says it went on the Internal Revenue Service’s website and did some research. "And what do I find under ‘MEDICAL DEVICES’ under ‘MANUFACTURERS TAXES?,’ " The following discussion of manufacturers taxes applies to the tax on: Sport fishing equipment; Fishing rods and fishing poles; Electric outboard motors; Fishing tackle boxes; Bows, quivers, broadheads and points; Arrow shafts; Coal; Taxable tires; Gas guzzler automobiles; and Vaccines." Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio recently examined a similar email and determined anyone who gets it in their inbox should put it in their trash bin. First, though, it is true that there is a medical device excise tax. The tax is designed to offset the added costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It became law at the beginning of this year. A 2.3 percent tax is imposed on some devices. The federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act has broad definitions of the types of devices that can be taxed. They’re typically devices used by physicians or medical offices. The items that cannot be taxed include eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids. PolitiFact Ohio found that none of the items listed in the chain email are included as medical devices. So why would Cabela’s tax its customers? It was an error, the business told PolitiFact Ohio. A Cabela's spokesman blamed a companywide "glitch" in its sales register system. The problem added a 2.3 percent "medical excise tax" to all purchases at its stores on Jan. 1. The error was caught the same day, the spokesman said, and the charges would be refunded. Is the tax "hidden"? Obviously not, if it was included on the Cabela’s bill. The Medical Device Manufacturers Association, a Washington, D.C.-based group, has vigorously lobbied against the tax and supported congressional bills to repeal it, saying it will take money the industry uses for research and development. In a March press release, the association said manufacturers had paid $388 million in taxes to the federal government since the tax started in January. To sum up, the email claims a medical excise tax "is supposed to be hidden from the consumer." That’s incorrect. The email also implies that items that can be taxed include fishing rods and some cars. Again, incorrect. Lastly, the email says Cabela’s sporting goods store "refused to hide" the tax. Wrong. The company said it made a mistake when it taxed customers and would refund them. Delete the email if it comes your way. Pants on Fire!

pomt-05590	Says "new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office conclude the final price-tag" for the health care law "will exceed $2 trillion — more than double what was initially reported."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/01/frank-lobiondo/frank-lobiondo-says-health-care-reform-law-will-co/	The court of public opinion has already struck down the health care law, according to one Republican. Now, U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo said, it’s the U.S. Supreme Court’s turn. The southern New Jersey congressman said in a letter to The News of Cumberland County that health care reform passed without bipartisan consensus. And, he said, although the tentacles of "ObamaCare" are not yet fully extended, the cost of the law is already increasing. "Many of the tax increases and penalties have yet to take effect while new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office conclude the final price-tag will exceed $2 trillion — more than double what was initially reported," LoBiondo wrote in the letter published online a week before the Supreme Court started hearing arguments over provisions in the law. PolitiFact New Jersey found two problems with LoBiondo’s statement: it relies on a misleading comparison and the "final price-tag" is marked up. So how much will the law cost? LoBiondo was referring to gross, rather than net, costs. The gross cost -- the cost without accounting for additional revenues the government will collect from the law -- was estimated at $938 billion by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, two years ago. That estimate includes costs from 2010 to 2019. In a recent report, the congressional agency updated its estimate to $1.762 trillion for 2012 to 2022. The updated figure doesn’t "exceed $2 trillion." LoBiondo spokesman Jason Galanes cited other estimates the CBO released to back up the point. In those estimates, the agency tests how the costs would change in scenarios that differ from the agency’s expectation that there will be a small reduction in employment-based health insurance. Galanes said in an e-mail that "LoBiondo believes it is reasonable to project that the law could in fact reach or exceed $2 trillion in costs as three of the four scenarios considered by CBO suggest." But under the congressional agency’s current assumptions, the projected gross cost is $1.762 trillion. And that’s not "more than double what was initially reported." To reach that conclusion, the congressman made a misleading comparison. The congressional agency’s original estimate of $938 billion included 10 years of data, from 2010 to 2019. In its latest estimate, the CBO projects the gross cost of the law over 11 years, from 2012 to 2022, for a total of $1.762 trillion. So, the figures include a different number of years. Also, the latest estimate represents nine years when the law is fully implemented and, therefore, costs more. The earlier estimate included several years when the law was not fully implemented and so costs were lower. When the gross costs from 2012 to 2019 -- the years included in both reports -- are compared, the difference is significantly less than double. It’s an increase of 8.6 percent, from $931 billion to $1.01 trillion. The difference in the net cost estimate over the same time frame further erodes LoBiondo’s point. It has decreased slightly from the earlier estimate. Two years ago, the CBO projected the health care law would have a net cost of $777 billion from 2012 to 2019. Now, that estimate is $772 billion. Our ruling LoBiondo said "new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office conclude the final price-tag" for the health care law "will exceed $2 trillion — more than double what was initially reported." CBO recently projected the gross cost of insurance coverage provisions in the law at $1.762 trillion from 2012 to 2022. In 2010, the agency estimated the gross cost at $938 billion from 2010 to 2019. It’s misleading to compare those two figures since they represent different years. When comparing the years included in both estimates -- 2012 to 2019 -- it’s clear the cost did not double. It increased by 8.6 percent. And during the same time, the net cost of the law decreased. We rate this claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-09374	Marco Rubio controlled funds that "out of the $600,000 that were raised, only $4,000 went to candidates to try to improve their chances to be elected to office."	/florida/statements/2010/mar/29/charlie-crist/crist-attacks-rubio-campaign-contributions/	Down in the polls in his quest to become a U.S. senator from Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist wasted no time attacking primary opponent Marco Rubio in a nationally televised debate on FOX News Sunday. "I view public service as a calling, something that you do to try to help other people, to improve their lives, their quality of life," said Crist. "Unfortunately, recent news accounts in Florida have come out that indicate, in fact, that Speaker Rubio views public service as a way to enhance his personal enrichment." Crist said that Rubio had set up a $600,000 "slush fund" that he used for personal expenses rather than political purposes. "In fact, out of the $600,000 that were raised, only $4,000 went to candidates to try to improve their chances to be elected to office. That's not what people want. They want people who are not there to enrich themselves but who are there to enrich the lives of their fellow Floridians." Crist's statement is based on an investigation into Rubio's finances by the Miami Herald and St. Petersburg Times. Rubio, the former speaker of the Florida House, controlled two separate political committees, according to the report. In December 2002, Rubio created Floridians for Conservative Leadership, which raised $228,000 in donations. At the end of 2003, he created Floridians for Conservative Leadership in Government, which raised $386,000. Of those two committees, it's true that only $4,000 went to direct contributions to political candidates. Crist, meanwhile, conflates the two committees together to get to his $600,000 "slush fund." But there's an important distinction between the two: The purpose of the first fund was to "support state and local candidates who espouse conservative government policies." It was registered with the state of Florida and allowed to give contributions to political candidates. The $4,000 in direct campaign contributions came out of this fund of $228,000. The Herald/Times review of other legislators' committees showed that they typically contributed far more to other candidates and reported vastly fewer credit card payments. According to the Herald/Times report: "Rubio spent the biggest chunk of the committee's money, $89,000, on political consultants, $14,000 in reimbursements to himself, and more than $51,000 in credit card expenses. Records show those expenses were for food, lodging and airfare but do not detail who was traveling or where expenses were incurred." The second fund was to "educate the public about conservative leadership in government." It was a 527 fund, registered with the Internal Revenue Service, but not the state of Florida. Because it was not registered with the state, it was not allowed to donate money to political candidates, and indeed it did not. According to the Herald/Times report, most of the money, about $236,430, from this second fund went to pay for Republican poltiical consultants. Read more details about the expenses in the Herald/Times report. We contacted the Rubio campaign after the debate for a response to Crist's charges. Campaign spokesman Alberto Martinez reiterated that the committees' operations were entirely within the law, and that all the money was spent advancing conservative causes, even if it didn't go directly to other candidates. The second fund wasn't allowed to give contributions, anyway, he added. It was intended to help Rubio travel around the state to promote conservative ideas to the general public. Crist also said during the debate that of the $600,000, "it's been shown lately it's been used to fix his minivan, get haircuts, employ family members, things of this nature that are not what a political committee is supposed to do." But Crist here is mixing Rubio's two political groups with a separate issue: Rubio had access to a credit card for the Republican Party of Florida, and that's what he used to pay for the minivan and and hair bills. Rubio has said the minivan charge was for damage to his car that occurred at a political event, and the hair charges also included items for a silent auction event that he ended up paying for himself. Here, we're ruling on Crist's statement that "out of the $600,000 that were raised, only $4,000 went to candidates to try to improve their chances to be elected to office." He's right about the $4,000. But he arrives at the $600,000 number by conflating two separate funds, one of which was not permitted to give to candidate campaigns. So we rate Crist's statement Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-03-29T16:39:01	2010-03-28	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-08088	"We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute [to their pensions]."	/florida/statements/2010/dec/15/rick-scott/florida-government-workers-only-country-not-contri/	Gov.-elect Rick Scott is taking office next month with big plans to cut state spending. One idea Scott has suggested is to cut $1.4 billion in state pension costs by making government employees contribute to their own retirement. Scott brought up the issue during the campaign and again on Dec. 14, 2010, in a meeting with state legislators. "What do you all think about employees contributing to the pension plan?'' Scott asked legislators about ways to shrink state spending. "We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute'' to their pensions. Last year, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the state and local governments contributed nearly $3.4 billion to the retirement fund, the Florida Retirement System. Governments typically contribute between 9 and 10 percent of an employee's annual income toward retirement. Employees are required to contribute nothing. Is Florida the only state with a system like that? Not quite, according to a PolitiFact Florida review of the state retirement systems of all 50 states. But Scott isn't far off either. PolitiFact Florida individually researched the state retirement systems across the country, as well as consulted with Ron Snell, the director of state services for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Snell studies state pension and retirement systems. Most state retirement systems are based on a defined benefit plan -- a system where the state multiplies an employee's years of service by salary and by some percentage to arrive at a pension amount. To qualify, employees have to be vested into the system -- meaning they work for the state for a certain number of years, often five. They also must contribute some percentage of their pay to the overall pension fund. (In most states, individual contributions don't fund the retirement, but go into the overall pension fund.) A few states, however, have begun to adopt more private-sector-like 401(k) plans where the employee voluntarily contributes to a retirement fund and the employer either matches a portion of the contributions, or contributes on their own. And some states offer voluntary, optional 401(k) plans on top of a government pension. With state revenue sources drying up, states have been moving away from 100 percent employer-funded pensions to plans where employees are required to contribute. Missouri, for instance, will start making employees hired after Jan. 1, 2011, contribute 4 percent of their pay to their retirement plan, said Christine Rackers at the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System. Virginia lawmakers this year passed legislation requiring new employees to contribute 5 percent of their pay to their retirement. Current employees are operating under old rules where they do not have to contribute, though Virginia has discussed making them pay, too. Wisconsin also passed legislation making workers pay toward the pension fund -- though their contribution is as little as .2 percent. Where are governments still footing the entire bill? The largest chunk of state employees in Utah are not required to contribute to their retirement. But a small percentage do. In Tennessee, state employees and higher education employees are not asked to pay toward their retirement, said spokesman Blake Fontenay. But some local government employees and all K-12 teachers are required to contribute, Fontenay said. The state, back in 1981, discussed either having employees contribute toward their retirement or forgo a pay raise that year, Fontenay said. The government chose no raise. And in Michigan, employees aren't necessarily required to contribute to their retirement because they have a traditional 401(k) plan, said Kurt Weiss with the state's Department of Technology, Management and Budget. The state contributes the equivalent of 4 percent of an employee's salary into a 401(k) regardless of whether the employee contributes. The state will then match up to an additional 3 percent employee contribution. A few other states exempt certain, small classes of employees -- like public safety employees -- from having to contribute to their retirement. But in every case, the bulk of state employees are required to participate in the state retirement system through payroll deductions. Wisconsin government analysts crafted a good synopsis of the state retirement plans in 2009 as that state was pondering changes. Contribution requirements are listed on Page 22. A note: Our analysis isn't meant to say Florida's retirement plan is a better deal for state employees than employees in other state governments. It's entirely possible that other state employees receive better pensions than Florida workers, even after accounting for employee contributions. Our focus solely was on where employees are asked to contribute to their retirement. And as we previously pointed out, Florida has the lowest payroll expenditures per resident -- $38 -- in the country, according to the state Department of Management Services. The national average was $72 per resident. Which brings us back to Scott's statement. In a meeting with state legislators, Scott suggested the state might save money by requiring state employees to contribute to their own retirement. Specifically, he said, that Florida is "the only state in the country" where government workers are not required to help fund their retirement. Scott is largely on the mark. Florida will be the only state, starting Jan. 1, 2011, where no one in the state retirement system is asked to contribute toward their pension. Two states -- Virginia and Missouri -- recently switched their retirement system meaning new hires will have to pay toward their retirement, but not existing employees. Michigan doesn't force its employees to participate either, but that state has a more private-sector-like 401(k) program. And Tennessee and Utah still do not require many of their state employees to contribute toward retirement, although other employees in those states do. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-03137	"Things like … having Friday classes have been shown to be very effective on college campuses" in reducing drinking.	/oregon/statements/2013/sep/13/university-oregon/have-friday-classes-been-shown-extremely-effective/	Drinking seems to be a perennial issue for college campuses. With school starting up again, and alcohol-related tragedies in the news, Oregon Public Broadcasting’s "Think Out Loud" decided it was time to see how campuses were dealing with student drinking. In discussing the issue, one of the guests, Jennifer Summers, the director of Substance Abuse Prevention and Student Success at the University of Oregon, said increasing the number of Friday classes is one tactic that has helped reduce student drinking. Specifically she said, "Things like … having Friday classes have been shown to be very effective on college campuses." We understood the logic: We don’t get too loose unless we know we can bury our heads in bed the next morning. But was this really a tactic universities were using successfully? The nice people running the "Think Out Loud" Twitter feed pointed us to a study out of the University of Missouri. Its three authors surveyed 3,341 first-time undergraduates and found that there was a distinct relationship between the amount that students drank on a given Thursday evening and whether they had an early morning Friday class. Here’s the juiciest part: "Excessive drinking on Thursday, relative to other weekdays, was found and was moderated by Friday class schedule," the report said. "(M)odels indicated that students with no Friday classes drank approximately twice as much on Thursdays as students with early Friday classes." On average, a student with an early Friday class drank 1.24 drinks, while students without a Friday class drank 2.4 drinks. Obviously this brings up a few questions. Turns out that great minds really do think alike because the study’s authors answered most of them. First, we were curious whether there was some other factor that might determine if a student chose to take a Friday class -- and if that same factor might be the reason he or she would drink less. Here’s how the study’s authors put it: "Students who have early Friday classes may be representative of a different type of student than those who do not in terms of their general level of academic aptitude, academic major, academic persistence, or other student characteristics." They checked into it, though, and found that there was no pattern and that the "observed Friday class effect was more likely attributable to the actual timing of the class and that it was less likely attributable" to other factors. Second, we thought students might be increasing their drinking on another night. If you can’t drink Thursday, you might be extra excited to hit the bottle the next night. But the authors found that if catch-up drinking were present -- and they didn’t find much evidence it was -- it was fairly limited. We chatted with one of the authors of the study, University of Missouri psychology professor Phillip K. Wood, to clear up a few other bits and pieces. One important factor is that there appears to be a diminishing return based on the time Friday class is held. The effect "is largest for the 8 o'clock classes," Wood said. "You can go out and drink and still drag yourself to class by 10." His biggest caveat, however, was that while he was confident in the findings, a controlled experiment would be the only way to know with absolute certainty whether Friday classes were effective in reducing alcohol consumption. "At the end of the day what you really need to do is a controlled experiment," he said. The study was convincing, but we couldn’t help but wonder whether any universities had made changes based on this study’s findings. Digging deeper, PolitiFact Oregon found that the University of Iowa did. In 2007, following the findings of the study we’ve been discussing, folks at Iowa decided to increase the number of early Friday morning classes. To encourage professors and departments to teach the classes, the university offered $20 for each student in a class that was changed to include lectures or discussions on Friday. The student newspaper, The Daily Iowan, reported in March 2010 that the university's emergency-room doctor Michael Takacs found fewer students were showing up at the emergency room during Thursday evenings and early Friday mornings. Takacs guessed the Friday classes had something to do with the drop, but added "it’s hard to know for sure." We spoke with Tom Rocklin, the University of Iowa’s vice president for student life, to see if the university had documented any discernable declines in drinking. He said it’s not clear whether the Friday class increase itself "was successful because we did a number of other things at the same time which combined have led to reduced drinking among our students." Given the strong study but muddled practical applications, we thought it was time to call Summers, the substance abuse specialist from the University of Oregon. She noted that the Friday class solution was included in a list of recommendations by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Specifically, it’s included in a category of suggestions by the group that it says have "evidence of logical and theoretical promise, but require more comprehensive evaluation" or that "appear to be capable of reducing high-risk alcohol use." The University of Oregon itself hasn’t gone this direction yet, Summers said, but it’s something that’s come up as a possibility. "It's not something that you can just say, ‘Poof, let's go for it,’" she said. "Faculty play an active part in changing that." So let’s get back to our statement. Summers said that "things like …. having Friday classes have been shown to be very effective on college campuses." It’s true that one study showed there was a strong connection between Friday morning classes and how much students drank on Thursday. That said, the study was not controlled, it concerned only one campus and the effect was seen only with particularly early classes. Moreover, we weren’t able to find a clear application that showed significant reductions when more early Friday classes were offered. Most important, Summers acknowledges that the list she used as a source cited only "theoretical and logical promise." We think she overstepped here. Saying that Friday classes have been "shown to be very effective" is an exaggeration. We rate this statement Half True -- the statement is partially accurate but leaves out a number of details.

pomt-13327	Says she "voted for a statewide fracking ban."	/florida/statements/2016/oct/05/dana-young/dana-young-mailer-leaves-out-context-fracking-bill/	In an attempt to position herself as a more environmentally-friendly candidate, state Rep. Dana Young, R-Tampa, has sent mailers touting her vote for a recent bill targeting fracking. The effects of the legislation Young voted for are not as clear cut as the claim Young makes. A third-party group supporting Young, who is facing Democrat Bob Buesing for state Senate in the newly created District 18, sent the mailer in the last weeks of September that says she "voted for a statewide fracking ban to protect our water." The group, the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, paid for the mailpiece, but the mailer says that Young approved the message. So we are putting Young on the Truth-O-Meter. The mailer refers to Young’s vote on House Bill 191, legislation aimed at regulating fracking in Florida. We were curious about the Young’s statement and the specifics of the measure. As we looked further into the bill, we found the mailer is somewhat misleading. What Young voted for would have regulated fracking, but it wouldn’t have permanently banned it. A closer look at House Bill 191 HB 191, dubbed "Regulation of Oil and Gas Resources," was sponsored by Rep. Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, and passed 73 to 45 on Jan. 27 in the Florida House. Young voted in favor of this bill, along with 72 other Republicans, while 38 Democrats and 7 Republicans opposed the bill. Young reasoned that HB 191 could have been the first step to a permanent ban on fracking. However, the bill only called for a temporary moratorium on the process, not a "ban" like her mailer says. Democrats who voted against the bill echoed arguments of environmental groups and said a temporary ban doesn’t go far enough to protect Florida’s water. Had the bill passed (it was defeated in a Florida Senate committee), the measure would have allowed Florida to regulate fracking — a process that involves pumping large amounts of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to harness oil and gas reserves. Per the bill, fracking permits would not have been issued until a study was completed in 2017 by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The DEP would have proposed rules based on the study’s results, which would have been subject to approval of the Legislature. Point being, the bill was never intended to ban fracking permanently, but place a moratorium on the practice while its effects were studied. Democrats also took issue with the fact the bill would have prohibited Florida's counties and cities from passing local bans against fracking. According to the Miami Herald, 41 cities and 27 counties oppose fracking. St. Petersburg has passed a resolution against hydraulic fracturing, along with Broward County, which outlawed fracking in January. In addition, there were several amendments to HB191 offered up by Democrats that would have created more safeguards against fracking, including a restriction on what chemicals can be used and studies on prenatal health, but they didn’t pass. Young voted against some of these, but her spokesperson said those issues were unnecessary, trusting the DEP study would have addressed those concerns. Young’s office said she strongly opposes fracking in Florida and will continue to seek a statewide ban. Our ruling A mailer from Young says she "voted for a statewide ban on fracking." That vote is in reference to HB 191, which would have set up a temporary moratorium on fracking in anticipation of future regulations. The bill would have authorized a study on which to base further regulation. It was not an outright ban on fracking. Young’s claim is partially accurate but is missing context that would give the reader a different impression. For that reason, we rate Young’s statement Half True. Correction: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly reported who sent the mailer. The piece has been updated to reflect that it was sent by an outside committee with Young's approval. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ed07ec3c-17f2-456c-aded-b343caaff2b7	None	Dana Young	None	None	None	2016-10-05T17:03:32	2016-10-20	['None']
pomt-11491	"I'm the only candidate on this stage who has actually cut taxes."	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/28/joel-giambra/giambra-only-gop-candidate-ny-governor-whos-cut-ta/	Former Erie County Executive Joel Giambra says he’s the only Republican candidate for governor with experience cutting taxes. Giambra said that gives him an advantage over the other two Republicans running for governor: State Sen. John A. DeFrancisco and Joseph Holland, a former housing commissioner under Gov. George E. Pataki. "I'm the only candidate on this stage who has actually cut taxes," Giambra said at a debate among the three candidates. Giambra served as Erie County Executive from 2000 until the end of 2007. He is remembered partly for proposing two different budgets for 2005 with the county in fiscal distress. He most recently worked as a lobbyist. DeFrancisco has represented part of Central New York in the State Senate since 1993. He was named deputy majority leader in 2015, the second most powerful position in the chamber. Holland has not served in a role where he would be able to cut taxes. Is Giambra right? Is he the only candidate in the race who cut taxes? Giambra’s record Giambra’s spokesperson said he was talking about experience cutting taxes while serving in an executive position. Neither DeFrancisco or Holland has ever been elected as an executive. But Giambra did not specify that during the debate. Instead, he suggested he is the only candidate with experience reducing taxes. It’s true, Giambra cut taxes in Erie County. The county property tax levy when he entered office in 2000 was about $181 million. He reduced it to about $152 million in his first budget for 2001, a cut of 16 percent. Giambra kept the levy flat until 2005, when the fiscal crisis hit. Giambra proposed two budgets for that year to respond to a $108 million deficit. Both cut county services so the tax levy would remain flat. Giambra’s proposed "green budget" cut less in exchange for a higher sales tax rate. His "red budget" proposed more severe cuts in lieu of a sales tax increase. The county legislature ultimately approved the first option. The property tax levy only increased about 3 percent in 2005. But the county’s fiscal crisis was not over. Giambra agreed to raise property taxes more than $30 million in 2006, a 19 percent increase. The total levy that year was about $188 million, or about 3 percent higher than when Giambra took office. Giambra’s final two budgets for 2007 and 2008 increased the property tax levy by 6.3 percent and 5.9 percent respectively. The final tax levy he approved totaled about $211 million. DeFrancisco’s record DeFrancisco held two of the Senate’s top positions when lawmakers cut state income tax rates twice in the past eight years. He was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 2011, when lawmakers agreed to reduce state income tax rates. The committee crafts the Senate’s counter-proposal to the governor’s budget and has to approve any legislation with a fiscal impact before it goes to the floor for a vote. The lower rates were a trade-off for an extension of the state’s high tax rate on wealthy earners. DeFrancisco voted for the bill. He was deputy majority leader when lawmakers approved another set of income tax cuts in the 2016 state budget. The deputy majority leader controls what happens on the floor of the Senate. DeFrancisco voted to approve the cuts. The lower rates were first proposed by Republicans in the Senate earlier that year. They wanted to lower the tax rate for middle-income earners from 6.45 percent to 5.14 percent. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Assembly agreed to lower the rate to 5.5 percent instead. DeFrancisco voted for other tax cuts in that time as well, including a cut in the state’s corporate tax rate and an expansion of the estate tax. Our ruling Giambra said he is the only Republican gubernatorial candidate "who has actually cut taxes." It's true he's the only candidate in the race who has done that in an executive office. But he did not make that distinction in the debate. The two other candidates have not held an executive office. It's worth noting Giambra did not cut those Erie County property taxes alone. County lawmakers approved the budgets he proposed. He’s not the only candidate with experience cutting taxes. DeFrancisco was a leader in the Senate when the chamber voted to approve a handful of tax cuts since 2011. The tax cuts would not have happened without senators like him voting for them. Giambra’s statement is not accurate. We rate it False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joel Giambra	None	None	None	2018-02-28T16:46:58	2018-02-10	['None']
pomt-15035	Israel has seen a "90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks" that it attributes to building a 500-mile fence.	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/02/scott-walker/scott-walker-israel-says-its-wall-led-90-percent-r/	With Gov. Scott Walker out of the GOP presidential race, there’s likely to be little talk about the idea of a wall with Canada. But some of the remaining candidates are calling for a wall with Mexico aimed at securing that border from illegal immigrants. And several of them have cited an example from Israel to bolster their stance -- including Walker, when he was a candidate. He pointed to one statistic we wanted to check. During an Aug. 17, 2015 appearance on Glenn Beck’s radio show, Walker recalled his trip to the Middle East where he saw the barrier that had been constructed between Israel and the West Bank. "They’ve seen something like over a 90 percent reduction in terrorist acts in that country that they attribute to having an effective fence," Walker said. "If Israel can do it effectively, there’s no reason why America can’t." That’s a significant decrease. Is it accurate? A little background Israelis and Palestinians have a long history of conflict over rights to land in the Middle East. Our quick history will start in 1947, when the United Nations set out to create a Jewish and an Arab state, but only the Jewish state came into being. The state of Israel was founded on May 14, 1948. Almost immediately, Arab armies invaded the new Jewish state. The conflict ended with armistice agreements made between Israel and its neighboring Arab states, after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the region. Those who stayed became Israeli citizens. The rest became refugees and remain stateless. Periodic bouts of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continued, with arguments centered on control of land and borders. Violence and terrorist attacks ebbed and flowed along with the political tensions in the region. A major Palestinian uprising against Israel started in 2000 after failed peace talks and became known as the Second Intifada. The first Intifada took place in the late 1980s and early 90s. In 2003, Israel began construction on a barrier to separate Israelis and Palestinians and prevent terrorists from entering Israel. Behind the numbers When asked for backup, Walker’s team sent a report compiled by the Jewish Virtual Library and last updated in April 2015. It says, "since construction of the fence began, the number of attacks has declined by more than 90%." The Jewish Virtual Library is a project of the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, a nonprofit group with the goal of strengthening U.S. relations with Israel. Mitchell Bard, author of the report and executive director of the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, said the numbers for the report came from the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Here’s how the numbers shake out: Year Number of attacks 2002 135 2003 67 2004 45 2005 28 2006 48 2007 10 2008 30 2009 14 2010 7 2011 11 2012 9 The report used 2002, a year before construction began, as a baseline for comparison. But 2002 was at the height of a streak of violence in the region, the Second Intifada, so that helps shade the picture from the beginning. The data shows a wave of terrorist attacks in the region between 2001 and 2006. In 2001, there were 118 attacks, while in 2000 just 29 occurred, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. "The year itself is an anomaly," said James Gelvin, professor at University of California-Los Angeles and author of "Israel Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War." "It was an extraordinarily bloody affair and that was when the wall was under construction," Gelvin said. "Of course, after it ended attacks would go down anyway." There is another issue: The data is outdated, only going through 2012. The following year, 2013, there were 11 incidents. Bard noted that when data from 2013 is added it still amounts to a 90 percent drop. But in 2014 the number of attacks jumped to 62. By that measure, it is more like a 50 percent drop. So, the use of outdated numbers skews the end result. In addition, the wall was not built in isolation. Even Bard, the author of the Jewish Virtual Library analysis, said "the main thing" contributing to the decrease was not the wall itself, but the activity of Israeli security forces along the barrier. He said the dramatic decrease in attacks was "in part because of the fence," but also cited checkpoints and cooperation between military and security forces as important factors. In short, attributing this short-term downward trend in attacks to the barrier is taking a very narrow approach to a more complicated issue. Finally, the way Walker constructed the statement gives it an extra twist. He noted Israeli leaders attribute the drop in terrorist attacks to the wall. By implication, he seems to agree with them. We found many references to the success of the "anti-terrorist fence" on Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Most notably on a Frequently Asked Questions page about the conflict, the ministry says, "data reveals a clear correlation between the construction of the fence and a drop in the number of terrorist attacks." Our rating Walker said Israel has seen a "90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks" that it attributes to building a 500-mile fence. A report from the Jewish Virtual Library showed a 90 percent reduction in terrorism, and the Israeli government does cite the fence as the reason for the drop. But the data used is outdated and once more recent years are added, the drop since 2002 is more like 50 percent. What’s more experts say the barrier is but one reason for the decline. Walker’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition of Half True.

pomt-00060	"West Virginia added the highest percentage of new construction jobs in 2017 in the United States, at 14.4%. This amounted to 4,300 additional jobs! In fact, #WV was the only state with double-digit growth!"	/west-virginia/statements/2018/nov/02/west-virginia-republican-party/did-west-virginia-lead-way-construction-job-growth/	Did West Virginia lead the nation in the growth of construction jobs jobs in 2017? The West Virginia Republican Party says it did. On Sept. 14, the party tweeted, "Did you know West Virginia added the highest percentage of new construction jobs in 2017 in the United States, at 14.4%? This amounted to 4,300 additional jobs! In fact, #WV was the only state with double-digit growth! Read more about the #WVcomeback." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet linked to an article from the Wheeling News-Register citing those numbers. But we wanted to confirm this with original data. It turns out that the source of the 50-state comparison is a report by the Associated General Contractors of America, a trade association in the construction industry. The comparison is drawn from data collected from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here are the five states with the biggest percentage increases during 2017. State Increase in jobs Twelve-month percentage increase West Virginia 4,300 14.4 percent California 75,500 9.8 percent Nevada 7,800 9.7 percent New Mexico 4,300 9.7 percent Idaho 3,800 8.7 percent So the party’s tweet was accurate. We also took a longer-term look at construction employment in the state. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction employment in West Virginia bottomed out in the second half of 2016 and rose consistently through the first quarter of 2018 before stabilizing. Still, the current level of construction employment in West Virginia hasn’t returned to its nearly three-decade peak in the period before the onset of the Great Recession. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com It’s worth noting that construction jobs, while important for people within the industry and within adjacent industries, only account for about 4.5 percent of non-agricultural employment in the state -- about 34,000 construction jobs in August 2018 out of 752,000 nonfarm jobs in all. "Total job growth clearly matters more to West Virginia citizens than employment in just one not-so-big industry," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Still, as far as the tweet’s limited claim goes, it is accurate. Our ruling The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted that "West Virginia added the highest percentage of new construction jobs in 2017 in the United States, at 14.4%? This amounted to 4,300 additional jobs! In fact, #WV was the only state with double-digit growth!" A look at the original data shows that the No. 1 ranking, the percentage increase, and the raw increase in jobs are all correct. So is West Virginia’s distinction as the only state with double-digit growth in 2017. We rate the statement True.

pomt-01857	Children are crossing the border because President Barack Obama said "if you come, you’re going to be able to stay, because we’re not going to enforce the law."	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/13/rick-santorum/santorum-obama-said-if-illegal-immigrants-come-you/	As children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras continue to arrive at America’s border, the political finger-pointing has started. President Barack Obama said the problem could be dealt with if Congress approves his emergency funding request. Republicans charge that the president’s own policies have fueled the surge. As the panelists on NBC’s Meet the Press batted this back and forth, Kim Strassel of the Wall Street Journal noted an unusual feature of the latest trend. "People are not coming here to sneak over," Strassel said. "The kids are coming up here saying, ‘Take me in, too. Take me into detention.’ " Former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum laid that at the president’s feet. "That’s because we have a president who said, ‘Hey, if you come, you’re going to be able to stay, because we’re not going to enforce the law,’ " Santorum said. For the record, Obama did not say those words. This fact-check focuses on whether Obama expressed the view that people who come today would be allowed to stay. We tried to contact Santorum to clarify his meaning and did not hear back. Children from Central America are currently allowed to stay in the United States and receive a hearing before potentially being deported as part of a 2008 human trafficking law signed by President George W. Bush. But Republicans have tried to pinpoint blame on Obama, pointing to Obama’s directive aimed at young undocumented immigrants in August 2012. That move, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, did change the administration’s practices. The question is, does it apply to the kids showing up today? Immigration lawyer and Cornell Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr says it does not. "Among other things, the kid must have arrived before June 15, 2012," Yale-Loehr said. The deferred action details A few months before the 2012 election, Obama issued an executive order that allowed certain young people without legal immigration status to apply for a two-year deferral of any removal proceedings. That deferral could be extended, and anyone who was accepted would also gain the ability to work in this country. Generally speaking, it targeted people who had come across the border with their parents when they were little and had lived in the United States for many years. The move came after Republicans rejected a bill, the DREAM Act, that would have put these people on the path to citizenship. The Homeland Security Department summarized who qualified: You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday; You have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time; You were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; You entered without inspection before June 15, 2012, or your lawful immigration status expired as of June 15, 2012; You are currently in school, have graduated or obtained your certificate of completion from high school, have obtained your general educational development certification, or you are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; You have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat. As Yale-Loehr noted, no child arriving at the border today would meet those criteria. Santorum claimed that Obama said, "If you come, you’re going to be able to stay." That would not follow under Obama’s deferred action memo, nor his public statements about the situation. A related talking point is that this move from Obama triggered the influx. However, based on numbers from the Homeland Security Department, the rapid rise began in 2011, well before Obama announced his policy. That is not to say that the policy definitively played no role. In an open letter distributed in key Central American countries, Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson underscored that Obama’s memo did not apply to new arrivals. The fact Johnson had to write a letter suggested that Central Americans did draw hope from Obama's executive order. A broader interpretation of Obama’s policies It is possible that Santorum had other administration immigration policies in mind. David Martin, professor of law at the University of Virginia, said by 2011, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement established centralized priorities for removal proceeding actions. Priority is given to people with criminal records, recent border crossers, those who had come back after having been sent home before, and a few other groups. Martin said this is a good way to use limited resources but it could have a downside. "Undocumented people with an otherwise clean record who have been here for three or four years fall outside the priorities," Martin said. "If they know these details, they may feel somewhat reassured." That said, Martin thinks this is a charitable view of what Santorum was thinking. "That scenario is miles away from the current controversy," Martin said. In addition, there has been debate over how aggressively the administration has sent undocumented immigrants out of this country. By some measures, the government has expelled 2 million people, a much higher number than any other president, but some critics say the pace has fallen off. As Anna Law, professor of constitutional law at CUNY Brooklyn College wrote in a recent article in the Washington Post, the available deportation statistics are muddy. There are people who are caught inside this country and sent home and people who are stopped at the border and turned back. If you use both figures combined, Obama looks tough. But use the first and not the other, and he looks less aggressive. (To make matters worse, the official categories have changed over time, making it difficult to compare administrations.) Kevin Johnson, law professor and dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis, said at the end of the day, the numbers don’t support the argument that lax enforcement has anything to do with the latest problem. "(It) seems far-fetched," Johnson said. Our ruling Santorum said that Obama drew the influx of children at the border by saying, "If you come, you’re going to be able to stay." The closest thing we could find to support Santorum's point is an open letter by the Homeland Security secretary to Central Americans. That letter acknowledged there could be a connection between Obama's executive order and the influx of children from Central America -- even though the executive order would not apply to the children approaching the border today. Obama's deferred action policy applies only to people who had lived in the United States continuously since June 15, 2007. The targeted enforcement policies would provide no advantage to the children showing up at the border, and the administration has sent millions of people back to their home countries. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2014-07-13T17:05:26	2014-07-13	['None']

"Breaking: Sasha Obama just crashed her expensive new car into a lake," stated a headline on Defense USA Dec. 21. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no credible news reports of the former president’s daughter crashing her car. The article stated that former President Barack Obama bought Sasha the luxury car for Christmas. The fake news account cites an alleged story in the Washington Times Herald that said Sasha Obama called police after she drove into Lake Hope about 32 miles outside of Washington. (We found no such Lake Hope in the D.C. area; there is one in Ohio.) "Officers noted a ‘strong smell of marijuana’ in the crashed vehicle, but no drugs were found as the wreckage was searched," the phony article stated. The fake news article linked to the website of the Washington Times Herald, an actual newspaper in Washington, Ind. But that website, which focuses on local news in Indiana, had no such story about Sasha crashing her car. (There was also a newspaper called The Washington Times-Herald that covered the capital city, but that was sold to the Washington Post in 1954.)

pomt-08809	"Unemployment for those with college educations is now 4.5 percent. Unemployment for those with more than a college education, below 4 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/17/laura-tyson/laura-tyson-says-college-grads-have-just-45-percen/	On the Aug. 15, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Laura Tyson -- who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton -- broke down the nation's unemployment rates in a striking fashion. Tyson, who now teaches in the Haas School of Business at the University of California (Berkeley), highlighted the significantly lower unemployment rates of Americans with college diplomas and advanced degrees, in contrast to the overall rate. "We have to worry about the longer-run problem of this structural employment," Tyson said, "because I'm going to point out one thing for this discussion. ... Unemployment for those with college educations is now 4.5 percent. Unemployment for those with more than a college education, below 4 percent. We have a problem of education in this country, and we have to educate more of our young people fully through college education. Let's take this as an opportunity to do that." We wondered whether her numbers were right, given that the national unemployment rate for all workers in July was 9.5 percent -- more than twice as high as the figures Tyson mentioned. (Separately, PolitiFact Texas looked at a similar claim by President Barack Obama.) We looked at the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the national unemployment rate as well as unemployment rates for various subgroups. Those subgroups include Americans of four specific educational attainment levels. They are: less than a high school diploma; a high school diploma but no college; some college experience but no college diploma; and a college diploma. For those with less than a high school diploma, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 13.8 percent during July. For those with a high school diploma but no college, the rate was 10.1 percent. For those with some college experience but no college diploma, the rate was 8.3 percent. And for those with an undergraduate degree or better, the rate was 4.5 percent. That's less than one-third of the rate for high-school dropouts -- and it's exactly as Tyson said it was. What about the unemployment rate for those with more than a college education? Economists we spoke to said that BLS doesn't regularly publish that statistic, though it can be calculated by labor and employment experts from the raw data BLS releases. Tyson didn't return our inquiry, but we checked with BLS directly, and they gave us three relevant statistics for July -- the unemployment rate for those with masters' degrees; those with professional degrees, such as law degrees; and those with doctorates. These aren't exactly comparable, since BLS does not release seasonally adjusted figures for those with advanced degrees. But we'll provide them anyway. The unadjusted July rate for those with masters' degrees was 4.9 percent. For those with professional degrees, it was 2.0 percent, and for those with doctorates, it was 1.9 percent. We calculated the overall unemployment rate for all three categories using proper weighting and found that the rate was slightly above 4.0 percent. That's not "below 4 percent," as Tyson said it was, but it's very close. In addition, the June 2010 BLS unemployment rate for those with more than a college degree is 3.3 percent. If Tyson was intending to use those statistics (which, once again, are not seasonally adjusted), she'd be correct -- but those aren't the most current figures. So, Tyson was right about the unemployment rate for college graduates and at worst, she was close on the unemployment rate for those with more than a college education. On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Laura Tyson	None	None	None	2010-08-17T11:00:11	2010-08-15	['None']
pomt-07273	Says his barehanded catch posted on YouTube is real.	/florida/statements/2011/may/24/evan-longoria/rays-3b-evan-longorias-spectacular-barehanded-catc/	The video, if you haven't seen it, is amazing. Tampa Bay Rays third baseman Evan Longoria is talking to a television reporter along the first-base line. Their backs are facing the baseball diamond, and the two are standing about 125 feet from home plate -- where a fellow Ray is taking batting practice. The teammate sprays a line drive directly at them. Instinctively, Longoria wheels around his head and torso, extends his right arm and catches the ball barehanded. The television reporter gasps, Longoria shakes off the pain in his hand and tosses the ball back toward the pitcher's mound. "Keep it on the field," he says, nonchalantly. The :24-second clip was first posted on YouTube May 6, 2011 by MrSprts12 and has since been viewed more than 3.8 million times. The biggest question: Is the video real? Or is it fake? PolitiFact Florida decided to take a break from politics to put the now viral video -- and the Rays superstar third baseman -- to the Truth-O-Meter. At first glance, the catch seems improbable. And to baseball fans, maybe even impossible. But baseball players have made amazing barehanded grabs before. In 1989, then San Francisco Giants outfielder Kevin Mitchell snared a fly ball off the bat of St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith with his bare right hand. And in 2005, New York Mets third baseman David Wright dove over his shoulder to catch a pop fly barehanded. Mitchell and Wright were in the middle of games, we should note, and saw the ball coming. Longoria had almost no time to react. We know several details about the video's origins, as explained by Longoria himself to the St. Petersburg Times' Marc Topkin and the Tampa Tribune's Roger Mooney. Longoria said the clip was filmed near the end of spring training, after Longoria spent nearly six hours filming a commercial for Gillette. Longoria said the video was shot at McKechnie Field in Bradenton, the spring home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He claims it's authentic. The video -- "It's still real, by the way," he said -- was shot with a handheld camera in one take in about five minutes, after the Gillette commercial wrapped. "Unbelievable, huh?" Longoria, a spokesman for Gillette who has filmed other ads, said. "It's funny when you talk about things going viral; it really does once it gets on things like Twitter and YouTube. It goes from a small snowball to an avalanche quickly." Let's go back to the tape. Because there are several things that don't add up. In the video there are four Gillette logos visible -- two behind home plate and two on a roof facade over the third-base bleachers. But those logos aren't part of McKechnie Field in real life, Trevor Gooby, the Pirates' director of Florida operations, told a reporter for Patch.com. The logos were added digitally and included in the final video that was posted on YouTube. Next, there is the user who posted the video, MrSprts12. The user created his YouTube account May 4 and has only uploaded the Longoria video. The user lists his company as Gillette. Then there's the reporter and the video graphic identifying Longoria. There is no television station symbols or letters on the video, and the reporter is holding a microphone without a "flag" that identifies the station where the reporter works. Perhaps even stranger, we could not find the video posted on any news site. (Surely, a TV station would love to claim the video as theirs.) A strong circumstantial case that the video is doctored. But we wanted to keep looking. We asked Topkin -- who has covered baseball for the Times since 1987 -- what he thought of the video. From Detroit, where the Rays were playing the Detroit Tigers, Topkin said he believes it to be a well-crafted fake. Topkin noted several things that aren't typical during a batting practice session. There is no cage surrounding the batter to catch foul balls or stop pitches that aren't hit. There's also no screen protecting the batting practice pitcher. There are no coaches in the video hitting ground balls and no other fielders on the baseball diamond to track down any hits. And there's more. The batter, after hitting a ball right at Longoria and the reporter, isn't heard yelling for them to get out of the way. And though Longoria makes a miraculous catch, the batter returns immediately to his batting stance like nothing even happened. The cameraman doesn't warn the reporter or Longoria either. And there's the frame-by-frame analysis of the video. If you watch closely enough, the ball is falling toward the ground as it approaches Longoria and the reporter. But in the last frame -- right before Longoria catches the ball -- it appears to move upward again. "Simply put, once the ball has started into a downward trajectory, it cannot then again head upwards without an external﻿ force," wrote YouTube user meltingsmoke, one of several thousand people to comment or question on the video's authenticity. "That clearly happens just before the ball is 'caught.' (It's) not the same ball and (its) trajectory is all wrong." The Times has been asking readers online if they thought the catch was real or fake. The vast majority, though not all, say it's a hoax. With the evidence overwhelmingly suggesting the video is a fake, we asked Gillette spokesman Michael Norton if the company would put the mystery to rest. "The video was filmed while on location for a Gillette Fusion ProGlide commercial," Norton told us. "We'll leave the 'is it real?' debate up to the viewers." At PolitiFact, we're ready to make the judgment call for you. From computer-added Gillette signage, to the reaction of the cameraman and the batter, from the way major league teams conduct batting practice, to the video evidence, this viral YouTube video is a clever piece of advertising. And fiction. Longoria is a good sport -- and spokesman for Gillette -- for saying the catch is real. But we're not buying it. We say Pants on Fire!

pomt-15149	"I was one of the few, very few, who voted `no’ on the Iran deal."	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/31/dave-brat/brat-says-hes-among-very-few-who-voted-against-ira/	Again and again, U.S. Rep. Dave Brat places himself in the vanguard of congressmen opposed to the Iran nuclear deal. "I was one of the few, very few, who voted `no’ on the Iran deal," Brat, R-7th, said during an Aug. 10 breakfast with Henrico County business leaders. "On the Iran bill, you want to know one of the few people who voted `no’ on the deal?" Brat asked at speech that night at the University of Richmond. He answered by raising his hand. And during an Aug. 18 radio interview on "The John Frederick Show," Brat reiterated, "I was one of the few votes against the Iran deal because I believe the Senate has a constitutional duty on treaties." All of this caught our attention for a simple reason: The Iran deal hasn’t come up for a vote. So we took a deep dive into Brat’s statements. The deal, you’ll remember, was reached in July between Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States. Iran agreed to limit significantly its nuclear capabilities for more than a decade in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions that have crippled its economy. Supporters say the accord, while far from perfect, has safeguards that will prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in the near term. They say the U.S. needed to make concessions, because many of its allies have grown weary of continuing economic sanctions against the oil-rich nation. Opponents say the deal lacks long-term guarantees that Iran -- hostile to Israel and the U.S. -- won’t develop nukes. They say the U.S. should demand that Iran renounce any future nuclear arms ambitions in exchange for lifting sanctions. Brat has made these points repeatedly. But when did the congressman vote against the accord? Jack Minor, Brat’s communications director, told us the vote occurred June 14 on a bill that gave Congress the power to review and potentially reject the Iran deal. The House overwhelmingly passed the measure, 400-25, with Brat voting in the minority. A week earlier, the bill sailed through the Senate on a 98-1 vote. It’s important to note that the roll calls were not up-or-down votes on the deal and that the bill did not directly pertain to provisions in the accord. The measure set up a review process that would require Congress, if it’s of such a mind, to pass a resolution rejecting the accord. If one or both of the chambers can’t muster a majority vote against the agreement by Sept. 17, the deal takes effect. Brat voted against the review bill because, according to Minor, it would "grease the skids" for the deal. Let’s explain: President Barack Obama had a choice on how to designate the accord: either as a treaty or as an executive agreement. He opted for the latter, and Brat objects to that decision. An executive agreement is a political accord -- as opposed to a legal one -- between heads of states. Presidents of both parties increasingly have opted to enter into executive agreements because, unlike a treaty, they give Congress narrow -- if any -- sway. A treaty, which is a binding legal agreement, must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the 100-member Senate. That would be an impossible barrier for the Iran deal, given that 41 Republicans and two Democrats in the senate already have said they oppose the deal, according to an article on The Hill, a political website. Executive agreements are not binding; they can be reversed by the next president. The trade-off, for sitting presidents, is that they do not necessarily require congressional approval. In the case of the Iran deal, with emotions high on both sides, Obama agreed to give Congress a say through the procedures bill that Brat opposed. Under the legislation, as we’ve said, Congress could reject the Iran agreement with a majority vote in each chamber. But, as Brat and others note, Obama likely would veto such a resolution. His veto would be sustained if it’s backed by one-third of the members in either house -- a low hurdle given Democratic support for the accord. That’s a far smaller threshold than the two-thirds backing Obama would need in the Senate to pass a treaty. Brat opposed the procedures bill because he believes Obama has a constitutional obligation to submit the Iran deal as a treaty, according to Minor, the congressman’s spokesman. Brat has introduced a bill, with three cosponsors, that would require the deal to be considered as a treaty. The measure is sitting in the in the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Does Brat’s vote against the procedures make him one of "the few" to vote against the accord? We asked two political scientists who have studied the use of treaties and executive agreements to weigh in. Michael Ramsey at the University of San Diego said the claim is misleading, because if the procedures bill had failed, as Brat hoped, Obama would have been free to implement the Iran deal without consulting Congress. Even if Brat had carried the day, "that would have not stopped the deal," Ramsey said. Ramsey also said Brat’s statement inaccurately implies that legislators who voted for the procedures bill support the Iran deal. To the contrary, 197 House Republicans who backed the procedures bill have signed a resolution voicing disapproval of the Iran accord. All told, 219 Republicans -- including Brat -- have signed the resolution. That’s more than half of the House. Andrew Rudalevige at Bowdoin College said Brat cast a symbolic vote against the deal. But he also noted that if Congress had rejected the procedures bill, "they wouldn’t have given themselves the review and reporting requirements that were in the act, and that Obama agreed to, so you can argue they would have been worse off on the margins." Rudalevige added, "The real vote against the Iran deal will be when the resolution for disapproval comes up on the floor." Our ruling Brat says, "I was one of the few, very few, who voted `no’ on the Iran deal." But the Iran accord has not come up for a vote. What Brat voted against was a procedural bill that gave Congress the power to review and potentially reject the Iran accord. Brat objected that Obama negotiated the deal as an executive agreement instead of as a treaty, which would have been required to clear a higher level of congressional support. The congressman was in the minority on a 400-25 bipartisan vote to pass the procedures. Brat’s statement implies that those who backed the bill supported the Iran deal. To the contrary, had the bill failed, Obama could have enacted the Iran deal without input from Congress. Almost 200 Republicans who voted for the procedures that allow them to have a say subsequently have signed a resolution opposing the Iran accord. Clearly, Brat cast what he sees as a protest vote against the deal. But again, the real vote on the accord has not occurred and when it does, many in addition to Brat are poised to oppose it. We rate Brat’s statement False.	None	Dave Brat	None	None	None	2015-08-31T08:20:28	2015-08-10	['Iran']
pomt-08677	"We've got to find 2 billion gallons (of water per day) between now and 2025."	/florida/statements/2010/sep/10/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-sounds-alarm-looming-water-crisis/	Republican Agriculture Commissioner candidate Adam Putnam is sounding the alarm about a critical water shortage he says Florida will soon be facing. "The most important issue facing Florida long term is water -- whether you want to plant an orange grove, build a subdivision, save the Everglades ... it all boils down to water," Putnam, a congressman from Bartow in Polk County, said on Sept. 9, 2010, during an editorial board interview with the St. Petersburg Times. "We've got to find 2 billion -- find, create, make, obtain through conservation -- 2 billion gallons (of water) between now and 2025. Per day." Putnam told the editorial board members assembled that the state needs to invest in alternative water supplies like reclaimed water, and create incentives for developers to invest in alternative supplies as well. The state must also advocate for more conservation and efficiency measures, Putnam said, and continue to invest in desalination facilities -- which turn salt water into drinking water. He wrote a policy position paper on the state's water supply issues, which you can read here. In this fact check we're drilling down on Putnam's basic assumption, that Florida needs to somehow develop an additional 2 billion gallons of water per day in the next 15 years. We turned to the state Department of Environmental Protection, the agency tasked to increase the state's available water supplies, for an answer. Florida used an estimated 6.9 billion gallons of fresh water per day in 2005, the DEP said, citing the most recent U.S. Geological Survey report. By 2025, it is projected that the state will use 8.7 billion gallons a day. That's an increase of 1.8 billion gallon per day, or 27 percent. Close to what Putnam said. We should note that the projected is based on the assumption that the state's population will grow to almost 25 million by 2025. Currently, the state's population is estimated to be around 18.77 million. The projection also assumes that the government will be responsible for providing water for everyone in the state. Both those assumptions could, of course, change between now and 2025. "As Florida continues to grow, pressure is put on the water resources of the state and the need to ensure these resources are available for future generations becomes increasingly important," the state wrote in its 2010 Annual Report on Regional Water Supply Planning. "Floridians have always enjoyed a quality of life that is inextricably linked to the health of our water resources. Tourists come here to enjoy pristine beaches, swim in our freshwater springs, and experience unique fishing opportunities. Florida's water resources also support large agricultural industries. If Florida did not maintain its high quality natural systems, the effects would be felt throughout the entire economy." To be sure, the DEP and the state's five water management districts have been preparing for the uptick. The water management districts are required by law to develop and update regional water supply plans every five years. And they have already identified, developed or are developing projects to help close the gap. In 2005, the Legislature created the Water Protection and Sustainability Trust Fund and designated $100 million to be used to promote the development of alternative water supplies. The state set aside another $117 million over three years in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Legislature stopped funding the program in 2009, the DEP said. The investment, however, helped water management districts provide funding assistance for 327 water saving projects, which will help create approximately 761 million gallons a day of "new water" available for consumptive use. That's close to 40 percent of the water expected to be needed by 2025. Most of the projects focus on adding reclaimed water capacity or demineralizing brackish groundwater. The work already being done by the state and water management districts is an important caveat when considering Putnam's comments because he makes it sound like the state has to find 2 billion gallons of water a day by 2025. In reality, the state already has projects on the book that get the state a portion of the way there. Yet, Florida has a ways to go. Putnam is right, based on the latest estimates Florida will use about 2 billion more gallons of water a day in 2025 than the state did in 2005. But the state and the five state water management districts have started planning for it, and already have identified water construction projects that will help meet some of the increasing demand. We rate Putnam's statement Mostly True.	None	Adam Putnam	None	None	None	2010-09-10T14:14:17	2010-09-09	['None']
pomt-00568	The New York Times "had to retract" its story that Hillary Clinton’s email handling had broken certain laws.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/11/brad-woodhouse/dem-operative-woodhouse-says-nyt-retracted-charges/	Questions about Hillary Clinton’s handling of her email records during her time as secretary of state are likely to dog her throughout her presidential campaign. But the candidate will have many defenders, including Correct the Record, a super PAC created to support Clinton. Correct the Record president Brad Woodhouse, a long-time Democratic operative, dismissed the entire email matter during an interview recently on CNN. "Every federal employer has to consider what they archive as work-related and what they consider personal, and she did what every other federal official did, what every other previous secretaries of state did," Woodhouse told New Day co-hosts Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota on June 5, 2015. "Look, nobody has found -- you know, the New York Times wrote a story that some type of laws had been broken. Turns out they had to retract that. People had to back off that, and it's totally not true." In the news business, retractions don’t come lightly and we wondered if in fact, the newspaper of record had taken back part of what it reported on Clinton. In reality, the New York Times hasn’t retracted a word. The closest it came was in a column from public editor Margaret Sullivan, who wrote that the article that broke the story "was not without fault." But the lapse, Sullivan continued, was a failure to list exactly which regulations Clinton might have ignored. That lack of specificity, Sullivan wrote, allowed Clinton supporters to score political points. "Not because it highlighted a factual error — the story was accurate — but because it kicked up enough dust to obscure the facts." Sullivan, we should note, doesn’t speak for the newspaper. Her job is to serve as an internal but independent critic of the paper’s work, something akin to an inspector general in government. Formal retractions or corrections come from the editors themselves, and as we noted, that has not happened. Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for Correct the Record, said Woodhouse was not using the word retraction in an official sense. Rather, he was speaking of the gradual fade in New York Times coverage that insinuated that Clinton had broken some law. "Ultimately the charge was retracted, even if the New York Times never issued a correction," Watson said. "Their own experts changed their minds." Let’s unpack that. What the ‘New York Times’ said The newspaper broke the story under the headline "Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules." It’s opening lines were "Hillary Rodham Clinton exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state, State Department officials said, and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be retained as part of the agency’s record." So the top of the story suggested a possible violation, which falls short of charging outright that she broke a law, as Woodhouse said. But the article does lay the groundwork to add weight to the idea of a potential violation. "Under federal law, however, letters and emails written and received by federal officials, such as the secretary of state, are considered government records and are supposed to be retained so that congressional committees, historians and members of the news media can find them." And: "Regulations from the National Archives and Records Administration at the time required that any emails sent or received from personal accounts be preserved as part of the agency’s records. But Mrs. Clinton and her aides failed to do so." About week and half after the initial story, the New York Times wrote that the regulations on preserving emails were vague. "Although the White House has strict requirements dating back two decades that every email must be saved, there is no such requirement for federal agencies. Instead they are in charge of setting their own policies for determining which emails constitute government records worthy of preservation and which ones may be discarded." While, as the story noted, President Barack Obama signed a 2014 bill that required government officials who use personal email accounts to hand over those records in 20 days, that law took effect after Clinton left the State Department. According to Thomas Blanton, a government disclosure expert cited in the story, this gave Clinton "wiggle room." Blanton was also cited in the original article. However, it is not accurate to say he changed his mind from one week to the next. In the first New York Times story, Blanton said "it was a shame" that the emails from Clinton’s personal account had not been turned over automatically. The New York Times also cited in its first story Jason Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath, who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration. At the time, Baron said he could not think of another instance when a high-ranking official used a private email account for all government business. Baron described Clinton’s email scenario as a serious breach. However, Baron did not say the practice was illegal. In the weeks that followed, he consistently said it was a bad practice. Our ruling Woodhouse said that the New York Times retracted the charge that Clinton’s handling of her email broke a law. That's wrong on two points. The newspaper never accused Clinton of breaking a law. Also, while the newspaper’s public editor said the original story should have included more details, the paper never issued a retraction or a correction. A spokeswoman for Woodhouse’s organization agreed with that point. The claim is not accurate, and we rate it False.

pomt-10270	"Joe Biden brought Republicans and Democrats together to pass the 1994 crime bill, putting 100,000 cops on the streets and starting an eight-year drop in crime across the country."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/24/barack-obama/bidens-crime-bill-helped-some/	In citing the credentials of his newly announced vice presidential running mate, Sen. Barack Obama touted the crime-fighting record of Sen. Joe Biden. "Fifteen years ago, too many American communities were plagued by violence and insecurity," Obama said in a speech in Springfield, Ill., on Aug. 23. "So Joe Biden brought Republicans and Democrats together to pass the 1994 crime bill, putting 100,000 cops on the streets and starting an eight-year drop in crime across the country." Biden did, in fact, champion the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994 which sought – through the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) – to put 100,000 additional police officers on America's streets. And crime did in fact drop in ensuing years. But several independent analyses concluded the program resulted in far fewer than 100,000 new officers on the street; and that while crime did drop, there were other more significant reasons. The effect of the COPS program was modest. We at PolitiFact have looked at this before, back when Biden was a presidential candidate and he was making similar claims on his own behalf. In November, this was the statement on Biden's Web site: "In the 1990s, the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets. As a result, murder and violent crime rates went down eight years in a row." We ruled the statement False. The Justice Department claimed it reached the 100,000 new police officers milestone in May 1999, but the department's Office of Inspector General found that the actual number was closer to 60,000. A 2005 report by the Government Accountability Office estimated that from 1994 through 2001, COPS expenditures paid for about 88,000 additional officer-years. A study by the conservative Heritage Foundation was even less generous, concluding that if one factored in the historic rates of growth in the number of police officers before the COPS program began, the number of officers "on the beat in 1998 was just 6,231 to 39,617 higher than in 1993." But our bigger beef was with Biden's claim that crime rates dropped "as a result" of those extra officers. The GAO concluded that while the COPS program helped to reduce crime, the effect was modest. Between 1993 and 2000, the GAO report found that COPS' nearly $8-billion in funds contributed a 1.3 percent decline in the overall crime rate and a 2.5 percent decline in the violent crime rate from the 1993 levels. However, the report states, "Factors other than COPS funds accounted for the majority of the decline in crime during this period." Between 1993 and 2000, the overall crime rate declined by a total of 26 percent, and the violent crime rate fell a total of 32 percent. A peer-reviewed study published in the February 2007 issue of the journal Criminology found that "COPS spending had little to no effect on crime." Biden took issue with our ruling in a letter to the editor, printed in the St. Petersburg Times on Nov. 10, 2007. He stated that taking the GAO's findings on what the COPS program contributed to lower crime rates still meant that more than 425 murders, more than 2,300 forcible rapes, and more than 11,000 robberies per year were prevented because of COPS. Biden cited a March 2007 policy brief from the independent Brookings Institution which concluded "COPS appears to have contributed to the drop in crime observed in the 1990s." "Given that the costs of crime to American society are so large – perhaps as much as $2-trillion per year – even small percentage reductions in crime can reap very large benefits," the Brookings report found. "COPS appears to be one of the most cost-effective options available for fighting crime." And a 2002 study by researchers at the University of Nebraska and Southwest Texas State University found COPS had a major effect on cutting crime from 1994 through 2000, particularly in big cities. "These studies confirm the common sense intuition that if you have an intersection with four street corners, and you have cops on three of the four corners, a crime is more likely to be committed on the fourth," Biden said in his letter. Lastly, Biden said, "the COPS program was not the only innovation of the 1994 Crime Bill that contributed to falling crime rates. The principle innovation of the 1994 Crime Bill was its recognition that to effectively fight crime you need an approach that coordinates prevention, enforcement and rehabilitation. The Crime Bill's three-part strategy helped reduce crime in the 1990s in New York City and in cities nationwide. And it's the strategy we need to continue fighting crime in our country." We stand by our ruling, on the grounds that the 100,000 new officers claim is at best suspect, and because we believe that Biden assigned more credit for reducing the murder and violent crime rates than the program deserves. Independent reports – even ones that praise the program for reducing crime – only credit COPS for being a portion of the reason for the decline in violent crime (and only a modest portion, according to the GAO). Obama's language is a little more tempered than Biden's. While Obama parroted the dubious claim that the program resulted in 100,000 new officers on the street, Obama said only that the program "started" an eight-year drop in crime, which is a little different than saying it "resulted in" that drop. David Muhlhausen, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, notes that the beginning of the decline in violent crime actually started a bit before the funding for COPS kicked in. But stats show it's pretty close. We rate Obama's claim Half True.

pomt-09441	In the Senate version of the health reform bill, "Every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management enrolled plan, every enrollee has to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards reproductive rights, which includes abortion."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/10/bart-stupak/stupak-says-every-enrollee-office-personnel-manage/	With abortion as one of the biggest remaining stumbling blocks in the health care reform push, Rep. Bart Stupak has been in high demand on political talk shows. An antiabortion Democrat from Michigan, Stupak says he and at least 11 other House Democrats would vote against the Senate language on abortion, which he says would allow federal funding for abortions. His biggest issue is in the proposed government-created health exchange (for people who do not get their insurance through their employer), government subsidies could go to people who choose plans that cover abortions. But Stupak has repeatedly raised another point as well. "The bill that they're using as the vehicle is the Senate bill, and if you go to page 2,069 through page 2,078, you will find in there the federal government would directly subsidize abortions, plus every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management enrolled plan, every enrollee has to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards reproductive rights, which includes abortions," Stupak said in a Good Morning America interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on March 4, 2010. Stupak made similar statements in a Politico article on March 4 as well as in an interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews on March 3. The Senate language on abortion was written by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who is an abortion opponent. While the language Stupak penned for the House version would prohibit insurance companies in the exchange from offering abortion services, Nelson's plan would allow companies to offer abortion services. But Nelson sought to ensure those services would be paid through patient premiums, not federal subsidies. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill requires that all enrollees in plans that offer abortion services "without regard to the enrollee’s age, sex, or family status" pay a separate amount to cover the actuarial value of abortion services for the entire population covered by the plan. The insurer "may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee, per month." So that's where Stupak gets his $1 a month figure. This is not necessarily an add-on cost. Many health insurance experts quietly acknowledge what Slate's Timothy Noah referred to as the "gruesome reality" that it actually costs insurance companies less to pay for abortions than it does to pay for prenatal care and delivery. But the Senate bill specifically states that the actuarial estimate "may not take into account any cost reduction estimated to result from such services, including prenatal care, delivery, or postnatal care." So the set-aside for abortions is at least $1, regardless of whether it costs less than a dollar, or whether it actually saves insurance companies money. In other words, this $1 a month is not really over and above what someone would pay for their insurance otherwise. It's a mechanism to segregate a pot of money from insurance premiums (rather than federal subsidies) that would pay for abortions. But Stupak didn't say the $1 a month was an additional cost, only that it would go "towards" abortion services. And that's correct. But Stupak errs when he says that "every enrollee" would have to pay the $1 a month. That extra dollar would be separated out only for people who select a plan that offers abortion services. Someone could just as easily choose a plan that does not cover abortions. In fact, the Senate bill requires that "with respect to multi-State qualified health plans offered in an Exchange, there is at least one such plan that does not provide coverage of (abortion) services." In other words, if you don't want to participate in a health plan that offers abortion, and for which you'll have to pay into an account specifically for abortions, you don't have to. We further note that the Senate bill also says that a state "may elect to prohibit abortion coverage in qualified health plans offered through an Exchange in such State if such State enacts a law to provide for such prohibition." So it's not required for states to offer plans in the exchange that cover abortions; but if they do have plans that offer abortion, they must also offer plans that do not. Lara Cartwright-Smith of George Washington University's public health school explains: "The legislative language he's referring to is about how the government determines the value of abortion coverage for plans offered through the Exchange to ensure that federal money is not used to pay for that coverage," Cartwright-Smith said. "This section does not apply to people who are covered outside of the Exchange, such as through an employer’s health benefit plan. Everyone buying insurance through the Exchange will have the option to enroll in a plan that does not include abortion. Those people will not pay any amount for abortion coverage and no federal funds for that plan will have to be segregated. "If, and only if, an enrollee selects an insurance plan that includes abortion coverage, then the value of that abortion coverage must be calculated and that amount must be segregated from the value of the rest of the benefits of that plan, so that the enrollee can pay for the abortion coverage separately with their own private money. The calculated value of the abortion coverage must be at least $1. This process is to ensure that federal funds aren’t used to pay for abortion coverage. These rules only apply to plans in the Exchange that include abortion coverage, so people who select a plan that does not include abortion will not have to pay for abortion coverage even if other plans in the Exchange do offer it." It's also important to note, she said, that these rules are about abortions for which federal funding is not allowed, such as elective abortions. Abortions for which federal funding is allowed, such as in cases of rape, incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother, may be covered by any plan in the exchange. We called Stupak's office, and they provided a statement from the congressman essentially acknowledging that his statement only refers to people who opt for a plan that covers abortions. But he warned that many people will be unaware that a portion of their premium would be earmarked for abortion. Stupak is correct that people who select a plan that covers abortions would have at least $1 a month of their premiums set aside for a fund that would pay for abortions performed for people in that plan. And everyone in that plan, even men, would have to pay into that account. But Stupak misspoke when he said, repeatedly, that "every enrollee" would have to pay into an account that would pay for abortions. In fact, the issue doesn't apply at all to people who choose a plan that does not cover abortion. And every state must offer a plan that does not offer abortion. Furthermore, people would have to be told up front if the plan they are considering covers abortions. So when Stupak says that "every" person would need to set aside this abortion money, it's not only wrong, we think it stokes misplaced outrage on an already highly charged issue. We rule Stupak's statement False.	None	Bart Stupak	None	None	None	2010-03-10T19:01:30	2010-03-04	['None']
pomt-03867	"Governor Christie, his idea of jumpstarting the economy is to propose a trickle-down income tax cut last year and in his budget address this year, he stated his support for it again."	/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/10/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-chris-christie-still-supports/	When it comes to claims about tax cuts in New Jersey, gubernatorial candidate Barbara Buono just can’t catch a break. That’s because Buono, a Democrat and state senator from Middlesex County, keeps repeating a claim about Gov. Chris Christie that leaves out significant details and has accuracy issues. And she did it again Tuesday, during her first national television appearance on the MSNBC program "Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell." During a nearly five-minute segment, Buono talked about why she’s the best candidate to be New Jersey’s next governor, citing issues such as the state’s rate of unemployment, foreclosures, economic growth and taxes. "Governor Christie, his idea of jumpstarting the economy is to propose a trickle-down income tax cut last year and in his budget address this year, he stated his support for it again," Buono said during the segment. In a previous claim on this topic, Buono tied the Republican governor’s support of an income tax cut to it disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest New Jerseyans. The Truth-O-Meter ruled that claim Pants on Fire. First, some background on Christie’s tax cut proposal. In January 2012 Christie proposed cutting income tax rates by 10 percent across-the-board over three years. Under that proposal, higher-income taxpayers would have seen a greater decrease because they pay more in income taxes. But after Democrats cried foul, the governor backed off that plan and endorsed a proposal to cut income taxes only for New Jerseyans below a certain income level and based on their annual property tax bills. Christie unveiled that proposal in July. His tax-cut plan was based on a proposal made by one of Buono’s colleagues -- Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester). Under Christie’s revised proposal, homeowners with taxable income of $400,000 or less would receive an income tax credit based on their property tax bills. The credit would be phased in over four years and ultimately reach 10 percent of the first $10,000 in property taxes paid. The Legislature, however, was concerned whether the state could afford it and decided to delay any cut to see if Christie’s revenue projections would hit his target. The target wasn’t met and the tax cut wasn’t funded. Still, the governor’s office confirmed support for a bipartisan tax cut proposal in January, and again in February when Christie said during his budget speech that New Jerseyans are overtaxed and deserve a tax cut. "But, if you change your mind and concur with my conditional veto, my Administration will figure out how to pay for this long overdue tax relief," he told the Legislature. "If you do not, I am content to let the voters decide this in November." The key difference is that Gov. Christie supported a tax cut and Sweeney's plan called for tax credits. So that's not an endorsement, said David Turner, a spokesman for the Buono campaign. "In the end, you propose the tax cut you want," Turner said. "The Governor proposed his and just because there was a Democratic legislature there to stop him does not erase the original proposal. Moreover, he was doing radio commercials in a Republican State Committee radio spot despite saying that he supported the Sweeney plan. That does not qualify as an endorsement, despite the fact that he masquerades as that." Our ruling Buono said in a recent television interview, "Governor Christie, his idea of jumpstarting the economy is to propose a trickle-down income tax cut last year and in his budget address this year, he stated his support for it again." Christie did propose a tax cut in January 2012 but dropped that idea six months later to support one proposed by Democrats that would result in an income tax credit on property taxes. The plan never went anywhere, however, because Christie’s revenue projections didn’t meet their target and Democrats said the state couldn’t afford the cut. Accordingly, Buono is correct that Christie proposed a tax cut last year and also expressed support in his February budget address for a cut. But as she has done in a past fact check related to this claim, Buono leaves out that the governor dropped his original proposal in favor of a Democratic tax-cut plan that he has supported since July. That’s a critical fact that would give a different impression, and that meets our definition for Mostly False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

Home runs over the right-field wall would land in the Providence River. Details of the project are still emerging. On Tuesday, the new owners told The Providence Journal that they planned to build the stadium with their own money but were exploring various public-subsidy options, including asking the state to give them the land, which had been earmarked for a public park. One of the new owners, lawyer James J. Skeffington, was asked what such a public-partnership might look like in an interview Tuesday with reporter Gene Valicenti on WPRO-AM. "You know, there’s only 30 cities that have Triple A teams in the United States, in major league baseball. And virtually every one of them [is] playing in government owned ballparks," Skeffington said. He went on to say that such arrangements were a way for cities and towns to induce the owners of those Triple A teams to play there. We wondered if Skeffington was right about the number of publicly-owned ballparks. We reached out to Skeffington, who told us his information was based on a consultant’s report that he would provide to us. After we called Skeffington, we contacted each of the 30 Triple A teams to find out who owns their ballpark. We learned that only three were privately owned: Security Service Field, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox’s stadium; BB and T Ballpark, home of the Charlotte Knights; and Raley Field, the Sacramento River Cats’ ballpark. Skeffington identified four stadiums as being privately owned, but our research concluded that one of those ballparks -- Aces Ballpark in Reno, Nev. -- is, in fact, publically owned. That park has been owned by the City Redevelopment Agency of Reno since 2013, according to Eric Edelstein, president of the Reno Aces. We note that there is much debate over whether public support for professional sport teams, such as helping to build stadiums, is a wise use of public money. That is beyond the scope of this fact-check. Our ruling James Skeffington said that "virtually" all of the 30 Triple A teams play in government-owned ballparks. Our research found that 27 of the 30 stadiums those teams play in are owned by a city, county or other government entity, as seen in Reno. We note that the word virtually is not an absolute. Given that, we rate the claim as True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-02224	Says opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act is part of the Koch brothers’ agenda.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/18/gary-peters/gary-peters-says-koch-brothers-oppose-paycheck-fai/	Criticizing the Koch brothers and hitting Republicans for opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act are two key tenets of the Democratic midterm playbook. So when we found the Democrat in Michigan’s open Senate race combining those attacks against his Republican opponent, effectively killing two birds with one stone — er, press release — we thought it deserved another look. Here’s the backstory: Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., is a co-sponsor to the House version of the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that builds on the Equal Pay Act, in hopes of increasing pay transparency in the workplace. The Senate version of the bill failed to muster 60 votes needed to advance the legislation because it couldn’t garner support from Republicans. Peters’ Republican opponent in the Senate race, former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, has come out publicly against the legislation for what it requires businesses to disclose. Peters, in response, has twice issued press releases this week insinuating that opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act is part of the agenda of Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers spending heavily on campaign ads (including in Michigan) to help Republicans win the Senate. "Land has chosen yet again to stand with her out-of-state billionaire allies like the Koch brothers" in opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Peters campaign wrote in a press release titled "Land Doubles Down on Koch Agenda." We’ve caught Democrats in other states assigning positions to the Kochs with little evidence. For the purpose of this fact-check, we’re focusing on whether opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act is part of the Koch brothers’ agenda. What is the Paycheck Fairness Act? First off, it’s already illegal to discriminate against a worker based on sex. Proponents of the Paycheck Fairness Act say this would add teeth to existing law by making it easier for women to learn whether they’re being discriminated against. That’s accomplished by prohibiting companies from retaliating against employees for discussing their pay. Women would be able to discuss their salary with other employees at the workplace without worrying about violating a company policy. In explaining Land’s opposition to the legislation, a spokeswoman said this provision would require businesses to disclose the pay of any employee to any worker who asks. But the bill specifically does not apply to an "employee who has access to the wage information of other employees as a part of such employee’s essential job functions." The bill also makes clear that if an employer is citing a factor other than the employee's sex for a disparity in wages between workers, it must be related to education, training, experience or other job-related reasons. Another key, and controversial, component of the bill would require the federal government to collect pay information from employers by sex, race and national origin of the employees. This information would be used to identify pay disparities within industries and potential discrimination. Land’s staff said this information could be easily made public through a FOIA request or if the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission publishes it online, essentially creating a searchable database of salaries. However, that is an unlikely scenario, as the law instructs the commission to consider "appropriate protections for maintaining data confidentiality." It’s also worth noting that employers with more than 100 workers are already required annually to fill out a form called the EEO1 with information on the race and sex of their employees. While it is sometimes used in academic research, names of employees are not included and the company names are usually protected. Finally, in addition to education and awareness measures, the bill also allows employees who have been discriminated against to receive punitive or compensatory damages in a civil suit. The Koch connection We asked Peters’ campaign for evidence that the Kochs oppose the Paycheck Fairness Act. They pointed us to the Center for Effective Government, a nonpartisan watchdog of money in politics. In addition to tracking campaign finance, the organization also keeps tabs on who is lobbying the government. Companies, and firms hired to lobby on behalf of companies and groups, must disclose the issues they’re meeting with Congress about. In 2009, Flint Hills Resources, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, spent $960,000 lobbying Congress on a wide range of issues, from energy to taxes. Listed among the bills Flint Hills Resources lobbied are a previous incarnation of the Paycheck Fairness Act and what would become known as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which passed both chambers of Congress and was eventually signed by President Barack Obama into law. Similarly, in 2010, Koch Industries hired the firm of Siff and Lake for $50,000 to lobby Congress on a handful of bills. According to a lobbying report, one of the bills was "S. 182, the Paycheck Fairness Act," a bill very similar to the current Senate bill. Specifically, Koch Industries wanted to discuss how the bill would change the way employers justify wage disparities. The reports don’t specify whether someone is for or against the legislation. A spokeswoman for Koch Industries did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But their past positions opposing government regulation makes us confident they were against the legislation. If they want to get back to us to dispute this, we’re all ears. Disclosure reports filed since have not indicated Koch Industries has lobbied on this issue, so 2010 was the company’s last public foray into the debate. Reports covering 2013 and the first three months of 2014 have not indicated Koch entities have focused on any of the Paycheck Fairness Act bills that have circulated Congress since last year (though they have until April 21 to finalize reports for Jan. 1 to March 31). Since the recently debated Senate bill was not introduced until April 1, it may take until July to learn if Koch Industries made a last-minute push against the legislation. While opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act may have been part of their agenda during earlier debates on equal pay, we don't know (and neither does Peters) if they weighed in on the bill now before Congress. Peters’ staff also highlighted a post about the Koch brothers by Think Progress, a site affiliated with the Center for American Progress that provides liberal opinion and analysis. The piece notes how several conservative and libertarian leaning organizations with Koch financing are critical of congressional action on equal pay issues. Most of the donations are relatively small compared with the overall funding of the highlighted groups. And not all of the people quoted by Think Progress were speaking directly on the Paycheck Fairness Act, but rather the general notion of a wage gap. One group, though, Concerned Women for America, did receive a significant portion of their funding from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a group funded by the Koch brothers that primarily distributes checks. Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee received $8.15 million of the $8.7 million they raised in 2011 from the Koch-affiliated group, according to IRS filings. In 2010, the group raised less than a million dollars and just $2 million in 2012, the last records on file. In a fact-sheet opposing the bill, Concerned Women for America called the Paycheck Fairness Act a "a one-size-fits-all policy" that "discourages flexible working arrangements" and "sidetracks businesses from their primary mission, which could lead to fewer job opportunities." Americans for Prosperity, a group more directly tied to the Koch brothers that has aired ads in Michigan against Peters, has not weighed in on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a spokesman told PolitiFact. Disclosure reports released later this year may reveal more information. But that's not information Peters was privvy to when he made his claim. Our ruling Peters’ campaign claimed opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act was part of the Koch agenda. Federal disclosure forms show businesses owned by the Koch brothers lobbied on similar legislation in 2009 and 2010. And a Koch-connected group gave significant funding in 2011 to Concerned Women for America, a group that has opposed the current legislation. But it does not appear Koch Industries has lobbied on equal pay issues since 2010, including the most recent legislation. Their most vocal organization, Americans for Prosperity, hasn’t entered the debate, either. In making the claim, the Peters campaign was relying on evidence from several years ago. Even if disclosure reports filed in the near future reveal that Koch entities lobbied on the issue more recently, Peters linked the Koch brothers to the legislation without knowing their involvement. Weighing all of that, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Gary Peters	None	None	None	2014-04-18T11:59:31	2014-04-14	['None']
pomt-15105	Says Donald Trump’s polling numbers show that he’s "the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been."	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/15/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-donald-trump-highest-hispanics-an/	All that talk about how unpopular Donald Trump is with Hispanics? In Michele Bachmann’s view, the opposite is true: Trump is polling at epic levels among Hispanic voters. Bachmann, whose life after the U.S. House has included stints as a conservative cable news pundit, said on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon on Sept. 10 that Trump is remarkably popular with minorities compared to the rest of the Republican field, even as he floats mass deportations, ending birthright citizenship and building a border wall as his first orders of business. "Donald Trump's numbers show that he's the highest with African-Americans that any Republican has ever been, and the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been," Bachmann said. Like, ever ever? Given that Trump himself has said he’s polling No. 1 with Hispanics, PunditFact wanted to know if Bachmann is correct. What the polls say A spokesperson for Bachmann did not return our messages asking how she knows Trump’s numbers are "the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been." A survey of summer headlines indicates she is wrong Wall Street Journal: "Hispanics hold dim view of Donald Trump, poll finds" CNN: "Poll: 82 percent of Hispanics view Donald Trump unfavorably" Politico: "Poll: Trump’s popularity increasing, but not with Hispanics" Gallup: "Hispanics Frown on Trump, but Not Rest of GOP Field." Without a doubt, more Hispanics have made up their minds about Trump than the other candidates. But not in the way Bachmann said. As the Gallup poll shows below, the broader Hispanic view of Trump is strongly negative. Trump’s net favorable rating, according to Gallup, ranks last of all candidates at -51 percent (65 percent unfavorable, 14 percent favorable). The next-lowest candidates are from Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz and former Gov. Rick Perry (who’s out of the race), tied at net -7 percent. Florida natives Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio top the tracking poll, with Gallup noting Bush’s favorability jumped as Trump’s fell this summer, undermining the theory that Trump is hurting the other candidates in the race with Hispanics. Gallup’s survey is based on interviews with about 650 Hispanics from July 8 to Aug. 23 with a margin of error of 5 percentage points. It’s no outlier. A Univision Noticias poll also shows Trump lacking the most support among Hispanics. Polling by The Economist/YouGov drives home the point. In a survey of more than 230 Hispanic adults, 62 percent said they had a very unfavorable view of Trump, compared to 43 percent of 2,000 voters of all backgrounds who felt the same way. Again, all of the other candidates were viewed more favorably. The Economist/YouGov poll was based on 2,000 interviews conducted Aug. 28-Sept. 1 via an opt-in Internet panel, with a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points. Problems with data Hispanics are not a monolithic voting bloc but a growing share of the population with roots in Spanish-speaking countries. However, most Hispanic registered voters lean toward the Democratic Party, with the Republican share accounting for about 25 percent, said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic polling at the Pew Research Center. The more relevant figure to this discussion is how Republican Hispanic registered voters feel about Trump compared to other candidates, Lopez said, since it is their vote that will influence the GOP state primaries. The problem with that is Republican Hispanic voters have not been queried as much as the broader electorate this early in the election cycle. Doing this well requires hiring Spanish speakers for interviews, randomly surveying households and asking respondents if they consider themselves Hispanic or Latino, and then making sure at least half of the respondents are reached by cell phone, Lopez said, reflecting Hispanic household trends. Some pollsters try to get at this through micro-sampling their larger pool of poll respondents, but the results are often meaningless because the sample is so small. The Economist/YouGov poll, for example, asked voters who identify as Republican to choose their preferred GOP nominee. Broken down by race/ethnicity, 28 percent of GOP-leaning Hispanic voters chose Trump, followed by "no preference" at 18 percent, and Bush at 15 percent. Here’s the problem with running away with those results and proclaiming Trump the favorite: Just 34 Hispanic adults answered the question. Put another way, that means 10 people chose Trump, six said they had no preference, and five chose Bush. No self-respecting statistician would say this tiny sample reflects the sentiment of all registered Hispanic Republicans. Also, the higher support for Trump makes sense, since he also posts higher name recognition than the other candidates. Only 9 percent of the larger pool of Hispanic voters said they did not know how they felt about Trump, compared to 22 percent for Bush and 24 percent for Rubio. The numbers were much higher for the rest of the field. A state poll? A Google search shows where Bachmann might be going with her erroneous claim. Some blogs crowed about a poll by Gravis Marketing for the conservative One America News Network that found "Trump leads Nevada poll with overwhelming Hispanic support." The Hispanic population is small in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the first three states to hold presidential caucuses or primaries next year, but that’s not true for Nevada, which goes fourth. About 31 percent of Hispanic respondents said they would vote for Trump in a Republican primary, followed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 11.4 percent, according to OAN. While this might sound good for Trump (and Bachmann), they shouldn’t read too much into the poll’s declarations. As CBS News pointed out when Trump made reference to this poll, the OAN poll is based on robocalling, which means a computer talked with respondents. This method is not as reliable, and it’s more problematic for reaching Hispanic residents — half of whom rely only on cell phones (higher than for African-Americans and whites). Robocalls to cell phone numbers are not permitted by federal regulators. It’s also not clear if the poll included a Spanish-speaking component, Lopez said. One last red flag: The poll’s details do not show how many Hispanics were asked the question from the sample of 620 registered Republicans. So we don’t know how many Hispanic Republican voters chose Trump. (Remember how much a handful of responses from Hispanic adults made Hispanic support for Trump appear in the YouGov poll?) That said, Lopez said the Hispanic Republican registered voter results seem to align with the view of Republicans overall in that poll, "and I doubt the 31.4 percent for Hispanics is statistically different from the 27.7 percent of all Republican registered voters" in Nevada who said they would vote for Trump. Our ruling Bachmann said Trump’s polling numbers show that he’s "the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been." We didn’t even have to crack open the history books of all Hispanic support for all Republicans ever to disprove her claim. Trump sits — and in many cases, firmly — at the bottom of favorability polls among Hispanics compared to the other GOP candidates. We rate the claim False.

pomt-10186	"Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' The Second Amendment….Ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/23/national-rifle-association/fuzzy-stand-in-96-does-not-amount-to-a-plan/	In a hard-hitting direct-mail piece to its members, the National Rifle Association detailed an alleged plan by Sen. Barack Obama to transform gun-ownership regulations. Obama's "plan" appeared on a section of the mailer designed to be cut out and carried around in a wallet. The front of the wallet card said, "Barack Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendment." The reverse listed the 10 parts of the alleged plan, including: "3) Ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns." We examined item No. 1 here , and found it to be Pants on Fire wrong. Some of the other items sound just as dubious, such as: "4) Close down 90 percent of the gun shops in America." And "6) Increase federal taxes on guns and ammunition by 500 percent." But let's stick to No. 3 for now. An NRA spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the direct mail piece, which first appeared in early August 2008. She would not delve into the details of how the organization supported its charges, but we're pretty sure we know where the NRA is coming from on this one. In 1996, as a candidate for the Illinois state Senate, Obama filled out a questionnaire for a community group called Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization. It asked if the candidate supported state legislation to “ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.” Obama’s answer: “Yes.” The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who “unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position” on gun control and other issues, even though Obama's writing was on another part of the questionnaire. (Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama’s campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, “He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn’t change the fact that some answers didn’t reflect his views.”) But let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Obama approved of what was on the questionnaire. There are still serious problems with using that to justify a claim that Obama has a plan to "ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns." For one thing, the question was about a state law. The NRA claims without qualification that Obama wants to ban handguns, implying that he intends to do so on a national level. Obama says frequently that gun regulation should be tailored to different geographical areas. For another thing, Obama's answer on the questionnaire was a long time ago. On a more recent questionnaire, he said, "A complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable," but reasonable restrictions should be imposed, according to the Associated Press . At the Democratic presidential debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said: "I have never favored an all-out ban on handguns." His vote in 2004, for a bill that authorized the Illinois State Police to issue concealed weapon permits to retired police officers and military police officers, supports that claim. Furthermore, as a state legislator and U.S. senator, Obama has had plenty of opportunity to propose a ban on handguns, and has never done so. Obama's alleged endorsement of a proposed state law in 1996 does not add up to a plan to ban handguns, particularly in light of evidence to the contrary that has accumulated since then. We find the NRA's claim to be False.	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2008-09-23T00:00:00	2008-08-01	['None']
pomt-05288	Says Williamson County Attorney Jana Duty "has never prosecuted a single adult felony case."	/texas/statements/2012/may/24/john-bradley/williamson-county-da-john-bradley-says-challenger-/	In the heated contest over the Republican nomination to be Williamson County’s district attorney, incumbent John Bradley has repeatedly said challenger Jana Duty, the elected county attorney, doesn’t have enough experience to do his job. In an op-ed article published on the Austin American-Statesman’s website May 14, 2012, for instance, Bradley talked up his résumé and then said: "Duty has never prosecuted a single adult felony case." Not one? Before detailing our fact-check, we think it’s important to note that we’re not tackling what kind of experience a district attorney should have and whether Duty has it — that’s open to debate. We were curious whether Bradley was correct that Duty had never prosecuted an adult felony case. On its face, such a charge illuminates a basic difference between the jobs of the district attorney and county attorney in Williamson County. Criminal prosecution of adults is split between them, with the district attorney’s office handling felony cases and the county attorney’s office handling misdemeanors. So since Duty became county attorney in 2005, adult felonies have not fallen under her purview, which means she could not have personally prosecuted them. In a write-up he emailed to us, Bradley says previous experience with adult felony cases is key because "no person can credibly or successfully lead an office without any experience or understanding of the job being done in that office." Via email, Bradley also told us that the district attorney sets office-wide policy on punishment recommendations in plea agreements. "As misdemeanor cases only involve a maximum of one year in jail and felony cases involve punishment of up to life in prison or death, felony experience is absolutely necessary," he said. As for Bradley’s experience, the write-up says he has been a prosecutor since 1987, starting out in the Harris County district attorney’s office. He joined the Williamson County district attorney’s office two years later. In 2001, Gov. Rick Perry appointed Bradley to lead the office, according to the county’s website, and he first won election in 2002. Bradley told us that he continues to personally handle some cases but that the majority are handled by assistant prosecutors. He said that on a daily basis, he discusses cases with prosecutors in his office, advises them and sets policy. To support his statement about Duty’s experience, Bradley first pointed us to a television news report in which he said Duty admitted his claim was correct. In the March 23, 2012, story by the Austin area’s YNN television channel, Bradley, in an interview, said: "I have over 20 years of experience; Jana Duty has never prosecuted a single adult felony case. And that’s the work that the DA does." Next, the YNN reporter, Alana Rocha, said: "She admits that’s true, but that her office has tried many such cases." Many adult felony cases? We found that statement confusing, so we sought clarity from the reporter. Rocha told us that Duty had admitted to her that Bradley’s claim is correct. Rocha also said that after we inquired, she checked with Duty afresh and Duty clarified that her office prosecutes juvenile felonies. In Williamson County, the county attorney’s office is responsible for juvenile cases. As further support for his statement, Bradley pointed us to a February 2012 candidate forum in Cedar Park, where, he said, Duty neither questioned the truthfulness of his claim nor offered examples of adult felony prosecution experience. According to a video of the forum on the website of the Central Texas 9-12 Project, Bradley raised the issue of experience in his closing statement, although he made a narrower claim there than in his op-ed piece, charging that Duty has never tried — as opposed to the broader idea of "prosecuted" — an adult felony case. That’s an important distinction because most felony cases are resolved through plea bargains, not trials. Bradley told us that more than 95 percent of the cases in his office end in such agreements. At the forum, Bradley said: "How can you have a district attorney run an office, decide the death penalty for people, if you’ve never stood in court in a felony case and tried an adult? And the fact is Ms. Duty" has not done so. Duty responded during her final statement that she is "also a career prosecutor" and that she has experience "trying many, many cases," pointing to work she has done in Bexar and Williamson counties. She said she has tried 30 to 40 jury trials and has handled family violence and Child Protective Services cases, including those that result in the termination of someone’s parental rights. "And again let me remind you that in a parental termination case, you are taking children away from their parents forever, and that is just as serious as putting somebody in prison," Duty said. Duty did not respond to our requests to discuss her professional experience. However, according to an Oct. 7, 2004, Austin American-Statesman news article and her campaign website, she had previously served two stints as a prosecutor: as an assistant district attorney in Bexar County after she passed the Texas bar exam in 1997, and as an assistant Williamson County attorney from 1999 to 2001. Her campaign website says Duty’s earlier work at the Williamson county attorney’s office came in the "Child Protective Services and Protective Order section" and then in the criminal division. According to legal experts we contacted, Child Protective Services cases generally involve allegations of abuse or neglect against a child’s parent or guardian and are civil, not criminal, cases. The website of the Williamson county attorney’s office says pursuing protective orders for qualified applicants is one way that the county attorney "aids in the prevention of domestic violence." A protective order is "a civil court order issued against a person who has committed family violence," the site says. Such orders can, for example, require that an abusive husband have no contact with his wife for a certain period of time. Either way, adult felony cases are not handled in the Williamson county attorney’s office. But did Duty handle such cases while working for the Bexar County district attorney, which prosecutes felonies and misdemeanors? That’s at least unclear. In her campaign bio, Duty says that in Bexar County, she "worked as the Protective Order Attorney and then as a family violence prosecutor in the family violence court." We sought information from the Bexar County district attorney’s office about the cases she handled there, but officials declined to comment. Brian Fischer, a Houston criminal defense attorney, told us that generally, prosecutions of family violence cases can involve misdemeanors or felonies. In an email, Duty replied to our inquiry about Bradley’s claim without speaking directly to its accuracy. She wrote: "My office prosecutes juvenile felony crimes and adult misdemeanor crimes (and a lot of other stuff). The Texas Rules of Evidence, the Texas Rules of Procedure (and) the elements of a felony are exactly the same for an adult case as they are in a juvenile case. In my 15 years as a lawyer, I have tried hundreds of adult misdemeanor, juvenile misdemeanor and felony crimes, Child Protective Services cases, and Protective Orders. I would venture to say that I have just as much trial experience as Mr. Bradley." Finally, we explored Duty’s intimation that there are similarities between the prosecution of adult felonies and juvenile felonies by consulting Texas legal experts, including Fischer, who specializes in juvenile law; two law professors; and a juvenile defense lawyer who prosecuted both adult and felony cases over nearly three decades in the Harris County district attorney’s office. The experts did not agree on the degree of similarities or differences between prosecuting adult and juvenile felonies. However, they all noted that juveniles can be charged with the same felony crimes as adults and that prosecutors are held to the same burden of proof in juvenile felony trials as in adult ones; they must prove "beyond a reasonable doubt" that the accused has committed the crime. Also, they agreed, the rules of evidence and the elements of the crime are the same in juvenile and adult cases. The issue of procedure is more complicated. The experts told us that juvenile courts operate under a sort of hybrid system, in which rules of civil procedure govern many aspects of a juvenile felony case while others are governed by rules of criminal procedure, as adult cases are. Other distinctions: The maximum sentence a juvenile can receive is 40 years, while adults face sentences up to life in prison or even death. Duty did not respond to our questions about how many juvenile felony trials she had prosecuted. According to data from the state Office of Court Administration, there were 205 new juvenile felony cases filed in the county’s juvenile court from Sept. 1, 2010, through April 30, 2012. During that time, 142 juvenile felony cases were resolved through pleas of "true" — the equivalent of pleading guilty in adult court. Also, 31 felony cases were dismissed. There was one trial, of a misdemeanor case, according to the data. Our ruling Duty points out that her office prosecutes adult misdemeanors and juvenile felonies, though it appears that none made it to trial in recent years. Hers may be a reasonable point. Still, Bradley specified that Duty had not conducted adult felony prosecutions. This published claim rates Mostly True.	None	John Bradley	None	None	None	2012-05-24T09:00:00	2012-05-14	['None']
pomt-00213	"Nate McMurray lobbied to send our jobs to China. (And Korea, too.)"	/new-york/statements/2018/oct/12/chris-collins/collins-tries-use-mcmurrays-work-asia-against-him/	Rep. Chris Collins, running for re-election to Congress in New York's 27th District in Western New York, is rolling out attack ads criticizing challenger Nathan McMurray's work in Asia. One side of a Collins mailer states: "Nate McMurray lobbied to send our jobs to China. (And Korea too.) The other side states: "Nate McMurray: American job exporter. Nate McMurray spent many years in Asia working to identify cheap labor and offshoring opportunities for American companies. He lobbied for trade deals that outsourced thousands of U.S. jobs to China and Korea - doubling our trade deficit and devastating American businesses." We decided to fact-check the Republican's claim that McMurray, a Democrat, "lobbied to send our jobs to China. (And Korea, too.)" The citations The mailer, paid for by the Collins campaign, lists three sources for the claims it makes, though it does not have a source for the claim we focus on here. The first source, a Buffalo News story, mentions McMurray’s time working abroad, but it does not say he was "working to identify cheap labor and offshoring opportunities for American companies," as the mailer states. The News story mentions McMurray’s time in Asia, studying law in Seoul, South Korea, on a Fulbright scholarship, and working as legal counsel for Samsung. To bolster Collins’ claim that McMurray "lobbied for trade deals that outsourced thousands of U.S. jobs to China and Korea," Collins cites a journal article published by the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, co-written by McMurray. The article is about how foreign companies can navigate Korea’s "restrictive employment agreements." There is no reference to any lobbying efforts in favor of trade deals by McMurray. The mailer’s final citation, from the New York Times, purportedly bolsters the mailer’s claim that the trade deals that McMurray "lobbied for" doubled the trade deficit and devastated American businesses. The story about the start of renegotiations of a trade pact between the United States and Korea includes a quote from Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative. He said the trade deficit in goods between the United States and Korea doubled since the United States Korea Free Trade Agreement took effect in 2012. The pact did not yield the expected increase in exports of American goods, and U.S. goods exports actually went down, Lighthizer said. Work in Asia But did McMurray lobby to send jobs to China and Korea? The lawyer who recruited McMurray to work for a Korean law firm called the claim "utter nonsense." Thomas Pinansky, the senior foreign attorney and partner at Barun Law in Seoul, South Korea, recruited McMurray to the firm and supervised his work. McMurray helped American companies enter the Korean market, Pinansky said in an interview. "The comments are utter nonsense, they’re not based factually on what Nathan was doing as an international attorney on the ground in Korea," said Pinansky, a self-described independent voter who donated $300 to McMurray’s campaign. The law firm works with American companies and others "to help them succeed in historically a difficult market to penetrate, but it’s an important one," Pinansky said. The claim that McMurray "lobbied" to send American jobs to Asia is false, he said. "Lobbying is also absurd. It makes no sense at all," Pinansky said. "Lobbying whom for what?" McMurray worked as a legal adviser in Asia from 2006 to 2013, first in China with Allen & Overy, and then in Korea with Barun Law and Samsung, according to his campaign manager, Victoria Dillon. "In none of these positions did he have the authority to outsource any jobs," Dillon said. Labor support We attempted to get evidence for this claim from the Collins campaign. Four attempts to contact the campaign, through telephone and email messages, left over two days, were not returned. McMurray’s work in Asia has been a point of attack for Collins in a recent television ad. An automated phone call also mentioned McMurray’s supposed ties to trade deals that increased the U.S. trade deficit. The identity of the person or group who paid for the automated call is not clear. In a statement responding to the Collins television ad that had a similar attack, McMurray pointed to endorsements from the labor community. They include United Steel Workers and United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Workers of America. "Do you think I’d have the support of the local and national labor community if I was going to ship jobs to Asia? Of course not," McMurray said. Our ruling McMurray worked in Asia with American companies trying to enter markets there. He also was a co-author of an article about navigating Korea's labor laws. Collins claimed "McMurray lobbied to send our jobs" to China and Korea. There is no evidence that companies sought McMurray’s legal advice to move jobs from the United States to Asia, or that McMurray lobbied on behalf of trade deals. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09363	"A lot of the ideas in terms of the (health insurance) exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/01/barack-obama/obama-says-heritage-foundation-source-health-excha/	EDITOR'S NOTE: An analysis of this comment by President Barack Obama was published on April 1, 2010. After it appeared, the Heritage Foundation's communications office contacted us to argue that our rating of Mostly True was too generous to the president. We did some additional reporting to review our ruling. Our second round of reporting -- primarily talking to conservative policy experts outside of Heritage -- solidified our initial conclusions. Below is the updated version of our story, which retains the rating of Mostly True, published April 26, 2010. Democrats like to parry Republican criticism of the recently passed health care law by talking about how it includes ideas that originated with conservatives. During an interview on NBC's Today show on March 30, 2010, President Barack Obama offered a specific example. Obama told host Matt Lauer that "when you actually look at the bill itself, it incorporates all sorts of Republican ideas. I mean a lot of commentators have said this is sort of similar to the bill that Mitt Romney, the Republican governor and now presidential candidate, passed in Massachusetts. A lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation. ..." We zeroed in on the notion that the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that is no fan of Obama's health care law as a whole, might have "originated" the idea of the health insurance exchange -- a virtual marketplace where individuals can purchase health insurance. Our interest only grew after we received an e-mail from Heritage president Ed Feulner that blasted Obama's claim. "President Obama this morning cited the Heritage Foundation's research in an attempt to sell his health care package as a 'middle-of-the-road, centrist approach,'" Feulner wrote. "We take great exception to this misuse of our work and abuse of our name. This is but the latest act in a campaign to sell this big-government program as a moderate law that incorporates conservative ideas. Americans should not be fooled." Feulner went on to argue that "the president knows full well — or he ought to learn before he speaks — that the exchanges we and most others support are very different from those in his package. True exchanges are simply a market mechanism to enable families to choose their health insurance. President Obama’s exchanges, by contrast, are a vehicle to introduce sweeping regulation and federal standardization on health insurance." Heritage continued its campaign against Obama's claim in an April 19, 2010, op-ed column in the Washington Post. The director of Heritage's Center for Health Policy Studies, Robert Moffit, wrote that "the version of the exchange we did develop couldn't be more different than that embodied in this law." He charged that "the Obama health-care law 'builds' on the Heritage health reform model only in the sense that, say, a double-quarter-pounder with cheese 'builds' on the idea of a garden salad. Both have lettuce and tomato and may be called food, but the similarities end there." We see two related, but distinct, questions here. The first is whether Heritage did in fact "originate" the idea of health insurance exchanges. The second is whether the exchange prescribed by the new law mirrors the one that Heritage has supported. • Did Heritage originate the idea? Our research suggests that while Heritage has advocated for health insurance exchanges for many years, others did, too. Scholars credit Alain C. Enthoven -- an emeritus professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business who worked in the Defense Department during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations -- with popularizing the idea for an exchange as many as three decades ago. Still, there's little doubt that Heritage has been a consistent and eager promoter of the exchange idea, especially during the effort to design a new health care system for Massachusetts. That effort concluded with the Democratic legislature joining with the Republican governor, Romney, to implement a system that includes a health insurance exchange. On numerous occasions, Heritage scholars wrote approvingly of the exchange system in Massachusetts, known as the Connector. In a paper about the Massachusetts plan published on April 11, 2006, Edmund Haislmaier, a Heritage fellow in health care policy, wrote of the "truly significant and transformative health system changes that the legislation would set in motion." Specifically, Haislmaier wrote that "this concept of organizing a state's insurance markets around a central clearinghouse represents a dramatic departure from recent state health insurance reform proposals. States have spent the past 15 years trying to expand health care coverage to small-business employees, with virtually no positive results. The Massachusetts legislation represents a bipartisan commitment to move away from the policies that have largely failed to make progress in covering the uninsured for the past 15 years." In another paper, titled, "The Rationale for a Statewide Health Insurance Exchange," and published on Oct. 5, 2006, Heritage scholar Robert Moffit wrote that "the best option is a health insurance market exchange." Comparing it to a farmers' market or the used-car dealer CarMax, Moffit said the exchange "would expand coverage and choice" and would represent "a revolutionary change in the health insurance market." Journalists seemed to give Heritage credit, as well. During 2006, columns and articles citing Heritage's role in promoting the health exchange idea ran in such publications as the Washington Post, the Dallas Morning News, the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the National Review. We feel the president is largely right on this point. The idea for exchanges may have "originated" outside Heritage, but in well over a decade leading up to the introduction of the president's health care plan, Heritage clearly took a high-profile role in touting it, culminating in the proposal enacted in Massachusetts. And given that, they can hardly be shocked that the president is noting the think tank's role in developing the overall concept (even if he did so in a self-serving way). • Is it the same idea? After Obama made his comment, we spoke to both Haislmaier and to Stuart Butler, Heritage's vice president for domestic policy. Both argued that the plan now enacted into law is fundamentally different in structure than the one Heritage advocated. "What Obama and Capitol Hill did was to take a mainstream idea and push it toward a much more interventionist, regulatory model, as opposed to the original idea, which was more market-based," Butler said in an interview. To prevent Heritage scholars from moving the goalposts after the fact, we decided to analyze how similar the proposals are only by referring to policy stances that can be documented in briefing papers published prior to Obama's election. We found at least four papers that spoke directly to the health insurance exchange idea, and in these papers, we noticed several passages that advocated elements of an exchange that differ from how the bill was ultimately written. Here are some of those differences: -- Who can use the exchange? In a 2006 paper, Moffit wrote, "Ideally, an exchange should be open to all state residents and all interested employers, regardless of the size of the firm, who want to arrange health insurance through the exchange." That's not the case with the exchanges in the new law -- at least not any time soon. When the exchanges go live in 2014, they will only be open to people already buying insurance on the individual market (that is, those buying insurance independent of their employer) and to employees of small businesses with up to 100 employees. A provision does allow employees of businesses with more than 100 employees to purchase coverage from the exchange, but not until 2017, and only if their state decides to allow it. (The exception is that employees who are paying too large a percentage of their income on their employer-based health insurance will be eligible in 2014.) -- How much federal regulation will there be? Heritage scholars have regularly argued that the key regulatory role for the exchanges should be handled by the states, rather than the federal government. In a 2007 paper, Butler wrote that "each state would determine on its own such features as the infrastructure for handling premiums, as well as the regulations and requirements for accepting insurance plans into the exchange. The state also would be responsible for determining pooling, reinsurance, and risk adjustment arrangements and the degree to which firms would, if at all, be required to offer plans available through the exchange to their employees." It's true that the new health care law will create state-based exchanges. However, they will have to adhere to many federal requirements. For instance, the federal law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to define an "essential health benefits package" (and update its details every year). This will become the minimum package offered on the exchanges. The law also limits plans sold on the exchange to charging differential premiums only based on age (in a 3-to-1 ratio), geography, family composition and tobacco use (on a 1.5-to-1 ratio). And health plans on the exchange will have to abide by an assortment of other rules governing marketing requirements, provider networks and standards for presenting information to consumers. -- How portable will insurance be? In a 2007 paper published by Heritage, researcher Connie Marshner argued that health insurance exchanges would promote portability of health insurance. "When individuals are able to purchase health insurance for themselves in an (exchange) marketplace, the insurance belongs to them," Marshner wrote. "Even if they change jobs, move, or quit working and retire, they own the policy and can keep the same health insurance if they so choose." That should be the case for many people on the health care law's exchange, especially those who bought their insurance individually, as long as states don't erect high barriers that bar people from moving from one state's exchange to another. But full portability will be unlikely for those who purchased insurance on the exchange with the help of their employer. While the exchange should make it easier for those switching jobs to find new insurance, there will most likely be a disruption when that employee switches companies -- and whenever there's a disruption in coverage, there's a likelihood that their plan will have to change to one degree or another. So where does this leave us? Edwin Park, a senior fellow with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, sees significant similarities in approach despite the differences outlined above. Park said the differences involved "rules of the road within the exchange, rather than fundamental differences in the underlying concept or structure." Henry Aaron, a fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, called the new health care law "a close relative" of Heritage's plan -- "not identical to be sure, but a sibling or at least a first cousin. The essence is that you have a government or nonprofit entity that regulates the sale of insurance to individuals or businesses in order to standardize offerings and to control selling methods in order to produce real, head-to-head competition and to provide customers information in forms they can readily understand. ... Yes, they are all different; but they are all of the same family. " We also solicited the views of conservative policy experts beyond Heritage. One -- Tevi Troy, a visiting senior fellow at the Hudson Institute -- thought Heritage had a legitimate gripe. "In the policy world, there is often a vast gulf between theoretical ideas and policies as implemented, and this case is no exception," Troy said. "While Heritage had been a leading advocate for health insurance exchanges, the law as written creates something so different from what Heritage sought that I understand why they want to remove their name from the list of proponents." However, we heard from nine people affiliated with conservative policy organizations other than Heritage who thought that the president's statement was reasonably accurate. Seven of them declined to publicly express their differences with Heritage for fear of making waves within the tight-knit conservative policy world. But two did allow their names to be used. One was Dan Miller, executive vice president of the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, who acknowledged that Obama's statement was so carefully worded that the president "was able to exploit" the issue "for his own ends." The other was Daniel McCarthy, senior editor of the American Conservative magazine who has written recently about the conservative origins of the president's health care plan. "Every think tank on the left and right knows that its recommendations will undergo some deformation before they make their way into law, if they ever do," McCarthy told PolitiFact. "Heritage might prefer state insurance exchanges with greater individual choice, including for workers already covered by their employers. But I don't imagine Ed Feulner would be complaining at all if a Republican president or a Republican Congress had passed a plan that deviated from the Heritage blueprint to the same degree that Obama's bill has. While it's not true that 'lots of' the specifics in the Obama plan were dreamed up by Heritage, the overall approach is similar to policies Heritage has long championed, including the individual mandate as well as the insurance exchanges. This is only controversial because the wrong party happened to pass the law, and it's poison for any conservative to be identified with it." We agree with Heritage that the differences between its original vision and the version enacted into law are not trivial, and are enough to undercut the president's effort to secure a Heritage Foundation seal of approval for his bill. But the president helped his case by wording his statement with extreme care. Intentionally or not, he gave himself subtle linguistic running room by saying that "a lot of the ideas" for the exchange came from Heritage, including the concept of "just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market." Even if not all of the ideas in the two plans are identical, we feel that it was fair of him to say that "a lot of the ideas" are in common, including the notion of pooling. So we conclude that the president's statement qualifies as Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-04-01T13:34:21	2010-03-30	['The_Heritage_Foundation']
pomt-09823	Schoolchildren across the nation "will be forced to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks, and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/02/republican-party-florida/republican-party-florida-says-obama-will-indoctrin/	President Barack Obama plans to speak to the nation's schoolchildren on Sept. 8. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the speech will be about "the importance of persisting and succeeding in school," and the department is offering classroom materials to "engage students and stimulate discussion on the importance of education in their lives." You might think that would be a harmless topic, and that people across the political spectrum could agree on the importance of education. Not so for the Republican Party of Florida, which released a statement "condemning President Obama's use of taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America’s children to his socialist agenda." "As the father of four children, I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama's socialist ideology," said Jim Greer, party chairman, in a news release. "The idea that schoolchildren across our nation will be forced to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks, and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president, is not only infuriating, but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans, while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power," he added. "The Democrats have clearly lost the battle to maintain control of the message this summer, so now that school is back in session, President Obama has turned to American’s children to spread his liberal lies, indoctrinating American’s youngest children before they have a chance to decide for themselves," he concluded. The release, which we received via e-mail, told us to click a link to learn more about Obama's speech. That took us to the U.S. Department of Education Web site, where Secretary Arne Duncan wrote that the speech was about "the importance of education." "The president will challenge students to work hard, set educational goals, and take responsibility for their learning," Duncan wrote. "He will also call for a shared responsibility and commitment on the part of students, parents and educators to ensure that every child in every school receives the best education possible so they can compete in the global economy for good jobs and live rewarding and productive lives as American citizens." We asked the Republican Party of Florida for evidence that Obama intended to discuss health care, banks, automobile companies or taxes with the nation's schoolchildren. They couldn't point us to anything. A spokesman said the party was particularly concerned about the study questions the department had provided. "The goal of these materials is to tell students why they should support President Obama in his overall agenda," said Katie Gordon. "If the former administration had done something like this, the media would be handling this a lot differently," she added. We reviewed the study materials but didn't see any mention of controversial issues, let alone any attempt to indoctrinate students in socialism. The pre-K through 6th grade materials said the main ideas of the speech would be "citizenship, personal responsibility, civic duty." The materials for high schoolers mention "personal responsibility, goals, persistence." We searched previous media reports to see if former President George W. Bush ever gave a nationwide address to schoolchildren, but based on our search, it appears he did not. He did, however, regularly visit individual schools and discuss the importance of education with students. We did learn, however, that President George H.W. Bush addressed the nation's students in a televised speech during school hours in 1991. ''I can't understand for the life of me what's so great about being stupid,'' Bush said, according to news reports from the time. He told students to ''block out the kids who think it's not cool to be smart'' and ''work harder, learn more.'' Democrats at the time criticized the speech. "The Department of Education should not be producing paid political advertising for the president, it should be helping us to produce smarter students," said Richard Gephardt, then the Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives. Republican Newt Gingrich defended Bush's speech, though. "Why is it political for the president of the United States to discuss education?" Gingrich said at the time. "It was done at a nonpolitical site and was beamed to a nonpolitical audience. . . . They wanted to reach the maximum audience with the maximum effect to improve education." But we digress. In ruling on Greer's statement, we wondered whether we should give him latitude for legitimate commentary on Obama's speech. But he crossed a line when he said that Obama intended to discuss "plans for government-run health care, banks, and automobile companies" and other policy matters not germane to education. That is factually incorrect, and the party could not offer any support for the statement. For raising the specter of socialist ideology and indoctrination, the party takes its claim to an additional, absurd level. We rate the Republican Party of Florida's statement Pants on Fire! Update, Sept. 3 : Since we published this item, the Department of Education has modified a line in its classroom materials about the president's speech. A bullet point for activities after the speech used to say, "Write letters to themselves about what they can do to help the president. These would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals." Now it states, "Write letters to themselves about how they can achieve their short–term and long–term education goals. These would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals." That change, however, does not alter our ruling. Based on the press release that the Republican Party of Florida used as a basis for this claim, there remains no evidence that Obama intends to discuss the controversial policy issues of health care, banking, the automotive industry, taxes or the national debt during his address to students. And so we still find the party's claim to be Pants on Fire.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2009-09-02T11:19:27	2009-09-01	['None']
pomt-04270	"The higher the education level, the more likely they are to vote Democratic."	/georgia/statements/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/	With the presidential election upon us this week, PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine a statement about national voting trends. In a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article, political analyst Larry Sabato commented on the constituency of the political parties, particularly among white voters. We already checked part of his statement that "Virginia’s educational level among whites is higher than Georgia (voters’ educational level)." We rated it true. In the article, Sabato goes on to explain more of the characteristics of the political parties’ faithful. "... The higher the education level, the more likely they are to vote Democratic," he said in the story. We decided to take a closer look to determine whether there were facts to bear this out. And if so, did this claim include voters nationwide? And what about Georgia, where conservative, white voters have been a solid base for the GOP? We asked Sabato about the basis for his comments. Like his first statement, Sabato used CNN’s 2008 exit polls to substantiate his claim, according to his political analyst and media relations coordinator, Kyle Kondik. Based on the 2008 exit polls of Georgia, Virginia (where Sabato works) and nationally, whites with a college degree supported Barack Obama at a higher rate than whites without a college degree, Kondik said. Looking at CNN’s 2008 national election poll of almost 18,000 respondents, 44 percent identified as college graduates. Of those college graduates, Obama had an 8 percentage point advantage over then-Republican presidential nominee John McCain. Of voters with a postgraduate degree, Obama had an 18-point advantage over McCain. In Georgia, the GOP maintained a strong foothold. All white voters at each education level -- except of course, white Democrats -- overwhelmingly voted for McCain. The GOP nominee had a 48-point advantage over Obama among Georgia’s white college graduate respondents. At the postgraduate level, the margin between the candidates shrunk, but McCain still beat out Obama by 1 percentage point. (The postgraduate voters were not identified by race.) The Pew Research Center released data in August 2012 about GOP gains among working-class white voters that found: "Lower-income and less educated whites also have shifted substantially toward the Republican Party since 2008." Among whites without a college degree, the GOP now holds a 54 percent to 37 percent advantage among non-college whites, who were split about evenly four years ago. The partisanship of white college graduates, by contrast, has not changed, the analysis found. Back in March of this year, political scientists and authors of the Monkey Cage blog examined the voting patterns of white voters in America. Their findings also support Sabato’s analysis. When viewed in the context of educational attainment alone, without also examining income level, the blog authors concluded that high school graduates are more Republican than non-high school graduates. But after that, the groups with more education tended to vote more Democratic. At the very highest education level tabulated in the survey, voters with postgraduate degrees leaned toward the Democrats. To reach the conclusions, the political scientists (professors at East Coast colleges such as George Washington University and Georgetown) used data from Annenberg pre-election polls for 2000 and 2004 and Pew pre-election polls for 2008. With white, highly educated voters being a key demographic for the Democratic Party, political observers, such as conservative columnist Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, are predicting Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney could carry several swing states if he can sway these voters to the GOP. But the Democrats seem intent on keeping this voting bloc. Last week the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), which conducts research on civic education and on youth voting and political participation, published an analysis of about 1,110 young voters based on their educational experience. CIRCLE, which is based at Tufts University and was founded in 2001 by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts, found that youths with college backgrounds were about three times more likely to have been contacted on behalf of the Obama campaign. The Romney campaign and supporters appeared to have contacted more non-college youths. In Georgia, the numbers are harder to examine. The secretary of state does not keep statistics on voters’ education levels. The GOP in the Peach State and in the Deep South in general still has a stronghold on the white voters, regardless of the education level, said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University and co-author of the book "The Rise of the Southern Republicans." "In a state like Virginia where you have a lot of Northern migrants and people coming in from outside the state, things may be different," he said. The GOP stronghold in Georgia is evidenced by the overwhelming number of Republicans in power at the state level, as well as the strong support for McCain four years ago and early polling data showing support for Romney this year. Sabato said that "the higher the education level, the more likely [voters] are to vote Democratic." Sabato bases his claim on 2008 exit polls showing this national trend. Several polls and analysis done on data from presidential elections dating back at least a decade support Sabato’s claim. Still, looking at data for Georgia, the trend remains for white voters -- regardless of educational level -- to vote Republican. For many areas of the country, Sabato’s claim holds true. But in Georgia and the Deep South, the GOP is still firmly in control. We rate Sabato’s statement Mostly True.	None	Larry Sabato	None	None	None	2012-11-05T06:00:00	2012-10-16	['None']
pomt-01983	"Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-rep-sean-duffy-voted-against/	As President Barack Obama faced attacks over long waits for appointments at Veterans Administration health centers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the House Democrats’ campaign arm -- engaged in some finger-pointing. The DCCC sent out a news release claiming that U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) -- and other Republicans -- voted against fixing the VA backlog. Here is part of the June 2, 2014 news release, which was headlined "Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes." "As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congressman Sean Duffy’s votes tell the true story of his record: when he had a chance to fix this problem, he voted against the fixes." The release went on to quote DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin saying, "It’s a shame that when Congressman Duffy had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA he voted no. Congressman Duffy voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better." PolitiFact National rated a similar DCCC claim against U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami and rated it False. (The DCCC issued a series of virtually identical news releases) Leaning heavily on PolitiFact National’s work, here is a look at how the claim fares when used against Duffy. VA backlog In the item on Ros-Lehtinen, PolitiFact reporter Amy Sherman wrote: We should start by distinguishing between two related, but separate, issues relating to veterans. One concerns longstanding problems with handling benefits claims from veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die as a result of their service. The other concerns long waits for service at VA hospitals. On the first issue -- benefits -- the backlog refers to requests that go unaddressed by the government for at least 125 days. PolitiFact found that the backlog nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in the summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012. In April 2014, the Obama administration released numbers suggesting the backlog was shrinking, but veterans groups said they had serious doubts about the numbers. The second issue -- the wait for health care -- stemmed from news reports that revealed secret waiting lists at VA hospitals, and that some veterans died while awaiting care. This is what ultimately led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki on May 30. The DCCC essentially conflates the two issues in the quest to highlight any vote that portrays Duffy as voting against veterans’ interests. Of course, political groups tend to cherry-pick the records of their opponent. As the Ros-Lehtinen item noted: It’s possible to dig up a vote made by virtually any member of Congress of either party and claim that the politician is for -- or against -- anything, including veterans benefits. So, just as the Democrats were able to find some votes in which Duffy voted against a service for veterans, there are other votes which he voted for veterans’ services. Many of the votes that the DCCC cited were procedural moves or one particular vote out of a series of votes. In most of the instances, the votes broke down overwhelmingly on party lines, with Duffy joining his Republican colleagues. That said, let’s start with the votes that are directly about the backlog: The votes • Veterans Backlog Reduction Act: A bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. William Enyart, D-Ill., ordered the VA to provisionally pay any disability claim if the VA didn’t respond within 125 days. Enyart introduced the bill in April 2013 and it was referred to the House committee on Veterans Affairs. It never received a vote. The DCCC said Duffy voted against considering that bill by pointing to a vote on the "previous question" -- a parliamentary move to force a vote. During a debate about a higher education bill, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. stated "if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will allow the House to vote on the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act." Enyart then explained his veterans’ bill and urged a "no" vote. His fellow Democrats complied and all voted "no" while the Republicans voted "yes," which defeated his effort. Something the DCCC omitted is that in October 2013, Duffy had voted to establish a commission or task force to evaluate the backlog of disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That measure passed, 404-1. • Increasing funds to reduce the backlog in disability claims: The DCCC said Duffy voted no, along with nearly every Republican, on a motion that would have added $9.2 million to hire an additional 94 VA claims processors tasked with reducing the disability claims backlog. The June 2013 motion was a "motion to recommit" on an appropriations bill to fund military construction and veterans affairs. A "motion to recommit" in the House refers to a last-ditch attempt by the minority party to amend a bill before it passes. Left unsaid: The overall bill, which did pass, provided money to address the backlog, just not as much as Democrats proposed. • Mental health funds: On June 2, 2011, Congress agreed in a voice vote to set aside $20 million for suicide prevention for veterans. On June 14, 2011, Duffy voted against a Democratic motion to recommit that would add $20 million for veterans’ suicide prevention. The GOP argued that such services were already funded, and the motion failed. Duffy, along with nearly every member of Congress, voted for the overall bill, which increased money for the military. The bill included an additional $20 million for suicide prevention outreach, according to Congressional Quarterly. • Medical and prosthetic research: In May 2012, Duffy joined all but three Republicans in voting against a motion to recommit that would have increased funding for veterans’ medical and prosthetic research by $28.3 million. Here too, Duffy joined the overwhelming majority in passing the overall bill. The bill provided a $1.7 million increase for medical, rehabilitative, health services and prosthetic research -- an amount equal to the Obama administration’s request, according to CQ. The DCCC also cited votes Duffy took leading up to the October 2013 federal shutdown. In August, he voted for a House Republican "continuing resolution" -- a stopgap funding bill -- that the Associated Press reported would "likely result" in the shutdown of the federal government. The bill passed 230-189. The shutdown led to a delay in death benefits for veterans among other delayed services, the Washington Post reported. DCCC also cited a pair of votes Duffy took in September, including one on a motion to commit to H.J. Res. 59, to make continuing appropriations that would have ensured veterans benefits wouldn’t be delayed during a shutdown. All but one Republican voted "no." However, left out of the DCCC’s account is that Duffy voted for in favor of H.J. Res. 72, the "Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution" -- a mini-funding resolution favored by House Republicans to reopen slices of the government. The measure passed the House with unanimous Republican support and overwhelming Democratic opposition. (Showing how both sides play this game, the RNC plucked out that vote to attack DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a claim we rated False.) Democrats also cited multiple other votes including a few that related to housing for veterans but Republicans could point to other votes on bills that did provide housing assistance. Veterans’ group report card Meanwhile, we found a veterans’ organization that issue voting "report cards" for members of Congress: The American Veterans (Amvets) gave Duffy an A-minus in 2013, based on eight pieces of legislation. In response to questions from PolitiFact National, DCCC spokeswoman Emily Bittner said, "These Republicans’ votes speak for themselves. Taken in their totality, they show an unfortunate pattern of refusing to cross party lines and vote for commonsense fixes to the problems at the VA." However, we don't think the votes chosen show the "totality" of Duffy’s record. Our rating The DCCC said "Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes." The DCCC points to some votes that went against funding certain veterans’ services or addressing the backlog. However, the DCCC ignores that Duffy took other votes in favor of increasing funding for veterans’ services -- just not as much as Democratic proposals would have offered. The bigger issue is that most of these votes came within elaborate games of tit-for-tat, in which each side offers proposals that they expect will fail, just to get lawmakers on the other side to take votes that look superficially bad. The reality of Duffy’s voting record is much more nuanced than the DCCC’s cherry-picked account would suggest. This, combined with the "A-minus" rating he's received from a veterans' advocacy group, undercut the DCCC's claim that he has a "long" voting record of voting against the interests of veterans. We rate the claim False.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2014-06-16T05:00:00	2014-06-02	['None']
pomt-15279	Says David Jolly refused "to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C."	/florida/statements/2015/jul/27/club-growth/david-jolly-refused-cut-funding-dc-greenhouse-anti/	U.S. Rep. David Jolly’s Senate campaign was only hours old when he began taking fire from his fellow conservatives. The Club for Growth, a political action committee backing Jolly’s GOP primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, said that Jolly may have only been in office for 16 months, but during that time he "racked up a terrible record on fiscal issues." "Jolly is so addicted to big government, he couldn’t even muster up the courage to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C.," the PAC said in a statement emailed on the afternoon of July 20, 2015, the same day Jolly announced that he would be vying for Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-open Senate seat. Jolly has only been in office since March 2014, after winning a special election for the late C.W. "Bill" Young’s 13th congressional district seat. Given such a short tenure, we wondered what action was so wasteful it would warrant Club for Growth’s assertion that Jolly had squandered too many greenbacks on a greenhouse. Flower power It turns out that "national greenhouse" is actually the conservatory at the U.S. Botanic Garden, a Washington museum first envisioned by George Washington more than two centuries ago with the mission of demonstrating and promoting "the importance of plants to the young nation," according to the garden. The garden became a reality in 1820 and has been open in its current location on the Capitol grounds since 1933. Referring to it as just a greenhouse is an understatement: The grounds include various outdoor gardens, several plant collections in the aforementioned conservatory and an amphitheater. It is devoted to the study and cultivation of all manner of plant species and is free to the public. In 2013, the garden featured a 250-pound beast of a plant known as the corpse flower, which rarely blooms and stinks of rotting flesh. Curious botany fans braved an hourlong wait just to see (and perhaps smell) the bloom. That’s not the kind of stuff you find next to the tomatoes and zinnias at the local nursery. Because of the quirk that it was established by the federal government and has long been run by the Office of Architect of the Capitol, the garden is funded through the appropriations process for the legislative branch. A Club for Growth spokesman told us the PAC was referring to an amendment to the fiscal year 2015 legislative branch appropriations bill. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., proposed cutting $3.1 million slated for repairs and improvements at the Botanic Garden. Gosar said the cut would have reduced funding to 2014 levels, but the garden’s administrators had been planning some changes. "Rather than making minor repairs to a few small leaks in the roof, the Architect of the Capitol is proposing to tear down the entire roof and replace it with something called a new vegetative roofing system," Gosar said, referring to a plan Architect of the Capitol Stephen Ayers had proposed. "We shouldn’t be wasting precious taxpayer money on a new, state-of-the-art vegetative roofing system." Ayers had testified in March 2014 to the House Appropriations Subcommittee that money also would go to repair chips and cracks in the conservatory’s facade. Ayers said a vegetative roof -- think of a living garden on top of the conservatory instead of tar or shingles -- "will have a longer lifespan and will reduce water runoff." South Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz said Gosar was merely "trying to generate headlines by attempting to cut much-needed funding to one of the most beloved destinations in Washington, D.C." But on May 1, 2014, the House voted in favor of the amendment, 219-198. One of the 37 Republicans who voted against the amendment -- and who as a result voted to keep the garden’s higher 2015 repair budget intact -- was Jolly. "It would have been penny-wise but pound-foolish to score political points by refusing to replace a failing roof on a federal building visited by almost 1 million Americans a year," Jolly spokeswoman Sarah Bascom told PolitiFact. "To not replace the roof jeopardized the safety of visitors and workers, and risked even greater cost should the roof and building fall in greater repair or lead to an accident with physical injury." As it happens, after the amendment to cut the roof spending passed the House despite Jolly’s opposition, lawmakers found ways to cut other spending and were able to put the roof expenditure back in the final version of the bill. The Club for Growth didn’t mention this. Changes at the Botanic Garden, which last completed an extensive renovation in 2001, are not as of yet listed among the projects on the Architect of the Capitol website. Our ruling The Club for Growth said Jolly refused "to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C." While "greenhouse" trivializes the U.S. Botanic Garden, the group is right that Jolly broke with most Republicans in voting against a 2014 amendment to cut funding for repairs to the complex’s roof and facade.

pomt-02902	A planning group said that to meet anticipated traffic demands by 2035, Interstate 35 between Austin and Round Rock will need a dozen additional lanes going north and 14 additional southbound lanes.	/texas/statements/2013/nov/06/sid-covington/projection-26-additional-lanes-wasnt-limited-inter/	In an opinion column on commuter trains potentially relieving traffic congestion in Austin, an advocate warned that if such a service doesn’t come to be, Interstate 35 would need to be considerably wider. "Staff for the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization recently told the city’s Transit Working Group that to meet anticipated demand by year 2035, Interstate 35 will need an additional 14 lanes southbound and an additional 12 lanes northbound between Round Rock and Austin," Sid Covington wrote in the article in the Oct. 28, 2013, Austin American-Statesman. The planning organization, known as CAMPO, coordinates regional transportation planning for Travis County and five surrounding counties. The region could plan such expansion, Covington wrote, but it would be wiser to invest in a passenger rail line connecting San Antonio and Georgetown, north of Austin. Covington chairs the Lone Star Rail District, an agency focused on providing regional passenger rail service to Central and South Texas along the Austin/San Antonio corridor. The district seeks tax money from local governments along the proposed rail route, including from the city of Austin, and has said it’s working with Union Pacific on building an alternate freight rail line so the passenger line could use existing tracks. Covington summed up: "There’s not enough concrete and available real estate for adding new lanes" ad "in finitum." We’re not judging how to relieve congestion. But did a presentation really envision 26 additional lanes on I-35? As of November 2013, the highway had up to four lanes in each direction in Austin, not counting frontage roads. Also, perhaps surprisingly, I-35 through Central Austin had about 4 percent less traffic in 2012 than it had in 2002, according to a Sept. 12, 2013, American-Statesman illustration, though it indicated the highway had as much as 65 percent more traffic in other portions north and south of downtown. To our initial inquiry about this multi-lane statement, Joseph Black, the district’s rail director, told us by phone the column got the forecasted lane counts backward. Black said the described presentation indicated a potential need for a dozen lanes southbound and 14 lanes northbound. By email, Covington then guided us to the relevant May 25, 2012, presentation to the Transit Working Group, whose membership included Austin City Council members and people from the greater community. The presentation, which we watched on the city’s online video, is dense. We promise some unpacking around the bend. At the meeting, Doug Allen, then an executive with Capital Metro, Austin’s regional public transportation provider, prefaced the lane-count detail by saying that officials worked with CAMPO’s "travel forecast model" to estimate how much additional capacity would be needed on I-35 and MoPac Boulevard through 2035 assuming both highways had "unlimited capacity." An assumption was that each highway lane would be capable of moving 2,000 people an hour, he said. Allen said the analysis, tied to projected automobile trips, suggested that six additional lanes would be needed in each direction on MoPac between U.S. 290 on the north side of the city and 38th Street, or a dozen total. He said the model indicated that 14 northbound lanes would need to be added to I-35 from Texas 71 to East Oltorf Street. That’s (gulp) 26 lanes of additional highway. Then again, Allen said that if the hoped-for passenger rail and other people-moving infrastructure comes to be instead, the described MoPac expansion would not be needed and I-35 would need only four additional northbound lanes, according to the research. By telephone, a Capital Metro administrator, Todd Hemingson, made a run at clarifying the presentation. We wondered, for starters, about the references to MoPac crossing 290 in North Austin and East Oltorf in South Austin, which it does not. Hemingson said the presentation used the equivalent of 290 and Oltorf as if they were invisibly extended to cross MoPac and I-35. And why did the calculations assume the highways had "unlimited capacity?" It’s an "all or nothing" scenario, Hemingson said. "In the transportation planning world, the purpose is to give you a suggestion of how much demand is actually out there without regard to the physical reality of how much could be carried by the highways available. Basically that’s it. It’s just a high-level look at the total demand for transportation in the" I-35 "corridor." But isn’t that assumption unrealistic? "Sure," Hemingson said. "In the real world, people would take alternate routes" if congestion grew overwhelming on the highways. "Over time, they would choose to live or work in a different locations. If it really took three hours to commute from Round Rock to downtown" Austin, "people wouldn’t do it. They’d choose to live in a different way." And was the point of the presentation that if the rail district’s passenger lines don’t happen, the highways will have to expand by that much? Negative, Hemingson said, the message is that the only way the Austin region will get close to "getting a handle on the congestion coming our way given the amazing amount of population growth that is coming is by doing all of the above," Hemingson said, meaning highway expansions, changes in commuting patterns, car pooling and passenger rail, with necessary funding still to be corraled. "It’s not reasonable to accommodate growth only by building more lanes," he said. Later, we asked Maureen McCoy, CAMPO’s executive director, to interpret the forecast. She stressed that the projection assumed traffic would never be stop-and-start on the highways. She then said the indicated additional lanes are "probably a nonstarter because of the magnitude," a reference to the destruction of buildings potentially needed to add so many lanes. "I don’t even know what you would have to wipe out to make that happen," McCoy said. The University of Texas has buildings on both sides of I-35 including a football practice facility and the UT Press. Also, hundreds of residents live near the two highways. Of late, McCoy said, there are no additional lanes contemplated for I-35; no funding has been identified. On the other hand, American-Statesman transportation writer Ben Wear wrote in an Oct. 28, 2013, commentary that the state and city of Austin have been studying the addition of a lane on each side of the highway. "Odds are they will be ‘express lanes’ like what is about to be added to MoPac north of Lady Bird Lake," Wear wrote, adding that this means the lanes would be tolled. Finally, we asked Hemingson to elaborate on the traffic projections feeding into the lane forecasts. He replied by email that the calculations were based on travel demands for 2035 in CAMPO’s long-range transportation plan. He also added that two Capital Metro employees who worked on the "thought experiment" are no longer at the agency, "so recollecting the exact details is difficult at best." He also emailed us a drawing he attributed to Allen, the staff member who made the 2012 presentation. The drawing, which we’ve posted here, shows that under the "all-or-nothing" scenario, the number of lanes on MoPac, which had up to four lanes in each direction as of November 2013, would reach seven between Texas 71 and downtown Austin, topping out at five from Lady Bird Lake to 38th Street. The drawing shows I-35 lanes topping out at 10 between 290 and 38th Street and running from seven to nine lanes on other stretches between Texas 71 to the south and U.S. 183 to the north. It all adds up to 26 lanes, the drawing indicates. Hemingson also said that "while vehicle miles traveled per capita in the region (and nationally) are down, that would not be reflected in this analysis because at the time it was run the CAMPO model inputs were based on a 2005 ‘base year,’ and so would not have been updated to reflect lower driving rates from that time to present." By phone, Covington agreed that his claim misstated the direction of the declared highway lanes and left out MoPac. It’s "nitpicking," he said, to note that his statement also didn’t mention that the projections assumed both highways could expand without constraints. Our ruling Covington said that a presentation indicated that to meet anticipated traffic demands by 2035, I-35 between Austin and Round Rock will need a dozen additional lanes going north and 14 additional southbound lanes. Those tallies reflect what a working group was told in May 2012, but the presentation by a Capital Metro official (using a CAMPO modeling system) projected 26 additional lanes on I-35 as well as MoPac; Covington’s column did not mention the second highway and also flipped the predicted number of northbound and southbound lanes. Perhaps more significantly, these lane counts were rooted in the assumption that both highways would have unlimited capacity, presumably including space enough to be widened dramatically despite the existence of major facilities along I-35 and hundreds of homes near both highways. We rate this partly accurate claim, which leaves out critical details and draws on a projection with an unrealistic assumption, as Half True.

pomt-01281	"In K-12 education, our kids are scoring at the bottom of science and mathematics right now in the industrialized world -- at the bottom."	/virginia/statements/2014/nov/02/dave-brat/brat-says-us-students-scoring-bottom-math-and-scie/	The debate between two professors – David Brat and Jack Trammell – vying for the 7th District Congressional seat would of course include points about education. "In K-12 education, our kids are scoring at the bottom of science and mathematics right now in the industrialized world -- at the bottom," Brat said during the Oct. 28 debate at Randolph-Macon College, where both he and Trammell teach. We asked Brat’s campaign where he got those figures. His spokesman, Brian Gottstein, sent us a column by Stanford University mathematician Keith Devlin that examines the Programme for International Student Assessment, tests in reading, science and math given to 15-year-olds every three years beginning in 2000. Most of the 34 member nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- an industrialized group of mostly Western European and North American countries -- participate now. A smattering of other countries, such as Russia, Indonesia and Brazil, and regional educational systems in China also take part. In 2000, 32 countries participated. That grew to 65 nations in 2012, the most recent test year with published results. Gottstein referred to a particular quote from Devlin’s column: "In 2006, American students ranked dead last, 25th out of 25, in math and 21st out of 30 in science. The U.S. also scored worse than ranked countries outside the OECD (considered to be developing nations) like Russia, Azerbaijan, Slovenia and Estonia. Only 1 percent of American 15-year-olds could perform at the highest level, and 27 countries had a higher percentage of 15-year-olds who performed at level 6. And 28 percent of U.S. students appear to have essentially no math skills at all." We remember from a past fact-check that American students have typically been middle-of-the-pack performers on international tests. But let’s dig a little deeper into the statistics from this column. First, let’s look at the United States’ rankings, as reported by the National Center for Educational Statistics: Science 2000: the U.S. scores ranked 14th among the 28 OECD countries and 14th of 32 total nations. 2003: 19th among 30 OECD countries and 22nd among 41 overall. 2006: 21st among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 57 overall. 2009: 17th among 34 OECD countries and 23rd among 65 overall. 2012: 20th among 34 OECD countries and 28th among 65 overall. Math 2000: the U.S was 18th among 28 OECD countries and 19th of 32 total nations. 2003: 24th among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 41 overall. 2006: 25th among 30 OECD countries and 35th among 57 overall. 2009: 25th among 34 OECD countries and 31st among 65 overall. 2012: 27th among 34 OECD countries and 36th among 65 overall. So, Devlin was correct on the science rank in 2006, but he underplays where the U.S. ranked among its peers on the math score. The U.S. wasn’t "dead last" in its math score that year and in fact hasn’t ranked "dead last" in any PISA test. Also, Brat and Devlin are referring to outdated results. We know from the 2012 results that among the 34 industrialized countries in the OECD, the U.S. ranked 27th on the math tests and 20th on the science tests. So the U.S. position among its peers on math and science tests has edged up slightly. In summarizing the U.S. results in the latest tests, the OECD said the U.S. math scores were "below average" among the industrialized countries in that organization. The U.S. science scores, the group said, were "close to the OECD average." Our ruling Brat said U.S. students rank "at the bottom" in math and science scores among industrialized nations. U.S. students have not fallen quite to the very bottom of the stack. The latest testing shows U.S. students rank near the middle of the pack among industrialized nations for science scores and in the bottom tier for math scores. The performance is nothing to celebrate, but Brat is wrong when he says twice in his statement that U.S. students rank "at the bottom" of developed nations in math and science scores. We rate his claim False.	None	Dave Brat	None	None	None	2014-11-02T00:00:00	2014-10-28	['None']
pomt-03222	Says unions call Obamacare "bad for workers."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/21/mike-lee/sen-lee-says-union-call-obamacare-bad-workers/	A small but vocal cadre of congressional Republicans would like to defund Obamacare and would be willing to risk a government shutdown to make that happen. A leading voice in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah. Lee says the new law is so bad, even key Democratic allies don’t like it. "By a margin of 2 to 1, Americans say Obamacare will make their family's health care situation worse, not better. Just 12 percent support the individual mandate. Doctors don't want it. Businesses oppose it. Unions say it's bad for workers," Lee wrote in an op-ed in USA Today. That last group, the unions, caught our eye. Organized labor is one of the pillars of the Democratic Party and lobbied hard for passage of the Affordable Care Act. We wanted to verify that Lee had his facts right. Unions that oppose the law Lee’s office pointed us to a press release and a letter. The press release from United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers called for "repeal or complete reform of President Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA)." The letter came from three of the larger unions in the country: The Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial International Union, and Unite-Here, which represents hotel workers. Those three unions sent a dire warning to the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. "We can no longer stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our members along with millions of other hardworking Americans. We believe that there are common-sense corrections that can be made within the existing statute that will allow our members to continue to keep their current health plans and benefits just as you and the President pledged. Unless changes are made, however, that promise is hollow. We continue to stand behind real health care reform, but the law as it stands will hurt millions of Americans including the members of our respective unions." The circumstances that led to this letter are complex, and we will get into them in a moment. But first, let’s look at which unions are opposing the law and which are supporting it. Many unions offer health insurance through unusual plans that allow large and small employers to buy coverage as a group, and some of the unions that are involved in these plans have the biggest objections to the health care law. Randy DeFrehn is executive director of the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, a sort of trade association for these insurance groups. DeFrehn said at least six unions have gone public with their objections to Obamacare. Behind the scenes, he said, the number is larger. "Altogether, there are a dozen or more out there," DeFrehn said. "They don’t all want to come out against the administration, but they are worried about the unintended consequences of the law." DeFrehn’s group has 23 member unions. So by his count, roughly half of them are raising red flags about Obamacare. In contrast, some very large members in DeFrehn’s organization actively support the law. That includes the Service Employees International Union, which represents housekeepers, janitors and other lower-paid workers. SEIU recently kicked off a national campaign to promote Obamacare. Even among the unions that warn of the dangers of the new law, for most of them, repeal is not the first choice. The letter to top Democrats called for "common-sense corrections." DeFrehn said that goal prevails, although calls for repeal could be the result of "ultimate frustration." What the unions don’t like One central problem with the law, in the unions’ view, is the threat it poses to the kind of health insurance their members enjoy today. Just as there are many different insurance companies, there are many different union insurance plans, about 3,000. These plans are often called Taft-Hartley plans after the federal labor law that created them. And here’s the rub: The Affordable Care Act creates insurance exchanges that will present employers with a new alternative to the current union insurance. "The unions think it will be cheaper for employers to drop out of the Taft-Hartley plans and go on the health exchange," said Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University School of Law. "This puts pressure on the unions who want to keep workers satisfied and make sure they have a reason to belong to the union." Here’s why the unions think that could happen. DeFrehn says 90 percent of the employers in these plans have fewer than 50 workers. While larger employers will face penalties if they don’t offer health insurance, these smaller employers would not. At the end of a union contract, they would be perfectly free under the law to drop coverage and encourage workers to buy through an exchange. The exchanges could be an attractive option for another reason. In an exchange, workers with family incomes as high as 400 percent of federal poverty level would be eligible for a subsidy from the federal government. A subsidy calculator from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy group, shows what this could mean in dollars and cents. A family of four making $92,000 a year would get about 25 percent knocked off the premium. That’s a significant discount; one that Secunda says would put the union plans at a competitive disadvantage. Over the decades, some unions have negotiated successfully for good health care benefits, even at the expense of wages. But if the unions’ nightmare scenario plays itself out as they fear, and employers drop coverage, then workers would find that they can get coverage without the union. The coverage probably wouldn’t be as good but its shortcomings might not be obvious. And maybe these workers would have less reason to belong to the union. "This could be yet another existential threat to the unions," said Secunda. There’s reason to think that some employers would exercise this option. Marshall Babson is a long-time employment lawyer and former member of the National Labor Relations Board, appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Babson represents management. Babson said for the past 20 years, he has been advising his clients to get out of Taft-Hartley plans. He said they are inefficient. "If the Affordable Care Act is a threat to these plans," Babson said, "It’s because they have been vulnerable for a long time." This is the union fear. What would actually happen under Obamacare is unknown. Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a group focused on how government programs affect people of modest means. Bernstein was chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden during the drafting of Obamacare. He was more optimistic that the plans will remain viable. "I wouldn’t be so quick to accept the assumption that the Taft-Hartley plans will end when the Affordable Care Act arrives," Bernstein said. "One of the myths is that employers will willy-nilly dump their plans and put people on the exchange. Typically, these plans are offered for a reason. They are an important part of the compensation package that makes sense for keeping the workers you need to run a business. The ACA won’t change that." But some unions, at least, are unwilling to wait and find out. Concerns about part-timers Another significant issue for unions is how the law treats part-time workers. While the law encourages employers to provide insurance, there are two primary escape clauses. Companies with fewer than 50 workers face no requirement to offer it. And no employer need provide coverage to anyone working less than 30 hours each week. "We don’t have hard numbers but we hear anecdotally that some companies are shifting to using more part-time workers," said Brenda Carter, spokeswoman for Unite-Here. Carter said that doesn’t affect her union’s members because they are protected by contracts, but it isn’t good for non-union workers. Our ruling Mike Lee said unions say that Obamacare is bad for workers. About six unions, some of them quite large, have warned in the strongest terms that Obamacare will undercut health care coverage for their members. The evidence suggests that more than six unions share that view. However, the union community is not monolithic, and some large unions continue to support the Affordable Care Act as much as ever. And while Lee would like to do away with the new health care law, even unions with deep concerns seek to fix the law, not repeal it. Still, a significant number of prominent unions spoke against the law as it now stands and not every union would need to feel that way in order for Lee’s statement to be accurate. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Mike Lee	None	None	None	2013-08-21T11:44:30	2013-08-04	['None']
pomt-07075	Virginia spends $400,000 on abstinence programs while losing $2.5 million in federal funds due to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s "political agenda."	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/27/naral-pro-choice-america/naral-says-mcdonnells-agenda-costs-state-federal-s/	NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia recently unveiled a video that uses a montage of numbers to criticize Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell’s stance on funding for sex education programs. Among the claims: "$400,000 -- approximate cost to Virginians to fund ineffective abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. $2.5 million -- federal funding for comprehensive sex education programs Virginia lost due to McDonnell’s political agenda." Are NARAL’s numbers and claims correct? We asked Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, for sources of the information. Let’s start with the statement that abstinence-only education costs the state $400,000. Keene said that’s a reference to match money Virginia provided to receive a federal grant for abstinence-only sex education. The payment allows Virginia to participate in the Title V Abstinence Education Grant Program administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program promotes abstinence until marriage to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases. Last September, HHS announced Virginia would receive an $889,973 grant for abstinence education for fiscal 2010. States have until Sept. 30, 2012, to spend the money. The federal cash pays for 57 percent of the cost of abstinence programs approved by HHS. Participating states are required to provide the remaining 43 percent of cost. The match money can come from a variety of sources including from state coffers, foundation dollars and in-kind donations. Virginia was required to come up with about $670,000 to match the grant. Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said in an e-mail that the state is paying $382,688 towards the match. The rest is coming from in-kind contributions and community organizations awarded contracts to implement the sexual abstinence programs. So NARAL is near the bull’s-eye in claiming Virginia is paying an "approximate" $400,000 for abstinence-until marriage programs. Caldwell noted that the state received federal abstinence education funding under previous governors going back to the 1990s. But in 2007, Democratic Governor Tim Kaine cut the state’s funding for abstinence-only education. McDonnell reversed that decision last year. At the same time, McDonnell chose not to seek money from another federal grant program that teaches students about contraception in addition to abstinence -- the Personal Responsibility Education Program. Unlike the federal abstinence-only money, the comprehensive sex education grant requires no match. McDonnell’s refusal to participate drew criticism from NARAL and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. That brings us to the second part of NARAL’s claim, that Virginia lost $2.5 million in federal money for comprehensive sex education under McDonnell. As a source, NARAL cited an HHS 49-page announcement of the PREP grant, which was created under the 2010 health care reform law. The HHS synopsis shows Virginia was estimated to receive a total of $2,593,487 during fiscal years 2010 and 2011. That’s close to NARAL’s number. But NARAL is greatly understating its case. States that didn’t apply for the grant in fiscal 2010 and 2011 are not eligible to seek funding for the 2012-2014 fiscal years. So Virginia potentially missed out on much more than $2.6 million. Estimates for 2012-2014 allotments are not available, said Kenneth Wolfe, an HHS spokesman. Let’s recap: A video by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia said that abstinence-only programs pursued under McDonnell have cost the state about $400,000. Meanwhile, the group says the state missed out on about $2.5 million in federal funding for comprehensive sex education. It’s true the state spent about $400,000 for a federal abstinence-only grant. And it’s true that the McDonnell administration did not apply for a comprehensive sex education grant that would have sent almost $2.6 million to Virginia during fiscal year 2010 and 2011. Because Virginia is now ineligible to apply for the comprehensive grant through 2014, the state will wind up declining a much greater amount of money than NARAL claimed. We won’t penalize NARAL for understating its case. Its statement is True.	None	NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia	None	None	None	2011-06-27T06:00:00	2011-06-06	['Virginia', 'Bob_McDonnell']
pomt-01872	Says Mitch McConnell voted to raise Medicare costs for a current Kentucky senior by $6,000.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/10/alison-lundergan-grimes/did-mitch-mcconnell-vote-raise-seniors-medicare-co/	It’s not officially election season until candidates start claiming one side is trying to snatch grandpa’s benefits. Welcome to the 2014 election season. In a folksy new ad in the Kentucky Senate race, Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes shares the screen with Don Disney, a retired Kentucky coalminer, who has a question for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Grimes’ Republican opponent. "I want to know how you could have voted to raise my Medicare costs by $6,000," says Don Disney. "How are my wife and I supposed to afford that?" A long silence ensues as Grimes and Disney stare at the camera. "I don’t think he’s going to answer that," Grimes offers. "I approve this message because I’ll work to strengthen Medicare, not bankrupt seniors like Don." Medicare became a contentious talking point in 2011, when Rep. Paul Ryan unveiled a budget proposal that Democrats said would "end Medicare." We named that our Lie of the Year. Does Grimes’ claim fair any better? We decided to hop in the wayback machine to find out. Where does the $6,000 figure come from? According to the Grimes campaign, the $6,000 number comes from several studies on the effect of the Ryan budget on retirees. The Ryan budget has had several incarnations over the years. This ad focuses on his 2011 proposal, according to supporting material we got from the Grimes campaign. Under the 2011 Ryan plan, Medicare would have undergone a drastic change for future retirees. Instead of the government paying doctors and hospitals for services they provide for seniors, beneficiaries would be given a voucher they could use to purchase private health insurance to cover their care. Here’s our first hurdle: Did McConnell vote for the Ryan budget? Yes, but there are two important points. First, McConnell voted for a motion to proceed on the Ryan budget, which would have allowed it to the floor for further debate and amendments. It was not a vote on final passage. It was a preliminary vote that even the Washington Post wrote was "mostly symbolic" because it had no chance of succeeding in the Democratic Senate. (The plan passed in the Republican-controlled House.) The motion ultimately failed 40 to 57. Second, budget resolutions are not legally binding. Presidents do not sign them. It is a general outline of spending priorities that, when agreed upon, is a helpful guide. But it would require subsequent legislation to actually change Medicare programs to accomplish Ryan’s goals. Still, it’s probably fair to say McConnell was on the record supporting the Ryan budget, at least enough to get it to the Senate floor. But did it actually increase Disney’s Medicare costs by $6,000? The Congressional Budget Office, the top fiscal scorekeeper for lawmakers, said implementing the 2011 Ryan plan would lead to an increase in out-of-pocket costs for seniors. How much? Instead of paying 27 percent of all their health care costs, seniors would be paying about 61 percent. (Worth noting: Ryan subsequently changed his plan to try to reduce the cost-sharing burden on seniors in later versions of his budget.) In real dollars, the Kaiser Family Foundation said the average senior would pay about $6,800 a year more in health care costs. The Grimes campaign also pointed us to 2011 studies by Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, that put the figure at about $6,350. But here’s the catch: these figures looked at what a 65-year-old would pay in 2022. That’s because under the Ryan plan, wholesale changes to the Medicare program would not directly affect anyone 55 or older. We learned from the Grimes campaign that Disney, the retiree in her ad, is 75 years old. So under no version of the Ryan plan would Disney be liable for the $6,000-plus in additional out-of-pocket costs that future beneficiaries would have faced if the proposal had passed. The Grimes campaign responded that in addition to changing Medicare for future beneficiaries, the Ryan budget also repealed the Affordable Care Act. That would affect current seniors in at least one way: prescription drug costs. How? Before the Affordable Care Act, seniors were required to pay 100 percent of prescription costs after the first $2,850 until they surpassed $4,550, at which point they would qualify for catastrophic coverage. By 2020, the Affordable Care Act eliminates that gap. If Obamacare was repealed, this benefit would disappear for seniors, including those currently 65 or older. So some seniors would pay more in prescription drug costs, though we don’t know how much on average. Ryan’s budget also would have cut federal spending for Medicaid, the joint federal-state program for low-income individuals, and converted the program into block grants that states could decide how to spend, Grimes’ campaign added. While we don’t know how states would have used the money, it’s possible changes to Medicaid could have impacted low-income seniors who receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Again, that figure is not concrete. These are both relevant talking points and worthy of consideration in the grand debate on Ryan’s proposal. However, they have little to do with the $6,000 figure used in the ad. Our ruling In the Grimes campaign ad, a Kentucky resident claims that McConnell "voted to raise my medicare costs by $6,000." The $6,000 figure cited in multiple studies measures a specific amount: The average out-of-pocket costs a new senior would pay in 2022 if Medicare changed to a more privatized system. People who turned 65 prior to 2022, like the retiree in Grimes’ ad, would remain in the current Medicare system and would not incur those costs. The counterpoint from the Grimes campaign is existing seniors will have to pay some costs if the Ryan plan passes. That may be true, but the $6,000 figure is completely unrelated to that discussion, and using a statistic about future retirees to make a broader point about current retirees makes for a misleading ad. We rate the claim False.	None	Alison Lundergan Grimes	None	None	None	2014-07-10T16:24:50	2014-07-10	['Mitch_McConnell', 'Medicare_(United_States)', 'Kentucky']
pomt-11916	"The child tax credit, if we don't do it, there will be no tax relief for working families. How much tax relief working families get under tax reform is entirely dependent on whether or not we put in place an increase to the child tax credit."	/florida/statements/2017/oct/19/marco-rubio/rubio-says-child-tax-credit-key-amount-tax-relief-/	The Trump administration and Senate and House leaders have revealed a framework for tax legislation that proposes tax cuts for business, a reduction in tax brackets, and the elimination of several tax breaks. What the plan means for Americans remains to be determined. But Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., recently said that the amount of tax relief working families receive under the plan is entirely dependent on one thing: what happens to the child tax credit. "The child tax credit, if we don't do it, there will be no tax relief for working families," Rubio said on WFLA on Oct. 15. "How much tax relief working families get under tax reform is entirely dependent on whether or not we put in place an increase to the child tax credit." We wondered whether increasing the child tax credit will be the only way that working families can gain under the framework. What we found is that the child tax credit is indeed central in the current tax proposal. However, the plan is so tentative that it’s premature to say that will be the only way "working families" will see relief. Why the child tax credit is key Rubio’s team sought to back up his assertion with a press release that included two charts. Both charts relayed the same message: In order to help working families, a tax plan must increase the child tax credit and make the credit refundable. So in Rubio’s mind, expanding — not just increasing — the child tax credit is key in seeing working families prosper. The Trump-backed tax framework proposes increasing the credit from the current amount of $1,000 and raising the current income threshold at which the credit phases out. Experts agreed that expanding the child tax credit is one of the central provisions that will shape the impact that middle-income households will experience under the framework. Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation, said the existing, $1,000 child tax credit is already quite large. Parents with children under the age of 17 are eligible for a tax credit of up to $1,000 per child. If they owe more than $1,000 in taxes, then the credit lowers their tax liability, or the total amount of tax left on their income. If parents owe less than $1,000 in taxes then the tax liability is reduced to zero. In its current form this tax credit is nonrefundable. Greenberg said that under current law, a married household with two children making $60,000 would owe about $3,733 in individual income taxes before taking the child credit into account. After taking the child credit into account, the household’s individual income tax burden would fall to about $1,733. (His math assumes that the household takes the standard deduction and does not claim any other major credits, exclusions, or other provisions.) Still, it’s not just about increasing the credit. Transforming it into a refundable credit is also important. In 2015, Rubio and Mike Lee, R-Utah, released a tax plan that connected the child tax credit to the payroll tax, which would have increased the refundability rate. At the time, experts were unsure whether this would have benefitted low-income families because it didn’t include an expansion for them. Another reason why expanding the child tax credit is important is because the current framework eliminates the personal exemption — that is, the untaxed income pegged to the number of dependents on their return. This provision disproportionately benefits households with children. To compensate for eliminating it, the plan proposes increasing the child tax credit. "It looks like they’ll pay more under the current framework, but that’s where the child tax credit comes into play," said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. "It does its magic and wipes away that tax liability." Is it the only way working families will see relief? It’s worth emphasizing that the details of the child tax credit are a work in progress. Right now, the plan does not specify how much the credit would increase or which incomes level would qualify. More broadly, little is known about the thresholds of new income tax brackets, which could greatly affect the distribution of benefits. "From the sketchy details we have of the basic (framework), it’s pretty fair to say the child tax credit is key," said Edward McCaffrey, a tax law professor at the University of Southern California. As a result, the credit has emerged as one of few options available to policymakers looking to change the tax burden on middle-income households. Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, bemoaned the focus on a specific tax break such as the child credit, favoring instead overall tax simplification. In that context, Edwards said, policymakers have lots of ways to cut taxes on moderate-income Americans. Maag, meanwhile, pointed to proposals outside the framework that would expand the earned income tax credit. For example, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., introduced a very large increase in that credit -- a refundable credit targeted at low-income working Americans -- that would provide benefits to low- and middle-income families Our ruling Rubio said if tax reform efforts don’t expand the child tax credit, "there will be no tax relief for working families." That’s a bit overstated, since the tax proposal is in its early stages. That said, judging by what’s in the initial framework, experts say that the child tax credit is one of the few levers that could significantly affect the size of the tax burden for middle-income households.

pomt-04721	"There is an increasing amount of evidence from public polling that the highest number of Americans ever identify themselves as pro-life."	/florida/statements/2012/aug/31/marco-rubio/rubio-says-those-identifying-themselves-pro-life-a/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., answered questions about abortion on Face the Nation on the eve of the Republican National Convention. Here is part of Rubio’s response: "Yes, Mitt Romney is pro-life, and the Republican Party -- although it has diversity on this issue -- is the home of the pro-life movement in American politics," Rubio said. "So are a growing number of Americans, by the way. There is an increasing amount of evidence from public polling that the highest number of Americans ever identify themselves as pro- life." We wanted to check to see if Rubio was correct that there is increasing evidence that the highest number of Americans ever identify themselves as pro-life. Polls that ask respondents to identify as "pro-life" or "pro-choice" The Gallup poll asked this question regularly between 1995 and 2008: "With respect to the abortion issue, would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life?" Those responding "pro-life" were anywhere from 33 percent to 46 percent between 1995 and 2008. In May 2009, there was a change: 51 percent said they were "pro-life" and 42 percent "pro-choice." Just two months later in July 2009, the pro-life percentage dropped to 47 percent and stayed in that ballpark for a couple of years. The most recent Gallup data available -- May 2012 -- shows 50 percent referring to themselves as "pro-life" and 41 percent "pro-choice." So that means between 1995 and 2012, the percentage considering themselves pro-life rose from 33 percent to 50 percent. And the percentage identifying as "pro-choice" dropped from 56 percent to 41 percent. Gallup said that the "pro-choice" response was at a record low in 2012. It stated that identification with the labels had shifted "from a wide lead for the pro-choice position in the mid-1990s, to a generally narrower lead for ‘pro-choice’ -- from 1998 through 2008 -- to a close division between the two positions since 2009." Gallup found the pro-life position ahead twice -- in May 2009 and May 2012 -- but said it remained to be seen whether those were temporary spikes or would be sustained. Gallup noted that Democrats’ positions changed the least on abortion, while the percentage of Republicans and independents identifying as pro-life increased. The recent shift in abortion views is not due to a change in the political composition of the samples, Gallup said. We found one other poll that asks respondents if they identify with "pro-life" or "pro-choice." PollingReport.com, which lists multiple polls from different organizations, showed that a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll in 2011 asked "on the issue of abortion, would you say you are more pro-life or more pro-choice?" Starting in 2009, each year more respondents chose "pro-life" than "pro-choice." (This poll showed occasionally pro-life edged out pro-choice narrowly in a few additional years.) For the most recent year listed, 50 percent said "pro-life" while 42 percent said "pro-choice" in 2011. Polls that ask other abortion-related questions But there are lots of different ways pollsters ask Americans for their opinions on abortion that don’t ask respondents to characterize themselves as "pro-life" or "pro-choice." These questions show that the abortion debate isn’t black and white -- the results change if pollsters ask Americans if they support abortion under certain circumstances, support Roe v. Wade or other questions about abortion. Gallup's longest-running measure of abortion views, established in 1975, asks Americans if abortion should be legal in all or certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances. That middle position of legal in certain circumstances has almost always been in the 50 percent range. The number was 52 percent in May 2012, while 25 percent chose "legal under any circumstances." Abortion-rights supporters emphasize that combined statistic to argue that most Americans support abortion in all or some circumstances. But opponents of abortion rights point to the poll question that shows when asked to narrow "certain" circumstances, more choose "only a few" rather than "most" circumstances. When you add those who chose "illegal in all circumstances" and those who said legal in "few" that adds up to a majority, said David O’Steen, director of National Right to Life. Wellesley economics professor Phillip Levine, who wrote a book on abortion policy, said that Rubio’s claim is technically correct since it simply refers to Americans using the "pro-life" or "pro-choice" labels. "How people label themselves as pro-choice or pro-life is probably of secondary importance to what sorts of policies they support," he said. "In that view of the world there has been very little movement. I would be hard-pressed to imagine other policies that have that level of stability." Most Americans have fallen into the middle category for decades of supporting abortion in certain circumstances. Our ruling Rubio said, "There is an increasing amount of evidence from public polling that the highest number of Americans ever identify themselves as pro-life." Rubio’s claim is carefully worded. He referred to Americans identifying themselves as "pro-life," so that would allow him to zero in on polls that specifically ask questions about labels. Gallup polls show that the percentage of Americans that consider themselves "pro-life" has increased from 33 percent in 1995 to 50 percent in May 2012. But policy matters more than labels. When pollsters ask respondents other questions about abortion -- such as if they favor abortion in limited cases -- the answers become more complicated, and it’s not easy to categorize those positions as "pro-life" or "pro-choice." Rubio has avoided those nuances, however, by carefully wording his statement. We rate this claim Mostly True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.

pomt-10711	"So what sort of services does Romney's health care plan provide? Per the state Web site: $50 co-pay for abortions."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/27/fred-thompson/indeed-abortions-are-covered/	Fred Thompson's campaign is trying to take the much-touted health insurance program that Mitt Romney helped create as governor of Massachusetts and turn it into a liability with conservative Republican voters who dominate the party's primary elections. The Thompson campaign, which has been playing up the former U.S. senator's antiabortion stances, sent out this e-mail in November 2007: "So what sort of services does Romney's health care plan provide? Per the state Web site: $50 co-pay for abortions. "While court mandate requires Massachusetts to cover 'medically necessary' abortions in state-subsidized health plans, Mitt Romney's plan covers ALL abortions -- no restrictions." And it's true. One of the crowning moments of Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts was the creation of Commonwealth Care, a state-run, state-subsidized health insurance program for people making up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Although private insurers provide the coverage, the state helps pay the bills and determines what services must be covered. That list includes abortion. And the co-pay is indeed $50. Romney has recently sought to distance himself from some details of the plan, but he has touted it in debates and interviews as a model for the nation. "I love it. It's a fabulous program," Romney said during a May 3, 2007, Republican debate in Simi Valley, Calif. "Now I know there's some people who wonder about it. Sen. Kennedy at the signing of the bill, we were all there together, he said, 'You know, if you've got Mitt Romney and Ted Kennedy agreeing to the same bill, that means one thing -- one of us didn't read it.' "But I helped write it. And I knew it well. ...The market can work to solve our health care needs, and 27 other states are working on health care programs now. It's a great program, a great opportunity for the entire country." Romney's campaign counters that the decision about what services to cover was ultimately left up to the independent Commonwealth Care Authority. But Romney was well-represented: Of the six policy-making members of the authority's 10-member board, half are appointed by the governor, and half by the state attorney general. Half of the ex-officio members also are appointed by the governor, including the chairman -- the governor's secretary of administration and finance -- and the state insurance commission. Although Romney shares responsiblity with the state legislature and the program's board, Commonwealth Care was his pet project, and he takes credit for it. We find Thompson's claims true.

pomt-05019	"Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Sean Duffy’s Republican Majority."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-says-p/	Democrats have freshman Republican Congressman Sean Duffy, R-Wisconsin, a former Ashland County district attorney, on their 2012 targets list. That was especially evident when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee unleashed a July 2, 2012 news release taking aim at Duffy’s campaign contributors. The release begins: "Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Sean Duffy’s (WI-07) Republican Majority." Quite a claim. But hardly an original one. The DCCC made an identical Chinese prostitution attack against Jim Renacci, a Republican House member in Ohio. They also used it against Republican congressmen Scott DesJarlais in Tennessee and Jim Gerlach in Pennsylvania. What’s behind this lurid campaign finance claim? Our colleagues in PolitiFact Ohio dug into the issue after Renacci was targeted. Here’s what they found: The charge is tied to billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who has donated millions to Republicans. A fired former employee of Adelson’s filed a lawsuit which alleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at properties his company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China. PolitiFact Ohio continued: The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn’t spent anything so far. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle. A spokesman for the Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always "maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson’s character." In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, Adelson said there’s not a "shred of evidence" to back his former employee’s charges, and "says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the … claims even more preposterous." Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau. The DCCC says "Adelson has given $5 million to Speaker (John) Boehner’s Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, pledged $5 million to Leader (Eric) Cantor’s Young Guns Network Super PAC, given $70,800 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and has committed at least $20 million into Karl Rove’s American Crossroads." So Adelson has contributed or pledged plenty of money to Republican candidates or committees. That’s clear. But the Chinese prostitution link is another matter. Here’s how PolitiFact Ohio put it in their review of the claim against Renacci: Do unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson’s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC’s claim that "foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority?" We don’t think so. Neither do we. As our Ohio colleagues point out, the allegation that Adelson allowed prostitution at the Macau comes from a fired employee. The DCCC takes that claim and says money from prostitution was included in Adelson’s campaign contributions to GOP congressional incumbents -- including Duffy. There’s no evidence that Duffy received contributions from Adelson, and he has no control over contributions to groups that support him. "The claim that Adelson’s donations to these other groups amount to ‘Chinese prostitution money’ is dubious enough that inserting the word ‘allegedly’ can’t save it," PolitiFact Ohio wrote in its assessment. That holds no matter what name is inserted into the cut-and-paste news release. You can repeat a claim, but the smell of smoke remains the same. Pants on Fire.

pomt-09501	"Holly Turner... still takes her homestead (property tax) exemption in Fort Worth."	/texas/statements/2010/feb/23/paul-workman/workman-says-turner-claims-her-homestead-exemption/	Businessman Paul Workman, one of three Republicans vying for a Texas House seat representing the southwestern portion of Travis County, has lived in the county about 25 years longer than opponent Holly Turner, whose campaign says she moved to Austin from Forth Worth in July. Workman has denounced her as a "carpetbagger," and started airing a radio ad Feb. 18 that suggests Turner is too new to the district to hold office. Among his claims: She "still takes her homestead exemption in Fort Worth." Does Workman have it right? Craig Murphy, a spokesman for Turner's campaign, flatly denied the charge, saying: "She doesn't have a homestead exemption in Forth Worth — she doesn't have a homestead exemption at all." Eric Bearse, a consultant for Workman's campaign, shot back: "She is trying to disown the downtown Fort Worth condo she bragged about just five months ago in a publication." According to Murphy, Turner's husband, Chris, has owned a condominium in downtown Fort Worth since April 2006 — eight months before he and Turner married. The two are featured in the September 2009 issue of Fort Worth Magazine enjoying the digs. Murphy said, however, that the couple moved to Austin in July 2009. Their son, Carter, started school in Austin in August. Still, the Turners met the state's criteria to qualify for the exemption on their 2009 property taxes. That is, Chris Turner owned it and they occupied it as their primary residence on Jan. 1, 2009. Also, neither spouse claimed a homestead exemption on another property (legally, they can only claim one homestead exemption between them). Holly Turner's name isn't on the deed, according to the Tarrant County property tax record — her husband's is, so he's the only one who can legally apply for and claim a homestead exemption for the property, said Mark Hutcheson, a partner at the Austin-based property tax law firm Popp, Gray & Hutcheson, LLP. The exemption cut about $900 from his property taxes, which were paid from the couple's joint checking account Jan. 31, according to tax records. Hutcheson said it's too soon to know if Chris Turner can claim a homestead exemption for 2010 because the Tarrant County Appraisal District won't re-evaluate whether the property qualifies for one until about April. Murphy said the Turners have been trying to sell the Fort Worth property for about a year, though it's not currently on a multiple listing service. Jo Ann Hicks Royer, the director of relocation at Williams Trew in Forth Worth, a real estate company that listed the Turners' condominium for about six months, called the condo market "very very slow." Hutcheson suggested it's appropriate for Holly Turner to say it's her husband's homestead exemption, not hers. Since her husband owned the condo since before they were married (we couldn't independently confirm this, but Murphy said they were married in New Zealand in December 2006), it's not community property, Hutcheson said. But Judon Fambrough, an attorney at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University, suggested that regardless of who legally owns the property and seeks the homestead exemption benefit, Holly Turner still enjoys the resulting reduction in taxes. That's a common reality. "Community... separate... it don't matter," Fambrough said. "He'll get the tax statement so he can claim the homestead exemption and the wife will benefit." Until July, the Fort Worth condo was Holly and Chris Turner's primary residence. As such, it qualified for the state's homestead tax exemption. While Holly Turner can't personally claim the exemption, it would be disingenuous to maintain that she didn't benefit from the tax break. By the same token, to suggest that she doesn't live in Travis County because her husband received a home exemption for 2009 is misleading. Workman could safely say his opponent enjoyed the tax benefits of her household's Tarrant County homestead exemption. He overreaches by saying Turner personally takes the exemption. We rate Workman's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Mandel emphasized the overwhelming vote for a state constitutional amendment that registers opposition to President Barack Obama’s health care reforms. Democrats, meanwhile, have cheered the resounding repeal of GOP-backed restrictions on collective bargaining for public employees. Over the course of a sometimes fawning 12-minute interview by host Howard Kaloogian, Mandel made several incendiary comments about the Avon Democrat. One particular statement caught PolitiFact Ohio’s ear. Asked how Ohioans’ health care and labor votes foreshadow 2012, Mandel referenced the Occupy Wall Street protests that began in New York two months ago and spread to communities across the country. Mandel specifically focused on reports of distasteful demonstrations that Republicans have sought to make representative of the entire movement. Brown is "out there egging on a lot of these protesters who are spitting on policemen and going to the bathroom on policemen’s cars at these protests on Wall Street and other places," he said. It was a bold accusation -- one that had us eager to find evidence of Ohio’s senior senator encouraging such offensive behavior. But we didn’t, because no such evidence exists. We first tried Joe Aquilino, a spokesman for Mandel’s campaign who pointed PolitiFact Ohio to emails and a website posting in which Brown offers supportive words for Occupy protesters. "It’s time to fight back," reads a page on Brown’s campaign website that asks visitors to stand with him as he fights for working families. "Sherrod Brown is a senator for the 99 percent of Americans who play by the rules and have had enough of Wall Street running the show." The web plea does not refer directly to Occupy Wall Street or to protesters, but the sentiments are the same. While some of the words might be seen as inflammatory, nowhere does Brown suggest that angry citizens spit on law enforcement officials or defecate on a police car. There have been reports of both types of behavior. A photograph that went viral after being obtained by the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail shows a man squatting over an NYPD cruiser. Brown, in case you were wondering, is not in the picture. Aquilino also referred us to a video, posted to YouTube, in which a band at an Occupy Portland rally jams to a repetitive chorus of "F--- the USA." Brown was nowhere near that protest. Brown did appear on the MSNBC program "Hardball with Chris Matthews" on Oct. 7. In the interview, which Mandel cited when asked about his claim, Brown praised the protesters. "I think the energy coming out of the Wall Street protesters is always a good thing," he said. Brown then seemed to immediately amend the "always" by clarifying: "When people nonviolently speak out and stand for something, it’s good to challenge authority when they do that." There was no call for such physical forms of protest -- quite the opposite, in fact. Asked about Mandel’s claim, Brown spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak offered an emailed statement stressing the senator’s support for police officers. Brown, she added in a subsequent telephone conversation, does not condone the type of behavior Mandel specified. But while none of the provided examples proves Brown encouraged protesters to attack police officers with their spit or stool, Aquilino maintains Mandel never implied otherwise on the radio. Mandel was "referencing the protesters in general," Aquilino said. "It’s a bigger-picture view of the movement. We’re not saying Sherrod Brown is out there saying to do these things." Aquilino also wrote in an email that "Josh was saying that Sherrod is supporting the protesters … who in some cases have decided to defecate on cars and spit" on police officers. But for PolitiFact Ohio, words matter. If Mandel was, as Aquilino claims, speaking "in general" and with a "bigger-picture view," why, then, did Mandel dwell on two very specific story lines? And "supporting" is far more passive than "egging on," which according to Merriam-Webster dictionary, is "to incite to action." As a public official, Mandel knows words matter. And given the incendiary level of other comments he made in the interview (he says at one point that Brown has "vilified capitalism" and views anyone who creates jobs as "the enemy.") his clear meaning was that Brown was encouraging protesters who are "spitting on policemen and going to the bathroom on policemen’s cars." That statement is not accurate and also makes a ridiculous claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates Pants on Fire.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2011-11-18T06:00:00	2011-11-14	['None']
pomt-10381	"I joined the Gang of 14, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, so that we wouldn't blow up the United States Senate. Sen. Obama had the opportunity to join that group. He chose not to."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/20/john-mccain/obama-not-one-of-the-gang/	In the contest to claim the title as the true champion of bipartisan politics, both Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama often portray themselves as the man most likely to have success reaching across the aisle to break the logjam of Washington politics. To bolster his case, McCain recently harkened back to the spring of 2005, when he was part of a small bipartisan effort to resolve a bitter standoff between Senate Democrats and Republicans over three conservative judicial nominees named by President George W. Bush. "I joined the Gang of 14, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, so that we wouldn't blow up the United States Senate," McCain said in a virtual town hall meeting on June 14, 2008. "Sen. Obama had the opportunity to join that group. He chose not to." At the time, the Democrats were using the filibuster to block confirmation votes on some conservative judges. Traditionally, the selection of judges had been viewed as a presidential power that was not to be curtailed. Senators felt free to vote against a nomination, but using procedural powers in the Senate to keep them from coming to a vote at all hadn't been done. The idea that Democrats were willing to use the filibuster to block judges was seen by many as an affront to the protocol-driven operations of the Senate. The Republicans, headed by Bill Frist, were bucking for the so-called "nuclear option," in which they would approve a series of procedural changes to allow the Senate to end filibusters with a majority vote, rather than a "supermajority" vote of 60 votes (essentially putting an end to the practice altogether). As part of the Gang of 14 compromise, the Democrats agreed not to support furthering the filibuster of the judicial nominees and not to initiate filibusters of future nominations except under "extreme circumstances." In exchange, the Republicans agreed not to vote with Frist on the "nuclear option." To be sure, McCain caught a lot of political heat from hard-line members of his party who wanted to move ahead with the "nuclear option." Obama was not one of the seven Democrats on the Gang of 14. At the time, Obama reluctantly supported the filibuster. "I'm not a huge fan of the filibuster," Obama was quoted as saying in April 2005. "Historically, what was it used for? Keeping me (an African-American) out of polling places." Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of the Gang of 14, told McClatchy Newspapers in March 2008 that it was unfair to emphasize Obama's absence from the bipartisan group, because he wasn't pressed to join. "When we got to seven (Democrats) counting myself, there was some discussion of expanding it," Nelson said, "but there was the thought it would be more unworkable." In his book, The Audacity of Hope, Obama states: "I declined to be a part of what would be called the Gang of 14; given the profiles of some of the judges involved, it was hard to see what judicial nominee might be so much worse as to constitute an 'extraordinary circumstance' worthy of filibuster. Still, I could not fault my colleagues for their efforts. The Democrats involved had made a practical decision — without the deal, the 'nuclear option' would have likely gone through." In an interview with the St. Petersburg Times on May 21, 2008, Obama was less generous in his assessment of the deal. "The Republicans like to emphasize the Gang of 14 because frankly the Republicans got everything they wanted out of that," Obama said. "I don't think it was a particularly good compromise." One can attach whatever significance one wants to McCain's statement, but the bottom line is that it's accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-08728	Sharron Angle "would eliminate the Department of Education."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/01/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-sharron-angle-wants-eliminate-educ/	The Nevada Senate race between incumbent Democrat Harry Reid and Republican challenger Sharron Angle has become one of the nation's most bitter, with Angle seeking to make Reid the poster child for the poor national and Nevada economies and Reid trying to portray Angle's staunchly conservative views as out of the mainstream. In a television ad released Aug. 23, 2010, Reid's campaign says that Angle wants to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. The ad relies on a clip from an interview Angle did with radio station KNPR, the NPR affiliate in Nevada, on May 19, 2010, when she was running in the GOP primary. The exchange quoted in the ad begins with the host asking Angle, "Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back?" Angle replies, "I would like to go through to the elimination." We wanted to look through the rest of the interview to make sure that Angle really does believe that the department should be eliminated. First, a little background on the Education Department. Its budget for fiscal year 2010 is about $64 billion. Of this, nearly $27 billion consists of Pell Grants, which fund disadvantaged students in college and graduate school. Another $25 billion is authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including funding to K-12 school systems around the country. An additional $12 billion comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which helps fund education for disabled K-12 students. Much of the remainder is spent on educational research. We went to the archived interview and found that the ad doesn't distort her view. Here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview: "I believe that anything that isn't a federally governed, enumerated power in the Constitution, which means the federal government should be paying out on this, is up for grabs here," she said. "And we have some departments like the Department of Education that passes down policy, one-size-fits-all, that fits no one. Like No Child Left Behind. We need to keep those education dollars right here in the state and put them where they will do the most good, which is right in that clasroom, with that classroom teacher. We need to cut down on those bureaucracies that take those educational dollars that should be going into that classroom. "And it angers me every time I hear (politicians) say we're going to cut teachers," she continued. "What about the agencies that never see a child, never have been in a classroom, that are passing down policy that actually overburdens our classrooms. What about those? Why don't we cut there?" That's when the host interjects. "Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back?" Angle responds, "I would like to go through to the elimination. I think we start by defunding it, and the reason that we should eliminate it is because its not the federal government's job to provide education for our children. It's a 10th Amendment right. It should be done here in the state, and it should be done as close to the local as possible." Reviewing the exchange on KNPR, it seems to us that the ad portrayed Angle's stance accurately. She did not hesitate, backtrack or give any indication that she misspoke, even when the host gave her the opportunity to roll back the scope of her proposal. She's expressed that position before, in a Mar. 22, 2010, interview with the conservative website Nevada News & Views, when she said she would like to eliminate not just the Education Department but the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency as well. It's worth noting that there's been a long-running constitutional debate about whether the Education Department is legitimate. Erwin Chemerinsky, the liberal dean of the University of California (Irvine) law school, argues that it's proper because of Congress' spending power. Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute counters that the 10th Amendment's assigning of all unlisted powers to the states makes it "plain and obvious that there is no constitutional authority" for it. Regardless, on the issue raised by Reid's ad -- whether Sharron Angle "would eliminate the Department of Education" -- we found that yes, she did say she wanted to do so in several public forums. So we rate the Reid ad True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2010-09-01T17:52:48	2010-08-23	['None']
pomt-01591	Opponent Glenn Hegar expressed pride in legislated cuts to public school funding.	/texas/statements/2014/sep/05/mike-collier/mike-collier-says-opponent-glenn-hegar-was-proud-l/	Houston businessman Mike Collier, the Democratic nominee for state comptroller, launched a video ad in August 2014 suggesting the Republican candidate, state Sen. Glenn Hegar of Katy, took pride in big cuts to public education. In Collier’s ad, the narrator says Hegar "voted to cut more than $5 billion from Texas schools, money for teachers, computers, even books -- all cut." This was a reference to actions taken by the Republican-majority 2011 Legislature in the face of a multi-billion-dollar projected revenue shortfall. "And Hegar is proud of it," Collier’s narrator says. Next, the ad shows Hegar saying: "Some people are saying, 'Oh, we’ve put more money into education.’ No we didn’t. There’s no way you can spin that. No we didn’t. But I was not ashamed to say we didn’t. I was proud that we did not." We waded into this after noticing a news account with a dash of doubt about why Hegar was proud. It wouldn’t necessarily shock if Hegar took pride. In June 2011, he issued a press release expressing pride in lawmakers balancing the 2012-13 budget in the face of a projected $27 billion revenue shortfall without tapping the rainy day fund or raising taxes; his release called the result "amazing" and "remarkable." And while Hegar made no direct reference to the school cuts, he hailed "a fiscally sound and responsible budget that funds essential services and forces state government to live within its means, just as Texas families must do." By email, Collier spokeswoman Chaille Jolink said Collier based his claim on Hegar’s comments some 38 minutes into his videotaped 2013 meeting with the Montgomery County Tea Party, which was posted on YouTube Dec. 31, 2013. Roll tape! In a question-and-answer period with group members, Hegar said he favors delivering education smarter and cheaper, perhaps online. The comptroller plays a role managing dollars, he said. "You’re really the watchdog for the taxpayers," he said. Our transcribed excerpt picks up with a member’s follow-up comment. Montgomery County Tea Party: "I think our whole education system needs to come under an audit because there’s somebody getting a lot of money and it’s not teachers. And education isn’t getting any better." Hegar (nodding): "Whenever -- I mentioned this to somebody the other day -- I said that whenever we did the cut; you mentioned earlier (gesturing away from the questioner) the cuts to education, and some people went out and said -- (gesturing in another direction) it was almost like your question earlier, was the budget balanced or was it not balanced? -- some people were saying oh, we’ve put more money into education. "No we didn’t (shaking head back and forth). There’s no way you can spin that. No, we didn’t. But I was not ashamed to say we didn’t. I was proud that we did not. "I had a lot of" school district "superintendents come up to me and tell me, you know what, thanks, because I’ve been needing to cut something over here and I’ve never been able to and you gave me the excuse. Now one, I’m about to jump on you because you just told me you wanted to and you should have, but you didn’t?… It really opened my eyes when somebody would say that we really needed to cut this stuff but I didn’t have a good excuse and you just gave it to me." MCTP: "So you were a scapegoat." Hegar: "That’s fine. I was happy to be the scapegoat; it didn’t bother me." We let Hegar’s campaign know we were checking on his declaration of pride. Spokesman David White emailed us a statement saying: "As a father of three children in public schools, Sen. Hegar believes in adequately funding our education system." White also urged us to read an Aug. 8, 2014 news blog post by the Dallas Morning News presenting a slightly different recap of Hegar's comments to the tea-party group. White then said Collier presented Hegar’s remarks "out of context." According to the tea-party video, the News’ story said, Hegar "recounts what apparently are constituent comments about last year’s restoration of nearly $4 billion of the earlier cuts. That’s when he says he was proud not to have ‘put more money in education. … There’s no way you could spend that.’" In our views of the video, we didn’t hear the senator referring to money restored. Also, we heard Hegar’s latter remark as: "There’s no way you can spin that." Our ruling Collier said Hegar was proud to cut public school funding. In 2013, Hegar said he was unashamed and proud to stand behind the cuts that Republicans passed into law. We rate Collier’s statement True.
