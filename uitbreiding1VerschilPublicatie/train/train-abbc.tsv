abbc-00256	The controversy over dual nationality that has engulfed the Australian Parliament since mid-July now involves at least seven politicians from the Government, the Greens and One Nation.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-08/fact-check-the-high-court-and-dual-citizenship-scandal/8874064	Contrary to Mr Dreyfus's claim, the situation is not cut and dried. In those cases the court said that for a person to be eligible to stand and be elected to Parliament he or she must take "all steps that could reasonably be taken to renounce" any foreign nationality or citizenship. Looking at the facts in isolation, Mr Joyce, Senator Canavan and Senator Nash did not meet that requirement, as all continued to be dual citizens after being elected. But the matter is not black and white: the court has not had to deal with a situation exactly like this one before. In the previous cases, the people in question were not Australians from birth and there was no dispute that they knew that they obtained citizenship of another country at some point in their lives. It is open to the High Court to completely overturn its existing interpretation of section 44(i). Alternatively, the court can add or clarify its existing interpretation to take into account these different circumstances. This is the position conveyed by the Solicitor-General and the legal representatives of Senator Canavan and Mr Joyce at a recent High Court directions hearing. Whether this would constitute a "change" to the existing position is up for debate.

abbc-00121	An argument has erupted over the rate of casual employment in the Australian workforce with unions claiming it is on the rise, and Workplace and Deregulation Minister Craig Laundy dismissing this as a lie.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-17/fact-check-casualisation/9654334	Mr Laundy's claim checks out, although it relies on a narrow definition of insecure work. Over the past 20 years (to 2017), the rate of casualisation has remained within a narrow band, hovering around 24 or 25 per cent of all employees, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Fact Check notes that the terms "casual employment" and "insecure work" are used interchangeably by Mr Laundy, while the ACTU considers casual work to be a sub-set of insecure work. As one expert told Fact Check, the debate over the rate of casualisation is "beset by loose language" and, therefore, open to interpretation.

abbc-00218	The ousting of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has exposed simmering discontent within the Liberal Party over its attitude towards women, amid claims female MPs were bullied during the August leadership spill and suggestions from outside the party that Julie Bishop, then deputy leader, was overlooked for the top job due to her gender.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-27/fact-check3a-has-the-liberal-party-failed-to-achieve-gender-pa/10256464	Ms McGowan is jumping the gun. The Coalition has not yet achieved 50 per cent female membership of government boards, but this target was only set in March 2016. In the two years since, the Government has boosted female representation on boards. Data available at the time of Ms McGowan's claim, for December 2017, shows women had achieved a record 44.5 per cent board membership. This is up from 40.5 per cent recorded in June 2016, three months after the Government set the target, and from 42.7 per cent in June 2017. In total, this amounts to an increase of 4 percentage points in 18 months. Under the Coalition, between June 2016 and December 2017, female representation increased by an average of 0.22 percentage points per month. Under Labor, between June 2010 and June 2013, the average monthly increase was 0.2 percentage points. The proportion of women on boards fell back under former Coalition prime minister Tony Abbott. However, Ms McGowan's claim relates to the period since March 2016 when the Turnbull government set the 50 per cent target. On current trends, that target would be met by January 2020. Experts consulted by Fact Check said that while governments effectively control the selection of board appointees, there are constraints on how quickly they can change the composition of government boards. These include, for example, fixed terms for current board members, which typically last three to five years. Professor Meredith Edwards said that given these constraints, the rate achieved since introducing Mr Turnbull's 50 per cent target was quite good. During 2016-17, the proportion of new board appointments that went to women was 46.2 per cent, down slightly from 46.5 per cent in 2015-16, and lower than the record 47.6 per cent achieved in 2012-13, Labor's last year of government.

There are no official statistics available for the past 12 months. The most recent police statistics show that 74 people were murdered on farms in the year to March 2017. That figure is well below the 400 claimed by Mr Abbott. Moreover, it includes all farmers, workers, families and visitors and all races. More recent figures, which identify white farmers, are available from the Transvaal Agricultural Union, a group representing the interests of farmers. According to their figures, there were 84 farm murders in the 2017 calendar year. Of these, 59 victims were white farmers. A further 15 people, including 8 white farmers, were killed on farms in the first three months of 2018. That means fewer than 70 white farmers were killed in the last 15 months. The police's latest data does reveal a rise in farm murders compared with the previous year, as does the union's data. However, experts told Fact Check that these changes reflected a general increase in murders across the entire South African population since 2012.

abbc-00279	"In terms of how I have described my attitude towards negative gearing, I have always understood that for the vast majority of Australians who use negative gearing they are modest income earning Australians, nurses, teachers, police," Treasurer Scott Morrison told the National Press Club in February.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-03/fact-check-negative-gearing-scott-morrison/7180812	Mr Morrison's claim is selective. Australian Tax Office data shows that one in 10 Australians who files a tax return is negatively geared in terms of rental property. Data provided by Mr Morrison's office, based on Treasury calculations, showed 67 per cent of the people who use negative gearing have taxable incomes of $80,000 or less. This was backed up by Fact Check's analysis of ATO statistics. However, as 82 per cent of all taxpayers have taxable incomes below $80,000, it is not surprising that most of the negative gearers fall into this category. As this category represents only 67 per cent of negative gearers, it is clear that these taxpayers use negative gearing proportionately less than taxpayers with higher income. Put another way, only 8 per cent of people with taxable incomes less than $80,000 use negative gearing, compared with more than double that proportion among people with taxable incomes above $80,000. Similarly, people with taxable incomes over $80,000 receive 42 per cent of the negative gearing benefit, but they only represent 33 per cent of all negative gearers. Finally, those with a total income (including negative gearing benefit) of $52,000 a year or less — an income more in line with the definition of modest as a "moderate" or median income — represent 59 per cent of all taxpayers, but only 40 per cent of negatively geared taxpayers. Only 4 per cent of these people use negative gearing. When the negative gearing benefit is removed by taking out their rental losses, they represent 33 per cent of people who use negative gearing.

abbc-00252	Prominent barrister Geoffrey Watson SC has criticised Australia's failure to establish a federal anti-corruption watchdog, telling ABC's RN Breakfast that it puts us "out of step with our international obligations".	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-28/fact-check-is-australia-in-breach-of-anti-corruption-obligations/8974742	Mr Watson's claim that Australia is in breach of its treaty obligations is debatable. But the convention allows nations to use whatever system best suits their particular circumstances, and their approaches can be wide and varied. In Australia's case, our "multi-agency" integrity system relies on a variety of state and Commonwealth bodies to investigate corruption in the public sector. Included among these agencies is the national watchdog for investigating Commonwealth public sector corruption — the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. Experts and advocates are divided on whether this system is sufficient for Australia to comply with its treaty obligations, the result of their different interpretations of the convention's requirements. Some argue that we will not be meeting our obligations until our system is made to be effective by being comprehensive. For the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to meet this expectation, its funding would need to be increased and its jurisdiction expanded. Others say that simply by having federal law enforcement officials who are not subject to political interference could get Australia across the line. And while they argue that a single, national watchdog might be desirable, it may not be necessary for meeting our obligations. Most countries considered "cleaner" than Australia in terms of corruption do not have such a body.

abbc-00018	Many Australians try to reduce their personal carbon footprint, but do we have the same options as people in other countries?	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-17/fact-check-corolla-emissions-comparison-uk-australia/8805598	Mr Butler's claim is ill-informed. Although Australia has placed limits on emissions of "noxious air pollutants" since the 1970s, Mr Butler accurately points out that there are no mandatory standards for carbon dioxide emissions from cars. However, the evidence does not back up the idea that the Corolla vehicle that "you'll buy" in Australia emits double the carbon dioxide as the same type of car in the UK. The comparison Mr Butler refers to was one made between two very different cars in the Corolla range — an Australian petrol model and a UK petrol-electric hybrid. A closer comparison would have been between the UK and Australian petrol models, or the UK hybrid and Australian Prius which shared the same engine. Importantly, Mr Butler's comparison is also based on outdated information. The Corolla is no longer sold in the UK, having been replaced by the Toyota Auris. And a lower-emitting petrol-electric hybrid Corolla was introduced to Australia in 2016, which compares more favourably with a similarly specified hybrid Auris. So, while Mr Butler has fairly accurately described a comparison that was set out in a 2014 Climate Change Authority report, the comparison was flawed at the time and changes in model line-ups mean the figures are not valid for 2017.

abbc-00225	In the midst of a tax cut bidding war ahead of the federal election, debate recently turned to the question of whether the Turnbull Government's tax package is fair — not only to lower and middle-income earners, but also to women.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-01/fact-check-tax-cuts-women/9989858	Ms O'Dwyer's claim is misleading. While it is accurate to say 86 per cent of female taxpayers have a taxable income of $90,000 or less, the argument that this is where the Government's "tax relief" is "focused" is problematic. Only the first tranche of measures, beginning this financial year, favour people with taxable incomes of $90,000 or less. It is, however, important to point out that very low-income earners do not benefit because they pay little or no tax (moreover, a greater proportion of these very low wage earners are women). Meanwhile, the second and third stages of the tax plan, beginning July 1, 2022 and July 1, 2024, unambiguously favour people on higher incomes. This holds using several measures to gauge the meaning of "focus", including the dollar value of the tax relief provided to different income groups; the share of the cost of the package apportioned to different income groups; the share of the tax burden carried by different income groups before and after the introduction of the tax package; and, the impact of the package on disposable incomes for different income groups. Fact Check does not make a judgment about the fairness or otherwise of the tax package. Nor does it make a judgment about the affordability of the plan; nor the Government's spending priorities. What is clear, however, is that only the first stage of the tax plan is focused on people with annual incomes up to $90,000. It is possible that, in using the word "focused", Ms O'Dwyer meant the group of taxpayers earning up to $90,000 were being prioritised by receiving the first tranche of tax relief. However, she did not make this clear. Taken in its entirety, over seven years, the bulk of the benefits of the plan will flow to people earning more than $90,000 and, at the end of this period, those earning more than $90,000 will carry a smaller share of the overall tax burden. A clear majority of these taxpayers are men.

Data compiled by Kenya's Communications Authority shows more than one-third (34.2 per cent) of Kenyans have access to broadband, after factoring in 15.4 million mobile subscriptions. However, it is unlikely that the millions of Kenyans using mobile broadband services would get faster speeds than the majority of Australians. Australia also has slightly faster mobile broadband than Kenya. These factors put Australia ahead of Kenya, but Mr Turnbull is not entitled to suggest that the scale of Australia's advantage is in the order of 90:1.5.

abbc-00260	Liberal MP Craig Kelly has claimed that poorly heated homes cause more deaths in Australia than in Sweden, despite our milder winters.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-09/fact-check-australia-sweden-winter-fatalities-heating/8780588	Mr Kelly's claim is overstated. The evidence supports the claim that more Australians than Swedes die in cold temperatures, and these deaths relate to moderate – rather than extreme – cold. But while temperature is a factor, lifestyle and general health risks also play a role, making it hard to attribute winter deaths to moderate cold alone. Deaths peak every winter in Australia, with cardiovascular disease contributing significantly to the rise. And although winter increases the risks associated with circulatory diseases, this could be due to the cold or alternatively, to infections. Cold temperatures can raise blood pressure and increase cardiovascular strain, so people living in cold houses are at added risk. This would appear to support Mr Kelly's claim. But it is a stretch to say deaths are "simply" the result of inadequate heating. Our habits also play a part in keeping warm. Experts are split on the best way to address the effect of indoor cold on winter mortality. We could improve indoor temperatures through insulating or heating homes, or we could address the health problems exacerbated by the cold.

abbc-00229	The May 9 decision of the High Court in relation to the dual citizenship of Labor's Katy Gallagher has led to the departure of five politicians from Parliament, four of whom were from the Labor Party.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-08/fact-check-was-the-latest-dual-citizenship-decision-clear/9808502	The Prime Minister's claim is exaggerated. In its May 9 decision, the High Court built on its earlier reasoning and has now made clear that a political candidate's renunciation of foreign citizenship needs to be complete before nomination, unless the foreign country's laws place "irremediable" obstacles in the way. Only then does the question of whether that candidate has taken "all reasonable steps" come into play. Lawyers for the five politicians had argued that it was sufficient for a candidate to have taken all reasonable steps within their power to renounce before nomination, regardless of the response by officials of the foreign country. The May 9 decision may have been the more likely outcome given the High Court's strict interpretation of section 44 in last year's the Canavan case. But based on Fact Check's own analysis and consideration of the views of three eminent legal experts, there remained the possibility that the court would rule otherwise. This was acknowledged in the Government's own legal advice. Until May 9 uncertainty remained: the fates of politicians who had taken "all reasonable steps" to renounce British citizenship but were delayed by UK Home Office processes were not "absolutely obvious and clear".

Assuming the new rules pass the Victorian Parliament, the state will have the lowest cap on political donations in the nation. It will also have the equal lowest disclosure threshold for donations and among the most transparent reporting requirements, while also casting its net widely to include third party political campaigners. Furthermore, penalties for breaches will be equal to the toughest in the country. Even so, the new rules are far from perfect. While foreign donations will be banned in Victoria (as they are in NSW and Queensland), Victoria won't be banning donations from property developers, or from tobacco, liquor and gambling businesses, as NSW has done. Because of Victoria's failure to match NSW's list of banned donors, one expert out of four contacted by Fact Check argued that Mr Andrews' proposed laws do not go far enough to qualify as the "strictest".

abbc-00239	Labor has put hospitals at the fore of its pitch to win this week's Tasmanian election, attacking Premier Will Hodgman's record on health funding.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-28/fact-check-did-the-tasmanian-liberals-cut-210m-from-health/9483130	Labor's claim is not the full story. The $210 million figure comes from a 2014-15 budget document that predicted future savings, over four years, compared with previous budget projections. But while the Liberals did propose significant savings to budgeted spending starting four years ago, they partly reversed course, later promising an extra $100 million for frontline health services. The claim also assumes that all of the savings would have fallen on the "health" area of the Department of Health and Human Services, when many of its employees work in "human services". The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)'s latest data shows that, in its first two years, the Hodgman Government increased recurrent health funding by a combined $39 million. However, because spending failed to keep up with the state's growing demand for health services, the amount of money available for each person who needs these services decreased — though likely by less than Labor has suggested. There have also been significant job cuts under the Liberals. If redundancy payments were deducted from the AIHW's figures, total recurrent spending on health under the Liberals would likely be lower than reported.

abbc-00003	Katter's Australian Party senator Fraser Anning sees migration as a "critical problem" facing the nation, and among the solutions proposed in his controversial first speech to Parliament was a big reduction in student visas to create more places for domestic students.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-23/fact-check-fraser-anning-university-places-international-student/10147364	Senator Anning's claim is ill-informed. There is no trade-off between domestic and international university places. The number of university places available to Australian students is largely determined by the level of Commonwealth funding provided. International students pay full fees (as do a relatively small number of Australian students) and their numbers are set by the universities. They do not take places away from subsidised Australian students. In recent years, universities have dramatically scaled up their facilities to capitalise on significant growth in both international and domestic demand for university places. As experts contacted by Fact Check noted, this process has been significantly funded by full-fee-paying international students, boosting the number of places and facilities available to Australian students. Senator Anning's plan to "drastically" cut the number of international student visas would merely erode a crucial revenue stream for universities, without creating extra places for domestic students.

Polling data from Newspoll, Ipsos, Roy Morgan, and Essential Media show the Greens are not the most popular party among young voters, although some polls put the Greens at a close second to Labor.

abbc-00022	The Federal Opposition has spent a lot of time talking about "millionaires" in the wake of the May 9 budget.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-08/fact-check-has-turnbull-announced-a-tax-cut-for-millionaires/8542472	Mr Shorten's claim is over the top. The measures announced in the 2017-18 budget do not include any personal income tax cuts. Mr Turnbull has not made any "announcement" about millionaire tax cuts. An additional tax that was brought in by the Abbott government in 2014, the temporary budget repair levy, was, by law, only scheduled to last for three financial years. Unless the Parliament takes the proactive step of passing new legislation, the levy will not continue beyond June 30. And the use of the emotive term "millionaire" misleads about the type of people who have been paying the soon-to-expire levy. Mr Shorten correctly notes that the budget does include a "tax hike": the Government is increasing the Medicare levy from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent. But this increase will apply to most people including "millionaires", not just so-called "working Australians".

abbc-00264	The Government has proposed a 10-year program of business tax cuts, beginning with a cut to a 27.5 per cent rate for companies with an annual turnover of less than $2 million.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-29/fact-check-labor-on-corporate-tax-cuts/7549754	Mr Turnbull's claim is close to the mark. The Labor Party cut company tax when it was in government between 1983 and 1996. At the 2010 election, the Gillard Labor government promised to cut company tax if re-elected. When in government, senior members of the Labor Party including Bill Shorten made the same sorts of arguments that the current Government is making about company tax cuts: that they boost investment and job creation and make Australia competitive with other nations. Mr Shorten himself criticised a proposal from the Greens that would have seen the money for "big business" tax cuts diverted to health and welfare spending. Today's Labor Opposition does not merely argue that company tax cuts are unaffordable. It now ridicules the whole concept as "wasteful", "flawed", "trickle down economics" and a "giveaway" that will have a "negligible effect on job creation". The Gillard government argued that its tax cuts were affordable over the forward estimates, paid for by proceeds from the Minerals Resource Rent Tax in the context of a budget that was to return to surplus by 2013. Similarly, the current Coalition Government says that its tax cuts are affordable over the forward estimates. It bases its calculations on assumptions and projections that may ultimately prove as inaccurate as those relied on by the Gillard government.

The most recent report available at the time the claim was made shows Australia's average peak connection speed of 39.3 mbps ranked 60th in the world in the quarter ending in December 2015. Experts consulted by Fact Check said the Coalition contributed to Australia's drop in rankings for several reasons, including its policy of rolling out fibre to the node technology rather than fibre to the premises.

abbc-00220	As the dust settles on a messy leadership spill, allegations of bullying of female members of the parliamentary Liberal Party have opened a debate over whether the party has a problem with women's representation.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-13/fact-check-women-in-cabinet-scott-morrison/10230820	Mr Frydenberg's claim is overstated. In both raw number and proportional terms, it can be said that female representation in cabinet has improved from the figures in Malcolm Turnbull's cabinet in the period directly preceding his removal from office. But Mr Frydenberg's claim ignores the fact that female representation in the current cabinet is not higher than earlier periods in Mr Turnbull's time in office. Mr Morrison currently has six women in cabinet, which is as many as there were in Mr Turnbull's cabinet for almost a year at the beginning of his tenure. By the end of Mr Turnbull's term, there were only five women in cabinet, so it can be said that Mr Morrison has brought the number of women in cabinet back to its peak. After Mr Turnbull lost the leadership, Mr Morrison did increase the proportion of women at the top table by more than 5 percentage points to 26.1 per cent. But this is lower than the 27.3 per cent of Mr Turnbull's cabinet at its highest.

abbc-00223	Equality for Australian women has worsened dramatically since the beginning of this decade, with high levels of sexual harassment in the workplace, the former President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, recently warned.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-13/fact-check-global-gender-gap/10051632	Professor Triggs' claim is fair. The index benchmarks countries on their progress towards gender parity. First, it awards each country a score based on the size of its gender gap. Then, it ranks countries according to their scores. Australia's overall gender gap ranking has worsened from 23rd position in 2010 (eight years ago), to 25th in 2012 (six years ago), to 35th in 2017. Professor Triggs is correct in pointing out that Australia has "regressed to 46th in the world [2016] and then slightly come back again to the thirties [35th in 2017]." The low point in 2016 was due to Australia's worsening rankings on the measures of economic participation and opportunity for women, and political empowerment — two measures that Professor Triggs specifically highlights. Professor Triggs made her comments in the context of a panel discussion about sexism in the workplace. In reaching a verdict, Fact Check focussed on economic participation and opportunity. Significantly, Australia's ranking for economic participation and opportunity has worsened dramatically in the past six and eight years. It was in 24th position eight years ago and 22nd position six years ago. By 2017 it had slumped to 42nd position. Eight years ago it had closed 72.7 per cent of the gender gap. Six years ago it had closed 72.9 per cent of the gap and by 2017, it had closed it by 73.1 per cent. Notably, Australia closed 74.1 per cent of its gender gap in 2014 and it has not been at that level since. Professor Triggs is also correct in noting that Australia holds a number one ranking, along with other countries, when it comes to educational attainment. Finally, Australia's overall ranking has to be seen in context. According to the World Economic Forum the 2017 global gender gap report showed that slow but steady global progress on improving parity between the sexes came to a halt in 2017, with the global gender gap widening for the first time since 2006.

abbc-00254	Finance Minister Mathias Cormann evoked memories of the Cold War when he gave a speech to the Sydney Institute on the evening of August 23, on the subject of "Policies for Opportunity vs Politics of Envy".	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-20/fact-check3a-are-labor27s-policies-socialist3f/8948552	Senator Cormann's claim is sensationalist. There is no settled definition of "socialism" or "socialist policies". Socialism is a collection of ideas that have been subject to vigorous debate since the 19th century. One form of socialism is centred around public (i.e. government) ownership of "the means of production, distribution and exchange". The Australian Labor Party's national platform has long included an objective of "democratic socialism" along these lines "to the extent necessary", but it is not reflected in the party's current policies. Labor is not proposing nationalisation of Australian industries. A broader definition of socialism includes policies that use the taxation system to redistribute income and espouse government intervention in the market economy. On that basis, some of Labor's policies are, strictly speaking, "socialist". The current British Labour Party leadership and US Senator Bernie Sanders argue for similar policies, and openly describe them as socialist. But Senator Cormann goes too far when he talks of the Berlin Wall and the "system of government" that existed in Eastern Europe between 1945 and 1989. That failed totalitarian and oppressive system bears no resemblance to the policies of Australia's Labor Party.

abbc-00118	In a blistering response to the 2018 federal budget, charity group World Vision slammed the Federal Government for "continuing Australia's darkest era of aid cuts and further letting down the world's most vulnerable".	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-25/fact-check-has-foreign-aid-budget-been-cut-five-years-running/9783098	Ms Anderson's claim is correct. Across the five financial years from 2014-15 to 2018-19, the aid budget has been cut twice in nominal terms. And while data from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade shows that nominal aid spending increased marginally in the other three budget years, these gains disappear after inflation is taken into account. This equates to a real cut in all five budget years. Experts told Fact Check that the Consumer Price Index was a reasonable way to measure inflation in the context of Australian aid spending. Based on this, Fact Check calculates that, from year to year, aid spending was cut in real terms by as little as 0.2 per cent and by as much as 17.7 per cent. According to ANU's Development Policy Centre, which publishes the aid figures in 2018 dollars, this equates to an $8 million cut in 2018-19 and a $953 million cut in 2015-16.

New Zealand citizens travelling on a New Zealand passport are automatically granted a visa when entering Australia. This is because of a bilateral arrangement between New Zealand and Australia, known as the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, which allows their citizens free movement between the two countries. However, people seeking asylum in New Zealand do not enjoy this privilege. Furthermore, asylum seekers granted refugee status would still require special travel documents and would need to apply for a visa before travelling to Australia. Experts told Fact Check that asylum seekers faced a lengthy process before being in a position to travel freely between New Zealand and Australia, needing first to qualify for citizenship. Anna Copeland, of Murdoch University's Law School, told Fact Check: "It's hardly justifiable to conclude that allowing New Zealand to take asylum seekers would create a backdoor into Australia. "The process to New Zealand citizenship is a long one ... For refugees from Manus [Island] or Nauru, they would have to first become New Zealand citizens, which takes more than five years."

Ms Lamb's own legal advice confirms that she obtained British citizenship by descent at birth. She applied to renounce her British citizenship before nominations for the 2016 election closed, but she did not enclose any evidence of her British citizenship with her application, as is required by the UK Home Office (and explained in its guidance notes). After the election, she provided some documents, but her application was still rejected. On publicly available information, she has not sought a review of the Home Office decision or made a new renunciation application. There is no evidence that the British Secretary of State has registered a declaration of her renunciation, which the Australian High Court has described as "the moment at which British citizenship is lost". Whether or not in the circumstances her continuing status as an Australian and British dual citizen means she is ineligible to remain in Parliament is a matter for the High Court to decide.

The other four relate to the drug treatment of offenders in the criminal justice system.

abbc-00232	In recent weeks, the fate of an aging power station in NSW's Hunter Valley has become the unlikely focus of a spirited debate over Australia's energy mix.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-22/fact-check3a-is-compulsory-acquisition-a-last-resort-for-extre/9718900	Mr Wilson's claim is overreach. It would be highly unusual for the Commonwealth to acquire a working asset such as the Liddell Power Station. Over recent times, governments of all persuasions have to varying degrees sought to privatise infrastructure and essential services, not buy them. It is unsurprising that a conservative member of parliament, holding a core ideological belief in the private sector, would be hesitant to acquire an asset unless doing so was "the last resort". But there is nothing in Commonwealth or state legislation that requires compulsory acquisition to be used only as a last resort or in extreme situations. The Government could choose to immediately start the process to compulsorily acquire Liddell. And putting aside the specific case of Liddell, governments of both political persuasions regularly use compulsory acquisition powers for road and other infrastructure projects that are not critical and when other options may be available. The new Western Sydney Airport, for instance, will be on land that was mostly acquired in the late 1980s. And it has been argued that the Victorian Government is planning to compulsorily acquire private bus company assets, even though there is no suggestion of a urgent crisis in bus services in that state. Mr Wilson's claim in itself is ambiguous. A viewer might have taken him to be expressing a personal opinion on when he believed compulsory acquisition should be used. But he does not preface the claim as an opinion, and it is couched in general terms: it is apparently "understood" that compulsory acquisition is "the power of absolute last resort". It was clearly open to a viewer to take Mr Wilson's comments to be a statement of fact.

Mr Bandt did not receive enough first preference votes at the 2013 election to be elected "in his own right" without preferences, and he relied on minor party, independent and Liberal Party preferences to be elected. While the Liberal Party how to vote card preferenced Mr Bandt last, a third of Liberal voters disregarded this and preferenced Mr Bandt ahead of the Labor candidate. There were 53 electorates, or roughly one-third of all electorates, at the 2013 election in which the candidate won on the primary vote alone, meaning that roughly two-thirds of seats were decided on preferences, as Mr Bandt's was. But experts say that the proportion of preferences that Mr Bandt relied on was small relative to his primary vote and that he was the clear winner of the seat. By contrast, there were 15 seats, or 10 per cent of electorates, which returned results which elected a different candidate to the primary vote winner, such as the rural Victorian seat of Indi.

The Greens have not nominated any alternative airport sites, although as examples they point to airports in Oslo, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Athens, which are located between 30 and 50 km from the respective city centres and connected to the city by high speed rail. Based on the Greens' policy, it is hard to envisage any site in the Sydney area that would meet their approval. But the Greens do not propose that Sydney would be left without an airport at all: closure of the existing airport would only occur after a new one is built — somewhere.

That's an annual average pace of about 0.3 per cent, over four-and-a-half years. Mr Swan has overstated wages growth under Labor, and understated wages growth under the Coalition, although not excessively so. Alternative methods to assess the data produce similar, although not identical, results. Regardless, what is clear is that wages growth has been sluggish in recent years despite falling unemployment.

The Coalition won the election on September 7, 2013, and was sworn into office on September 18, 2013. Fact Check considers the Coalition "came into government" on one of these dates but could not establish the precise number of children in detention on either date. However, an August 2014 media release from then immigration minister Scott Morrison said: "When Labor left office there were 1,392 children in held detention". Monthly statistics published by the Department of Immigration and the Parliamentary Library show 1,773 children were in detention at the end of August 2013. In late August 2013, Mr Morrison noted that the Labor government was releasing children from detention. The number of children in detention fell to 1,165 at the end of September 2013. The most recent figures indicate 88 children were in onshore detention facilities on January 31, 2016. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told Parliament on February 9 there were 75 children in detention. The Immigration Department told Fact Check that on February 11 there were 74 "illegal maritime arrival" children in onshore detention facilities. However, experts consulted by Fact Check did not agree on whether the total number of children in detention should include children currently on Nauru. The most recent figures show 54 children are on Nauru. If those children are added, the total number of children in detention on January 31 was 142. On either definition, the number of children in detention has been falling since October 2015.

Mr Abbott used broad language, requiring Fact Check to make a number of assumptions. A "worker" is taken to be someone in a non-managerial job, with an income less than $70,000 a year. Statistics show that most smokers are "workers", and they will end up paying more tax. Because the increase will constitute a higher proportion of a "worker's" pay, it will have a greater impact on a "worker's" household budget than a higher income earner. But the data also shows that around 80 per cent of "workers" do not smoke and so will not be affected. Given smoking rates are higher among groups of people with other characteristics, such as being unemployed, on Mr Abbott's argument, tobacco excise increases could equally be described as an "tax on the unemployed".

Undergraduate students in law, business and economics pay over 80 per cent of their course fees. Most postgraduate students pay their full course fees, as do most students enrolled at non-university higher education institutions. And there is more to the cost of higher education than course fees. Looking only at domestic undergraduate students at public universities, the Government would be justified in saying it subsidises more than half the fees per student on average. In addition, the taxpayer contribution to average costs includes carrying HECS or HELP loans from the Government that are not repaid by students. But it cannot be said that the Government subsidises more than half "the cost" of "each student's" higher education.

His numbers check out, although they differ slightly to those from the government agency officially tasked with publishing the gender pay gap. However, they oversimplify what has happened to the gender pay gap in recent decades. When it comes to the role of government policy, the Government claims that job creation and economic growth were key drivers behind the lower pay gap. But experts told Fact Check a booming economy would likely correspond with a larger gender pay gap, as had occurred during the mining boom when men's wages rose faster relative to women's. Experts said the current government could not claim credit for decreasing the pay gap, and that the only government measure that may be responsible for narrowing the gap was a policy legislated by the former Labor government.

abbc-00010	A war of words has broken out in Tasmania over how many jobs would be lost if poker machines are stripped from pubs and clubs — a promise made by Labor ahead of the state election on March 3.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-23/fact-check-gambling-jobs-tasmania/9454362	Mr Gutwein is wrong. Tasmania's gaming industry did not say thousands of jobs would be lost. The Treasurer relied on a gaming industry survey, which predicted 1,038 jobs would be lost. He also relied on the gaming industry's rough calculation that, in total, 5,100 jobs would be "affected" — meaning jobs would be impacted through reduced hours, changed duties or lost altogether. Experts have called into question the methodology of the gaming industry's survey. And, in an unusual admission, a gaming industry representative told Fact Check the industry was aware that some people engaged in public debate had misinterpreted the numbers — wrongly believing that about 5,100 jobs would be lost, when in fact the survey had indicated only 1,038 would go. He acknowledged the misrepresentation had not been corrected on the public record. A report commissioned by the Tasmanian Department of Treasury and Finance says reliable data on employment in the gambling industry are not collected by governments or industry. These numbers indicate gaming-related employment levels in pubs and clubs run in the hundreds of jobs rather than thousands. The Treasury report refers to a number of other studies that have examined the extent of employment in Tasmania's gambling industry, either calculating job numbers or full-time equivalents. Such calculations take into account the numbers of full-time jobs and part-time jobs. These studies also indicate that employment in the gaming industry totals hundreds of jobs rather than thousands.

His claim refers to five policies, but his spokesman, when approached by Fact Check, pointed to six policies that the Opposition claims Labor has poached. In four of the six cases, the Liberals did announce very similar policies ahead of Labor. The fourth case — a policy on home batteries — was first announced by the Liberals, and while Labor later announced an arguably more generous policy, it was not included in its 2017 "Energy Plan". When it comes to the other two cases, the record is mixed. The Liberals were the first party to promise a wide rollout of phonics testing, but this followed on from a trial in selected schools previously instituted by the Labor Government. It is arguable that the full rollout was an expected follow-on from the trial. The other policy the Liberal spokesman pointed to — a policy on drug rehabilitation orders — differs from Labor's proposal. And Labor says it is still considering the precise form its policy will take. It is also impossible to know whether Labor would have announced the same policies in the absence of earlier Liberal announcements, or exactly when it had finalised a specific policy. What is clear, however, is that the policies that the Liberals and Labor share only constitute a small proportion of all the policies and initiatives being proposed in the campaign.

This fact check is based on research from a previous claim on debt and deficit made by Deputy Liberal Leader Julie Bishop. Budget figures and historical data show that Labor inherited a surplus close to $20 billion, but the deficit they "turned that into" was far from a record. Experts told Fact Check that in order to make comparisons over time, deficits must be measured as a share of GDP, and the largest deficit as a share of GDP in Labor's last term was in 2009-2010 at 4.2 per cent. This pales in comparison with deficits sustained during World War II, which were over 20 per cent of GDP, and World War I, which were over 10 per cent.

abbc-00120	The Federal Government has all but confirmed it will be delivering personal income tax cuts in the upcoming May budget.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-02/fact-check-is-tax-to-gdp-lower-now-than-howard-years/9705324	Mr Keating's claim checks out. At no stage "throughout" the Howard years was the tax to GDP ratio lower than the current 21.6 per cent. However, it is important to note that the comparison is somewhat clouded by the July 1, 2000 introduction of the GST, a federal tax which replaced several state-based taxes. On Treasury's current forecasts, the tax to GDP ratio is predicted to rise in coming years to levels well above the Howard years. However, Fact Check does not consider these forecasts, which will almost certainly be amended due to new policy decisions and changing economic conditions, to undermine Mr Keating's claim. The extent to which tax cuts are in Australia's best interests is a different question, and not the subject of this fact check.

abbc-00240	The size of the public service features regularly in debates about privatisation and government debt, with solutions often focussing on staffing cuts.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-19/fact-check-the-public-service-and-woolworths/9404588	Mr Leigh is on shaky ground. Measured by total employees, the Woolworths Group — including all of its Australian operations — employs more Australians than the federal public service. On the other hand, Woolworths supermarkets do not. The public service employed 152,095 people at the end of June 2017. This is the figure cited by Mr Leigh, which Fact Check accepts. When it comes to Woolworths, however, the numbers are less clear-cut. It appears the wider group employed around 183,500 people in Australia at the end of June 2017, while its Australian supermarkets currently employ 115,000 people. On that basis it is impossible to assess the data behind his claim. But in any case, experts contacted by Fact Check said the comparison makes little sense because it ignores substantial differences between public servants and retail workers, notably hours worked. They said a better measure would compare full-time equivalent staff, which takes these hours into account. The Commonwealth budget shows that in 2016-17 the federal public service employed 140,911 full-time equivalent staff. Woolworths declined to supply a full-time equivalent count. However, one can be estimated using retail industry data.

abbc-00009	A regularly repeated claim in public debate is that Indigenous Australians were covered by a flora and fauna act, which did not classify them as human beings, and that this only changed when the constitution was amended following the 1967 referendum.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-20/fact-check-flora-and-fauna-1967-referendum/9550650	Ms Clanton's claim is a myth. Aboriginal people in Australia have never been covered by a flora and fauna act, either under federal or state law. But despite several attempts by various people to set the record straight, the myth continues to circulate, perhaps because, as one academic told Fact Check, it "embodies elements of a deeper truth about discrimination". Although the claim has been repeated more frequently during the past 10 years, there is evidence to suggest the myth originated in the early 1970s. Both an expert consulted by Fact Check and a museum website in Western Australia suggest several factors have given rise to the notion that a flora and fauna act once existed. Also, a widespread and energetic campaign for a yes vote in the 1967 referendum played a crucial role in setting the conditions for the myth to emerge. Experts told Fact Check that the referendum involved "dry" technical amendments to the constitution relating to Indigenous Australians. As these were difficult to explain in a campaign-friendly way, campaigners for a yes vote instead pushed the idea of equal rights and justice for Aboriginal people. The hugely successful referendum was thereby imbued with a symbolism that further enriched the conditions for the myth to take root; that before the constitution was amended, Indigenous Australians were classified according to a flora and fauna act — a completely incorrect conclusion.

abbc-00026	Labor is going to the election with ambitious policies on reducing carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-08/fact-check-do-emissions-always-rise-under-the-coalition/7466354	NSW Labor's advertisement is misleading. The notion that emissions never fell under the Howard government is shown in the advertisement itself to be inaccurate. It is also inaccurate when earlier years of the Howard government are included. The idea that emissions only rise under Liberal governments is disproved by more recent data about emissions under the Rudd-Gillard government that was available when the advertisement was published, and by emissions data under the Hawke-Keating government. Since 1990, emissions rose in 9 of the 13 years the Liberals were in government, compared with three of the 12 years Labor held government. Experts say that with the exception of the carbon tax, factors outside federal government policy have had more of an impact on carbon emissions.

Smart drum lines are a new technology, untested in the Australian environment. But the traditional drum lines upon which smart drum lines are based are proven to reduce the incidence of shark attack. Although some of the available evidence relates to joint use of drum lines and nets, it cannot be said with certainty that the smart drum lines will not make the beach safer. Smart drum lines do result in shark deaths and put other marine life at risk, although they also allow the possibility of officers attending to set free animals that have been caught. And as Mr Kennedy acknowledged in the same interview, the threat to wildlife from drum lines is less than that of the nets already deployed in NSW.

abbc-00246	Social Services Minister Christian Porter says the Government has been reining in the Newstart program, the main form of income support for jobseekers.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/fact-check-newstart-labor-coalition-spending/9111150	Mr Porter's claim is spin. A Fact Check analysis of departmental annual reports shows that over six Labor budget years Newstart spending increased at an annual average pace of 13.8 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent so far under the Coalition. This more or less accords with Mr Porter's figures. However, it is a stretch for Mr Porter to suggest that in contrast to Labor's "massive failure" the difference reflects the Coalition's very hard work. Rather, as experts contacted by Fact Check noted, the rise in Newstart spending under Labor initially reflected a rise in unemployment linked to the Global Financial Crisis — a factor beyond the Australian government's control — and later was affected by policy decisions designed to save the budget money, including shifting tens of thousands of single parents from the Parenting Payment (single) to the less generous Newstart. As experts have noted, this led to lower spending on the Parenting Payment (single) allowance, but higher spending on Newstart. The net result was a substantial saving to the budget. In addition, there is no evidence to show that people have been making the transition from Newstart to employment more quickly under the Coalition. The latest Department of Social Services figures show that Newstart recipients are exiting the payment at a slower rate than they were in any of Labor's six budget years.

This verdict relies on the research contained in those fact checks. Both claims related to Coalition's plans to change a funding arrangement proposed by the Gillard Labor government. But the changes are not due to begin until July 2017 and it is far from certain that the Gillard promises would ever have been fulfilled because they were far into the future and never budgeted for. Something cannot be taken away if it was never given in the first place.

abbc-00253	Lachlan Macquarie, governor of NSW from 1810 to 1821, is often remembered by history as a man of the enlightenment who brought civilisation to the colony.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-27/fact-check-did-lachlan-macquarie-commit-mass-murder-and-genocide/8981092	The issue is not cut and dried. In April 1816, Macquarie ordered soldiers under his command to kill or capture any Aboriginal people they encountered during a military operation aimed at creating a sense of "terror". At least 14 men, women and children were brutally killed, some shot, others driven over a cliff. Although Macquarie's orders included an instruction to punish the guilty with as little injury to the innocent as possible, archival evidence shows he knew innocent people could be killed. In addition, Macquarie explicitly instructed his soldiers to offer those Aboriginal groups encountered an opportunity to surrender, and to open fire only after meeting "resistance". These instructions appear to have been ignored. Historical records suggest the soldiers offered no opportunity to surrender, opening fire on a group of people ambushed at night and who were fleeing in terror. Macquarie appears to have glossed over this failure in the weeks following the massacre, telling his superior back in England that his men acted "perfectly in Conformity to the instructions I had furnished them", and claiming the soldiers had indeed encountered resistance before opening fire. Macquarie was ultimately responsible for his men. By today's standards, his actions — and lack of action in not bringing soldiers who disobeyed his instructions to account — would, as a minimum, likely be regarded as a war crime involving a disproportionate response that led to a significant loss of life. And, depending on the definition, the incident might also be described as "mass murder", perhaps akin to recent military massacres in which innocent civilians attempting to flee were killed. The issue of whether or not the actions amount to genocide is a complex one. A legal definition of genocide did not exist until after World War II. It is questionable whether this can be applied retrospectively to Macquarie's actions, which took place some 130 years before the UN General Assembly made genocide a crime under international law. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that Macquarie set about deliberately to "destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group", as per the UN definition, however misguided and destructive some of his Indigenous policies might have been. It is, therefore, problematic to suggest that Macquarie, as an individual, was guilty of ordering genocide. However, it can be argued that the impact of the wider conflict between Aboriginal people and Europeans (whether soldiers or vigilante settlers), combined with a range of other factors — the loss of land and food sources, the spread of disease, the removal of children, and alcohol abuse, for example — contributed to the large-scale loss of life and culture that resembled genocide. Experts contacted by Fact Check acknowledged the nuance in the arguments, but differed in their interpretations of Macquarie's actions and his culpability or otherwise. Their full comments are outlined below.

The exact figure is 51.3 per cent. But whether these Muslims are also living on welfare payments cannot be established because the Government does not collect information on religion in social security statistics. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not collect this data either. Most newly arrived skilled migrants must wait two years before becoming eligible for welfare payments.

The evidence Mr Morrison puts forward to support his claim focuses on a relatively short time frame and is subject to volatility. Furthermore, his claim is underpinned by income data from the 2016 census that is potentially problematic, and unpublished calculations that have not been released for independent scrutiny. Experts contacted by Fact Check broadly agree: Australia is less equal today than it was in, say, 1981. And the broad trend over the decades since the early 1980s would appear to point to widening disparity. However, the experts are not united about what has happened in recent years. Some suggest inequality has got no worse, while others suggest it has. This uncertainty is also reflected in the data: one credible set of figures shows a slight deterioration of inequality, another one a slight improvement. Mr Morrison was excessively definitive in the face of data which is not definitive.

FODMAPs are a recently identified category of sugars found in many foods, so although hard to find in the supermarket, they actually do exist. Experts say that the evidence on the existence and effects of FODMAPs is accepted internationally. According to research, FODMAPs can exacerbate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, a medically recognised and painful condition with symptoms that go beyond what Mr Baxter refers to as "the human condition". On the issue of how many Australians might be affected, Mr Baxter was right to trust his gut. The research team behind the low FODMAP diet say the number of people with irritable bowel syndrome is closer to 15 per cent of the population. The pressing question might be: should Mr Baxter cut back on onions and cherries? Maybe, but Fact Check recommends he consult a medical expert.

On paper, same-sex couples in a settled relationship do have the same broad set of rights as opposite-sex couples who are married. This is because, over more than a decade, federal, state and territory governments have made real efforts to standardise the rights of same-sex, de facto and married couples. At a federal level, the Rudd government introduced significant reforms over a broad range of policy areas in 2008. And all states (except WA) and the ACT allow same-sex couples to obtain official registration of their relationship. This makes it easier for them to prove their relationship when asked. Meanwhile, IVF treatment is open to same-sex couples Australia-wide, and same-sex couples (outside of the NT) can adopt children. But on a practical basis, same-sex couples have to deal with administrative hassle and uncertainty that opposite-sex married couples never have to face. Those who have not (or cannot) register their relationship may have to prove their de facto status when dealing with hospitals, Centrelink and other areas of government. This can lead to same-sex couples having to disclose personal information to strangers or faceless government officials, which can be invasive and traumatic, particularly during a partner's illness or if some branches of the family do not get along. By contrast, married people can simply use their marriage certificate as proof of their relationship. Same-sex couples also must hope that government officials in health, welfare or other areas understand the complexities of the law around de facto relationships and will apply it correctly. A married couple knows their relationship will be recognised even in the most shambolic of bureaucratic systems.

abbc-00282	"Under Labor, defence spending as a share of GDP dropped to its lowest level since 1938," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said at a doorstop interview on February 24, ahead of the release of the Government's Defence White Paper.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-24/turnbull-defence-fact-check/7196360	Mr Turnbull's claim is not the full story. In the 1938-39 financial year, defence spending was 1.5 per cent of GDP. Under Labor in 2012-13, spending was 1.60 per cent of GDP, the lowest it has been since 1938. Under the Howard government, defence spending was 1.62 per cent — only 0.02 per cent higher — in 2002-03. But Mr Turnbull did not mention that defence spending also rose to 1.93 per cent of GDP under Labor in 2009-10, which was higher than at any time during the former Howard government and higher than it has been under the current Coalition Government. It is the highest figure since 1994-95, when Paul Keating was prime minister and defence spending as a share of GDP was 1.96 per cent. Whilst a share of GDP is commonly used by governments of all stripes to measure defence spending, GDP estimates are subject to quarterly fluctuations due to new economic data becoming available, whilst defence spending remains fixed after its final determination. This can arbitrarily affect the appearance of defence spending in any given year, and there is no way to predict whether the figures for 2002-03 and 2012-13 will be estimated as higher or lower than each other in future releases from the ABS, as more information comes to light which could alter GDP estimates. The Government itself has a policy of decoupling defence spending from GDP, as evidenced in the 2016 Defence White Paper, to address the problem of fluctuations due to revisions of GDP estimates.

abbc-00236	Despite his own upbeat campaigning for Saturday's state election, former senator Nick Xenophon has drawn the ire of South Australia's labour movement and become the focus of radio and online advertisements attacking his parliamentary voting record.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-13/fact-check-did-nick-xenophon-vote-to-cut-the-age-pension/9531908	SA Unions' claim is overblown. Only two legislative changes affecting age pension payments have taken effect since Mr Turnbull became Prime Minister. Both were legislated and voted on during the Abbott government. The first of these capped the amount of income from defined benefit schemes that seniors are able to exclude from the pension's income test. However, there is no record of Mr Xenophon having voted for the measure, and his office did not provide details of his support. He did vote for changes to the age pension assets test, which took effect on January 1, 2017. These amendments raised the "free area" threshold, below which a person's assets do not affect how much pension they receive. But they also doubled the rate at which payments are reduced for every $1,000 of assets above the threshold. Three experts told Fact Check that the results of the changes were mixed: some people with fewer assets will have had their pension increased, while relatively wealthy people with greater assets will have had their payments reduced or cut entirely. Figures issued recently by the Department of Social Services demonstrate this double-edged result, with 165,200 people benefitting from the changes and another 370,000 (roughly 9 per cent of pensioners, nationally) losing out. So, while the age pension itself has not been cut, some people's individual entitlements have been affected. This is not the case, however, for people who are less well-off. For example, home-owning couples with assets of less than $375,000 and individual homeowners ($250,000) will not have been affected. SA Unions also suggested to Fact Check that the Turnbull Government's Welfare Reform Bill was further evidence of Mr Xenophon voting to cut pensions. However, these changes do not affect seniors payments specifically and the bill is yet to pass the Senate.

Specialist bulk billing rates have also increased over that time, despite a longer freeze on their rebates. But experts told Fact Check it was not possible to know why bulk billing rates had increased in spite of the freezes on rebates. They say a range of factors could have increased bulk billing, including that the freeze on GP rebates had not been in place long enough to affect bulk billing rates and that doctors were absorbing rising practice costs themselves instead of passing them on to patients. An increase in ageing patients on pensions who were more likely to be bulk billed could also have contributed to the increase.

Though household electricity prices rose significantly under the Liberal National Party, and to a lesser extent under Labor, the figures she quotes do not tell the whole story. Ms Palaszczuk relies on an analysis by the Department of Energy and Water Supply which shows that bills for a particular category of household rose by an average of 1.9 per cent a year under Labor and by an average of 12.7 per cent a year under the LNP. In highlighting Labor's record over the last three years, Ms Palaszczuk has misleadingly compared an average per-year increase under Labor with a total three-year increase under the LNP. While she does say "per year" when referring to Labor and "over the term" when referring to the LNP, the department's analysis included data that she could have used in a way that is not misleading. In addition, she neglects to point out the narrow basis for the departmental analysis she relies on. The department's figures for household bills apply only to regional Queensland. They do not apply to households in the state's more populous southeast, including Brisbane. They are estimates for the typical bills for just one type of customer, on one price structure and using the median annual amount of electricity. Experts consulted by Fact Check said that the bulk of price movements did not result from decisions made by the Newman or Palaszczuk governments. Rather, they resulted primarily from changes to network charges and wholesale prices.

abbc-00115	A series of by-elections for the House of Representatives will take place on July 28, four of which have Labor as the incumbent party, and in one of which the incumbent is the Centre Alliance's Rebekha Sharkie.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-27/fact-check-has-a-government-not-taken-a-seat-from-an-opp/10003610	Senator Cormann is correct. The last time an opposition lost a seat to a government at a by-election was in 1920 — almost 100 years ago. The previous MP in that by-election, Hugh Mahon, remains the only member in the history of the House of Representatives to be expelled. He recontested the seat and lost. However, whilst by-elections on average swing towards the opposition of the day, experts told Fact Check that there are a minority of historical cases where the government of the day has achieved a swing towards itself larger than those required to unseat Labor in Longman or Braddon. With this in mind, psephologist Kevin Bonham told Fact Check that Labor losing a seat would be "unusual, but not as unusual as the very poor historic win rate indicates".

Data from the Australian Institute of Criminology shows the rate of homicide victims dying from a gunshot wound has dropped since the reforms came into force, but not consistently in every year. ABS data indicates the rate of assault by firearm causing death has also declined since the reforms, but not in every year. Data from the ABS also indicates the rate of suicide by firearm fell by 67 per cent from 2.1 deaths per 100,000 of the population in 1996 to 0.7 deaths in 2014. However, experts consulted by Fact Check said the impact of Mr Howard's reforms on those declines is debatable. Some research argues the reforms did not significantly influence firearm homicide rates or already falling rates of firearm suicide. Other research argues the reforms accelerated the rates of decline, with one study suggesting firearm suicides dropped by 74 per cent from the 1990-95 average following the buyback scheme. While it is accurate for Mr Howard to assert that gun-related homicides and suicides have dropped since his reforms were implemented, there is more to it. Studies on the impacts of his reforms have come to varied conclusions and experts contacted by Fact Check said other factors would have influenced the drops, even though the reforms are likely to form part of the story.

Studies conducted primarily in the US have shown that coronary calcium scans are able to identify heart disease in patients, with the resulting calcium "scores" having been found to correlate with future cardiovascular events. The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand describes the test as a "robust" way to estimate future risk of cardiac events. By contrast, the sub-committee of the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council responsible for new and emerging technologies cautions that calcium scoring for predicting heart disease "is of unproven clinical benefit or utility". The sub-committee raised concerns about the radiation dose involved (the equivalent of 50 chest x-rays per scan) as well as the impact on downstream tests and treatments. Cardiologists contacted by Fact Check agreed the test was better at predicting heart attacks than traditional blood pressure or cholesterol checks, but were hesitant to back the test as strongly as Dr Walker.

abbc-00287	"Australia is already the second largest military contributor to the campaign against ISIL in the US-led coalition," Julie Bishop said in a doorstop interview on December 3.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/fact-check-australias-contribution-against-islamic-state/6977668	Ms Bishop's claim is overstated. Australia's contribution to the training mission in Iraq of 380 personnel is indeed the second largest after the US, but there is more in the theatre than just training personnel. The re-deployment of French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle into the conflict in November pushed the number of French aircraft involved over 40, outnumbering Australia's aircraft contribution five to one. The French carrier has 3,500 personnel on board to support operations, whilst Australia has only 400 personnel assigned to its Air Task Group, although Australia also has around 600 personnel at Al Minhad who may be important to the mission but have not been counted as part of the total. Furthermore, air sorties and strikes are difficult to compare due to the ambiguous nature of the wording used by different countries, as well as different reporting dates. Whilst Australia has been and still is making a substantial contribution to the US-led coalition, experts contacted by Fact Check agree that France has now overtaken Australia, which puts Australia third at best.

For a start, the foreign aid budgets of governments worldwide are typically small when compared to aggregate private spending, whether it be on pets or any other economic component. Australians spent $14 billion a year on alcohol in 2012, for example. This comparison is arguably more apposite for showing that Australia's foreign aid budget is "small", rather than a comparison with private spending on pets.

The Treasurer accurately points to a widening gap between Australia's company tax rate and that of many other countries. Where there has been a global trend to lower company taxes, Australia has not reduced company tax for most businesses since 2000. Australia's company tax rate (30 per cent for most businesses) already compares unfavourably with that of Singapore (17 per cent) and the United Kingdom (19 per cent). And while the United States currently has a higher company tax rate than Australia (35 per cent or over 39 per cent if state taxes are included), the Republican administration is pushing to reduce that rate to 20 per cent. While Australian resident shareholders may see little direct benefit from company tax cuts due to Australia's imputation tax credit system, it is clear that many foreign investors compare company tax rates when deciding where to invest. But it is not the only factor influencing investment. And even if the Labor Party caves in and agrees to the Government's company tax proposals, this would only result in a reduction over time to 25 per cent. Australia would continue to compare unfavourably to Singapore, the UK (which is scheduled to reduce its rate to 17 per cent over the same period) and possibly the United States.

abbc-00116	With five by-elections slated for July 28, the Coalition has been spruiking its achievements and vision for the country, including freshly legislated personal income tax cuts.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-25/fact-check-is-the-government-spending-record-amounts-on-health/9989808	Mr Turnbull's claim is a fair call. Spending on health was higher in 2016-17 than in any other year since at least 1985-86. The final budget outcome is not yet available for 2017-18, but on the most recent estimate spending on health was higher again. However, that year's health funding was boosted by a number of one-off items in the budget, including nearly $1 billion in retrospective adjustments or top-ups for underspending on public hospitals in previous years, chiefly in 2015-16. Then, in 2018-19, the financial year now underway, the most recent estimate shows health spending will decrease slightly from the previous year — though it will drop by less than the 2017-18 top-up amount. Looking at this term of office overall, spending in each of the three years on health is or is estimated to be higher than the previous record set in 2015-16. This is also the case when measured in spending per person. The picture is similar for public hospitals: higher spending in both 2016-17 and 2017-18 — including the retrospective adjustment — and then a dip forecast for 2018-19. Again, this is also the case when measured in spending per person. However, the later numbers are only estimates and, as the adjustment in 2017-18 shows, they are open to change. One expert told Fact Check that the budget figures might be underestimates, and noted that spending on Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not under the Government's control, but depends on patient demand. Taking into account differences in how the various data sources report spending, Mr Turnbull can justifiably say federal spending on both health and hospitals was expected to reach a fresh peak around the time he made the claim. But while that sounds impressive, "record spending" is a claim most governments could make. That's because funding almost always increases from the previous year. In fact, between 1985-86 and 2015-16, total health funding went backwards only once — or, in per capita terms, just four times. Between 1989-90 and 2015-16, total spending on hospitals by the Commonwealth decreased six times, or eight times on a per capita basis. Of these, the two largest decreases (2009-10 and 2012-13) came immediately after the largest relative increases.

For example, the CSA classifies aggravated robbery as a sub-set of the broader category of robbery, which falls within the offence division of "crimes against the person". Mr Guy is also selective when citing figures for common assault, which is a sub-category of the broader assault division and which has seen a 37 per cent increase in offences since 2014. But CSA data for the broader "assault and related offences" category, shows only a 16 per cent increase over the same period. Experts told Fact Check that focusing on crime rates per 100,000 of population — rather than by raw numbers alone, as Mr Guy appears to have done —would give a more accurate picture of crime across the state. They also pointed out that crime numbers fluctuated from year to year, and there were different ways of measuring crime.

No direct comparison can be made between the two competitions because the claim was made before the A-League season had been completed or its finals played. However, experts told Fact Check it was nevertheless legitimate to compare the television ratings for the full WBBL season with all the A-League games broadcast during the same period. Ten WBBL games were televised live, three on Network Ten's primary free-to-air channel TEN and seven on its subsidiary channel ONE. Over the same period 27 A-League games were shown live on pay television channel Fox Sports 4, five of which were also broadcast live on free-to-air channel SBS 2. The average for the women's cricket was 142,000. The average for the men's football was 43,000 on Fox Sports and 47,000 on SBS 2.

abbc-00117	The union movement has enlisted the opinion of an unlikely ally — the Catholic Church — in its campaign to make wage theft a crime.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-14/fact-check-is-wage-theft-a-mortal-sin/9841392	Ms McManus's claim is a faithful account. Although Pope Francis didn't specifically say "wage theft", he did refer to examples that fall within the term's broad meaning. Strictly speaking, there is no agreed definition of wage theft. However, Fact Check takes it to mean deliberate non-compliance with legal obligations relating to employee entitlements — whether that's underpaying wages or withholding leave payments and superannuation. And the Pope said those "who don't pay" are committing a mortal sin. Indeed, Catholic doctrine makes clear that his admonition applies to intentional acts of greed or stinginess by employers. And the Catholic Bible shows Jesus took a similar view. So what's the punishment for a mortal sin? Without a good excuse — for example, ignorance or a pathological disorder — then the Catholic Church says sinners should brace for "eternal hell". That's unless, of course, they repent and promise to change their ways.

abbc-00008	Australians now need to visit a doctor to obtain codeine after the drug was taken off pharmacy shelves and made available only with a prescription.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-23/fact-check-over-the-counter-prescription-only-codeine/9522916	Mr Hunt's claim doesn't stack up. There has not been any recent data to suggest that 100 Australians are dying every year from over-the-counter codeine products. The latest available data was published in a 2015 study covering 2000 to 2013, which showed that on average about 100 Australians were dying a year from all codeine products, both over-the-counter and prescription. Mr Hunt's claim comes from a Therapeutic Goods Administration estimate, which is based on an assumption that an increasing death rate seen in the early years of that research would have continued in the time since then. This is not accepted by experts consulted by Fact Check. In any case the study was unable to determine the source of the codeine involved in 60 per cent of the deaths. In the 40 per cent where the source could be determined, over-the-counter products were involved in 40 per cent of cases. That means over-the-counter codeine was only conclusively found in 16 per cent of all the deaths reported in the study, or 16 per year on average. It appears that Mr Hunt and the Therapeutic Goods Administration have used the study's findings to assume that over-the-counter products were involved in 40 per cent of all codeine-related deaths. However, the authors of the study cautioned against that, saying that an absence of data "limits inferences about the source of codeine". In the lead-up to the decision to make codeine prescription-only, the Therapeutic Goods Administration commissioned an economic model from KPMG. KPMG used the data from the 2015 study to arrive at an assumption that there could currently be 30 deaths per year from over-the-counter codeine. The 2015 study also pointed out that making codeine available only on prescription would not prevent all the deaths attributable to over-the-counter codeine. Using the reasons given in the study, KPMG's model assumed that five lives a year would be saved by the move, which it described as a conservative number suitable for assessing the costs and benefits of banning over-the-counter sales. While there is evidence of an overall increase in misuse and harm relating to codeine products, the available research does not support Mr Hunt's claim that 100 lives a year could be saved by making codeine available only on prescription.

The Australian Constitution does not prevent dual citizens from sitting as High Court judges. Under the constitution, justices of the High Court are appointed by the governor-general in council, effectively the government of the day. The sole constitutional restriction is that a justice has to retire when they turn 70, and cannot be appointed if they are 70 or over. A Commonwealth law – the High Court Act 1979 – adds that to be eligible for appointment, a justice has to have been a judge of a Commonwealth, state or territory court (other than the Local Court of the Northern Territory) or an Australian barrister or solicitor for at least five years. The prohibition on dual citizenship for federal politicians could be seen as a unique aspect of the Australian system. Dual citizens are able to sit in state and territory parliaments, subject to some exceptions for people who obtain foreign citizenship while in parliament.

abbc-00262	On budget night 2017, the Federal Government announced a levy on Australia's big banks, which it estimates will raise $6.2 billion over four years.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-07/fact-check-bank-levy-malcolm-turnbull/8589928	Mr Turnbull's claim is exaggerated. After the Global Financial Crisis, many European countries introduced bank levies, but other parts of "the developed world" did not follow their example. Australia's levy is similar in its structure and rate to some European levies but different from most of them in its primary aim. Due to the impact of the GFC on the European banking system, a dominant theme of the European levies is creating greater stability in the banking sector by reducing debt and discouraging risky lending practices. Many governments specify that the revenue raised is to be used to pay back GFC bailout loans, and some put the revenue into dedicated funds to be used as a buffer should another crisis occur. In contrast, Australia's levy is designed primarily to raise revenue for budget repair, as well as helping create greater industry competition and balance sheet resilience.

abbc-00245	Unemployment is shaping up as a key issue in the Queensland election campaign.

Although Queensland employment did indeed fall by about 30,000 in 2016 — the biggest fall for any calendar year since the current employment series started in 1978 — the LNP has ignored the surge in jobs over the past ten months, which has offset the 2016 loss more than three times over. The most recent figures also show Queensland now has the strongest annual employment growth in the nation, although as one expert pointed out, after a year of relative weakness in 2016, the state's job market has been coming off a lower base. While the unemployment rate in Queensland, at 5.9 per cent, has been slowly trending down, it remains above the national average, and only slightly below Tasmania, which has the highest unemployment. Like some other states, the unemployment rate has been higher than it otherwise might have been because of an increase in the number of people actively looking for work. And, as a second expert noted, five out of six states are grouped in a relatively narrow band of unemployment, meaning Queensland's unemployment ranking could quickly change. Furthermore, as two experts noted, state government policy is only one of several factors that influence the jobs market. Others include federal politics, international economic conditions, exchange rates and interest rates. Given these dynamics, to suggest that a state government is solely responsible for the performance of the labour market is a stretch.

And this timeframe relates only to the processing and resettlement arrangement with PNG. The Rudd government's overarching policy that asylum seekers arriving by boat without visas would not be settled in Australia was not described during key announcements at the time as being only for a short period. Mr Rudd's repeated message in the run-up to the September 2013 election was that "from now on" the business model of people smugglers wouldn't work "any more" because people arriving by boat without visas would "never" be permanently settled in Australia.

abbc-00219	Australia's new Prime Minister and Treasurer have both been keen to trumpet good news about the economy in the wake of recent political turmoil.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-24/fact-check-are-profits-growing-five-times-faster-than-wages/10287356	There is more to the story than Dr Chalmers's claim suggests. A commonly quoted measure of wages included in the National Accounts — average compensation per employee — increased 1.6 per cent over the year to the June quarter in seasonally adjusted terms (a widely-used adjustment to iron out standard seasonal influences). Using the bureau's trend measure (which applies a rolling average to smooth out statistical volatility), average compensation per employee increased 1.7 per cent over the year. A commonly used measure of profits included in the national accounts — gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations — grew 9.7 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms (or by 8.8 per cent in trend terms). The National Accounts figures showed gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations grew more than five times faster than average compensation per employee over the year to the June quarter. However, the claim requires context. First, as experts contacted by Fact Check pointed out, profits tends to be more volatile than wages. This is partly a function of the fact that profit — a measure of what is left from revenue after costs — is critically influenced by fluctuations in input prices, commodity prices, exchange rates and consumer demand, all of which can fluctuate significantly. In the face of such volatility, comparing a single quarter of data has the potential to paint a misleading picture. Second, the measure of profits in the national accounts provides a snapshot of the total pool of profits across the economy. This pool grows over time as the economy and output expand. As a consequence, Dr Chalmers is comparing an economy-wide pool of profits, with a per capita measure of wages. As one expert noted, this is not a "like-for-like" comparison. A "like-for-like" comparison involves examining the total pool of profits against the total pool of wages. According to the bureau, the total pool of wages — referred to as total compensation of employees — grew by a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent over the year to the June quarter, partly reflecting rising employment. On this measure, profits grew at roughly twice the rate of wages.

abbc-00012	Federal MP Bob Katter's response to a question about the same-sex marriage survey has turned heads across the nation, and around the world.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-30/fact-check-does-a-crocodile-kill-someone-every-three-months-/9202902	Mr Katter is wrong. Experts told Fact Check there was no evidence to support the claim that crocodiles were killing people every three months in Queensland. Long-term figures from the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection show a rate of one fatal crocodile attack every three years from 1985 to now. These figures accord with data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which is only available to 2016. The department's data shows fatal crocodile attacks in Queensland have increased in recent years, but not to the rate Mr Katter claims. In the past 10 years there were six deaths, a rate of one every 20 months. There was one death per year in the past three years. And even if Mr Katter was only considering very recent deaths in making his claim, the two most recent fatal attacks occurred in March and October of this year, seven months apart.
