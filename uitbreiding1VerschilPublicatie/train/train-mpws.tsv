mpws-00001	This week, the Supreme Court upheld a critical part of the Affordable Care Act that allows people to get subsidies when they buy insurance on the federal exchange. The decision came down to four words, which the plaintiffs argued allowed only people buying insurance through state-based marketplaces, like Minnesota’s MNsure, to get the money. Minnesota’s Washington, D.C., delegation was split on the ruling, with Republicans opposing it and Democrats applauding it.

But the one thing Democrats in both the House and Senate do agree on is that minimum wage hasn’t kept pace with the cost of living. Sen. John Hoffman, DFL-Champlin, underscored that point in a recent press release. “Currently, about 20 percent of Minnesota jobs pay less than $10.03 an hour, which is what the federal minimum wage would be today if it had been increased for inflation since the late 1960s.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/03/poligraph-minimum-wage-claim-correct/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Minimum wage claim correct	March 14, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party']
mpws-00035	Gov. Mark Dayton gave a late-season State of the State address this week. In it, he highlighted some of the bright spots in Minnesota’s economic, education and health outlook as evidence that changes made during his tenure are making the state better. PoliGraph looked at three of those statements this week. “There are more than 2.8 million jobs in Minnesota today. More jobs than ever before in our state’s history. 150,000 more jobs than when I became governor.” Using seasonally adjusted Department of Employment and Economic Development data going back to 1990, Dayton’s claim checks out: There are roughly 2.81 jobs in Minnesota today, and that’s more than the state has seen in recent history. It’s also true that there are about 151,000 more jobs today than when Dayton took office in January 2011. Of course, it’s important to put these numbers in context. The nation as a whole has been recovering from the recession for several years now. According to DEED, Minnesota went into the recession earlier than the nation and came out of it a bit earlier, too. Since then, the state’s growth has essentially tracked the nation’s growth. “Our graduation rate, nearly 80 percent, is the highest in a decade.” According to data from the Department of Education, 79.5 percent of seniors graduated in 2013 up from about 77 percent the year before “This increase is twice the yearly increase seen over the past three years, showing acceleration in progress for Minnesota seniors,” the education department said when it released the numbers. Minnesota’s graduation rate is among the highest in the nation. In fact, graduation rates everywhere are on the rise, particularly among Hispanic and African American kids. However, when it comes to graduating lower income kids, Minnesota’s rate is on the low side compared to other states – about 58 percent, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Education. “We have the fifth lowest percentage of citizens without health insurance coverage.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/05/poligraph-dayton-claims-about-economy-education-accurate/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Dayton claims about economy, education accurate	May 2, 2014, 2:20 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Massachusetts', 'Washington,_D.C.', 'Connecticut', 'Mark_Dayton', 'African_American', 'Vermont']

Thissen asked him if he thinks climate change is caused by human activity. “I believe there are eminently qualified scientists who would disagree [that climate change is caused by human activity], and I agree with those scientists,” Gruenhagen said.

mpws-00006	The 2015 session will be remembered as the one when Gov. Mark Dayton and the Legislature couldn’t come to terms on education funding. Dayton vetoed the education bill. Dayton wants $150 million more in the K-12 education bill to support pre-kindergarten programs in public schools. Republicans and some DFLers say the additional $400 million they put into education should be enough. Most of it is going to the per pupil formula. It’s an issue that has pitted Dayton against members of his own party, and underscores a fundamental difference in how many Democrats and Republicans view the issue of early learning. Many on the right say that, in addition to giving schools more money across the board, extra cash should be invested in early learning scholarships for low-income students, which gives parents a choice in where their kids start their education. (The funding bill includes money for this program, too.) On the left, many believe that to level the playing field for all kids, early education should be free and offered universally in public schools. This week, PoliGraph looked at two essential arguments on either side of the debate. The impasse sets the Legislature up for a special session to renegotiate a deal before July 1, when the new fiscal year begins and the state’s education department would shut down without annual funding. Republicans say Minnesota’s school administrators oppose Dayton’s pre-K plan. Dayton’s proposed expansion would be voluntary and for only half the day. Some school superintendents do oppose the idea. For instance, the Association of Metropolitan School Districts, which represents schools in the Twin Cities area, said universal pre-kindergarten “is a worthy goal.” “But our school districts need time to secure the necessary classroom space and licensed staff, develop transportation plans, provide staff training, and be prepared to serve pre-kindergarten students with special needs,” wrote AMSD executive director Scott Croonquist in a letter to House Education Finance Chair Rep. Jenifer Loon, R-Eden Prairie earlier this month. Instead, Croonquist’s group supports more funding for the per pupil formula – which is what the bill sent to Dayton includes – and higher investments in the School Readiness program, which serves 3 and 4 year olds who are underprepared for kindergarten. Similar views are shared by the Minnesota School Boards Association, individual administrators across the state, and even Dayton’s Early Learning Council, which suggested some of the money should be invested in the early education scholarship program. The Minnesota Association of School Administrators has a more nuanced view on the issue. Executive Director Gary Amoroso said his group supports Dayton’s call for $150 million more. But it would like to see much of it added to the formula, with an undefined expansion of early childhood learning coming next. Amoroso said he doesn’t view the issue as a divide between Dayton and the superintendents. However, some superintendents do support Dayton’s proposal. They include Julia Espe, who is superintendent of Princeton’s Public Schools. She wrote in a letter to legislators that “universal pre-K for 4-year-olds will help us with our core mission–educating every single student… Why can’t we provide this strategy to close the achievement gap when the state has a surplus?” Espe’s views were echoed by superintendents in Bloomington, Maplewood and South St. Paul, among other places. Dayton says universal pre-kindergarten in public schools will help close the achievement gap. At the core of Dayton’s argument is that expanding pre-kindergarten to public schools will give all kids a better start in life. Dayton has cause for concern. Minnesota ranks last among 41 states when it comes to access to state pre-kindergarten programs and Minnesota ranks high when it comes to daycare and pre-kindergarten costs. And the state’s achievement gap between white students and students of color remains stubbornly wide. Meanwhile, there’s some consensus among early learning experts that students, regardless of race and economic background, who attend high quality pre-kindergarten do better in school and in life, said Milagros Nores, who is Associate Director of Research at the National Institute for Early Education Research. Nores added that the effects are even stronger for low-income, minority and dual language children. But Nores said learning can happen in a number of settings, not just public schools, and still be successful. “If the experience is high-quality, then it doesn’t matter where the child learns,” she said. Some states, including Georgia, have an all-public approach, and the outcomes are good. Other states use a combination of public and private programs, and children are successful there, too, Nores said. Minnesota falls into the latter category, with lower-income children accessing pre-K with state-funded scholarships. Dayton’s budget preserves that funding, but critics say more money should be dedicated to those programs. University of Minnesota professor and early childhood learning expert Arthur Reynolds agrees that quality trumps location. But Reynolds also pointed out that many of the factors associated with quality – such as teaching skills and curriculum – are often found in the public school setting. “Many of these features are more common in schools, especially teacher pay and certification, but private centers can also be very strong in these areas, sometimes stronger such as in [lower] group size,” Reynolds said. “There tends to be more variation in quality in private programs comparatively.” Reynolds also emphasized access, particularly when it comes to pre-K costs in Minnesota. “There has been greater reliance on private programs, family -based programs but the need to build a larger more unified system is real and that is what the Governor is proposing,” Reynold said. The Verdicts Figuring out how to better educate Minnesota’s children is a politically thorny and complicated issue. And while there’s some uncertainty about how widespread support is for Dayton’s plan and whether ultimately expanding pre-kindergarten to all public schools is entirely necessary, politicians on both sides of the issue are making sound and reasonable arguments based on plenty of facts. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/05/poligraph-arguing-for-and-against-public-pre-k/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Arguing for and against public pre-K	May 22, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Mark_Dayton', 'Minneapolis–Saint_Paul', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Bloomington,_Indiana', 'University_of_Minnesota', 'Georgia_(U.S._state)', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Jenifer_Loon', 'Instituto_Nacional_General_José_Miguel_Carrera', 'Blind_Joe_Reynolds']

mpws-00011	In his fifth State of the State address on Thursday, Gov. Mark Dayton repeated a lot of claims about the state’s economy and future. PoliGraph put three of those claims to the test and found two of the three to be correct. Here’s Dayton’s first claim about Minnesota’s economy. “More Minnesota businesses are expanding.  So, more Minnesotans are working.  They are earning more money, which means they are paying more taxes.” Dayton’s talking about the state’s most recent budget forecast. The report showed that more Minnesotans are working and earning higher wages, when not adjusted for inflation. That means more income and sales tax revenue for the state, which is a big driver behind Minnesota’s $1.9 billion budget surplus. PoliGraph rated a similar claim from Dayton accurate in the past, and we’re sticking with that rating. Dayton went on to talk about how Minnesota’s employment rate stacks up against the rest of the nation. “Our unemployment rate is an unusually low, 3.7%…. Minnesota is the only state in the nation, whose employment rate for 25-54 year-olds in 2014 exceeded its pre-recession level in 2007.” Dayton is correct that the state’s unemployment rate is 3.7 percent – lower than the national average of 5.5 percent. He’s also referring to a study from the Pew Charitable Trusts that compared 2014 employment rates in every state with employment rates prior to the recession. The study focused on 25-54 year-olds because those are considered prime working years, according to Pew’s website. Dayton is mostly correct that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that has an employment rate that’s higher than before the economy tanked. But the rate change is only slightly better than before the recession, and the Pew study doesn’t consider it statistically significant. Lastly, Dayton touched on the state’s education funding. “A rank of 24th in per-pupil K-12 education expenditures by a state with the 11th highest per-capita income means that at least thirteen other states are making greater financial efforts than we are to educate our children.” Back in January, Dayton made a similar claim about Minnesota’s per-pupil spending, but Poligraph gave it an inconclusive because the most recent numbers available are a few years old. That means the latest rankings don’t include Dayton’s more recent investments in education, like funding for all-day kindergarten. This claim comes with another important note: Minnesota actually ranks 15th in per capita income according to the latest Census data. A few years ago, Minnesota ranked 11th in the nation. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/04/poligraph-fact-checking-the-state-of-the-state/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Fact-checking the State of the State	April 10, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Mark_Dayton', 'The_Pew_Charitable_Trusts']

Republicans say Democrats are trying to make themselves look good during an election year. “This session, the Governor signed into law $508 million in tax relief for middle class families and Minnesota businesses,” says a primer on Dayton’s tax cuts. “These new tax cuts benefit middle class Minnesotans, including seniors, farmers, teachers, working families, and small businesses.” It’s true that Dayton signed a bill that lowered taxes by about $508 million, but he also raised taxes by $2.1 Billion in the previous session. 	misleading	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/04/poligraph-daytons-tax-cut-claims-leave-out-context/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Dayton’s tax cut claims leave out context	April 18, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Mark_Dayton', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
mpws-00048	Sen. Al Franken is running for re-election this year, making him a top target for the state’s Republicans. Many of them, including Franken’s potential opponents, are focusing on the Democrat’s apparent involvement in asking the Internal Revenue Service to give extra scrutiny to conservative political groups that masquerade as non-profits. Here’s a sampling of some recent barbs: “As a driving force behind the IRS Scandal, he denied First Amendment rights to Conservatives. It’s unacceptable that he directed a powerful government agency to intimidate and harass people based on their personal beliefs.” – GOP Senate hopeful Mike McFadden in a fundraising letter. “Will you ask @alfranken why he signed a letter urging the IRS to go after conservative groups? – Republican Party of Minnesota Secretary Chris Fields in a tweet. Franken stayed “shamefully silent in the face of IRS targeting.” – GOP Senate hopeful Julianne Ortman in a fundraising email sent Feb. 25, 2014. 	false	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/03/poligraph-republican-claims-on-franken-and-the-irs-go-too-far/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Republican claims on Franken and the IRS go too far	March 5, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Al_Franken', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Internal_Revenue_Service', 'First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution', 'Minnesota']
mpws-00025	Bermuda’s warm beaches have become part of a chilly political battle between Sen. Al Franken and his Republican opponent Mike McFadden. Franken’s latest ad says McFadden’s company is incorporated in Bermuda to avoid U.S. taxes, a tactic that’s meant to emphasize McFadden’s wealth and connections to corporate America. “Meet investment banker, Mike McFadden. He’s running for Senate in Minnesota. But McFadden’s business is based right here in Bermuda. That’s right: McFadden’s company uses a special tax loophole to list its headquarters offshore and to avoid paying millions of taxes in America.” 	misleading	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/09/poligraph-key-facts-missing-in-frankens-latest-ad/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Key facts missing in Franken’s latest ad	September 10, 2014, 2:01 PM	None	['United_States', 'Bermuda', 'Minnesota', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Al_Franken']
mpws-00008	For some Minnesota poultry farmers this year’s massive avian flu outbreak is  the worst they’ve ever seen. Nearly 3.8 million birds have died from the virus or were killed to prevent it from spreading. It’s hit the state’s $800 million turkey farming industry the hardest. In the midst of the crisis, legislators have discussed emergency funding to help poultry farmers deal with the outbreak, and have made a point to promote consumption of Minnesota turkeys. But one DFL legislator took to the House floor to give a bizarre speech about why he’s worried about the risk of humans getting avian flu. Rep. Ron Erhardt, DFL-Edina said that after eating turkey over the weekend “he was all flu-ed out” and referred to eating turkeys as “possible poison,” saying that there has been transference of avian flu to humans in the past. 	false	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/05/poligraph-erhardts-bird-flu-claims-are-false/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Erhardt’s bird flu claim is false	May 6, 2015, 2:28 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Ron_Erhardt_(politician)']
mpws-00013	Politicians love to exaggerate. One of their favorite claims is that something is the largest [fill in the blank] in Minnesota’s history – the largest spending increase, the largest tax cut, the biggest investment. House Speaker Kurt Daudt of Crown made one such claim in response to Gov. Mark Dayton’s proposed supplemental budget, which invests big in education. He said that with a nearly $1.9 billion budget surplus, Dayton should back off his plan to raise the state’s gas tax to pay for road and bridge construction. “Frankly, it would be the largest gas tax increase – I think – in state history,” Daudt said. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/03/poligraph-largest-gas-tax-in-state-history/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Largest gas tax in state history?

Take GOP gubernatorial hopeful Scott Honour who made the following statement in a recent press release: “Fixing [MNsure’s] problems will be expensive, and Minnesotans are unjustly being asked to pay the bill for Governor Dayton’s failed Obamacare exchange. Just days ago, the House passed a $442 million bailout of Obamacare-MNSure in the omnibus supplemental spending bill.” 	false	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/04/poligraph-a-bailout-for-mnsure-not-so/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: A bailout for MNsure?

But her answer to a question about student loan debt stood out to PoliGraph. “When you look at the average debt for students in Minnesota… it’s something like $30,000,” Klobuchar said. College graduates aren’t trained for the jobs that are available, she added. “One of the things that I’ve found frustrating is that we have something like 80 percent of our manufacturers in Minnesota have job openings,” she said. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/08/poligraph-klobuchar-right-student-debt-jobs-stats/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Klobuchar right on student debt, jobs	August 22, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota']

mpws-00042	The proposed new Senate Office Building is getting a lot of attention at the Capitol right now, and will be getting a lot of attention this coming election season, too. Republicans are using the estimated $90 million project as a way to paint the DFL majority as wasteful. Meanwhile, Gov. Mark Dayton and the House DFL have concerns about the cost and size of the project, too. In defense of the new building, Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said his chamber is actually giving up a lot of space during the simultaneous Capitol building renovation. “The Governor is almost doubling his footprint in the Capitol under the new, tentative space allocation… The Services for the Blind are adding significant space. The Historical Society is almost doubling the amount of space they’re going to have in the Capitol. The Senate is giving up about 38,000 square feet of the space we occupy in this building.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/03/poligraph-bakk-office-building-claim-correct/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Bakk office building claim correct	March 28, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Mark_Dayton', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Russell_Senate_Office_Building']
mpws-00043	Get ready to hear a lot about a proposed Senate office building this election season. Republicans are using the project as a way to highlight wasteful spending among their DFL counterparts. Senate Democrats say the space is badly needed to accommodate members of the chamber. Because it’s shaping up to be a major campaign issue, this week’s installment of PoliGraph will look at two claims made about the new construction. First up, this statement from Republican state Rep. Kurt Zellers, who is seeking his party’s endorsement to challenge Gov. Mark Dayton this fall. “The $90 million dollar Senate Legislative Office Building and parking ramp the Democrats snuck through the legislature last year is a disaster zone of reckless spending, and Governor Dayton and the DFL-controlled legislature think it’s a good idea,” Zellers wrote in a fundraising letter. “We’re already one of the highest taxed states in the U.S., and yet Governor Dayton just keeps adding to the tab by allowing our tax dollars to be used to build a $90 million complex that won’t even hold all the senators it’s being built for.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/03/poligraph-checking-senate-office-building-claims/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Checking Senate Office Building claims	March 26, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['United_States', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Mark_Dayton', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party']
mpws-00045	After intense speculation that he would end his political career, 7th Congressional District Rep. Collin Peterson announced earlier this week that he would seek a 13th term. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which raises and spends money to maintain a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, has been salivating over Peterson’s seat for some time now because the 7th District leans Republican. With Peterson’s announcement, the NRCC is now trying to make the case that Peterson has overstayed his welcome in Congress by pointing out that he’s flip-flopped on congressional term limits. Here’s what the group said in a recent press release: Peterson has voiced his support for 12-year term limits in the past and even voted for a term limits constitutional amendment … In 2010, Peterson also signed the U.S. Term Limits Amendment Pledge – 20 years after he first ran for Congress. 	misleading	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/03/poligraph-nrcc-misinterprets-petersons-term-limit-record/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: NRCC misinterprets Peterson’s term limit record	March 19, 2014, 3:19 PM	None	['United_States_Congress', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'United_States', 'Collin_Peterson', 'United_States_House_of_Representatives', 'Republican_National_Committee']
mpws-00002	The 2015 legislative session is over, and Republicans are touting the fact that they were able to keep spending low.

mpws-00037	This week, the Minnesota Senate passed legislation that’s meant to address pay disparities and protect women in the workplace. Among other things, the legislation would require companies with government contracts to certify that they pay men and women equally, and require employers to be more flexible with pregnant and nursing mothers. State Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, sponsored the bill. She argued on the Senate floor that protecting female employees is critical for the economy because their salaries are more and more likely to their household’s primary source of income. “Fifty percent of the state’s working mothers are the primary breadwinner for their family, as the sole earner or earning more than their spouse,” Pappas said. She went on to add that, “the pay gap is stuck at about 20 percent, that is women earning 80 percent of what men do on average.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/04/poligraph-pappas-stats-about-women-workers-correct/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Pappas stats about women workers correct	April 25, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota']
mpws-00003	The legislative session may be over, but that doesn’t mean we’ll stop hearing about pre-kindergarten any time soon. The issue was a major flashpoint between Gov. Mark Dayton’s administration and legislators, including DFLers in the Senate. It came down to this: Should the Legislature set aside millions to fund pre-kindergarten in all public schools or boost overall school spending and target other dollars to families who are least likely to be able to afford quality early education? Ultimately, Dayton and legislators settled on the latter option, passing a $17 billion education bill. But in the final hours of the special session, Rep. Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center, said the money isn’t well spent in the first place. “It’s a great babysitting service. But you have no empirical evidence to prove that pre-K doesn’t wear off by third or fourth grade,” he said during debate over the bill. 	false	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/06/poligraph-cornish-pre-k-claim-misses-mark/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Cornish pre-K claim misses mark	June 17, 2015, 2:04 PM	None	['Mark_Dayton', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party']
mpws-00007	As a member of the Army National Guard for 24 years, 1st District U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minn., has long made veterans issues his issues. So, at first blush it’s perplexing that he voted against a Republican-backed Veterans Affairs funding bill that, among other things, increased funding for the department. The National Republican Congressional Committee took note, sending an email to reporters in Minnesota saying that Walz voted against the VA funding bill that included a “more than $68 billion – a 6 percent increase from last year – in funding for VA Health Care Programs, VA medical centers…disability payments and other vital services.” Walz did vote against the bill.
