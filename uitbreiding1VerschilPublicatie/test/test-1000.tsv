pomt-14700	The five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are "back on the battlefield."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-wrong-claim-prisoners-swapped/	President Barack Obama is one of the worst negotiators Donald Trump has ever seen, the real estate magnate and presidential candidate said. Take, for example, Obama’s controversial decision to exchange five Guantanamo detainees for Taliban prisoner Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May 2014, Trump said to NBC Meet The Press host Chuck Todd. "You look at these deals," Trump said Jan. 10 in Ottumwa, Iowa. "I always bring up Bergdahl. We get a traitor, they get five people that they've wanted for nine years, and they're back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including us. And we get a dirty, rotten traitor." Trump’s statement that the five former detainees -- who were senior Taliban operatives -- are now "back on the battlefield" is one we rated False in July 2015. We decided to revisit the claim to see if anything had changed in the past six months. We looked into whether there were any new developments around the detainees, sometimes called the Taliban Five. The new information shows they’re still where they were last -- in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar under government supervision. So Trump is still wrong. The five detainees were released to Qatar in 2014. Qatar is understood to be a neutral state, as opposed to a "battlefield" for insurgent activity. Under the agreement, the five released detainees are not allowed to leave the country. This travel ban was initially supposed to last one year, ending June 1, 2015, but it has been extended. Multiple administration officials told us the detainees haven’t left Qatar. We looked for any evidence to contradict that and found nothing. In fact, in December 2015, the Republican-controlled House Armed Services Committee produced a report in which it expressed concern that the Taliban Five pose a security risk. But the report noted that the security arrangements first made in 2015 had been extended so that the five would remain in Qatar. The State Department told us on Jan. 9, 2016, that the men were still in Qatar. "None of the five individuals has returned to the battlefield," said State Department spokeswoman Liz Trudeau. "All five men are subject to a travel ban, and none have left Qatar." "They’re still in Qatar," added Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the National Security Council. Another barrier to the ex-detainees’ return to the battlefield is an additional travel ban beyond the U.S.-Qatar agreement. Four of the five are restricted from leaving the country due to a travel ban imposed by a 1998 United Nations Security Council Resolution, said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean the former detainees aren’t trying to reconnect with the Taliban or other insurgent groups. At least one of the Taliban Five is suspected by the United States of having attempted to contact Taliban associates. And Afghan intelligence officers arrested two suspected insurgents who tried to visit former detainee Mohammad Nabi Omari in Qatar, according to the New York Times. It’s also possible that some or all of the Taliban Five have had more contact with the Taliban or other jihadist networks without the public (or even the government) knowing, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But mere communications, or even giving orders from a distance, is not the same thing as literally being "back on the battlefield." "There are indications that they would like to return to the battlefield," Gartenstein-Ross said. "There’s reason for concern, but there’s not evidence to support (Trump’s) particular claim." Even if the Taliban Five has re-engaged in insurgent activities electronically -- a contention that, we reiterate, is not confirmed by any publicly available information -- it would be a stretch to conclude that this counts as returning to the battlefield. "At least one of them called some of his relatives. I don't know what he said on the phone. If making a phone call now constitutes returning to the battlefield, we are in 1984 territory," Rubin said, referring to the George Orwell novel. Our ruling Trump said the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are "back on the battlefield." The Taliban Five are known to be in Qatar, where they have been since their release over a year ago. Qatar is considered neutral ground -- not a battlefield -- and they are not allowed to leave the country. At least one of the five has been in contact with suspected insurgents, but experts said there is not enough information available to know the extent of these communications. And even if they had communicated with insurgents from afar, that would not the same as literally going back to the battlefield and, as Trump said, "trying to kill everybody.". Because there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim, we rate it False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-01-10T09:00:00	2016-01-10	['Bowe_Bergdahl', 'Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp']

pomt-12949	"We don't get any of that information" from the federal government on who refugees are, where they come from and how long they are likely to stay.	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/06/scott-walker/federal-government-doesnt-give-information-syrian-/	In year-end media interviews, Gov. Scott Walker amplified his safety concerns about the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s review of refugees who come to Wisconsin, particularly from Syria. "We want to make sure Homeland Security's got an aggressive and appropriate vetting process, to have an idea who's coming in, where they're coming from, how long they're anticipating being here," Walker said on the Dec. 23, 2016 edition of "Here and Now," a Wisconsin Public Television show. "Right now, we don't get any of that information. And as you can imagine, it's frustrating for us, it's frustrating for law enforcement. And it's not to say that refugees aren't legit; we've had refugees before, we'll have refugees going forward from any number of countries. We just want to make sure we can guarantee our safety." Is Walker right that authorities in Wisconsin don’t know who the refugees are who settle in the state, where they’re from and how long they’re likely to stay? Federal vetting process After terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Walker and other Wisconsin Republicans said they opposed the settling of Syrian refugees in the state. They have not laid out a plan for ensuring that doesn't happen. But in one of his 2016 year-end interviews, Walker called on President-elect Donald Trump to immediately clear federal barriers to keeping Syrian refugees out of the state. Refugees, to be clear, are different from other types of immigrants. A refugee has been legally defined as having "a well-founded fear of persecution because of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; is outside his or her country of origin"; and is unable to return there "for fear of persecution." Trump and other Republicans have denounced the sufficiency of the federal vetting of refugees. And there’s no question there are challenges to screening refugees from conflict zones such as Syria, where intelligence and national security officials have said there is minimal data on individuals. Nevertheless, vetting is a multi-step, multi-agency process, in place since 1980, that includes additional screening of refugees coming from Syria. As PolitiFact National has reported, here is the process generally: 1. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees determines who is eligible as a refugee. 2. Refugees referred to the United States are vetted through a process that involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, and the departments of State, Homeland Security and Defense. (For Syrian refugees, there’s one additional step (more details here). Their filings with the UN and initial documents submitted to the U.S. program are reviewed. Information about where they came from, what caused them to flee and what their experiences were like are cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information.) 3. While the checks are being conducted, Homeland Security officers interview the refugees in person. Refugees who’ve been cleared by an officer, the State Department and the background checks then undergo medical screenings, a match with a sponsor agency, "cultural orientation" classes and one final security clearance. This process (more details here) typically takes one to two years, if not longer, and happens before a refugee ever gets onto American soil. Notifications in states With regard to Walker’s statement, two nonprofits -- Amnesty International USA and the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants -- told us that state governments generally are not given lists of the names of refugees who are resettled in their states. But that’s something of a red herring. Refugees approved for settling in the United States, like other legal immigrants, have a right to live where they want and to move about. The experts pointed out that the state government or local law enforcement agencies generally are not notified when any person who is legally in the United States moves into their state. That’s not to say no one in Wisconsin knows when refugees first arrive. In fact, preparations are made in advance, in an effort to choose a community where a refugee is likely to assimilate. According to the two nonprofit agencies and David Martin, an emeritus professor of international law at the University of Virginia who’s previously held posts at Homeland Security and the State Department, here is an overview of the process: 1. Non-profit agencies that have offices throughout the United States -- including Catholic Charities and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services -- have contracts with the U.S. State Department to do refugee resettlement. Those agencies are given the names, home countries and other information about refugees approved by the Department of Homeland Security, such as whether they have family in the United States. 2. At the national level, the agencies meet weekly to decide, in consultation with the State Department, where the approved refugees should be resettled, based on their individual circumstances and local resources. In turn, those agencies’ local offices are notified and resettlement plans are put in place specifically for the refugees, covering housing, job assistance, language classes and other needs. Once the final vetting is completed, the local agencies meet the refugees when they arrive and begin the process of helping them settle. In addition, the private agencies coordinate with state refugee services workers who are federally funded employees of the state Department of Children and Families. So, it’s not as though the state is in the dark about refugee resettlement. Two final points: 1. Some information about refugee resettlements is readily available on the website of the federal Refugee Processing Center. We did a search that showed that in 2016, 1,877 refugees were placed in Wisconsin, with nearly half coming from Burma (also known as Myanmar) in Southeast Asia. Here are the five largest groups: Country Refugees settled in Wisconsin in 2016 Burma 979 Democratic Republic of the Congo 262 Somalia 216 Iraq 144 Syria 119 2. Given that refugees are coming to the United States because life is not safe for them in their homeland, and it’s been a years-long process to get admitted to the U.S., the stays are not viewed as temporary. "The strong presumption is that it’s permanent," said Martin. Refugees who stay for a year without committing a crime can then get a "green card" and become a permanent U.S. resident, he said. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said Walker’s complaint is that the governor’s office doesn’t receive any information about refugees placed in Wisconsin until after decisions have been made by the federal government. "The state has no authority regarding who is coming to our state, when they are coming and where they are coming from," Evenson said. But, to reiterate, the vetting of refugees is a federal matter. And once people have legally arrived in the United States -- immigrants, refugees, etc. -- they are generally free to live where they want without notification to, or approval from, the state. Our rating Walker said: "We don't get any of that information" from the federal government on who refugees are, where they come from and how long they are likely to stay. Walker has a point in that, after vetting the refugees and approving their entrance to the United States, the federal government does not provide lists of the names of those individuals to states. But that’s something of a red herring -- states don’t get lists of other people who are legally in the United States and are generally free to move about and reside wherever they want. Data on the numbers of refugees, where they came and where they settle is available -- and Wisconsin state government has refugee services workers who coordinate with private agencies in the settlement of refugees. As for Walker’s point about length of stay, it doesn’t really fit, given that refugees fleeing their homeland generally are settling in the United States permanently. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/727375cb-e973-4e22-9341-5b20a1e8605b	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2017-01-06T06:00:00	2016-12-23	['None']

pomt-05259	Says "there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/31/paul-krugman/chris-christies-jersey-comeback-challenged-new-yor/	New York Times columnist Paul Krugman isn’t feeling Gov. Chris Christie’s "Jersey Comeback." In his May 28 column, Krugman chastised the Republican governor as a "fiscal phony," suggesting that Christie’s comeback message is at odds with job growth in New Jersey since he took office in January 2010. According to the liberal columnist, "there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison." We’re not sure if that "McMansion" nickname will stick, but as for job growth, Krugman’s analysis is spot on, PolitiFact New Jersey found. In terms of the percentage increases in total jobs and private-sector jobs as of April 2012, New Jersey’s growth since the beginning of Christie’s tenure has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak argued that the state’s "economic policies have us headed very much in the right direction in terms of job growth." Drewniak added, "Do keep in mind that it was under this Governor that New Jersey had the best single year of private sector job growth in the last 10 years. That’s over 71,000 private sector jobs created since the Governor took office." First, let’s talk about total job growth, including public- and private-sector employment. As with previous stories, there’s two ways of analyzing job growth figures: the net increase in jobs and the percentage increase. Our analysis is focused on the percentage increase, because that metric accounts for the differences in size between New Jersey and the other two states and the nation as a whole. While New Jersey’s total jobs grew by 37,100, or roughly 1 percent, between January 2010 and April 2012, New York increased its total jobs by 298,700, or about 3.5 percent, and Connecticut saw growth of 33,500, or about 2.1 percent. As of April, there were 132,989,000 total jobs in the nation as a whole, representing a roughly 2.9 percent increase since January 2010. The April figures for the nation and the states are preliminary. Looking at total job growth since February 2010 -- Christie’s first full month in office -- we found similar results. Between February 2010 and April 2012, the nation saw an increase in total jobs of about 2.9 percent. During the same time period, New York and Connecticut increased total jobs by about 3.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, New Jersey’s total job growth was about 1.2 percent. The following chart lays out the changes in total job growth as of April 2012: Net Total Job Growth Since Jan. 2010 % Total Job Growth Since Jan. 2010 Net Total Job Growth Since Feb. 2010 % Total Job Growth Since Feb. 2010 New Jersey 37,100 1% 45,000 1.2% New York 298,700 3.5% 296,000 3.5% Connecticut 33,500 2.1% 34,100 2.1% Nation 3,710,000 2.9% 3,745,000 2.9% Now, let’s review private-sector job growth -- a statistic frequently touted by the Christie administration. Between January 2010 and April 2012, New Jersey gained 65,600 private-sector jobs for an increase of about 2 percent. Starting in February 2010 and continuing through April 2012, the state’s private-sector jobs grew by 71,200, or roughly 2.2 percent. But those figures fall behind private-sector job growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole. New York increased its private-sector jobs by about 4.6 percent since both January 2010 and February 2010, while Connecticut’s growth was roughly 3.2 percent since January 2010 and nearly 3.3 percent since February 2010. The nation’s private-sector jobs increased by about 4 percent during the same time periods. Here’s the chart showing private-sector job growth as of April 2012: Net Private Job Growth Since Jan. 2010 % Private Job Growth Since Jan. 2010 Net Private Job Growth Since Feb. 2010 % Private Job Growth Since Feb. 2010 New Jersey 65,600 2% 71,200 2.2% New York 324,300 4.6% 321,800 4.6% Connecticut 43,800 3.2% 44,400 3.3% Nation 4,220,000 4% 4,247,000 4% Our ruling In his May 28 column, Krugman claimed "there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison." Krugman’s analysis is correct. In terms of the percentage increases in total jobs and private-sector jobs as of April 2012, New Jersey’s growth since the beginning of Christie’s tenure has been less than the increases in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole.

pomt-02882	Says the U.S. national debt has tripled during Rep. Greg Walden’s time in Congress.	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/11/dennis-linthicum/has-national-debt-trippled-rep-greg-walden-was-ele/	U.S. Rep. Greg Walden may be a member of the House GOP leadership, but that hasn’t protected him from allegations that he’s too liberal for his conservative base -- or from drawing a primary challenger. Late last month, Klamath County Chairman Dennis Linthicum announced he would try to oust Walden in the 2014 Republican primary. Part of Linthicum’s motivation, he told The Oregonian, is that he sees Walden as a career politician who doesn’t stand up for conservative values. On his campaign website, Linthicum offers the nation's ever-increasing public debt as one piece of evidence: "During Walden’s time as a representative (nearly 16 years) the National Debt has tripled." We constantly hear about the nation’s trillions of dollars worth of debt, but has it really tripled in the time that Walden has been in office? We wanted to find out. Looking up the public debt -- past and present -- is a fairly simple exercise. The U.S. Department of the Treasury Bureau of the Public Debt has a handy website that lets you look up the debt on just about any date. Before we shower you with numbers, though, a quick note: As with almost anything we dig into, debt is a complex subject. When you talk about the total debt held by the U.S., there are two oft-cited measures. The first is the total outstanding public debt. That’s everything we owe to all of our debt-holders, no distinction made. Then there’s the debt held by the public. That’s our total debt minus intragovernmental debt or money owed by one part of the government to another part of the government. One economist we spoke to said the second one was generally "a little better measure." To be safe, we checked the growth of both. Walden began his service as a U.S. congressman in January 1999. The closest date we could find for which the Treasury had estimates of both sorts of debt was Sept. 30, 1999, so we went ahead and used that date and compared it with the most recent figures available, from Nov. 7. Here’s what we found: Back in 1999, the total outstanding public debt was $5.6 trillion. These days, it’s a little north of $17 trillion. In other words, it’s tripled. The U.S. debt minus the intragovernmental loans was $3.6 trillion back in 1999 and is about $12.1 trillion these days. So, that’s more than tripled. Of course, we’re not economists so our next step was to call some experts. We spoke with Tom Potiowsky, the chair of the Economics Department at Portland State University and the former chief economist for the state of Oregon, and Mark Thoma, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. They both had little doubt that Linthicum’s claim is accurate, but they did provide us with some caveats. Thoma noted that comparing our debt now, on the heels of a recession, to debt from 1999 when the economy was in better shape, might be somewhat deceiving. We’ve had to spend far more on social programs, for instance. "To me, it’s misleading to use a recession as your end point," he said. Potiowsky questioned whether it’s fair to hang the debt growth on Walden -- something we’ll get to later. And both Thoma and Potiowsky suggested we look at the U.S. debt relative to the nation’s gross domestic product. If the economy were expanding as quickly as the debt, that would be important to note. We dug back into the numbers. In 1999 the debt-to-GDP ratio (if you use the entire debt) was 57 percent. These days, it’s 101 percent. So it’s just about doubled. Meanwhile, if you skim off the intragovernmental debt, the ratio in 1999 was 36 percent and is 72 percent today. Again, it’s doubled. The takeaway, then, is that debt is growing and it’s growing faster than our GDP. We called Linthicum to ask whether it’s fair to pin this all on Walden. "I realize that Greg Walden is one member of the House, and there’s the Senate and there’s the president and his policies," he said. "I was just making what I saw as a statement of fact." That may be so, but given that Linthicum uses the claim on a campaign website specifically to draw contrasts between him as a fiscal conservative and Walden as somebody who has let the debt skyrocket, it’s hard not to read it as an attack. The blame, though, is largely misplaced. You’d also have to account for entitlement program growth and the impact of the recession. His statement is accurate but he can’t pin the bulk of the growth on Walden, who is one of hundreds of lawmakers and three presidents to serve since 1999. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08581	On running a "civil and polite" campaign	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/27/roy-barnes/bag-snakes-jab-leads-ajc-politifact-georgia-revisi/	A TV political ad funded by Democrats calls Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal "slippery as a bag of snakes." This gave AJC PolitiFact Georgia's scribes pause. The Democrats' candidate is former Gov. Roy Barnes. Didn't he say after the Republican primary runoff that "just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names"? We pulled out our Flip-O-Meter, which detects whether politicians have flipped on their positions. We've used the Flip-O-Meter on Barnes and his opinion on "civil and polite" campaigns before. On Aug. 11, Barnes said on WSB-TV that he'd try to run one. "I think that you can show differences without being mean," Barnes said. "You know, it’s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. There are differences, but they’re honorable people. And so just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names. "But we do have a responsibility to show the differences, and I think they do, too. As long as it’s done in a respectful way and one that’s not personal, I think that we can do that." In late August, we looked at Barnes' commercials to see if he was true to his word. We found the ads were not nearly as nasty as those in the Republican gubernatorial runoff. They focused on important issues and cited facts correctly. But with each new TV commercial, he moved further from "civil and polite" territory. We ruled Barnes did a Half Flip. So how's Barnes doing now? We peered into that bag of snakes with the help of two University of Georgia professors: Charles Bullock, an expert on Georgia politics, and Spencer Tinkham,an expert on political messaging. The Democratic Party of Georgia paid for "Fabrication," the pro-Barnes commercial. It was posted on YouTube.com on Sept. 19. It was a response to one released several days earlier by the Republican Governors Association. In both ads, pairs of codgers sit at tables covered in red-checked tablecloths, sipping coffee and swapping homespun political wisdom over the whine of a harmonica. In the Republican ad, the old men remember the term of Barnes, which ended in 2003, as an unhappy chapter in Georgia's history. In Democrats' ad, "times were better" when Barnes was governor, one of the men says. "So this Washington guy Deal is lying?" a second man asks. "Slippery as a bag of snakes," his friend replies. "I guess we can call him a 'shady Deal,' " the second man quips. The scene ends. An announcer says, "Nathan Deal. Too corrupt, even for Congress." Bullock's verdict: Negative. Tinkham's verdict: It's not a negative ad. It's a comparative one. A true negative ad would not mention the positive things done by the candidate it supports, he said. "I wouldn't call the ad 'civil and polite,' " Tinkham said. "But I think Barnes successfully separates himself from its content to such an extent that it is difficult to attribute the incivility and impoliteness to him. Rather, it seems that it's the 'good ole boys' in the coffee shop who are making the negative judgments." In Barnes' defense, Emil Runge, a spokesman for Barnes' campaign, said the ad was in response to a "misleading" one by Republicans. He added that Barnes never said he would avoid pointing out differences between himself and Deal. Since our experts were split and Runge made reasonable points, we looked at four other pro-Barnes TV commercials to see if the overall tone of Barnes' ads has shifted. "Fresh Start," released Aug. 27, compares Barnes to Deal on ethics. Deal might spend too much time clearing his name on ethics accusations, it said. Barnes has no such problems, so he can devote more time to Georgians. "Padlock," also released Aug. 27, features a cartoon of Deal in what appears to be a windowless storage closet. It said Deal is "hiding something," but offers no facts to back up its claim. "Secret Lease," released Sept. 6, said Deal's release of his tax returns is "a desperate attempt to fool the voters" and calls Deal "too corrupt, even for Congress." "Investigation," also released Sept. 6, scrolls through headlines about Deal's run-in with congressional ethics investigators and asks whether, if elected, he'd spend too much time clearing his name. While "Fresh Start" and "Investigation" for the most part stick to the facts on the legitimate issue of candidate ethics, "Secret Lease" accuses Deal of trying to deceive voters without clear proof, and "Padlock" is almost all insinuation.

pomt-08519	Since being elected in 2002, Scott Walker has "given back over $370,000 of his salary to the county."	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/06/scott-walker/gop-governor-candidate-scott-walker-says-he-has-gi/	For years, folks in southeastern Wisconsin have heard about Scott Walker, the Milwaukee County executive, giving up thousands upon thousands of dollars of his salary. Elsewhere, the claim may be more of a jaw-dropper. In March 2010, after launching his campaign for governor, Walker used a TV ad to tout the money he has returned and the amount is also proclaimed on Walker’s campaign website: Since being elected in 2002, Scott Walker has "given back over $370,000 of his salary to the county." The returned money was part of a 2002 campaign promise to cut the job’s salary by $60,000 per year. Walker, the Republican candidate for governor, made the pledge in the wake of a scandal over lavish county pensions. His Democratic opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, has taken a jab at Walker, pointing out Walker has reduced his annual giveback from $60,000 to $10,000. The Barrett campaign points to a 2002 Walker flier, which includes the promise to reduce the county exec salary by $60,000 per year. That promise, however, didn’t specify for how long Walker would reduce the salary by $60,000. And in April 2008, he was re-elected after telling voters he would reduce the giveback to $10,000. (Walker joked at the time, according to a news report, that his decision to give back nearly half of his $129,114 salary had been unpopular with his wife.) (For those wondering, Barrett has taken six furlough days, two in 2009 and four in 2010, according to an aide. He has been taking his full salary, which this year is $147,335, according to the city comptroller’s office.) So now the $370,000 question: Has Walker really given back that much back? Let’s find out. To get our tallies, we went first to the Walker gubernatorial campaign, which referred us to the county Department of Administrative Services. That office reports directly to Walker, so we also asked for figures from Milwaukee County Treasurer Dan Diliberti, a Democrat. Both offices agreed on the figures. Taking into account the partial year Walker served after being elected in 2002, and an odd number of pay periods in 2003 through 2005, Walker returned the equivalent of $60,000 per year from 2002 through 2007. In 2008, which was covered partly by the $60,000 promise and mostly by the $10,000 promise, Walker returned $18,846. And in 2009 and so far in 2010, Walker not only returned the equivalent of $10,000 per year, but he’s also written checks to the county, for just under $500 each, for one furlough day in 2009 and six more furlough days in 2010. The grand total? Walker has foregone $375,070 in salary since being elected county executive in 2002 -- $5,070 more than what he has claimed during the gubernatorial campaign. Our summation is as simple as the math: In his initial campaign, Walker made a pledge to return $60,000 a year, though he later was re-elected on a smaller give-back pledge. He said his checkbook is more than $370,000 lighter -- and the county’s coffers that much better off. The record shows Walker’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-06399	Says Rick Perry wrote a newspaper item saying he was "open to amnesty" for illegal immigrants in the United States.	/texas/statements/2011/oct/29/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-perry-wrote-opinion-article-sayin/	Assailed by Texas Gov. Rick Perry about undocumented workers who used to mow his lawn, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney shot back: "You wrote an op-ed (opinion piece) in the newspaper saying you were open to amnesty" for illegal immigrants. That moment at the Oct. 18, 2011, CNN Republican presidential debate marked continued jousting between the two over illegal immigration. According to a Sept. 11, 2011, news article in the Boston Globe, both hopefuls oppose legislation offering a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, deeming it "amnesty." In references to immigration, according to HG.org, a legal information website, amnesty means a "governmental pardon for violating policies related to immigration. Immigration amnesty would include the federal government forgiving individuals for using false documentation such as Social Security numbers, identification cards, and driver’s licenses, in order to gain employment in the U.S. and continue to remain in the country. Amnesty would allow illegal immigrants or undocumented aliens to gain permanent residency in the United States." The Globe article also notes that Perry unsuccessfully asked the 2011 Texas Legislature to approve legislation disallowing "sanctuary cities" in his state and ensuring police officers could inquire into the immigration status of people they stop. The story says too that Perry opposes the federal DREAM Act, which would open a path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants who complete two years of college or military service. Republicans haven’t always aligned against amnesty plans. A 1986 measure signed into law by President Ronald Reagan permitted residents illegally in the country before 1982 to work toward legal status. According to a July 2010 report by NPR, nearly 3 million illegal immigrants ultimately took advantage of the opportunity, though critics judged the law a failure at curbing illegal immigration. These days, Perry ranks among candidates who view amnesty as a toxic term. A Sept. 12, 2011, press release from his campaign says that Perry "believes that Washington must first secure the border before we can have any rational discussion about immigration reform, and he opposes amnesty." Then again, NumbersUSA, a group that airs concerns about mass immigration, says in a web post updated Sept. 28, 2011, that Perry’s stance on amnesty "remains unclear. During the (George W.) Bush presidency, Gov. Perry gave mild support to the idea of legalization. But he has spoken against President Obama's various ‘administrative amnesties.’" That’s a reference to the Obama administration’s declaration it’s applying "prosecutorial discretion" to deport some illegal residents and not others. Some factors the government listed in June 2011 as affecting deportations include how long a person has been here, with particular consideration given to his or her legal residency status; if the person came here as a young child; and if he or she has pursued a college degree or served in the military or have immediate relatives who have done so. NumbersUSA also notes Perry’s support for a 2001 Texas law enabling some undocumented residents to pay in-state tuition at colleges and universities. Its entry continues: "He opposes a congressional-passed amnesty as long as the border is not secure. He says once the border is secure, a conversation about amnesty can start. He does not make it clear where he would stand during such a conversation." Back to Romney’s debate jab. Did Perry write a piece saying he was open to amnesty? Romney spokesman Ryan Williams sent us a copy of a July 28, 2001, letter from Perry, who had become governor the previous year, to the editor of the Dallas Morning News. In the letter, Perry takes exception to a news story characterizing him as wary of easing the flow of immigrants from Mexico into the United States. That news article, in the July 27, 2001, Morning News, quoted Perry airing reservations about a proposal by the George W. Bush administration to grant permanent legal residency to many undocumented immigrants from Mexico. "I share the concerns of most Texans and most residents of the United States about an amnesty program," the story quoted Perry saying. "All of those concerns must be addressed in a thoughtful methodical manner." The article also referred to President Bush saying he didn’t favor unconditional amnesty for immigrants living here illegally. "Perry said he, too, sees problems in blanket amnesty but that he supports the goal of working with Mexico on having a seamless border," the article said. "‘Having some day in the future a transparent border is an admirable goal and one we should have,’ (Perry) said. ‘With that said, we realize there are problems with health care, education, environment and infrastructure all along the border of Texas and Mexico that we need to address. Until both countries are comfortable that we addressed these concerns, then we need to be cautious and make progress one step at a time.’" Perry’s subsequent letter of objection to the newspaper said: "The truth is, I am intrigued and open to the Bush administration's amnesty proposal. Most Texans would agree that it's better to have legal, taxpaying immigrants from Mexico working in the United States than illegal immigrants living in fear of the law and afraid to access basic services." Perry’s letter also said that if Mexico develops a "stronger middle class, the goal of a more seamless, transparent border could become a reality. In the meantime," his letter said, "...there are many unanswered questions about how an amnesty plan would be implemented and how it would ultimately impact our state's health care and education systems, as well as other services. Any amnesty proposal must be thoroughly debated and analyzed before implementation and should include input from all border states. Such a plan could benefit our state and countless Mexican families seeking a better life. I applaud President Bush for initiating a public dialogue on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to participate in the development of this initiative." So, Perry wrote to a newspaper saying he was open to the Bush amnesty proposal, though any proposal would need vetting. News reports show Perry talking down amnesty in later years. In a Dec. 14, 2006, article posted on the website of the Texas governor’s office, Perry said "neither amnesty nor mass deportation is the answer" to border security and illegal immigration. "The first unfairly rewards those who broke our laws, and the latter is not only unrealistic and unenforceable, but it would devastate our economy. That’s why I support a guest worker program that takes undocumented workers off the black market and legitimizes their economic contributions without providing them citizenship status." His article continues: "I would rather know who is crossing our border legally to work instead of not knowing who is crossing our border illegally to work. A guest worker program that provides foreign workers with an ID removes the incentive for millions of people to illegally enter our country. It also adds those workers to our tax base, generates revenue for needed social services and it can be done without providing citizenship." In his January 2007 inaugural address, Perry said: "We must have a guest-worker program... And we must oppose amnesty because those who come here illegally should not be able to receive citizenship ahead of those who migrate here legally." He said much the same in his February 2007 State-of-the-State address, telling lawmakers: "Those who come here illegally should not be rewarded with amnesty." In August 2007, according to a Houston Chronicle news story, Perry said during a trip to Mexico that he supports a system that would temporarily legalize foreign workers, while making sure they pay taxes and obey the law. Such a system, Perry said then, would allow for a "free flow of individuals between these countries who want to work, who want to be an asset to our country and to Mexico." Stumping in Iowa for Rudy Giuliani for president in November 2007, Perry was interrupted when he advocated securing the border and providing non-citizen workers with a tamper-proof ID card, according to a Dallas Morning News recap. In what may have been a reminder that some people see temporary guest-worker schemes as tantamount to amnesty, an audience member said: "That sounds like amnesty." In early 2008, Perry stressed border security over immigration reform in an Austin press conference, saying that if a comprehensive overhaul occurs he wants temporary workers who apply for U.S. citizenship to wait their turn behind others who have already done so. "There's a line. Get in just like everybody else," he said, according to an article in the Feb. 1, 2008, Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Our ruling Romney’s claim leaves the incorrect misimpression Perry is lately open to amnesty, while Perry has said he's against amnesty for years. Still, Romney is correct that Perry once wrote a newspaper saying he was open to amnesty, though Perry's 2001 letter spoke only to a particular proposal. The Texan also has aired continued interest in enabling illegal immigrants to become guest workers, an idea that some consider a form of amnesty. We rate Romney's statement Half True.

pomt-04548	"We haven’t passed a budget in more than three years and not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the floor this year."	/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/28/bob-corker/bob-corker-says-senate-has-not-passed-budget-more-/	Congress headed home for its six-week, pre-election break on Sept. 22, after the U.S. Senate voted just past midnight to give final approval to a short-term budget measure that will keep the federal government running for another six months. The decision to approve a short-term budget fix instead of passing a spending plan for the entire fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 again set off a debate about whether lawmakers were acting irresponsibly. "We haven’t passed a budget in more than three years and not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the floor this year," U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in a press release explaining why he voted against the short-term measure. Corker argued Congress should not be passing the short-term measure, known as a continuing resolution, or any spending bill until it has prioritized how taxpayer dollars are to be spent and at what levels. "If the Senate can’t perform its most basic responsibilities," Corker said, "I worry about how we’re going to make the tough decisions and do the hard work that will be necessary to get our country on a path to fiscal solvency." To back up the senator’s claim about congressional inaction on a budget and spending bills, Corker’s office pointed us to two documents compiled by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee. The first was a timeline indicating that the last time the Democratic-led Senate passed a budget was on April 29, 2009. The other document was a status report on all 12 of the annual spending bills that provide funding for federal departments and agencies. According to that document, not one of the 12 spending bills has been considered by the full Senate this year. Corker is not the first Republican to take the Democratic-led Senate to task for failing to pass a budget. PolitiFact and its partners in other states have examined at least five similar claims in the past, and rulings on those have varied because the statements were worded differently. When statements attempted to pin the blame squarely on just one political party for the inaction, rulings of Half True were given. But in a case where blame was not heaped on just one party, as is the case with Corker’s statement, PolitiFact has gone with True or Mostly True, depending on the wording of the claim. In any case, each of those statements cited the same date – April 29, 2009 – as the last time a budget had been approved. An April 26, 2012, item from PolitiFact Ohio explained how the budget process is supposed to work: Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise. Budget resolutions are policy plans. They are not appropriations bills, or spending bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes. If a budget resolution doesn’t pass, the federal government won’t go dark. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money. What about Corker’s claim that not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the Senate floor this year? The U.S. House passed seven of the 12 annual appropriations bills this year and sent them to the Senate for consideration, according to the status report by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved 11 of the 12 spending bills and sent them to the full Senate for consideration. An independent search by PolitiFact via the Library of Congress’ Thomas bill-tracking web site confirmed the figures cited in the GOP report. But none of the bills approved by the House or the Senate Appropriations Committee were ever brought to the Senate floor for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who decides which bills will be considered, told reporters on July 10, 2012, that no spending bills were likely to be approved this year because of an ongoing dispute with House Republicans over how much the federal government should spend. True to his word, Reid so far has not brought any of the annual spending bills to the floor this year, necessitating the short-term budget measure to keep the government running for another six months. Previous PolitiFact items on claims like this also have brought this perspective -- there have been times when Republicans have been in charge and also have failed to pass a budget. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida report that the House and the Senate had failed to pass a joint budget bill on four other occasions since 1983. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. For fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007, the House and the Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress. Our ruling Sen. Corker says it has been more than three years since Congress passed a budget and that this year, not a single appropriations bill has made it the Senate floor. The record shows that he has his facts straight. While other Republicans have tried to lay the blame for the lack of a budget at the feet of Democrats, Corker does not specifically apportion blame just one party. He simply chastised the Senate in general for failing to pass a budget and we rate his statement as True.	None	Bob Corker	None	None	None	2012-09-28T04:00:00	2012-09-22	['None']

pomt-05845	Says abortion is "the most common surgery in our country."	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/15/patrick-johnston/leader-personhood-issue-claims-abortion-most-commo/	Nearly four decades after the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case legalized abortion, it remains an emotionally-charged debate. It was against that backdrop that Dr. Patrick Johnston, the director of Personhood Ohio and a leader of the effort to get the so-called "Personhood" issue on the Ohio ballot, began his remarks on Cleveland public radio on Jan. 30 with a statement. At the outset of his remarks, Johnston referred to abortion as "the most common surgery in our country." The statement became the launching point for the Zanesville-area doctor to make his case that abortions have become too routine and for why Ohioans should back a rewriting of the Ohio Constitution so that a fertilized egg is defined as a person -- a change that effectively would outlaw abortion. Johnston’s claim seemed like the kind of straightforward assertion that Politifact Ohio can dig into while steering clear of the moral questions that surround the divisive issue. We began by checking with Johnston to see where he got his numbers on abortion, and the frequency of other procedures. He directed us to the website for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy analysis group, as the source for his abortion numbers—they count about 1.21 million abortions in 2008. He also pointed us to several websites for gall bladder surgery, which assert that the procedure is one of the most common surgeries in the United States with about 500,000 patients a year. The Guttmacher Institute numbers for abortions were much higher than those we found from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported about 828,000 abortions in 2007. However, the CDC numbers are based on reports from state health departments and do not include abortions done in California, Maryland and New Hampshire — three states where the reporting of abortions is apparently voluntary. Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman with the Guttmacher Institute, said her group’s numbers include all 50 states and are based on actively surveying abortion providers rather than pulling data from state health department reports. Over the past several years, the Guttmacher Institute’s estimated number of abortions in the United States have basically held steady going from 1,206,200 in 2005 to 1,212,350 in 2008. But are there more common forms of surgery? The federal CDC keeps close tabs on what people are discharged from hospitals for based on a pair of national annual surveys, one for inpatient and one for outpatient clients. By far, the most common form of surgery in 2006 was eye surgery for cataracts. There were about 5.63 million eye surgeries that involved either removing or replacing the eye lens, according to the 2006 National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (the latest outpatient survey available). There were about 1.4 million endoscopic polypectomies, which involves the removal of presumed pre-cancerous lesions such as polyps on the colon, according to the outpatient numbers. Meanwhile, there were about 1.34 million Caesarean sections where the fetus is delivered by cutting open the pregnant woman’s abdomen, according to the 2007 National Hospital Discharge Survey (the latest inpatient survey available). Abortion would rank fourth behind that trio in most common surgeries. But are they all examples of surgery or could they be considered just medical procedures? We spoke with Dr. Lisa Keder, an obstetrician and associate professor with the Ohio State University Medical Center, and she said that while the term surgery isn’t strictly defined, the way that patients are billed for medical procedures reflects whether it is officially considered "surgery." Keder said that eye operations, endoscopic polypectomies, C-sections and abortions are all coded for billing purposes as surgeries. Additionally, we should note here that because so many people go to the hospital for medical procedures -- almost 45 million inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in 2007 in the United States -- that virtually every type of surgery on a human system when classified broadly was much more common than abortions. There were, for example, 6.94 million heart operations, but no specific procedure more than the 1.06 million cardiac catheterizations. So if you classify surgeries in broad terms, abortions tumble much farther than No. 4 on the most common surgeries list. Johnston , while trying to make his case that abortion has become too routine, told a Cleveland radio audience that abortion was "the most common surgery in this country." He’s not even close. The most comprehensive abortions statistics show about 1.21 million abortions a year in the United States. But annual surveys show there are about 5.63 million eye surgeries involving the removal or replacement of the lens in the eye. That procedure occurs more than four times as often as abortion. And abortion didn’t rank No. 2 or No. 3. There were about 1.4 million cases where presumed per-cancerous polyps were removed from inside a patient’s body the year of the most recent outpatient survey numbers available. Meanwhile, a procedure that is common among women who are giving birth -- a Caesarean section -- occured more frequently that year than did abortion.

pomt-10411	Obama's wife wrote a paper in college that said America was a nation founded on "crime and hatred" and that whites in America are "ineradicably racist."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/30/chain-email/her-senior-thesis-doesnt-say-that/	A chain e-mail about Michelle Obama purports to be excerpts from a senior thesis she wrote while at Princeton University. It's true that Obama, then Michelle Robinson, attended Princeton and wrote a thesis titled "Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community." In Obama's thesis, she sought to quantify how the attitudes of black Princeton alumni changed after graduation in regard to race relations and social change. Obama was especially interested in the attitudes of Princeton alumni in regard to improving the lives of lower-income blacks. To document the change in attitudes, Obama devised an 18-question survey and mailed it to black alumni. Her thesis is a discussion of her methodology and an analysis of the results. It contains a limited amount of personal opinion in the introduction. But the thesis did not say that the United States was founded on "crime and hatred" and that whites in America are "ineradicably racist." This appears to be a complete fabrication. The thesis is available on the Internet; the politics news site Politico reported on it in February 2008 and posted a copy it had obtained from Princeton University . We downloaded a copy, which appears to be complete with no numbered pages missing. We read it, but we did not find the phrases the e-mail describes. We took the additional step of scanning the document through optical character recognition software so we could search its text electronically. An automated search did not find the words "crime," "hatred," "hate," "ineradicably," or "racist" in the document. The e-mail goes on to list some accurate quotes from the thesis, but its initial accusations are fiction. The words "crime and hatred" and "ineradicably racist" are inventions of whoever penned the e-mail, not words that appeared in Obama's thesis. Because of that fabrication and the e-mail's intention to defame the Obamas, we rate this claim Pants on Fire! For more about this chain e-mail, read our story Digging up dirt on Michelle Obama .

pomt-10896	Says Tony Evers "didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/06/republican-party-wisconsin/yes-explaining-gops-attack-governor-candidate-tony/	With the Aug. 14, 2018 primary election closing in, the Wisconsin Republican Party on Aug. 1, 2018 released radio ads attacking four of the eight Democrats who are running for governor. In announcing the ads, the party identified Tony Evers, Matt Flynn, Mahlon Mitchell and Kelda Roys as the leading candidates to win the right to challenge GOP Gov. Scott Walker in the general election on Nov. 6, 2018. The ad attacking Evers, who is the state schools superintendent, claims Evers "didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls." An earlier version of the GOP attack, which we fact checked in 2017, rated Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter. The revised attack does a little better, but still leaves out important context. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. The teacher The radio ad alludes to the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. As we reported in the earlier fact check, Harris was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. As the state GOP continued to hammer on the case in 2017, it was later reported that a fellow staff member had told the school district’s investigators Harris also had made crude remarks to staffers about the appearances and chest sizes of female students. However, Evers’ department said neither the department nor the arbitrator could determine whether Harris actually made the sexually crude comments. Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. The arbitrator concluded that Harris’ behavior did not endanger any students — a key finding, based on state law at the time — and the decision to give Harris back his job was upheld by two courts. The real punch in the Republican Party’s attack, though, is aimed at Evers. So, where does he come in? Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Evers’ role Evers did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. But Evers decided against seeking revocation after concluding, as the arbitrator did, that the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger kids, as defined by the law at that time. In other words, in the view of Evers’ department, there was no legal basis to take away Harris’ license. At the time, state law defined immoral conduct in such cases as "conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil." After the Harris case, the law was changed so that immoral conduct includes "the intentional use of an educational agency’s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material." That is, the part about endangering students was removed, a change that was backed by both Evers and Walker. We’re on the 6 p.m. newscasts on WTMJ-TV on Wednesdays and Fridays. Our rating The state Republican Party says Evers "didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls." It’s true that Evers, as the state schools superintendent, opted not to revoke the teacher’s license. But what’s left out is that Evers concluded that state law at the time didn’t allow for a revocation because the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger children. The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator, who ruled the teacher had been fired improperly and gave the teacher back his job. And two courts upheld the arbitrator’s decision. The importance of the endangering standard was underlined by the fact that the Legislature later made sure to take that clause out. The attack on Evers is partially accurate, but leaves out important details — our definition of Half True.

pomt-09698	"History tells us that job growth always lags behind economic growth."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/09/barack-obama/obama-says-job-growth-always-lags-behind-economic-/	Some Republican critics have scoffed at President Barack Obama's pronouncements that the economy seems to be improving, pointing to the unemployment rate, which keeps going up. But Obama has consistently tempered his hopeful words about positive economic indicators with warnings that unemployment rates are likely to continue to rise for a while, even as the economy improves. "History tells us that job growth always lags behind economic growth," Obama said Nov. 6, 2009, in remarks in the White House Rose Garden. "He's right about that," said William Beach, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's center for data analysis. In the post-World War II era, there have been 10 recessions and after most of them, employment lagged a few months behind other improving economic indicators. But after the last two, in 1991 and 2001, unemployment rates continued to climb for more than a year. Interestingly, Democrats criticized President George W. Bush regarding the 2001 "jobless recovery," much as some Republicans now criticize Obama for the current one. The latest jobless recovery came as little surprise to economists who study such trends. "Employers are hesitant to hire people back to the work force (after a recession) because they don't know if the economy is going to continue to grow, which is understandable," Beach said. But more importantly, he said, the American economy has become increasingly reliant on service jobs, such as information and financial jobs. "Those jobs come back very slowly," Beach said. The recession this time is even more severe, so Beach predicts this jobless recovery will last even longer than past recessions. "I don't think we'll see jobs coming back for a long time," Beach said. But even without government meddling, Beach believes employment was destined to lag. The San Francisco Chronicle , relying on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in August charted the lag between recessions' end and the peak of unemployment rates. In the eight recessions between 1949 and 1991, unemployment rates lagged by an average of about three months. After the last two, however, it took 15 months and 19 months, respectively, before unemployment rates peaked. Bottom line, President Obama is right when he cautions that employment has lagged behind economic recovery in the past. And so we rate his statement True.

pomt-11536	"Russian source behind fake Trump dossier killed in Russian plane crash, Rosatom CFO also dead"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/14/puppetstringnewscom/fake-news-claims-two-russian-officials-dead-plane-/	A fake news story said that two Russian officials linked to an infamous dossier and a Russian nuclear agency were among the victims of a plane crash near Moscow that killed all 71 passengers. "Russian source behind fake Trump dossier killed in Russian plane crash, Rosatom CFO also dead," read the headline on a Feb. 11, 2018, post on Puppet String News. The post was flagged on Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake news story took a real plane crash and made up the names of some of those who died. Consider the source: Puppet String News describes itself as created by a jaded U.S. Navy veteran who "decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability." We found many things wrong with the post. The story begins by citing an actual Business Insider story on Belarus-born businessman Sergei Millian as a key source in the Trump-Russia dossier, a 35-page report of opposition research on President Donald Trump, prepared by a former British intelligence officer who was hired by Trump’s Republican and Democratic rivals during the election. Later, the Puppet String News story suggests Millian actually goes by the name Sergey Panchenko and died in the Russian plane crash. Sergey Panchenko is listed on the passenger list released by Russian authorities, but Panchenko is a different person than Millian. The article also refers to Millian as being Russian, but he’s Belarusian. The name "Sergei Millian" is not listed at all in the list of passengers who were boarded on the plane. The story offered an unsourced photo of passengers' names who were on the aircraft with Panchenko highlighted. Also killed off in this story is Ivanov Vyacheslav, who is credited with being the CFO of nuclear energy corporation Rosatom, the company at the center of the Uranium One deal. That deal involved the sale of a Canadian company with mining interests in the United States to Russia’s nuclear energy agency. Vyacheslav did hold the CFO position at Rosatom until 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. According to the company website, the current CFO is Nikolay Soloman. This Ivanov Vyacheslav was not on the plane, but a different man by the name was. The man killed in the plane crash was born in 1986, Snopes reported, whereas the former Rosatom CFO began studying for his degree in 1987. Our ruling A fake news site said that two Russian officials had died in a plane crash. While the list of victims contained names that matched those of the two officials, they were not the same people. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05256	Says that from 1992 through 2010, every statewide candidate drawing over 43 percent of the vote in a Republican Texas primary won the resulting runoff.	/texas/statements/2012/may/31/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-1992-every-texas-republican-dr/	David Dewhurst led the May 2012 Texas Republican primary for the U.S. Senate with 45 percent of the vote; his campaign then said that history is on Dewhurst’s side in the July 31 runoff against second-place finisher Ted Cruz, who drew 34 percent in the primary, according to nearly complete returns. A memo from Dewhurst pollster Mike Baselice, issued at 11 p.m. May 29, 2012, says: "While we should expect a normal post-election tightening of numbers, history demonstrates why Dewhurst is in a strong position to become U.S. senator: every Republican candidate with over 43 percent going into a statewide runoff during the last 20 years has gone on to win." For sure? Dewhurst’s spokesman, Matt Hirsch, provided us with a spreadsheet he described as listing every statewide Republican primary since 1992 resulting in a runoff. Runoffs occur when no candidate draws more than 50 percent of the primary vote. Hirsch said the information on Dewhurst’s spreadsheet was drawn from historical election returns kept by the state. According to Dewhurst’s spreadsheet, 13 statewide GOP Texas primaries led to runoffs from 1998 through 2010. By phone, Hirsch told us the party had no statewide runoffs in 1992, 1994 or 1996, though we later confirmed there were runoffs in 1996. And of the statewide Republican primaries that led to runoffs, four fit the Dewhurst campaign’s conditions, according to the spreadsheet. That is, three judicial primaries and a primary for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission involved candidates garnering more than 43 percent of the primary vote who later won their runoffs. In four of the other GOP primaries resulting in runoffs, the candidate who led the primary won the runoff, according to the spreadsheet. Yet five GOP primary leaders -- including 1998 attorney general hopeful Barry Williamson -- lost their runoff. Two eventual losers carried 38 percent of the primary vote and one drew nearly 43 percent – not quite the "over 43 percent" figure aired in the Dewhurst campaign’s memo. Dewhurst’s spreadsheet shows that in a 2002 Texas Supreme Court primary, Elizabeth Ray drew nearly 42.92 percent of the vote to Dale Wainwright’s 31 percent. Ray lost the runoff, however, drawing 45 percent to Wainwright’s 55 percent. Online recaps posted by the Texas secretary of state, which oversees election returns, confirmed the campaign’s examples of runoffs won by individuals who earlier drew over 43 percent of the primary vote. Specifically, Paul Womack, running for a spot on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, drew nearly 45 percent of the 2002 primary vote and won the runoff with nearly 57 percent. Also that year, Tom Price drew 47 percent in the primary and 57 percent in the runoff. In 2004, Victor Carrillo, running for the railroad commission, carried nearly 50 percent of the primary vote, 63 percent in his runoff. And in 2006, Charles Holcomb won 45 percent of the primary vote for a Court of Criminal Appeals seat, drawing 54 percent in the runoff. Our review of each primary since 1992 unearthed three 1996 Court of Criminal Appeals runoffs not on Dewhurst’s spreadsheet. One of these runoff winners, Price, prevailed after barely trailing -- by 30.53 percent to 30.35 percent -- in the primary. Bottom line: Four primaries resulting in runoffs neatly match up with the Dewhurst camp’s conditions.In contrast, a dozen primaries resulting in runoffs do not perfectly fit the parameters because the leader in the primary carried 43 percent or less of the vote, meaning he or she fared worse than Dewhurst in the 2012 primary -- and half of these other primary winners won the runoff, while half lost. Our ruling We are not judging the predictive value of Dewhurst’s claim, which would be speculative beyond the bounds of a backward-looking fact check. For instance, skeptics might stress that only four of the 16 GOP statewide primary-runoff combinations from 1992 through 2010 fully support Dewhurst's claim. Half of the remaining dozen primary leaders lost the runoffs. Put another way, however, there are no instances since 1992 of a Texas Republican candidate for statewide office drawing more than 43 percent of the primary vote and losing the runoff, which is Dewhurst’s point. We rate the claim as True.	None	David Dewhurst	None	None	None	2012-05-31T12:30:44	2012-05-29	['None']
pomt-09011	Tarpon Springs takes its homeless to St. Petersburg.	/florida/statements/2010/jul/09/leslie-curran/city-council-chairwoman-leslie-curran-says-tarpon-/	The nickname for it is "Greyhound therapy." A police officer comes across a homeless person and gives him a one-way bus ticket out of town to a faraway locale. It's also dubbed "homeless dumping," where officials from one city drive homeless people to another city, drop them off and leave. One city's solution becomes another city's problem, handled in the most impolitic way. Does it happen? Or is it the stuff of urban legend? No one can say for sure, partly because no jurisdiction would ever admit to sticking another place with its homeless problem. Which makes what City Council Chairwoman Leslie Curran said at a May 13 council meeting so extraordinary. Curran implicated Tarpon Springs police Officer Jose Yourgules, and unnamed others, in passing the buck. "When he comes upon any homeless individual in Tarpon Springs who needs assistance, he brings them to St. Petersburg," she said. "They send them all to St. Petersburg." Yourgules made this confession at the May 7 Homeless Leadership Network meeting, Curran said. "I didn't find it amusing," Curran said. "I don't think it's funny that every other city should depend on St. Petersburg to provide social services for everyone in the county." That does seem unfair, so, really, why does Yourgules do it? Well, not so fast, Yourgules said. "We don't do that," he said. For one, Tarpon Springs doesn't have a big homeless problem. He said the town has about 40 homeless people. Total. As the Police Department's homeless outreach officer, he does come across people who might need help. Does he bring people to St. Petersburg and drop them off at places like St. Vincent de Paul? "No, that's the worst thing you could do," Yourgules said. "You're not helping them if you do that." Instead, he said, he calls around to shelters in Pinellas County, checking which ones have open beds. He said that since March 15, he has placed 10 people in shelters. He took four to Pinellas Park, which has two shelters, Pinellas Hope and Touched by an Angel. He took five to Clearwater, which has two shelters, Homeless Emergency Project Inc. and Clearwater Homeless Intervention Project. He has taken only one person to St. Petersburg, to A Turning Point, an alcohol rehabilitation center. We checked it out. Pinellas Hope's facility manager, Angelia Mosley, confirmed that Yourgules brings homeless people to the Pinellas Park shelter. Jeffrey Polhill, president of the Touched by an Angel, said he knows who Yourgules is, but said the shelter doesn't track officers in its records. Neither does Clearwater Homeless Intervention Project, said Larry Passaro, a case manager there. "I do know that Tarpon Springs police bring people to our shelter," Passaro said. Katrina Tucker, program manager for A Turning Point, confirmed that Yourgules had brought only one person to the facility since March 15. Did Yourgules say what Curran said he said? The meetings aren't recorded, so it's unclear. The minutes of the meeting are compiled from typewritten notes of a staffer. They summarize, briefly, that Curran asked Yourgules where he sent people for services and he said ''St. Petersburg." Sarah Snyder, executive director of Pinellas County Coalition for the Homeless, is responsible for the minutes. She said Yourgules meant that as a joke. "We told him afterward that there are things you don't joke about," Snyder said. But City Council member Herb Polson, who attended the meeting, said Yourgules wasn't joking. Pinellas County Commissioner Ken Welch attended the meeting, but doesn't remember Yourgules speaking. He did find it hard to believe that Yourgules would have said something like that. "I don't remember any statement about homeless people from north county being brought to St. Petersburg," Welch said. Another attendee, former St. Petersburg City Council member Jamie Bennett, said Yourgules did in fact say that. "I think he just misspoke," Bennett said. "He's brand new. That was his first meeting. I don't think he meant it." Yourgules said that what he said was misunderstood, but he definitely hadn't been joking. He said Snyder didn't tell him that there are some things you don't joke about. "What I was trying to say is that up north, there are no services," Yourgules said. "We take them to where the shelters are." And that's not St. Petersburg, he said. "Clearwater and Pinellas Park provide more services that we use," he said. "(Curran's) just upset. They are the biggest city, and it has the highest population of the homeless. But we don't bring people there and leave them. That would be unethical." Curran said she believed him, now. "All I was reporting is what he said at the time," Curran said. "Nothing on him, but that's just what he said." The Truth-O-Meter isn't interested in what Yourgules said. That's a good thing, too, considering that there's no recording of the meeting, only vague minutes reflecting what was said. But no one is disputing what Yourgules claims now and what his records show. Four shelters confirmed his records. He takes the majority of the homeless people he finds to shelters, which mostly aren't in St. Petersburg. What we're assessing is Curran's claim that Tarpon Springs takes all of its homeless to St. Petersburg. And we find no evidence to substantiate her blanket statement. We rate her statement False.

pomt-13439	If upstate New York split from downstate "the economic indicators of upstate New York would be among the lowest in the country."	/new-york/statements/2016/sep/16/bob-duffy/upstate-economy-one-worst-country/	Former Lt. Governor Robert Duffy penned an op-ed piece in the Rochester Business Journal urging upstate lawmakers to form their own caucus. Doing so would help them press upstate issues in a state legislature dominated by downstate lawmakers. But upstate New York breaking from downstate entirely? Duffy called the idea "ludicrous." "If we ever did that, the economic indicators of upstate New York would be among the lowest in the country," Duffy claimed. "We do count on downstate to carry much of the load for the economic health of New York." Calls for upstate to secede from New York State are not new. But secession gained steam last year when upstate advocates pitched the idea at a protest in the Southern Tier. Some were angry over gun control laws passed in 2013. Others were upset by the ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, because they believe the gas drilling process would boost that region’s struggling economy. One of the leading secession proponents, the Divide NYS Caucus, hopes for momentum to build ahead of a future Constitutional Convention in New York State. Voters will decide whether to hold a convention in the 2017 general election. Downstate has a bigger population than upstate. The Assembly is comfortably in the hands of lawmakers from New York City and the surrounding area, most of whom are Democrats. The State Senate, meanwhile, is controlled by Republicans, mostly from upstate and Long Island. Is Duffy right? Would upstate’s economy rank low on its own? The Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce was not able to tell us which economic indicators Duffy was referring to. We looked at two indicators typically used to measure the economy - unemployment and wages - to check his claim. The unemployment scorecard As of July, the statewide unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That’s better than the national average of 4.9 percent. But New York State still ranks 25th in the nation, tied with three other states. Duffy says the line dividing upstate from downstate is the same used in this year’s minimum wage hike. In that deal, New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County were given a different timeline to reach the higher wage than the rest of the state. Our analysis uses the same method: We define upstate as everything north of New York City except for Westchester County. There’s no data publicly available that shows unemployment for this definition of upstate. We used county-level data from state and federal databases to evaluate Duffy’s claim. The unemployment rate in upstate New York is 4.6 percent, according to the latest data from the state Department of Labor. That number is an average of the counties we’ve defined as upstate. That’s better than the statewide average and would rank 23rd in the nation - ahead of the statewide ranking. The wage scorecard Income per capita is different than the average wage. It measures how much money someone takes in, whether it’s earned at a job or not, instead of just measuring how much a job pays. We looked at both. In upstate, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the per capita income was $40,123 at the end of 2014, the latest county-level data. Upstate would have ranked 37th in the nation that year, below the national average of $46,049. New York State as a whole ranked fifth that year. As for wages, only Washington, D.C., had a higher average wage than New York State’s $67,521. The national average is $52,942. The average wage upstate was $42,287 by the end of 2015, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. If it was its own state, upstate would rank 44th for wages, ahead of South Carolina but behind New Mexico. Our ruling Duffy wrote in the Rochester Business Journal that "the economic indicators of upstate New York would be among the lowest in the country" if the region split from downstate. We compared national data on unemployment and wages to county-level data to rate his claim. With Duffy’s definition of upstate New York, unemployment is close to the national average while wages and income are among the lowest in the country according to the latest data. We rate this claim as Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa7c54fa-de00-4abc-9ed1-8e386ceaf46c	None	Robert Duffy	None	None	None	2016-09-16T15:15:08	2016-08-19	['New_York_City']

pomt-06351	"The average homeowner spends more than $2,000 each year on energy costs – more than on either real estate taxes or homeowners insurance."	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/07/johnny-isakson/isakson-says-energy-bills-higher-taxes-insurance/	Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson wants Americans to invest in greener homes, and he is co-sponsoring a bill he thinks will help this take place. The Sensible Accounting to Value Energy Act, introduced last month, requires lenders who write mortgages backed by the federal government to consider a home’s possible energy costs along with loan payments and other expenses when they determine whether a buyer can afford it. Energy bills are even higher than real estate taxes or homeowners insurance, Isakson said in a press release issued Oct. 19. "The average homeowner spends more than $2,000 each year on energy costs – more than on either real estate taxes or homeowners insurance, both of which are regularly accounted for in mortgage underwriting, " the release read. Even more than real estate taxes or homeowners insurance? Sounds like a big chunk of a typical homeowner’s budget. We took a closer look. An Isakson spokeswoman referred us to a chart produced by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Market Transformation, which promotes energy efficiency and green buildings. It created a chart with average 2008 costs for energy, property taxes and homeowners insurance. Energy costs stood at $2,278. Property taxes were $1,879. Homeowners insurance was $791. The chart said that the IMT used U.S. Department of Energy data, U.S. Census Bureau numbers, and figures for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Researchers typically go to these sources for this type of information. Each year, the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy publishes the Buildings Energy Data Book, which tracks how much energy residential and commercial buildings use. They include data on how much the average household spends on energy. For 2008, it was $2,269, or $9 lower than IMT’s figure. An IMT researcher told us that their number is higher because they included costs of wood fuel, which the Energy Department excludes. The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey includes estimates on the median amount of real estate taxes paid for owner-occupied housing units. It was $1,897, according to their 2008 data. This is close to IMT’s number. Then we looked at average yearly costs for homeowners insurance. We looked at census data, which is based on calculations from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. For 2008, it was $791, just as IMT said. Isakson was right. On average, the amount of money a homeowner pays for energy bills is higher than property taxes or homeowners insurance. He earns a True.

pomt-13244	Says that compared to direct sales by manufacturers, consumers "save avg of $500 per car sold through franchised dealer model."	/texas/statements/2016/oct/18/texas-automobile-dealers-association/car-dealers-association-incorrectly-ties-500-savin/	To say Tesla Motors hasn’t had an easy ride directly selling its high-end electric vehicles to Texans is an understatement. That’s probably due in part to the sway of the Texas Automobile Dealers Association, which through the 2013 and 2015 state legislative sessions stopped Tesla’s effort to repeal a prohibition on vehicle manufacturers selling directly to Texas motorists -- a standoff expected to renew in the 2017 session. So we noticed when @teslaintexas, a Twitter account for Tesla’s efforts in Texas, said in a September 2016 tweet: "Auto dealers profit off the current system." The tweet urged followers to tell legislators to legalize "direct sales." The auto dealers association, through the @autodealerstx account, shot back with a tweet stating "consumers save avg of $500 per car sold through franchised dealer model. #txlege got it right the first time." We wondered about that savings figure, ultimately finding the association’s cited study didn’t compare dealership sales to online or phone sales of the kind that Tesla conducts with Texas customers. First, it’s worth a look at what the auto dealers and Tesla have been tussling over. The Texas franchise law, implemented decades ago, prohibited direct sales of vehicles from the manufacturer to the consumer. In other words, Tesla cannot sell cars at their own Texas showrooms, though it may process orders by phone or online. Other states, including Connecticut, Michigan and Utah, have dealership statutes, according to Stateline, a reporting service on state policy funded by the Pew Charitable Trust. For their part, TADA has told lawmakers that the franchise model saves consumers money because it allows them to shop around independently-owned dealerships, where deals and other incentives can drop the car’s sticker price. So why has Tesla declined to sell its electric vehicles through Texas dealerships a la Ford, Chevrolet and Toyota? Appearing before the Federal Trade Commission in January 2016, Todd Maron, Tesla’s general counsel, said the Texas model would not work for the company because, unlike traditional dealerships that often sprawl side by side along major highways, Tesla's showrooms need to be smaller and are already built in high foot traffic shopping areas. Such a setup encourages a necessary education process for buyers who must learn about the company’s relatively new electric technology, Maron said. Large car dealerships cannot offer those resources, Tesla representatives have argued. Legislation that would have allowed Tesla to get around the state’s franchise dealer model won approval from a Texas House committee in 2013 but went no further. In 2015, Tesla-friendly measures got a House committee hearing and no more. Back to the money claim: We asked the dealers association about how it got its $500 savings figure for dealerships versus direct sales to motorists. On behalf of the association, consultant Jennifer Stevens pointed us to a journal article, "State Automobile Franchise Laws: Public or Private Interests?" It was published July 12, 2016 on the website of the Washington, D.C.-based Phoenix Center for Advanced Legal & Economic Public Policy Studies, a nonprofit founded in 1998 "with a mission to provide independent assessments of the economic and material implications of regulatory and economic policy in the U.S. and abroad," according to its website. But, we noticed, the study didn’t compare shopping in a dealership to shopping for cars online. Rather, it largely considers a broader debate about state auto franchise laws -- whether dealers protect consumers from manufacturers or whether they’re a scheme to protect dealership owners. We noticed that the touted $500 figure doesn’t show up in the paper. Asked about that, one of the paper’s authors, George Ford, the center’s chief economist, pointed out the figure in the abstract of a March 2015 Phoenix Center policy paper, which minorly cited in first paper, on "the price effects of intra-brand competition. In other words, this paper focused on competition among retailers that sell the same branded product, measuring competition as "the distance (in miles) to the nearest same-brand dealer," the paper said. The abstract states: "For the popular Honda Accord, for example, increasing the distance between Honda dealerships by thirty miles raises the price paid by consumers by about $500." The researchers found that for nearly all the car models they looked at -- limited to the 10 most popular new cars bought in Texas from 2011-2013 -- competition between same-brand dealers lowered the price tag on new cars. The authors considered price as a function of the distance between the nearest same-brand dealers, allowing them to find the average price at various distances. The bottom line, according to the study’s authors, is that more independent dealers competing for consumers’ money meant lower prices for the consumers. Ford, a co-author of both papers, said there was previously a lack of economic analysis on the "fairly important" issue of price changes due to dealership competition, so he and a colleague set out to do that. Fiona M. Scott Morton, an economics professor at Yale University, disagreed with the overall analyses of the center’s two studies. The Texas model does not reduce in any discernable way the amount customers will pay for a car, a claim which long has been advanced by the automobile associations to keep the model, Morton said. In fact, according to her analysis of the issue at the state level, the opposite can be true. "One issue that’s particularly confusing to lay people is the idea that the dealers create price competition with each other" under a dealership model like Texas’, she said. "There is no sense that a manufacturer who owns his own store would charge more. Truthfully, there are no issues with the manufacturer having their own stores." Next, we hunted other relevant research on the specific question about customers saving money at car dealerships as opposed to via a direct sales model. Several professors, including Mortons, pointed us to a U.S. Department of Justice analysis from 2009, conducted by Gerald R. Bodisch that focused on the state bans on direct sales, which Bodisch said may hinder the development of a more cost-effective method for car distribution. In the paper, Bodisch writes that most buyers today likely would want some hands-on contact with the car before purchasing, but if state bans were repealed, the situation for consumers could look different. "Surveys do show that many new car buyers in America would be interested in buying directly from manufacturers, particularly to avoid costs associated with the dealer/customer bargaining process. In one survey, almost half of respondents said that they would opt to buy cars direct from the manufacturer even if it didn't save any money," he wrote. Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan law professor who focuses on regulation and studies franchise models, said the study’s attempt to correlate the dealership model’s intra-brand competition with generally more savings for consumers is bogus. "I’m not denying that it’s possible that (dealerships) could lead to lower prices, but it’s not because of the law. You don’t need the law for that," Crane said. "The dealer could just turn out to be more efficient than the manufacturer." The independent experts we talked with said there is no way to compare how much Texas consumers save when purchasing a vehicle at a dealership versus online from Tesla, because Tesla can’t sell directly to consumers from showrooms in the state. Finally, we circled back to the auto dealers association. Its president, Bill Wolters, stood by its tweet and cited study. By phone, Wolters agreed the study didn’t compare traditional dealers to Tesla’s sales methods. However, Wolters said, the conclusion suggesting dollar savings due to franchises being abundant signals a built-in advantage for consumers that Wolters said he doesn’t believe manufacturers like Tesla would offer through showrooms which, Wolters predicted, would solely be concentrated in the state’s biggest cities. Our ruling The auto dealers association responded to a tweet talking up direct sales by car manufacturers by saying consumers save an average of $500 by shopping at traditional roadside dealers. However, studies offered to back up this claim didn’t gauge whether shoppers save money by visiting dealers rather than buying directly from manufacturers. The $500 savings figure ties to shopping roadside dealers offering the same model of car. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-07137	Gov. Chris Christie caused a 4.1 percent increase in property taxes in 2010, marking the highest increase since 2007.	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/16/new-jersey-assembly-democrats/new-jersey-democrats-say-gov-chris-christie-caused/	The blame game over New Jersey’s rising property taxes has been under way in Trenton for decades, and the current debate over last year’s increases is no different. In various public statements, Assembly Democrats have blamed Republican Gov. Chris Christie for the following statistic: property taxes increased 4.1 percent in 2010, marking the highest increase since 2007. "New Jersey property taxes increased 4.1 percent in 2010," according to a May 10 press release. "This is the highest increase since 2007." That number showed up in the press release as one of the examples of the "governor’s property tax failure." Assembly Democrats said the tax hike followed cuts made by Christie to school and municipal aid. PolitiFact New Jersey found the Assembly Democrats’ numbers to be accurate. A report by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs shows that the average residential property tax bill increased in 2010 by 4.1 percent. That report also points out that last year’s percentage increase was higher than the 3.3 percent and 3.7 percent increases in 2009 and 2008, respectively. (Because of budget increases, average bills went up by 5.4 percent in 2007 and 7 percent in 2006, according to the report.) But PolitiFact New Jersey still thought some things were missing from the Democrats’ underlying argument that Christie bears responsibility for the 2010 tax hikes. It’s worth noting that Christie didn’t begin his tenure until after the previous fiscal year had started, and some policy decisions affecting the beginning of 2010 predated him. For a clearer picture, we reached out to five experts on economic policy and taxes, and learned that although they believe Christie holds some responsibility, the property tax hikes also had to do with the recession and rising costs facing local officials. As some experts pointed out, there’s no doubt the reduction in state aid last year contributed to property tax increases. Property taxes are determined by county, municipal and school officials, but their local budgets are influenced by the level of state aid received. To help meet an $11 billion budget gap, Christie’s first budget as governor cut school aid by about $829 million and reduced municipal aid by nearly $446 million, according to the state’s "Citizens’ Guide to the Budget." Democrats are blaming Christie for those aid reductions, but keep this in mind: the cuts were part of a budget approved by the Legislature, including both Democratic and Republican representatives. Referring to the decision to not raise state taxes to meet the revenue shortfall, Rutgers University professor Joseph Seneca said: "It was a shock to the way fiscal business was done in New Jersey before." Glen Fandl, an adjunct professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University, said the aid reduction played a role in the tax hikes, but he argued a larger factor is that the number of municipal revaluations slowed in 2010 due to declining property values. In revaluations, properties’ assessed values are revised -- meaning the amounts that taxes are based on -- and tax rates are reduced. Without as many revaluations, tax rates mostly went up in 2010, Fandl said. Fandl said another reason was a significant increase in tax appeals from commercial property owners. Fandl said of Christie: "The recession’s not his fault." Fandl noted that towns and school districts still faced contractual obligations to their employees, despite cutting expenses. Rising utility and healthcare costs are beyond Christie’s control, but at the same time, the governor declined last year to support extending a higher tax rate on personal income over $1 million, according to Jon Shure of the Washington, DC-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center leans Democratic. The state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services estimated the higher rate would have generated about $637 million for the property tax relief fund in the current fiscal year. "Any time New Jersey reduces its state income tax, it has less money available for property tax relief," said Shure, former president of the Trenton-based New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning think tank. David Brunori, a research professor at The George Washington University in Washington, DC, offered a few other targets to place blame for the tax hikes, including the dependence on state aid and a desire to maintain the same level of local services. New Jerseyans want a great deal of services and there are two ways of paying for them: state aid and higher property taxes, Brunori said. Across the country, states historically cut local aid when faced with budget deficits, Brunori said. At the end of the day, towns decided to maintain services, he said. "I’m not sure I would blame the governor," Brunori said. Montclair State University assistant professor James DiGabriele said he’s not blaming anybody, including Christie. The larger problem is that government has not revised its structure for generating revenue, DiGabriele said. Towns could charge a fee for services, such as garbage collection, he said. "In the new economy, I don’t know if we have a choice," DiGabriele said. Pointing to the number of school administrators and school boards, Fandl said there is so much home rule in New Jersey that is driving up costs. That system itself is the problem, Fandl said. "The costs are never going to go down and that’s the problem," Fandl said. Now let’s go back to the blame game: The Assembly Democrats are criticizing Christie for tax increases in 2010. They are correct taxes increased 4.1 percent. The governor’s aid cuts contributed to the tax hikes, and Christie rejected a tax increase that would have provided more property tax relief. But some Democratic legislators also signed off on aid reductions by approving the state budget. There also are several other factors at play here -- the recession, declining property values, tax appeals, rising costs, a local desire to maintain services and an expensive system of running school districts. We rate the Democrats’ statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at NJ.com.

pomt-10519	"I've been standing up against ... the Chinese government over women's rights and standing up for human rights."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/11/hillary-clinton/a-great-speech-but-what-else/	Pointing to her experience confronting a foreign giant on a diplomatically sensitive matter, Sen. Hillary Clinton takes credit for pressuring the Chinese government to recognize women's rights, and for taking the Beijing government to task for its overall human rights record. In an interview on CNN's American Morning on March 5, 2008, Clinton said, "I've been standing up against . . . the Chinese government over women's rights and standing up for human rights." Clinton has made similar claims in campaign speeches. In a foreign policy address at George Washington University in Washington on Feb. 25, she said, "I went to Beijing in 1995 and spoke out for women's rights and human rights. The Chinese government wasn't happy; they pulled the plug on the broadcast of my speech. But I took that as a compliment. Because it was important for the United States both to be represented and to make absolutely clear that human rights is an integral part of our foreign policy and that women's rights is key to that. What we have learned is that where women are oppressed and denied their basic rights we are more likely to have regimes that are more adversarial to American interests and values." Clinton was referring in her February remarks to a 1995 speech she delivered at the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, in which she called on the world community to protect women against violence, improve their access to health services and education and generally give them more self-determination. "It is time for us to say here in Beijing, and the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights," Clinton said. "It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are born girls." Chinese state radio and television blacked out Clinton's speech. Reports at the time stated the official Chinese press was under instruction to ignore her address until an official reaction was crafted. China experts say such censorship is routine and reflects the government's desire to emphasize consensus and tamp down confrontation. Though Clinton's comments detailed abuses that occurred around the world — for example, rape in war-torn Bosnia and the burning of Indian brides whose marriage dowries were deemed too small — they had particularly strong implications in China, which had been the object of global criticism for forcing women to have abortions or undergo sterilization as part of "one-child-per-family" population control efforts. Clinton echoed her remarks and stressed the importance of promoting the economic empowerment of women at a separate gathering of the United Nations Development Fund for Women later in the trip. Clinton's campaign says her advocacy helped prompt many nations to make equality among the sexes a reality in the 21st century, and that she helped procure $140-million in small-enterprise loans and other credit to help poor women around the world. Clinton was walking a fine line at the time of her Beijing address because her husband's administration was trying to engage China and tone down U.S. condemnations of human rights abuses. Human rights groups were concerned her participation in the conference would amount to an implicit endorsement of Chinese policies. Diplomats, meanwhile, were worried her presence would aggravate U.S.-Chinese relations. The New York Times, in an editorial, said the speech "may have been her finest moment in public life." Experts on U.S.-China relations say Clinton's speech exemplified her ability to go to a foreign capital and deliver a forthright address, but said little about her readiness to confront a real foreign relations crisis. Nor did it have much of a lasting impact on China's legal and political system. Women remain underrepresented in the country's political and business leadership, and the country's population control policies remain in place. "In no way was this (Clinton's speech) a major confrontation with the Chinese government, or did it in any way resemble a crisis," said Thomas Carothers, vice president for studies-international politics and governance at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "It was a good speech that set out principles but didn't go outside the bounds of the relatively mild approach to China the U.S. was taking at the time. It was one of many pushes from the outside ... it couldn't be said to change the direction of China's legal reform." The Clinton campaign, responding to recent criticism that her speech was not important, cites an Associated Press account to claim that "her speech at the conference — where she famously declared 'women's rights are human rights' spurred real action." But that's a bit of sleight-of-hand. We checked the full text of that story, which cited policy changes that helped women in many countries, and found the story attributed those changes to the conference, not specifically to Clinton's speech. Clinton's interest in women's issues in China again was apparent — albeit in a less confrontational way — three years later, when she and then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright traveled to a women's legal aid center affiliated with Beijing University's law school during a 1998 state visit by President Bill Clinton. The visit was intended to assess China's efforts to update its legal system. The Clinton administration made U.S. pledges of assistance in that effort a subject of the trip. The legal aid center dealt with a wide range of women's legal issues, including rape, job discrimination and family planning. Yes, Clinton delivered a tough speech implying Chinese policies were unacceptable at a global gathering in that nation's capital city. But the Clinton campaign has failed to show she has been involved in the long-term commitment for improvements in China that her statement suggests. We find her claim to be Half True.

pomt-06505	Massachusetts has "less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured. You (Gov. Perry) have a million kids uninsured in Texas."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-raps-number-uninsured-kids-texas-touts/	During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sought to contrast health care in his state with that in Texas, the home state of a rival, Gov. Rick Perry. One of the yardsticks he used was how many children are uninsured in each state. "We have less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured" in Massachusetts, said Romney, who signed a law designed to get uninsured residents covered. "You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids." We decided to check Romney’s math. We turned to the statehealthfacts.org website, assembled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent research organization specializing in health care policy. The most recent state-by-state figures available are for the period 2008-09. For Massachusetts, there were 51,400 uninsured children (that is, birth to 18), or 3 percent. (Of those with insurance, 65 percent got it from an employer and 29 percent got it from Medicaid.) This means that Romney’s number is overly rosy -- he said less than 1 percent, when the percentage is actually three times higher. To be fair, Massachusetts still had the lowest percentage of uninsured children in the nation. And it did a whole lot better than Texas. Texas had 1,303,000 children without insurance over the same period, or 18 percent. (Of those with insurance, 42 percent got it from an employer, 35 percent got it from Medicaid, 3 percent from an individually purchased plan, and 2 percent from other public plans.) Texas' rate is the highest in the nation. So for Texas, Romney was accurate. He even undercounted a bit. The Romney campaign pointed to a report published by the Massachusetts state government that found that "virtually all Massachusetts children had health insurance coverage in 2010 (99.8 percent). The uninsured rate for Massachusetts children fell from 1.9 percent in 2009 to 0.2 percent in 2010." However, the report did not address uninsured children in Texas, and we prefer to compare states using a study with equivalent methodologies if one is available, and in this case, we’re sticking with the Kaiser report’s numbers. Our ruling Romney said that "less than 1 percent" of Massachusetts kids are uninsured, when in fact the best available number is 3 percent. But that’s still the lowest in the nation. Meanwhile, he actually underestimated the number of uninsured children in Texas when he said there were a million. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06405	Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was right that President Barack Obama’s health care bill created what "would, in effect, be death panels."	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/28/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-health-care-reform-includes-death-/	Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich seems to have done some dumpster diving in that bin where politicians toss their old rhetoric. During the Republican primary debate in New Hampshire, Gingrich reused an old gem of a claim: That President Barack Obama’s health care reform created "Death Panels." Karen Tumulty, a national political correspondent for the Washington Post, brought up expensive treatment that she said patients receive in the last two years of their lives under Medicare. She asked the former Georgia congressman whether such spending is wasteful, and if the government should intervene. "So, if you ask me, ‘Do I want some Washington bureaucrat to create a class action decision which affects every American’s last two years of life?’ Not ever," Gingrich replied. "I think it is a disaster. I think, candidly, Governor Palin got attacked unfairly for describing what would, in effect, be death panels," he said. Death panels? Our friends at PolitiFact National, our sister site based in Washington, D.C., debunked the "Death Panel" claim more than two years ago. In fact, it was PolitiFact’s 2009 Lie of the Year. Since Gingrich seems it’s worthwhile to recycle death panels, we think it’s worthwhile to remind readers why they’re bunk. PolitiFact National traced the controversy to a post on Palin’s Facebook page Aug. 7, 2009. She said seniors and the disabled "will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care." PolitiFact read all 1,000 pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. "There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's ‘level of productivity in society’ to determine whether they are ‘worthy’ of health care," they concluded. "There's certainly no "death board" that determines the worthiness of individuals to receive care," they added. Health care bill opponents could make a case that Palin is justified in fearing that the current reform could one day transform into such a board, but that’s not what she said. She said the panels were in the bill. They weren’t, and they still aren’t. PolitiFact also debunked a similar claim made after the final version of the health care bill passed in March 2010. In June of that year, PolitiFact Florida looked at a claim by a candidate for U.S. Congress that under the new health care law, the elderly will be denied care when they have "passed the age limit for treatment." The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly, confirmed in an email that it has no age limit for treatment. This newer claim started because the health care law, as passed, does support "comparative effectiveness research," which compares the clinical effectiveness of treatments. But the law specifies that if research shows a certain treatment for the elderly isn't effective, it "may not be construed as mandates, guidelines, or recommendations for payment, coverage, or treatment or used to deny coverage." "Death panels" were not proposed when the health care reform effort started, and "death panels" still don’t exist.

pomt-00436	"The American economy is continuing its longest monthly streak of job growth in history, with 3.9 million jobs added since President Trump was elected."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/23/west-virginia-republican-party/west-virginia-gop-tweet-correct-about-job-growth/	President Donald Trump often touts job growth on his watch as one of his top accomplishments in office. State Republican party organizations have followed his lead. The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted on Aug. 8, 2018, that "the American economy is continuing its longest monthly streak of job growth in history, with 3.9 million jobs added since President Trump was elected." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet cited a White House web page as its source. But we dug into the numbers ourselves just to be sure. We’ll take the two parts of the tweet separately. "The American economy is continuing its longest monthly streak of job growth in history." PolitiFact has previously confirmed that the United States is in the midst of its longest positive job growth streak in history -- 94 months and counting. Here is a chart showing month-to-month employment increases or decreases since January 2008. There has not been a monthly decline since 2010. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The tweet fails to mention that most of these months of job growth occurred on President Barack Obama’s watch, which are noted in blue in the chart above. So Trump, whose months of job growth are noted in red starting in 2017, did not accomplish this feat on his own. "3.9 million jobs (have been) added since President Trump was elected." We looked at official Bureau of Labor Statistics data and found that since November 2016, when Trump was elected, the economy has added about 3.9 million jobs. That’s what the tweet said. Starting from this point, of course, includes two and a half months when Obama was still president. If you calculate the figure using January 2017 instead -- when Trump actually took office -- the number would be 3.4 million. We’ll note that economists say presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. Our ruling The West Virginia Republican Party said, "The American economy is continuing its longest monthly streak of job growth in history, with 3.9 million jobs added since President Trump was elected." Both parts of this claim are accurate, and while it’s worth noting that no president deserves full credit for economic achievements on their watch, the tweet was carefully worded and is not substantially misleading.

There are 5-million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in 2000."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/15/hillary-clinton/the-ugly-truths/	As she makes her case for the White House, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., promises voters that she'll do more to help the middle and working classes. Key to that pitch is the notion that things aren't going so well now. "Productivity has risen 18 percent among American workers over the past six years, yet wages have stayed flat, and family incomes have fallen by nearly $1,000," she told a crowd in New York City on Dec. 5, 2007. "There are 5-million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in 2000." The macroeconomic forces of a rapidly changing global economy are causing more trouble for many working people than the Bush administration, despite what Clinton and other Democratic candidates suggest. U.S. Census Data from 1995 to 2005 show that those wages are down or stagnant for workers who have the least education, while earnings have increased for those with college degrees. Increased competition from cheap foreign labor is squeezing U.S. factory workers and costing jobs, while wages have not kept pace with rising energy and health care prices, several studies say, including the 2006 State of Working America by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan advocate for the poor. Productivity indeed is up about 18 percent since 2000, but income is down, and nearly 5-million more people are living in poverty than at the height of the last business cycle in 2000, government statistics show. "All of that paints more of a picture about what individual households are seeing and reacting to," said Aviva Aron-Dine, a policy analyst for the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a nonpartisan advocacy group for the poor. Clinton accurately portrays the economic challenges facing Americans - and the next president - as she campaigns. We find her statement true.

Mark Hass, a Beaverton Democrat, is one of the most vocal supporters of the plastic bag ban making its way through the Oregon Legislature this session. It makes sense, then, that he’s been pretty vocal about correcting perceived untruths on the part of the plastics lobby. In a Feb. 8, 2011, committee hearing on the ban, Hass called lobbyists out for saying that plastic bags are recyclable. Here’s what he had to say: "You know, I think Oregonians would really love to recycle your (plastic bags). They really would. And if they could, we wouldn’t be here today. The whole point of the recyclers being in support of this is because they can’t recycle your bags. "Four percent are turned in to the supermarkets (to be) sent over to China. You just heard that testimony. "If Oregon recyclers could recycle your bags, there would be no need for this (bill). We want to be able to recycle them. But we can’t. And so they don’t get recycled, and they do end up on the beaches and in the ocean. And you keep referring to these things as being recyclable. And I just want to caution you on that because I think you’re stretching things when you say these are recyclable." We wondered whether Hass was right. Are plastic bags destined for the landfill and nothing else? So, we started off on a fact-checking mission with this as our claim: Oregon recyclers can’t recycle plastic bags. To start, we called the city of Portland’s Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, which is home to the Solid Waste and Recycling Program. We asked Bruce Walker, the manager of the program, whether Portlanders could just slip the ubiquitous plastic grocery bags into their curbside bins like they can other common recyclables. "Absolutely not," he said. "We have tried our darnedest, through public education, to get that message out there. … They absolutely should not be put in a recycling cart." Walker added: "Throughout the state of Oregon, there is no curbside program that wants these materials." Next stop was the recyclers themselves. We called Jeff Murray, a vice president for Far West Fibers, a Portland-area recycling business. Murray also sits on the board of Oregon Recyclers Association, which has come out in favor of the plastic-bag ban. He spoke to us, however, from the point of view of Far West Fibers. We asked him to walk us through the reasons plastic bags generally get the shaft from curbside recyclers. Are they recyclable or not? He prefaced his comments with this: "I have learned almost anything in this world is recyclable." But some things are easier and more cost-effective to recycle. The deal with plastic bags, at least as far as his business is concerned, is that they clog the sorting machines and unclogging those machines is more than just an inconvenience. "It just jams," Murray said. "It breaks … sometimes it can cause fires." "Basically, it shuts down the efficiency of the system." But, Murray added, "plastic bags are recyclable in the right market." That market, he said, is generally overseas, and there are a couple of caveats. The market isn’t a dependable one. "There are times when we don’t have markets to recycle it. That was the one material we had to landfill" when the economy soured. Even when there is a market, the product might not get recycled, he said. "When it gets sent overseas, I can’t tell you how much does or does not get recycled," Murray said. "We have absolutely no way to guarantee or even make the slightest claim that we’re going to hold these for recycling." Ideally, he added, residents would know better than to put the bags in their recycling cans and they would never find their way to his facility in the first place. Rick Winterhalter, chairman of the Oregon Recyclers Association, one of the groups supporting the plastic bags ban, says that’s the general sentiment. "We kind of look at (plastic bags) like an invasive species," he said. "We have never included them in our curbside recycling program. And yet they wind up in the curbside recycling and then they wind up at the (sorting facility)." But Winterhalter confirmed what Murray had said, under the right conditions (and if they’re in good enough shape), plastic bags can be recycled. However, he added, the public doesn’t have many options for recycling the bags themselves. "The opportunities for people to do that in this region are extremely limited." Usually those opportunities have to be provided by the grocery stores themselves. For example, Fred Meyer -- which has stopped offering plastic bags in its 10 Portland-area stores -- offers plastic-bag recycling bins at its retail locations. Those recovered bags are then sold to a company that uses the materials in its "wood alternative" products. Other companies, such as Hilex Poly, which manufactures the bags in question, also take the bags back from in-store recycling programs. "Plastic bags are 100 percent recyclable," says Philip Rozenski, the company’s marketing and sustainability director. "We are one of the major buyers in the United States." Hilex recycles old bags into new bags. That said, the company doesn’t offer the sort of dependable buyer that local recycling centers say they need. Hilex works with a specific sort of plastic bag and wrap, and the materials collected at Oregon centers include various other bits and pieces that Hilex has no use for. Rozenski said Hilex would rather educate the public to take the plastic bags back to the stores, rather than get them from sorting centers. So, it seems, bags can be recycled -- under the right circumstances -- but are they? We gave the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency a call to see if there are any statistics on the matter. It turns out there are. According to the agency’s 2009 Municipal Solid Waste Report, about 3,850,000 tons of "plastic bags, sacks and wraps were generated" last year. Of that, 360,000 tons -- about 9 percent -- were recycled. Of the portion of those plastics that are low density -- the sort used in plastic bags -- the recycling rate was closer to 13.4 percent. In the Feb. 8 hearing, ban opponents tried to argue that plastic bags could be recycled, and Sen. Hass pushed back. He said Oregon recyclers couldn’t use the bags. Well, the issue is not that cut and dried. In a broader sense, plastic bags are, indeed, recyclable. At the local level, though, it’s a tough sell. Oregon recycling centers can -- and sometimes do -- collect the bags and sell them to others for further recycling. But that’s not always possible; sometimes there’s just no market for the bags, sometimes the bags can’t be saved. (And state recyclers seem to agree that, ultimately, the bags are more trouble than they’re worth.) We’ll split the difference here and rate this claim -- that Oregon recyclers can’t use plastic bags -- as Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-02225	"On average, women make 77 cents for every dollar men make."	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/18/michelle-nunn/nunn-avoids-slip-gender-pay-claim/	Democrats and Republicans have yet again found an issue to disagree on -- the gender pay gap -- and one U.S. Senate candidate’s comments about it drew the attention of our Truth-O-Meter. "On average, women make 77 cents for every dollar men make," the candidate, Michelle Nunn, a Democrat, has said in statements and on her Facebook page. Is this statistic true? Senate Democrats earlier this month failed to get the 60 votes required to break a Republican filibuster blocking the Paycheck Fairness Act, which among other things, would require the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect data about pay from employers. Nunn and other Democrats say the bill would help women earn the same wages as men. Republicans say the legislation is unnecessary and would result in more civil lawsuits. A few area Republicans saw Nunn’s comments about the gender pay gap and asked us to fact-check Nunn, who has sought centrist positions on many issues. Some political analysts see the gender pay gap battle as an election-year effort by Democrats to woo women to their side. Several Democrats have used the 77 cents claim in this ongoing debate, some with more accuracy than others. For example, we recently gave former President Jimmy Carter a Mostly False rating for his statement that "in the United States for the same exact work for a full-time employee, women get 23 percent less pay than men." The number Carter used comes from a 2010 U.S. Census Bureau study that looked at the total wages earned by male and female workers. The study found men’s total wages -- key words here, total wages -- were about 23 percentage points higher than the total amount of women's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. And this is a key point: The census study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller wage gaps. The Census Bureau number does not take into account critical factors that could influence the figure, including specific occupation, time on the job and education level. The gap drops dramatically if you compare men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job and other relevant factors. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department. It found that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap vanished. President Barack Obama made a somewhat similar statement to Carter’s on the campaign trail in 2012 when he said "women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." Our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington rated that statement Mostly False for many of the same reasons we gave the same rating to Carter. Perhaps seeing the trouble with that statement, Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address that women "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." That statement is more in line with the U.S. Census Bureau study because the president did not say that women were doing the same work and being underpaid. PolitiFact found other research that showed a smaller pay gap. PolitiFact rated Obama’s revised statement Mostly True. There are two key points to Nunn’s statement. She began with the qualifier "on average." And she did not say there was a pay gap for women doing the same work as men. That puts Nunn’s statement more in line with the U.S. Census Bureau study. Nunn made no attempt to equate equal work with equal pay -- a comparison that has landed some of her fellow politicians on shaky Truth-O-Meter terrain. Her statement could have used a little context, but she is mostly on target. We rate Nunn’s statement Mostly True.	None	Michelle Nunn	None	None	None	2014-04-18T06:00:00	2014-04-10	['None']

pomt-09918	Says the Constitution only requires her to tell the census "how many people are in our home."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/25/michele-bachmann/michelle-bachmann-claims-constitution-only-require/	U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is no stranger to the Truth-O-Meter. So far, her comments have decidedly bent the needle to the left and, on one occasion, set the meter on fire. We swear we're not trying to pick on her, but we just couldn't let this latest one go. Recently, Bachmann went on record to declare that because of ACORN's involvement in the Census and other privacy concerns, she would only tell 2010 Census takers how many people are in her household — and nothing more. Here's how she explained it in a Washington Times interview (which you can listen to here ): "Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money," Bachmann said. "And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. "And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that." There's a lot wrong in her statement, so we divided it into two Truth-O-Meter items. You can read the one on ACORN's involvement in a different item . In this item, we'll address Bachmann's claim that she's only constitutionally obligated to provide the number of people in her household. Here's what the Constitution actually says: "Representation and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers ... the actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct." So the Constitution itself does not contain any requirement, as Bachmann claims. We draw your attention to the last clause, "in such a manner as they shall by law direct." The "they" in that sentence refers to members of Congress. They write laws about the content of the Census and require that people answer the questions. Even the very first census in 1790 included more than just the question of how many people lived in the household. According to a Census Bureau spokeswoman, the 1790 Census specifically asked about the number of free white males age 16 and over in order to assess the country’s military and industrial potential. That first Census also asked for the race and gender of household residents, and whether they were free or enslaved. Subsequent Census Acts expanded the number of questions exponentially. According to Census spokeswoman Stacy Gimbel, these laws came under the authority of the "Necessary and Proper" clause of the Constitution: "The Congress shall have the power . . . To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." Congress' use of the Census to ask questions well beyond just the number of people has been upheld several times by the Supreme Court, Gimbel said, citing several cases. What's more, a law passed by Congress requires people to answer "any of the questions on any schedule submitted to him in connection with any Census" from the U.S. Census. So what if you don't? The law says those who refuse to fill out the entirety of their Census questionnaire or answer questions posed by Census takers could face fines of anywhere from $100 to $500. Honestly, Gimbel said, the U.S. Census doesn't often enforce those rules. "It is important to note that Census takers are not seeking to prosecute people; our goal is to gather and return to the public quality information that assures equal representation and determines how billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money is spent by their government," Gimbel said. Bachmann's claims that the Constitution only requires people to say how many people live in their household is "completely baseless," Gimbel said. Bachmann stuck to her misguided guns in a Fox interview on June 25, this time backing up her concerns about privacy by noting that in the 1940s the Census Bureau handed over information used to round up Japanese people and put them in internment camps. "I'm not saying that that's what the administration is planning to do," Bachmann said, "but I am saying that private personal information that was given to the Census Bureau in the 1940s was used against Americans to round them up, in a violation of their constitutional rights, and put the Japanese in internment camps. I am just not comfortable with the way this census is being handled, with associating with ACORN, with the questions that are being asked, with Americans being compelled to give this information. How will this be cross-checked? Will it be held privately?" Bachmann is right about how the Census was used to identify Japanese-Americans in the 1940s. Since then, however, Congress has passed laws to specifically protect the information it collects. Census employees take those privacy laws very seriously, she said. Employees found to have violated laws to protect people's personal identity face up to five years in jail and fines of up to $250,000. Bachmann is not only wrong here, she is engaging in fearmongering that encourages people to break the law. And in doing so, she's falsely telling people that the Constitution would support them. In fact, the Washington Times reporter followed her answer by saying, "Well, I'm going to take your hint then and that'll save me some time." And so we feel it's necessary to rate this one Pants on Fire.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2009-06-25T16:01:03	2009-06-17	['None']
pomt-12094	"I'm the only candidate who has not accepted money from Carl Paladino nor LPCiminelli; two of the biggest developers in the city of Buffalo."	/new-york/statements/2017/aug/25/betty-jean-grant/which-candidates-mayor-took-money-top-buffalo-deve/	Buffalo Democrats will choose among three candidates in the Sept. 12 mayoral primary. But, according to Erie County Legislator Betty Jean Grant, only one of them has not received money from two controversial Buffalo developers. "I'm the only candidate who has not accepted money from Carl Paladino nor LPCiminelli; two of the biggest developers in the city of Buffalo," Grant told a local news station. "The fact they have not contributed to my campaign gives me the freedom to be independent of any political strings attached to me." Paladino, a major figure in Buffalo development, is the founder and chairman of Ellicott Development. LPCiminelli was run by Louis P. Ciminelli until his indictment on federal corruption charges in 2016 for allegedly rigging state construction bids. Ciminelli has since resigned. Grant, the underdog, faces Mayor Byron Brown, a three-term incumbent, and Mark Schroeder, the city’s comptroller. Brown had $582,167 in his campaign account at the most recent filing, more than four times what Schroeder had. Grant had $11,986. Is she right that she’s the only candidate who hasn’t taken money from Paladino or Ciminelli? Donations to Brown Brown is the only candidate who has received donations from either developer since his last election in 2013. He received $2,500 from Louis Ciminelli in 2015. Brown has said he will set aside the donation from Ciminelli until the trial is resolved. William Paladino, Carl Paladino’s son, gave Brown $2,000 earlier this year. William Paladino, who is Carl's son, is the current chief executive officer of Ellicott Development and has worked at the company for more than two decades. Brown received a total of $12,000 from Ciminelli during his first and second terms. The company gave Brown $6,000 during those terms. Paladino contributed $100 to Brown’s campaign in 2013. William Paladino donated $500 the same year. Brown also used a second political committee to support other candidates during his first term. The account has not taken or spent money since 2009. Ciminelli donated $1,000 to the account between himself and his company. Brown did not receive donations from either developer when he was in the State Senate from 2001 to 2005. Donations to Schroeder Schroeder received $3,500 from Louis Ciminelli when he first ran for comptroller in 2011. Ciminelli gave him another $5,000 in 2015. Ellicott Development gave Schroeder $200 in 2011. William Paladino gave him $500 in 2012. Schroeder also served in the State Assembly from 2005 to 2011. He took $1,750 from Louis Ciminelli and $150 from Ellicott Development in that time. Donations to Grant Grant ran primary campaigns against State Sen. Tim Kennedy in 2012 and 2014. She did not receive any contributions from either Paladino or Ciminelli. Grant served on the Buffalo Common Council and Buffalo School Board before her election to the county legislature in 2007. Her filings for Common Council no longer exist. Local candidates were not required to file with the state Board of Elections at the time, and the Erie County Board of Elections was not required to hold on to the records after five years. So to the extent of what we know from state filings, Grant has not received money from either developer or their families. Our ruling Grant said she was the "only candidate who has not accepted money from Carl Paladino nor LPCiminelli." Because Carl Paladino is the chairman of Ellicott Development, and his son runs it as CEO, we included contributions from him, his son and the company in our rulling. Grant did not specify a time frame. Her two rivals for the mayor's office have not received contributions from either developer during the current campaign. But we understood her to mean contributions during their entire political careers. Filings show Grant is the only candidate who has not received money from either developer. Brown is the only candidate to take money from both since 2013. We rate her statement True.

pomt-06400	"A recent Department of Labor study guessed Wall Street fees cost a worker 28 percent of the value of your plan over the span of your career."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/28/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-wall-street-fees-claim-third-40/	On a tirade against Wall Street -- and the critics of Occupy Wall Street protesters -- Rachel Maddow used a "three pillars" illustration on her MSNBC show Oct. 19, 2011, to talk about the crumbling of America’s retirement system. The three pillars of retirement income are pensions, personal savings and Social Security. Then Maddow proceeded to deconstruct how they’ve all been deconstructed. We were particularly interested in her comments on pensions. Pensions have largely been replaced by 401(k) investment plans, which in Maddow’s view are "kind of a scam." "Whereas pensions for the most part used to be separate from the Wall Street banking/casino apparatus, 401(k) plans just put Wall Street in the middle of the action, right between you and your retirement -- which is by definition a risk-laden venture for the middle class. But it is a great windfall for Wall Street," Maddow said. She then went to video of an NBC News segment with Tom Brokaw and a reporter discussing the problem of hidden fees for 401(k) plans. The segment ends with an unidentified male saying, "The total cost to the American public is something in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year." Maddow then follows up: "One and a half to $2 billion a year right into Wall Street`s pockets just in fees. And that was back in 1997. What do you think it is now? "A recent Department of Labor study guessed Wall Street fees cost a worker 28 percent of the value of your plan over the span of your career," Maddow said. That’s a pretty big bite out a hard-earned nest egg. We decided to investigate. A little on 401(k) plans Until about 30 years ago, a major source of retirement income for Americans was the employer-funded pension system. Pensions were calculated based on what employees earned and years of service. Traditional pensions are known as a defined benefit plans because they pay a fixed amount every month. Many employers no longer offer pensions because, quite simply, they’re expensive. Instead, more and more are offering 401(k) plans. In these defined contribution plans, the employee contributes to an individual fund -- a contribution sometimes matched by the employer. Instead of providing a predictable income in retirement, the plans are subject to the ups and downs of the market and other variables that can erode or enhance retirement income, including how many years the money is invested and the timing of withdrawals. Most of us don’t manage our plans ourselves -- they demand sophisticated, long-term investment decisions -- so that’s where management companies come in. Think Vanguard and Fidelity and other investment advisers. Maddow was talking about the fees charged by these firms to manage the plans’ investments and do the bookkeeping. What we found A spokesman for MSNBC referred us to a section of the Department of Labor website that covers these fees. "Assume that you are an employee with 35 years until retirement and a current 401(k) account balance of $25,000. If returns on investments in your account over the next 35 years average 7 percent and fees and expenses reduce your average returns by 0.5 percent, your account balance will grow to $227,000 at retirement, even if there are no further contributions to your account. If fees and expenses are 1.5 percent, however, your account balance will grow to only $163,000. The 1 percent difference in fees and expenses would reduce your account balance at retirement by 28 percent," the website says. To Maddow, that paragraph meant Wall Street takes nearly a third of workers’ retirement savings. We asked a couple of economists what it meant to them. Steve Utkus, a principal with the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research, said the Labor Department’s example is "a standard hypothetical used through the retirement savings industry." "It simply says that, all things equal, higher fees mean lower savings at retirement. ... I don't believe the DOL was trying to make any comparison with the actual fees paid by 401(k) plans -- for example, that most participants were paying one or the other fee," Utkus said. He pointed us to a 2009 study by Deloitte Consulting and the Investment Company Institute, a trade group for mutual funds, that surveyed actual fees paid by plans. It found the median 401(k) fee is 0.72 percent -- or about half the 1.5 percent used in the Labor department example. Utkus also pointed out that most participants in the U.S. (i.e. employers) are larger plans which are able to negotiate even lower fees. Tony Webb, senior economist with the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, also noted that assuming 7 percent return on investment is a bit optimistic. Taking inflation into account, Webb said a return of 4.5 percent is more realistic. And 35 years, he said, is longer than most people save for retirement. They may have student loans to pay when they begin working, or they might put their extra money toward saving for a house. Whatever the reasons, Webb said most people don’t get serious about saving until age 40. So that 35-year retirement savings could be shortened to 25 years and both the fees and the return on investment could be significantly lower. The Labor department example assumes a single contribution accruing interest over time. Webb said it’s more useful to consider a worker who makes annual contributions. He says, "A typical worker aged 27, earning $50,000 a year, who contributed 9 percent of salary (6 percent himself plus a 50 percent employer match), invested 50/50 in a stock-bond portfolio earning 4.5 percent after inflation, could, in the absence of fees, expect to accumulate $366,700 by age 62. If he incurred fees of 0.72 percent, his pot would be 13.5 percent less, $317,200." Webb also pointed out that the fees aren’t for nothing. "Investment managers do provide a service," he said. Still, the reason all this is important -- the reason the Labor Department devotes space to it on its website and the reason Maddow sounded the alarm -- is that the fees over time do add up to thousands of dollars subtracted from people’s savings. And yet very often they’re invisible. "There’s nothing on the (401(k) plan) website that tells you how much the plan manager has charged you that month in management fees," Webb said. "Nobody sends you a bill." So those fees just end up being unknown costs that erode substantial value out of people’s nest eggs. (Some good news on that front: new regulations that take effect next year will require companies to provide investors more and clearer information in their quarterly statements on administrative and investment fees charged to their accounts.) Our ruling Maddow declared, "a recent Department of Labor study guessed Wall Street fees cost a worker 28 percent of the value of your plan over the span of your career." But what she was quoting was not a study -- but a scenario using higher than normal fees. Maddow's statement made it sound as if the typical worker, or at least a great many of us, lose a third of our retirement savings to plan management fees. Economists tell us that’s not the case. So Maddow correctly reflected the Labor Department's hypothetical scenario in which fees would seriously erode retirement savings. But it didn't reflect the reality most workers with retirement savings accounts face. In reality, returns on investment, the number of years the money is invested and even the fees vary greatly. The study by Deloitte Consulting and the Investment Company Institute that surveyed actual fees paid by plans found the median 401(k) fee is 0.72 percent -- or about half of the rate used in the Labor Department's example. We take Maddow’s larger point -- that these unseen fees can claim a lot of money from people who don’t have it to spare. But the numbers that she uses to make the point reflect higher fees than most people pay. So we rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-04922	Says under federal law "we do not have any limitation on the number of guns and bullets we can buy."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/01/robert-menendez/us-sen-robert-menendez-claims-there-are-no-federal/	In the days following a mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez and some of his fellow Democrats called for strengthening the nation’s gun control laws. At a July 24 news conference in Washington, D.C., Menendez pointed out how, under federal law, "we do not have any limitation on the number of guns and bullets we can buy." PolitiFact New Jersey is not weighing in on whether there should be such federal restrictions. We are only fact-checking Menendez’s claim that none exist. We found that the senator's right that there is no federal law limiting the number of guns and bullets one can purchase at a given time. Three states, including New Jersey, have enacted their own restrictions on handgun sales. A spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and gun policy experts confirmed that the senator’s claim is accurate. "It is correct that there are no limits in federal law to the amount of guns or ammunition a person can buy if he/she is not a proscribed possessor of firearms," said Daniel Webster, co-director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Federal law prohibits certain individuals from getting a gun or ammunition, such as someone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Also, there are certain reporting requirements under federal law for multiple gun sales. For instance, licensed dealers must report to federal authorities if they sell more than one handgun to the same person within five consecutive business days. Also, licensed dealers in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas must report multiple sales of certain rifles during the same time period. Referring to such federal reporting requirements, Jon Vernick, co-director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research, added in an e-mail: "However, this form simply acts as a record of, not a limitation on, multiple purchases." The vast majority of states don’t limit the number of firearms that can be purchased, according to a state-by-state breakdown compiled by the California-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. New Jersey is one of three states that prohibit the sale of more than one handgun to an individual within a 30-day period, along with California and Maryland, according to the center. Each of those state laws allow for certain exemptions. Virginia repealed a similar law earlier this year. "The Senator was (and will continue) to talk about the need for federal laws that limit the number of bullets and the number of firearms a person can purchase," Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said in an e-mail. "He believes we need stronger laws nationally, not a patchwork of laws that vary in terms of strength state by state." Our ruling Following the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado, Menendez claimed at a news conference that "we do not have any limitation on the number of guns and bullets we can buy." Three states, including New Jersey, limit the number of handguns one can purchase in a 30-day period, but there are no limits under federal law on the purchase of firearms and ammunition. Federal regulations only mandate reporting multiple gun sales in certain cases. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07176	Says U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan promised to "end health care for our seniors."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/10/sandy-pasch/democratic-wisconsin-state-rep-sandy-pasch-says-go/	When some Democrats look at the federal budget plan proposed by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., it’s as if they’ve caught sight of a tiki bar at the end of a hot summer day. They aren’t envisioning fruity drinks with tiny umbrellas, but rather electoral victories. The Democrats see Ryan’s plan, particularly its changes to Medicare, as distasteful to voters and therefore an advantage for their party. As evidence, they point to Democrat Kathy Hochul’s upset win in a western New York congressional race that was dominated by Ryan’s Medicare plan. That special election was held May 24, 2011, less than two months after Ryan released his plan, which would convert Medicare into a "premium-support payment" program starting in 2022. On June 6, 2011, Wisconsin state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, was asked in an online chat how Ryan would affect elections on another level. Pasch is running in a recall election against state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, who aims to retain a seat she has held since 1992. It is one of an unprecedented nine state senator recall elections that will be held in Wisconsin in July 2011. In the chat, which was sponsored by Blue America, a political action committee that says it works to elect progressives, a questioner asked: "I just read that (Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman) Mike Tate says that Paul Ryan will be a central focus in the recall elections. I hadn't heard that before. Will it work? Is it that connected in people's minds? Or is it too abstract for the average voter to make the connection?" Pasch, a second-term lawmaker who formerly worked as a nurse and nursing professor for 30 years, gave this response: "I think that Paul Ryan is the face of the radical plan to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid. People across Wisconsin depend on and like Medicare. If you stand with Paul Ryan, you stand with the promise to end health care for our seniors. It's not just a policy issue, it's a values issue." So, according to Pasch, Ryan promised to end health care for senior citizens. No health care? That would be one stiff drink to swallow. Before we assess Pasch’s defense of her claim, a little background. Ryan’s budget -- passed by the GOP-controlled House, 235-193, but defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate, 57-40 -- would make dramatic changes to Medicare if it ever became law. As it exists now, Medicare is government health insurance for people age 65 and over and for people under 65 with certain disabilities. It helps pay for doctor visits, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Under Ryan’s plan, people who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Those who turn 65 in 2022 or after, the budget office said, would get a "premium support payment" from Medicare. Rather than getting health insurance from the government, Medicare recipients would use the payment toward the cost of buying private health insurance. That’s a major change. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that future Medicare recipients "would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system." But when MoveOn.org declared that Ryan’s budget "abolishes Medicare within 10 years," the left-leaning political advocacy group earned a False from us, given that Medicare would change but not go away. Other critics, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, haven’t gone as far, arguing instead that Ryan’s plan would end Medicare "as we know it." But when Wasserman Schultz also claimed that under Ryan’s Medicare, insurance companies could "deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions," she got a False from our colleagues at PolitiFact National. Yet Pasch goes even further, claiming Ryan has promised to "end health care for our seniors." Not just Medicare, but "health care." Now to Pasch’s defense. Pasch’s campaign manager, Phil Walzak, argued in an email to us that, under Ryan’s proposal, Medicare recipients would "lose a guaranteed set of health benefits" because they would instead receive money to be used toward buying private health insurance. He also predicted that Medicare recipients would get fewer benefits even though they would be paying more for their health care. He cited analyses by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the National Academy of Social Insurance. For her part, Pasch herself was more measured in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin than she was in the online chat, saying Ryan’s plan "is clearly a move toward not promising health care to seniors." She went on to say that as senior citizens are forced to pay more for health insurance, they will "start neglecting their health care." It’s time for the tab from our political tiki bar. Pasch originally claimed that Ryan promised to end health care for seniors and now she says his Medicare plan is a "move toward not promising health care to seniors." That’s quite a step back from the original claim. Moreover, we’ve established that, although it’s expected that senior citizens would pay more for health care under Ryan’s plan, they would still have health care. At PolitiFact, we have a name for the drink that’s made by mixing false and ridiculous. It’s called Pants on Fire, and that’s what we rate Pasch’s claim.

pomt-02805	If the Trans-Pacific Partnership "is fast-tracked through the Senate, it won't receive a committee assignment" and the consideration will include "no debate."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/29/chain-email/chain-email-says-major-pacific-trade-deal-could-be/	A new chain email warns that President Barack Obama is about to grab "the powers of a king" through a new trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries. The email begins, "A leaked copy of Obama's top secret Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) has been posted on our website and it is much, much worse than anyone anticipated. We can say goodbye to America's borders, our Constitution and the rule of law if Obama and Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., are able to ram this treaty through the Senate. And that's exactly what they're trying to do! Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says this ‘free trade’ deal is a clear violation of the separation of powers. Only the Senate is allowed to negotiate trade agreements under the Constitution. Harry Reid wants to fast-track this treaty, which will essentially grant Obama the powers of a king to negotiate all future deals." The email goes on to say, "If this treaty is fast-tracked through the Senate, it won't receive a committee assignment and it will be subjected to a straight up-or-down vote, with no debate." We learned of the email when a reader sent it to us, asking for a fact-check. The email originated with Pray For US, a Henderson, Nev.,"online outreach Christian church and ministry." Most Americans probably haven’t heard of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but if the trade agreement comes to fruition -- and that’s far from a certainty at this point -- it could be a very big deal. One thing it wouldn’t do, though, is give Obama king-like powers. The email is also wrong when it claims that the fast-track process in Congress rules out committee assignments and debate. That’s what we’ll be fact-checking here. Let’s start with the basics. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, if it’s enacted, would set the ground rules for trade between a dozen nations in the Pacific region. It’s been in negotiation for several years among the United States, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Combined, these countries account for roughly 40 percent of the world’s economy. The Obama administration has made the agreement a top priority for trade policy. Mireya Solís, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has called it "the most ambitious trade initiative pursued by the Obama Administration, one that will have large ramifications for overall trade policy and the direction of the world trading system." Trade deals often draw opposition from the left (due to such concerns as labor rights, environmental protection and an expansion of corporate power) and sometimes from the right (such as over a feared loss of national sovereignty). This has been true with the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well, with various proposed provisions drawing fire, including everything from pharmaceutical patent rules to rights for legal redress. The deal could be taken up under a process informally known as "fast-track." That refers to a procedure outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. According to the Congressional Research Service, when Congress passed this law, it granted the president the authority to enter into trade agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs. Congress would then enact changes related to the agreement through legislation, using a procedure that streamlined and sped up the legislation’s path through Congress. The streamlined rules were designed to keep lawmakers from making changes that would threaten the international agreement. Here are some of the key elements of the fast-track process, taken from a CRS summary: • The president sends a final text of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress. Identical bills are required to be introduced in each chamber of Congress on the day they are received. • The bills are then referred to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, as well as other committees, if jurisdiction warrants. Each committee has 45 in-session days to report the bill to the floor. If that deadline passes without committee action, the bill is automatically sent to the floor. • On the floor, debate is set at 20 hours, evenly divided between those for the agreement and against it. The chain email is correct that when the eventual vote is taken, it is on the original text, without any amendments. And the measure needs 50 percent plus one to pass -- not the common Senate supermajority of 60 votes. While these rules do curb lawmakers’ ability to shape the agreement’s terms, the email is simply wrong to claim that legislation stemming from a trade agreement "won't receive a committee assignment" and that the agreement will have "no debate." We will note two other problems with the claim. First, whatever comes out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiation won’t be a "treaty," as the email claims. Under the Constitution, treaties require a two-thirds vote by the Senate. Second, fretting about how the Trans-Pacific Partnership could be passed under the fast-track process is putting the cart before the horse. Fast-track authority must be renewed periodically by Congress, and that authority lapsed on July 1, 2007. Since then, Congress -- under both Democratic and Republican majorities -- has not chosen to renew it. And with relations between the two parties, and between the House and the administration, thoroughly frayed, a renewal looks unlikely anytime soon. So it's possible that the agreement will be considered under fast-track, but it's far from certain. Our ruling The chain email said that "if the treaty (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) is fast-tracked through the Senate, it won't receive a committee assignment" and the agreement will have "no debate." The procedures laid out in the Trade Act of 1974 are designed to streamline the process of enacting trade agreements, but the process does in fact include committee consideration and floor debate. We rate the claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2013-11-29T06:00:00	2013-11-26	['None']

pomt-14087	"The Chinese last year probably stole $360 billion in intellectual property from the United States."	/punditfact/statements/2016/may/17/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-china-stole-360-billion-intelle/	Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has spoken favorably of presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, including expressing openness to being tapped as his vice president. And on Fox News Sunday, Gingrich joined Trump in hammering away at China. Gingrich said on May 15 that while he had played a major role as a congressional leader in passing one of Trump’s most heavily criticized trade deals, the North American Free Trade Agreement, it’s not a bad idea to be tougher now. "When you hear, for example, that the Chinese last year probably stole $360 billion in intellectual property from the United States, I think being tough about that's a good thing," Gingrich said. "I think conservatives can be for very tough-minded trade." The $360 billion figure is based on a federal estimate, though experts caution that the true number is impossible to know. It could actually be higher. Where the number comes from Intellectual property refers to creative concepts such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names and images used in commerce, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. Its creators and owners are protected legally through patents, copyrights and trademarks, but cross-border theft of intellectual property is hard to police. Over the years, United States officials have said that China is one of the worst offenders. This has been driven in large part by an aggressive technology quest by China’s central government. We tracked down Gingrich’s $360 billion figure to comments by William Evanina, director of the Counterintelligence and Security Center under Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Evanina told reporters in November 2015 that, based on reports by nearly 140 companies, espionage via computer hacking costs the U.S. economy $400 billion a year, and that the Chinese government is believed to be behind 90 percent of those attacks. That works out to $360 billion. Gingrich spokesman Ross Worthington subsequently confirmed that Evanina’s comments were the source of Gingrich’s number on Fox News Sunday. The first thing we should note, however, is that the $360 billion figure is only for losses from cyber-hacking — a limitation that Gingrich didn’t specify. Of course, adding in non-cyber losses would only increase that figure beyond $360 billion. And Worthington said that this all may be an under-estimate because "corporations do not usually reveal the fact or allow (law enforcement) to go public or estimate losses because that would in effect expose their consumers, clients and stockholders to more losses, indirect and direct." How solid is the $360 billion number? Still, experts agreed that there’s lots of uncertainty in determining the scale of intellectual property losses. Another estimate for intellectual property theft from China, by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, a blue-ribbon panel, pegged annual U.S. losses from intellectual property at approximately $300 billion, of which China accounted for "between 50 percent and 80 percent of the problem." That would produce a figure between $150 billion and $240 billion, lower than what Gingrich said, though the commission acknowledged that such studies may be undercounting the scale of losses. "The exact figure is unknowable," the commission cautioned. Independent experts strongly agreed. "Estimating losses from intellectual property theft is like trying to predict next month's weather with 1960s technology," said Justin Hughes, a Loyola Law School professor who specializes in intellectual property. "Estimates are by nature guesstimates, and rough ones at that. I would not be comfortable with anything more specific than ‘hundreds of billions of dollars.’ " Hughes added that measurements of intellectual property theft don’t necessarily include U.S. losses from counterfeit goods, another area of concern. Even basic definitions offer room for disagreement, said Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Should we use what it’s worth to the owner or the thief? If intellectual property hasn’t fully been brought to market — and that turns out in many cases to be the most valuable intellectual property — its value to anyone can only be very roughly estimated," he said. James A. Lewis, senior vice president and program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, also noted technical problems in calculating a dollar value. "If I steal intellectual property that you value at $100 and I can’t use it, the actual loss is zero," Lewis said. Our ruling Gingrich said, "The Chinese last year probably stole $360 billion intellectual property from the United States." The $360 billion figure comes from a senior government official, and there are indications that it could, if anything, understate the scale of the problem. However, it’s worth remembering that all estimates in this field are subject to guesstimation. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cba1cc29-04f5-45ce-8fde-99d2012548ce	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2016-05-17T16:02:27	2016-05-15	['United_States', 'China']
pomt-00820	Says Ted Cruz just flip-flopped about the president needing to be U.S.-born.	/texas/statements/2015/mar/27/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-says-ted-cruz-flip-flopper-president/	Canadian-born Ted Cruz, the Texas senator lately embarked on a bid for president, conveniently flip-flopped on whether a candidate needs to be born in the United States to run for president, an online meme suggests. We speak of this March 26, 2015, Facebook post: SOURCE: Facebook post, March 26, 2015 The post quotes the pictured Cruz, who was born in Calgary, Alberta, in December 1970 to an American mother and a Cuban-born father, saying Barack "Obama’s mother’s citizenship is irrelevant since his father wasn’t American and he wasn’t born in America. He can’t be president." Constitutional provision That comment would have been of a piece with inaccurate "birther" charges about the Democratic president, who was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in August 1961 to an American mother and Kenyan father. At issue is the constitutional provision requiring any president to be a "natural born citizen" of the United States--meaning the person must be a citizen at birth, most legal experts concur. The candidate also must be 35 years of age and a U.S. resident for 14 years. What does it mean to be a "natural born citizen"? Most legal experts contend it means someone is a citizen from birth and doesn’t have to go through a naturalization process to become one. And if that’s the definition, then Cruz is a natural born citizen by being born to an American mother and having her citizenship at birth. (See a full rundown of Cruz’s eligibility in this updated PolitiFact story.) Cruz flip-flop? The Facebook post, making the case for Cruz’s flip-flop, says Cruz said March 23, 2015, the day he announced his presidential candidacy: "All you need to know about my parentage is my mother was a citizen. My father and place of birth are irrelevant." Hypocrite! No confirmation of either comment Except, ahem, an extensive search of the Nexis news database and online news sources yields no sign of Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, making either statement. Our searches led us only to a March 26, 2015, web post on Debunkr.net saying the same; Cruz hasn’t made these comments. We asked Cruz’s campaign if Cruz had ever said Obama couldn’t be president for anything connected to his birthplace. He "has not," Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed. In news stories dating from 2013 to the present, Dallas Morning News reporter Todd J. Gillman, who heads that paper’s Washington, D.C., bureau, has detailed Cruz’s citizenship actions including a decision to legally end his dual U.S.-Canada citizenship in June 2014. At the time, Cruz made his birth certificate available to reporters: SOURCE: Email, Catherine Frazier, then-press secretary, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, to Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer, Austin American-Statesman, Aug. 19, 2013 Previously, Gillman took note of a Mother Jones magazine article stating Cruz’s father, Dallas-area pastor Rafael Cruz, had made a comment while stumping for his son that suggested Obama be sent back to Kenya. In September 2012, the elder Cruz spoke of sending Obama "back to Kenya." That's the land of birth for Obama's father, the News noted in a Nov. 1, 2013, news story, though the 44th president was born in Hawaii, "making him a natural-born American two ways -- by birth on American soil and because his mother was from Kansas." "We have our work cut out for us," the elder Cruz told a North Texas Tea Party gathering Sept. 12, 2012, as later revealed by Mother Jones. "We need to send Barack Obama back to Chicago. I'd like to send him back to Kenya, back to Indonesia." At the time, Frazier said the pastor did not speak for his son. Ted Cruz subsequently said his father made an "ill-advised joke," the News reported. Our ruling A Facebook meme indicates Ted Cruz has conveniently flip-flopped on whether the president must be U.S.-born. We found no evidence Cruz made the presented comments or that he’s changed his position about the "natural born citizen" provision. While he’s spoken occasionally about his own birth and citizenship, he appears not to have made declarations about Obama’s origins. This makes the Facebook post factually unsupported and ridiculous.

Among other things, the ad says that Mike Huckabee "even supported taxpayer-funded scholarships for illegal aliens." There's some truth here, but it's not as dramatic as the 30-second ad portrays. Rather than supporting a scholarship fund aimed at illegal aliens, Huckabee supported a measure that would have allowed the children of illegal aliens who graduated from Arkansas high schools to receive in-state tuition and apply for a state-funded scholarship program, the Academic Challenge Scholarship. Arkansas students can qualify for the scholarship if they achieve a specific grade-point average (3.0 out of 4.0 for a four-year college) and meet a few other basic criteria. At a November 2007 debate in St. Petersburg, Huckabee said he supported the measure so that the children of illegal immigrants could have "the same scholarship that their peers had, who had also gone to high school with them and sat in the same classrooms." (Huckabee also claimed the rules regarding this proposal were stricter than they actually were; we checked that claim here . We also checked previous claims from Romney on similar issues here and here .) Even though Huckabee supported the measure in 2005, it never made it out of the Arkansas legislature, so it never became a law in Arkansas. Romney is right in his assertion, but he glosses over a few important caveats to get there. For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-15171	Says Bobby Jindal’s parents "used his birthright citizenship to become Americans, making him an anchor baby."	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/25/occupy-democrats/liberal-group-tags-jindal-anchor-baby/	Billionaire Donald Trump’s immigration proposals include forcing Mexico to pay for a wall at the border, tripling the number of immigration officers, and ending the long-standing practice of birthright citizenship. There are exceptions but generally speaking, if you are born in the United States, you can claim citizenship regardless of the immigration status of your parents. This goes back to the 14th Amendment. Once Trump raised the issue, other GOP contenders followed suit, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. On Aug. 17, 2015, Jindal tweeted, "We need to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants." This prompted the liberal group Occupy Democrats to post a meme on its Facebook page with this message: " ‘We have to end birthright citizenship to stop anchor babies,’ says Republican Bobby Jindal whose noncitizen parents arrived in the U.S. four months before he was born and used his birthright citizenship to become Americans, making him an anchor baby." The part we’re fact-checking is the claim that Jindal’s parents gained citizenship through him. People define "anchor baby" in different ways. Some use it when food assistance and medical care for a low-income child of undocumented immigrants produce indirect benefits for the parents. That doesn’t apply in Jindal’s case. For one, his parents had healthy incomes when they arrived, and more to the point, Occupy Democrats focused on another meaning of anchor baby — a child through whom a noncitizen can craft a path to full citizenship. Coming to America The Facebook post is shaky on its quotation of Jindal. His tweet didn’t mention "anchor babies." The closest he came to saying those words was during an interview with Fox News where, on being pressed by the host, Jindal said, "I’m happy to use the phrase," but he still didn’t actually use it. However, regarding Jindal’s personal timeline, the post is accurate. Jindal’s parents moved from India to Baton Rouge, La., on Feb. 1, 1971. Jindal was born on June 10, 1971. So that’s just about four months later. Back in the days when people like Trump were clamoring for President Barack Obama to show his birth certificate, Jindal moved to ensure that no such questions would hang about him. In 2011, the Times-Picayune reported that Jindal had produced his birth certificate. It showed that he was born at Woman’s Hospital in Baton Rouge to Raj Gupta, his mother, and Amar Jindal, his father. At the time, his mother had a scholarship to study nuclear physics at Louisiana State University, and his father, an engineer professor, was working for a subsidiary of the Kansas City Southern Railway. A couple of years later, Amar Jindal took a new job with the Exxon oil company. Jindal’s mother Raj Gupta earned two master’s degrees, one in physics and another in nuclear engineering. She ultimately worked for the state Labor Department in information technology. Mike Reed, communications director in the Louisiana governor’s office, told us that Raj Gupta became an American citizen in 1976, and Amar Jindal followed 10 years later in 1986. Why does that matter? Because those dates mean that Jindal’s birthright citizenship played no legal role in his parent’s citizenship applications. Let’s see why. 21 is the magic number Two leaders in immigration law explained that Jindal only could have helped his parents become citizens when he had turned 21 years old. Under the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the child of immigrants can sponsor them to become permanent residents. The child must be a citizen and must be 21 or older. Once the parents are permanent residents, they must live in America for five straight years. After that, they can apply for citizenship. If Jindal’s citizenship had made any difference, the earliest his parents could have been eligible would have been 1992, five years after he turned 21. When his mother became a citizen in 1976, Jindal was 5, and in 1986, for his father’s naturalization, he was 15. It’s not even close. "If both parents had lawful permanent residence, then it doesn’t make a difference if they had a kid," said David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Lenni Benson, a law professor at New York Law School, also said that given the Jindals’ circumstances, the son’s citizenship was "irrelevant." "Once they secured immigrant visas and became lawful permanent residents, they could seek naturalization on their own after five years of residence and meeting other requirements," Benson said. Everything Leopold and Benson told us matches the rules that we found on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. At the end of the day, there is no evidence that Jindal was an "anchor baby." Occupy Democrats did not return a message to the group’s email address. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said Bobby Jindal’s parents used his birthright citizenship to become Americans. We reviewed the law and spoke to two experts in immigration law. The only way Jindal might have been able to help his parents become citizens is if he had been 21. He was 5 when his mother became a citizen and 15 when his father took the same step. The experts we reached told us Jindal’s citizenship was irrelevant, bringing Occupy Democrats' claim into the realm of ridiculous. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-11667	"White House staff compiled a number of gorilla documentaries into a makeshift gorilla channel" for President Donald Trump.	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/05/tweets/gorilla-channel-trump-satire-tweet-fools-1000s/	With off-the-charts anticipation over the release of a tell-all book about President Donald Trump, the Twittersphere was primed for a classic hoax. The Twitter account @pixelatedboat delivered. "Wow, this extract from Wolff’s book is a shocking insight into Trump’s mind," the prankster said Jan. 4, adding what looked like a picture of a section of the book. "On his first night in the White House, President Trump complained that the TV in his bedroom was broken, because it didn’t have ‘the gorilla channel’," the faux excerpt began. "To appease Trump, White House staff compiled a number of gorilla documentaries into a makeshift gorilla channel, broadcast into Trump’s bedroom from a hastily-constructed transmission tower on the South Lawn." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Not content with that absurdity, the excerpt continued with a quote from an unnamed insider saying Trump "kneels in front of the TV, with his face about four inches from the screen and says encouraging things to the gorillas." But it’s not true. To be sure, we ran a search on a Kindle copy of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, by Michael Wolff. There was not one mention of a gorilla. But plenty of people believed the tweet, which got over 51,000 likes and was retweeted over 16,000 times. One person tweeted, "I did not realize it was a joke until I read the comments!! We're so far down the rabbit hole, this seemed completely believable. What's happening to us????" Another said "I read pretty far in before I realized ..." Prolific twitterer Eric Garland with over 170,000 followers confessed "I got totally punked on the Gorilla Channel thing." About six hours after the tweet went up, the author changed his display name to "the gorilla channel thing is a joke." And he wrote, "Wonder if this new display name will help. Probably not." Our ruling Come on. A phony gorilla channel for President Trump hacked together by his staff to distract him? Do we need to say more than Pants on Fire?

pomt-14962	"CNN's Crap Polling" is so bad that it shows that "no one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton."	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/21/viral-image/next-chapter-conspiracy-theiry-graphic-takes-aim-c/	A few days ago, we waded into the debate over a conspiracy theory circulating among some supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders -- the one that has CNN, among other media outlets, keeping favorable post-debate poll results for Sanders under wraps because the network, and other parts of the media establishment, are in the tank for Hillary Clinton. After we gave a Pants on Fire rating to the claim that CNN deleted from its website an online poll favorable to Sanders, many readers attacked PolitiFact as being part of this conspiracy against Sanders. Nonetheless, we’ve decided to wade in again after a reader sent us a Facebook post that added a new wrinkle to the alleged CNN conspiracy. The reader sent us a post that showed an image of results from a CNN-ORC International poll taken between Oct. 14 and 17. On the image, two columns were circled in red -- two columns of sub-results by age group for a question about how favorably or unfavorably the respondent views Hillary Clinton. The two columns show responses for survey participants ages 18 to 34 and ages 35 to 49. Every possible answer in those columns has been marked N/A -- "not applicable." The creator of the image was dumbfounded, slapping this comment on the image in big red type: "CNN's Crap Polling: No one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton?" The reader who contacted PolitiFact wondered whether the image creator’s question was legitimate, so we took a closer look. Bottom line: It’s all a misunderstanding about how CNN reports the results of its surveys. (After we emailed questions to the person who had posted it on their Facebook page, we didn’t receive a response, but the post was pulled down. We saved a screenshot, above.) The easiest way to debunk the graphic’s assumption is to look a few columns to the right. There, one can find a heading that reads "under 50," with 74 percent of respondents in that age group saying they feel favorably about Clinton, 23 percent saying they feel unfavorably, 3 percent saying they have no opinion and 1 percent saying they’ve never heard of her. (Our real question: Who belongs to the 1 percent who have never heard of Hillary Clinton?) So this column of poll results clearly shows that people under 50 did tell the survey takers about their opinions about Clinton. What about those mysterious columns full of "N/A"? They are there because of CNN’s polling policy. The policy is explained fully in the same document that the Facebook image was drawn from, though it appears on an earlier page not shown in the Facebook post. This section explains the CNN policy on "crosstabs" -- the polling industry’s term for results sorted by demographic subcategories such as age, race, gender or income level. "Crosstabs on the following pages only include results for subgroups with enough unweighted cases to produce a sampling error of +/- 8.5 percentage points or less," CNN wrote. "Some subgroups represent too small a share of the national population to produce crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error. Interviews were conducted among these subgroups, but results for groups with a sampling error larger than +/-8.5 percentage points are not displayed and instead are denoted with ‘N/A.’ " In other words, for the age ranges 18 to 34 and 35 to 49, the survey reached too few people to produce a statistically valid sample -- so to avoid publishing questionable numbers, CNN simply reported them as "N/A." This pattern -- categories with larger sample sizes given specific figures, and those with smaller sample size marked "N/A" -- is echoed elsewhere in the full document. "The CNN/ORC polls are highly regarded," said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. "They are one of the few partnerships to provide us subgroup data, which is invaluable. The Facebook question does a disservice to the poll." Our ruling The Internet graphic accused CNN of being such an incompetent pollster that it found that "no one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton." This is based on a misreading of the CNN-sponsored poll. Two age-range subcategories produced too few respondents to qualify as statistically valid results under CNN’s threshold, which was plainly spelled out in the survey-results document. The claim is even debunked on the graphic itself -- it showed a category with actual results for respondents under the age of 50. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06972	Says state Sen. Sheila Harsdorf wants to "eliminate Medicare" as we know it.	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/14/shelly-moore/democratic-candidate-shelly-moore-says-sen-sheila-/	The high-stakes recall elections for Wisconsin Senate are starting to sound like congressional races, as Democratic challengers try to link Republicans to the Medicare funding plan offered by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Janesville. Sometimes the link is clear: Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), for example, said she was "standing with Ryan" on Medicare reforms. Now she’s under attack for it as she tries to retain her seat. Then there’s the claim from Democrat Shelly Moore, a teacher and union activist seeking to unseat Sen. Sheila Harsdorf (R-River Falls) in a northwestern Wisconsin district. She sent out a direct-mail piece with this headline: "Senator Harsdorf and Her Party Want to Eliminate Medicare As We Know It, Forcing Seniors to Pay Thousands More a Year for the Same Coverage." The cover illustration and message, featuring a resident in the 10th District, was even tougher: "Lyda Haskins of River Falls Can’t Afford For Medicare to End. CAN YOU?" We’ll return to that constituent later, but first a bit of background. Democrats across the country are seeking political advantage by injecting Ryan and Medicare into local races. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found that it will save the government money. It does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for insurance, PolitiFact National has reported. The Ryan plan leaves the government-run Medicare health insurance program in its current form for people now 55 and older. For those currently under 55, Ryan would end the guaranteed benefit in Medicare; it would pay directly for medical services instead of giving seniors a set amount, the Journal Sentinel reported. Critics call that a "voucher" plan but Ryan does not. He says more choices for Medicare participants would increase competition and drive down cost. It is complex and far-reaching plan. But has Harsdorf come out in favor of it? When we asked Moore for backup, campaign aides cited two pieces of evidence. One was a video of a brief, taped conversation Harsdorf had July 3, 2011, in Hudson with a woman who wanted to know her position on Ryan’s Medicare plan. But rather than voicing support, as Moore’s campaign claims, Harsdorf pointedly -- and repeatedly -- does not take a position. "I’m really focused on state issues," Harsdorf offered -- a stance she repeated in an interview with us. Gillian Morris, a Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesman involved in Moore’s campaign, said the video showed that Harsdorf was "unwilling to stand against" Ryan’s plan -- and may be a hint she supports it. But the video doesn’t indicate support -- or even opposition -- so it’s not much backing at all for Moore’s claim. The second piece the campaign pointed to was a vote cast by Harsdorf on June 16, 2011, against a Democratic amendment to restore a variety of social service cuts in the 2011-’13 state budget. One line in the amendment sought to allow Wisconsin’s attorney general to sue over possible federal changes to Medicare and Medicaid. Harsdorf joined other Republicans in killing the amendment. We examined the Senate amendment and listened to the 40-minute floor debate in that chamber, as well as the debate in the Assembly over a similar amendment the day before. The Senate version does not mention Ryan at all, but Democratic senators made it crystal clear during debate the amendment was aimed at Ryan’s Medicare plan. In the Assembly, there was little doubt that Democrats were using the vote to put Republicans on the record in a way that could be used against them later. "Are you going to stand with Wisconsin seniors or stand with Congressman Ryan?" asked state Rep. Jon Richards (D-Milwaukee). That gets at the purpose of the amendment, which included many other things, but what about the substance of the claim made by Moore? During the Senate debate, Harsdorf said nothing about the amendment; Republicans as a group largely were silent. What about the guts of the amendment? Did a vote against it, as Moore contends, put someone on record in favor of Ryan’s plan to turn Medicare into what the amendment called "vouchers"? There are significant problems with that reasoning. One, Harsdorf had 98 other possible reasons to vote against the amendment, which contained a total of 99 changes covering a range of issues such as Family Care, Senior Care and Badger Care. The Medicare amendment Moore refers to was No. 93 on the list. Two, the amendment in question referred to giving the attorney general the ability to sue over changes not just to Medicare, but to Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income individuals. We searched news accounts, speeches, TV ads and position papers and found no evidence of Harsdorf taking a public position on Ryan’s plan. Nor could Moore’s campaign produce any. Harsdorf told us her vote against the Democratic amendment reflected only her support for the Republican-crafted state budget, which she helped mold as a member of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee. Without that direct connection, the approach feels more like guilt by association. In the 2010 campaign, a liberal group sought to link GOP Assembly candidates to Ryan’s proposals on Social Security. We found the links were beyond thin, and the allegation of "privatizing" Social Security inaccurate, and we rated the claim Pants on Fire. Before we close, there are two other problems with Moore’s campaign literature -- one of them a whopper. For one, Moore plays loose in stating the impact of Ryan’s Medicare proposal. At one point, her flier says it would "eliminate Medicare as we know it." In another, it says the plan would "end" Medicare. For those who turn 65 before 2022, the program would not change. And for the others, Medicare would change dramatically but it would still exist, PolitiFact Wisconsin noted in ruling False a MoveOn.org claim that Medicare would be abolished in 10 years. And, last but not least, we called the woman pictured under the flier's headline: "Lyda Haskins of River Falls Can’t Afford For Medicare to End." Haskins, 85, told us that she would have no trouble without Medicare even if it were taken from her -- which it would not be, under the plan. "It’s laughable that I wouldn’t be able to afford it," Haskins said. "They should have not have done that." Haskins, whose daughter Alison Page ran unsuccessfully against Harsdorf in 2008, is well known in the area. Haskins said she was not told her name would be used, and was not aware that Medicare would be an issue in the direct mail piece. She said she agreed, along with her grandchildren, only to be pictured generically as a Moore supporter. "It was wrong to use my name. I think it was somebody’s error," said Haskins, who said she would still support Moore. Morris said Moore campaign officials were "perplexed" over Haskin's allegations, saying they fully explained to her the image would be used in a Medicare flier and that she understood. Let’s take stock. Moore portrays Harsdorf as wanting to "eliminate Medicare as we know it" or to "end" Medicare for seniors. But the video she points to as backup does not include an acknowledgment of support for Ryan’s Medicare plan and the opposition to the Senate amendment cited is not proof of support either. There were 99 points in that amendment and the Ryan-focused one was so vague that even as a separate item it would have provided no definitive proof of Harsdorf’s stance. We could find no backup at all in our own search of Harsdorf’s position, and she said simply she’s focused on state issues. Indeed, the campaign literature highlights a woman who wouldn’t be affected -- and who herself disputes that she "can’t afford" for Medicare to end. It is incumbent on the person making a factual claim to be able to support it. The flier’s claims are false, barring new information, and the misleading nature of the presentation pushes this into ridiculous territory. That’s a Pants on Fire.

pomt-03641	U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham says South Carolina "has a labor shortage and wants more immigration."	/georgia/statements/2013/may/03/dustin-inman-society/anti-amnesty-group-takes-sen-graham/	The immigration debate is in high gear, prompting us to look into two claims on the issue. The most prominent driving force for reform has been the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan coalition of U.S. senators -- four Republicans and four Democrats -- which released its comprehensive immigration reform bill last month. A key provision in the Senate bill (a House version could be a step-by-step approach still to come) would create guest worker programs for low-skilled and agricultural workers. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a proponent of the programs. But that advocacy didn’t go over so well here in Georgia with an anti-amnesty group, the Dustin Inman Society, which purchased a billboard advertisement criticizing Graham. The billboard, posted in Cherokee County near Woodstock, reads: "South Carolina Welcomes the Undocumented! Sen. Lindsey Graham says his state has a labor shortage and wants more immigrants." The advertisement goes on to tell job seekers: "For job tips, call his office (number provided) located in Pendleton, S.C., only two hours from Atlanta!" The billboard ends with a link to a Patch article about Graham discussing immigration reform at a South Carolina Rotary Club meeting in February. We wanted to know if the ad correctly quoted Graham and accurately characterized his comments. We contacted D.A. King about the billboard. King is the leader of the Dustin Inman Society, named for the Georgia teenager killed in a 2000 traffic accident by an illegal immigrant. The billboard is in the county where Dustin Inman lived, King said. "Absent the (mainstream media) shining some honest light on the matter, we thought it would be educational and entertaining to at least illuminate his claims and perhaps encourage black market labor to migrate to South Carolina," King said in an email to us. "That would open up jobs here (in Georgia) and help legal workers." Graham, through a spokesman, said he had no comment on the billboard. In the Patch article referenced on the advertisement, Graham told the Rotary Club: "When you go to these meatpacking plants in Saluda (S.C.), harvesting the crops or servicing the hotels along the coast, you may not believe it, but it is true -- there is a shortage of labor in some parts of our economy, even though we have high unemployment." Graham also commented on the issue in a U.S. Senate hearing in February, and a portion of his remarks are included in a film by independent filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch, "They Come to America II." The film, which is critical of Graham, says that 340,000 Americans in South Carolina can’t find full-time jobs. "Nobody wants to displace a willing American worker, but I can tell you in South Carolina there are certain jobs, like in the meatpacking industry, that as an employer you can advertise all day long every day of the week and you’re not going to get that workforce," Graham says during the hearing. So, Graham says his state has a labor shortage for certain jobs, and in the instances he’s made that claim, he has largely focused on the meatpacking industry. Neither the billboard nor a film criticizing Graham, though, notes that the senator’s comments referred mostly to the meatpacking industry. The billboard goes on to say that South Carolina welcomes the undocumented. Graham has advocated for a bill creating a guest worker program, but such a program would provide a legal means for some immigrants to work in the country. To sum up, a Georgia anti-amnesty group, the Dustin Inman Society, criticized Graham for his comments that the Palmetto State has a labor shortage. As part of his argument for comprehensive immigration reform and guest worker programs, Graham made claims there is a labor shortage in some areas, and in at least two instances the Republican senator specifically mentioned the meatpacking industry as an area needing workers. The claim about Graham’s statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores the senator’s focus on the meatpacking industry. The society goes on to say that Graham’s state welcomes undocumented immigrants, but the guest worker program he supports would create a legal means for immigrants to work. We rate the society’s claims Mostly False.	None	Dustin Inman Society	None	None	None	2013-05-03T00:00:00	2013-04-15	['United_States', 'Lindsey_Graham', 'South_Carolina']

pomt-06396	"The State of Rhode Island has the worst state-funded pension in the country."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/30/helen-glover/talk-show-host-helen-glover-says-rhode-islands-pen/	(This story was updated on Oct. 31 to reflect the fact that General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has also referred to Rhode Island as "the worst" as recently as Sept. 8, 2011.) Rhode Island has a pension crisis. Simply put, it doesn't have enough money set aside to cover the payments that it has promised its current and future retirees. How bad is it? WHJJ talk show host Helen Glover declared on Oct. 24 that we are now first among the worst. "The State of Rhode Island has the worst state-funded pension in the country. Of all of the systems, we're the worst," she said during her Oct. 24 show. Are we really at the bottom of the heap? When we asked Glover for her source, she sent along several articles. But before we get to them, a quick reminder about what is at stake. Rhode Island’s state pension plans are paying $370 million this year to provide retirement benefits for government employees. If nothing changes, that amount will nearly double next year to $615 million. According to state officials, the plan now has only 48 percent of the funds it needs to cover its pension obligations. The federal government regards 80 percent as a safe level. Now back to Glover’s claim that Rhode Island’s system is the worst in the nation. One of the sources she supplied to us was a story on WPRI.com with this headline: "RI pension fund in worst shape of all, Pew suggests." But the story compared the 2010 funding level for Rhode Island with Pew data from other states from 2009, when Rhode Island wasn't the worst at all -- five states had less cash in 2009 to cover their pension obligations than Rhode Island (which was at 59 percent). Illinois ranked the worst, funded at 51 percent. The WPRI story noted what the headline didn't: that it was using data from different years. Yet when other websites picked up the WPRI headline, the story’s caveats were dropped. Glover's sources included one such item, a five-paragraph story from BusinessInsider.com headlined, "Rhode Island's Pension Liabilities Are Now The Worst In the Country" that combined the WPRI story with an error-filled chart that, it said, came from Boston College's Center for Retirement Research. When we went directly to the Boston College database and ran our own calculations, we found that it put Rhode Island pensions as being funded at 62 percent in 2009, not 48 percent as Business Insider reported. (And instead of being "the worst in the country," Rhode Island was ranked ninth from the bottom, a better ranking than the Pew report.) So what do the latest numbers show? At Pew, research director Kil Huh said the organization is still gathering 2010 data. The latest tallies from 4 of the 10-worst states haven't been released. But Illinois' numbers, published in July, show that state has dropped to a funding level of 45 percent, keeping it at the bottom of the list -- so far. Two states that had worse numbers than Rhode Island in Pew's report on the 2009 numbers -- West Virginia and Oklahoma -- have not released their latest statistics. So why did the funding percentages fall in 2010? Huh said it probably comes from the lingering impact of the recession, which keeps pulling down the amount of money pension funds have been earning over the last five years. "The states are still accounting for the significant losses they experienced in the fall of 2008." And in Rhode Island, the state retirement board voted in April to scale back its predicted rate of return for its pension investment portfolio. The assumed rate of return had been 8.25 percent per year; the board adjusted that to 7.5 percent. (The actual market return over the last 10 years has been 5.74 percent; 1.52 percent in the past 5 years.) Glover also referred us to a recent Washington Post story that paraphrased Raimondo as saying that Rhode Island has the nation’s worst-funded pension system. (We also found a New York Times story that did the same thing.) But neither quoted her directly, and the Post story cited a per-capita comparison, not a funding level comparison. Raimondo did make such a statement in the Feb. 24, 2011 edition of PBS NewsHour, saying the state had "the highest unfunded liability per capita of any state in the country." But more recently, says Raimondo’s office, the treasurer has consistently characterized the funding level as "one of the worst" in the nation or "one of the worst" per capita. A search of Providence Journal stories supports that. (However, after this report was published, Bob Plain of WPRO produced a tape from Sept. 8, 2011, in which the treasurer clearly and repeatedly characterized the funding of the state's pension system as "the worst," with the "highest unfunded liability per capita.") Our ruling Helen Glover said Rhode Island's pension system is the mostly poorly funded in the U.S. Her statement was based on sources that either misread the numbers or mixed old data with new. Using the latest 2010 numbers from Pew, Rhode Island ranks no lower than second from the bottom, and the state's standing may improve as other states report their figures. And when we sought out other sources, such as Moody's and Boston College, we couldn't find any ranking that put Rhode Island at the bottom of the barrel when it came to pension funding. That doesn't detract from Rhode Island's profoundly perilous pension problem. But being in last place is a very specific distinction, and we're not there -- yet. Because Glover was so definitive, we rule that her statement "contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression" -- PolitiFact's definition of Mostly False.

pomt-03501	Says Gov. John Kasich implied that a portion of workers’ compensation rebates to employers "should be directed back to him in the form of campaign cash."	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/07/tom-letson/state-rep-tom-letson-suggests-ohio-gov-john-kasich/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich made news last month when he proposed returning $1 billion in insurance premiums to more than 200,000 public and private employers. The rebates, later approved by the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation board, could be worth up to millions of dollars and are possible thanks to an unexpected surplus in bureau funds. A couple of weeks later, the Republican Kasich noted the accomplishment among others in an email sent to his campaign’s listserv. The email drew the ire of State Rep. Tom Letson. A statement sent by Letson’s office called Kasich campaign’s email as a "fundraising pitch to cash in" on the rebates. Letson asserted that Kasich was "raising money from an injured workers’ fund" and that the governor has "directly tied BWC rebates to" political donations. "It is as if the Governor is implying that a portion of the rebate should be directed back to him in the form of campaign cash," said Letson, a four-term Democrat from Warren. PolitiFact Ohio decided that Letson’s provocative claim was worth a closer look. Let’s start with the email from Kasich’s campaign. Letson’s office attached a copy to his statement. We confirmed its authenticity after a Kasich aide forwarded us the original. The campaign email’s subject line: "$1 billion back." Here is the entire text: [Supporter], did you hear the recent news about the $1 billion coming back to Ohio taxpayers? Governor Kasich recently announced that Ohio's Bureau of Workers' Compensation would be returning $1 billion back to public and private employers in a move that’s aimed to help spur job creation. This plan has received a lot of praise and you can read some of the coverage below. Also, a recent survey of CEOs named Ohio as having the most improved business climate of all the other states in the country. It's great to see our reforms getting so much attention but there's still a lot more work to do and we’ll need your help to keep up the momentum. Finally, Gov. Kasich joined a Mahoning Valley company in announcing the creation of new jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in the local economy. You can read more about this great news here. Below are some more things for you to read and please take a moment to help us share some of them with your Facebook friends: We share the entire text, with the Kasich campaign’s bolded emphasis added, to show that there is no direct fundraising pitch in the text. The closest the campaign comes is the line about how Kasich has "a lot more work to do" and needs "your help to keep up the momentum." Immediately below the text were photos and headlines that link to six articles shared on the campaign’s website. At the very bottom of the email were two button-style links. One, labeled "Donate Today", links to the contribution page on the campaign’s website. The "Donate" button was not displayed next to any mention of the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation rebate offer. PolitiFact Ohio reached out to Letson’s office. Keary McCarthy, chief of staff for the Ohio House Democrats, responded on the lawmaker’s behalf. He argued that because the email included the "Donate" button at the bottom, it qualified as a fundraising pitch. Because the email noted the rebate program, McCarthy said it’s fair to link the rebates to a plea for campaign money. "Donate" buttons are common on nearly every email sent by a political campaign. Many emails are much more explicit, whether by suggesting specific contribution amounts or making it clear that the supporter’s donation is important to meeting an incremental goal or winning a race. McCarthy stressed other points from Letson’s statement, which referred to past "horrible missteps" at the workers’ compensation agency. That’s a reference to the Coingate scandal during the Taft administration, in which lax oversight of investments cost taxpayers millions of dollars. Tom Noe, a Republican fundraiser, went to prison for raiding a $50 million portfolio he had managed for the agency. That context helps explain what type of behavior Letson is concerned about. But Letson spoke of misbehavior as if it already was occurring. So, do the facts back him up? Let’s review. In an email to campaign supporters, Kasich’s campaign touted the workers’ comp rebate program and two other recent accomplishments. The email included links to articles about these and other accomplishments and, at the very bottom, a link for those who wished to donate. So there is a fundraising element to the email. Letson said it was "as if the Governor is implying that a portion of the rebate should be directed back to him in the form of campaign cash." He is not merely asserting that Kasich was trying to raise money in the email. Rather, Letson is positing something very specific: that Kasich was asking rebate recipients to kick back some of their savings to the governor’s campaign. That’s a serious accusation. And though Letson hedges with words such as "as if" and "implying," that doesn’t excuse the gravity of his claim. We don’t think anyone could reasonably come away from Kasich’s email with the impression he implied what Letson says he did. PolitiFact Ohio has a rating for such absurd statements: Pants on Fire!

pomt-11045	The Iran deal "handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/29/kevin-nicholson/tammy-baldwin-opponent-errs-claiming-billions-doll/	A prime attack Kevin Nicholson makes against U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin concerns the Iran deal that President Donald Trump recently withdrew from. The deal, Nicholson declared, had "handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that." Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are running in the August 2018 Republican primary for the right to challenge Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, in the November 2018 general election. The Delafield businessman made the statement on May 30, 2018, to conservative Green Bay radio talk show host John Muir. It is one he has made repeatedly. He mostly misses. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The backdrop About three weeks before Nicholson made the radio claim, Trump announced the United States would pull out of the nuclear pact with Iran and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, saying the deal failed to contain the regime’s nuclear ambitions and regional meddling. The easy part of Nicholson’s claim to check is Iran’s connection to terrorism. Iran has been on the U.S. State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. Those countries (Iran, Sudan, Syria and North Korea) have been determined to have "repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism." But let’s get to the thrust of Nicholson’s claim -- that the deal merely "handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes" to Iran and that Baldwin was one of the first senators to support it. The cash The deal, struck in July 2015 under President Barack Obama, was with Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. The deal restricted certain Iranian nuclear activities for periods between 10 to 25 years, and allowed for more intrusive, permanent monitoring. It also prohibited Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons in the future. So, it wasn’t just merely turning over cash to Iran. Latest Kevin Nicholson fact checks: "Tammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence." Mostly True. Says conservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein is a Wisconsin resident. False. "There are more guns in this country than there are people." Half True. As part of the deal, Iran did get access to tens of billions of dollars in assets — but the vast majority of those assets are Iran’s own money. And what cash was delivered on a plane was far less than billions. As our PolitiFact colleagues have reported: The deal released Iranian assets frozen under a variety of sanctions. The assets, cash in the bank, real estate or something else, belonged to Iran in the first place. The total value — worldwide — of freed Iranian assets was about $56 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. According to the U.S. State Department, Iran received about $1.7 billion from the United States — $400 million plus interest. The payment was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered. Many news organizations reported the delivery of the $400 million in an unmarked cargo plane after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran. As for Baldwin’s backing of the Iran deal, she wasn’t among the first. Her campaign cited reports showing that Baldwin announced her support on Aug. 7, 2015 — after 13 other senators had done so. Our rating Nicholson says the Iran deal "handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that." Iran is on the United States’ list of state sponsors of terrorism. As part of a 2015 deal aimed making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, Iran got access to tens of billions of dollars of its own assets that had been frozen — there weren’t billions of dollars sent on a plane. The United States, in a transaction indirectly linked to the Iran deal, did send on a plane $400 million in cash to Iran. Iran was owed the money because it had paid the United States for military hardware in 1979 that was never delivered. Finally, Baldwin was not among the first senators to support the Iran nuclear deal. Thirteen other senators had announced their support before she did. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Nicholson a Mostly False.

pomt-06686	Rick Perry "was the (campaign) chairman for Al Gore at one time, not too many years ago."	/texas/statements/2011/sep/07/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-rick-perry-was-al-gores-campaign-cha/	Editor’s note: After doubts were raised about Rick Perry’s role in Al Gore’s 1988 presidential campaign, we looked afresh into the matter, concluding in September 2011 that Perry was not Gore’s Texas campaign chairman. This research has prompted us to revise downward our rating of Paul’s claim to Half True. Interviews and news articles confirm that Perry was among 28 Democratic legislators who endorsed Gore for president in January 1988. But there’s no proof he led or ran Gore’s campaign in Texas. It appears that a Democratic opponent slapped various Gore campaign leadership labels on Perry in a 1998 election year and, partly because Perry did not dispute them, the descriptives stuck. For archival purposes, though, the article below retains the text of our original Paul fact check, which was published Aug. 15, 2011. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul told a gathering in Iowa the other day that he wasn’t worried about his chances if fellow Texan. Rick Perry joined the Republican presidential race. As caught on video by a San Francisco Chronicle reporter, Paul said Aug. 10 in Mason City that Perry’s candidacy "probably will help us, because he’ll just further dilute the establishment vote. He’s part of the status quo." Paul also said Perry’s gubernatorial record doesn’t show him to be a conservative. He added that Perry "actually was the chairman for Al Gore at one time, not too many years ago." Gov. Perry for Gore, the former Democratic vice president, not so long ago? Indeed, as we noted in a 2010 fact check, when Perry was still a Democrat, he was the Texas state chairman for Gore's presidential campaign in 1988, the year before he switched parties in anticipation of running for state agriculture commissioner in 1990. What brought Perry to pitch in for Gore, whose candidacy washed out after the Tennessee senator failed to do well outside his native South? At the time, many conservative Texas Democrats put stock in Gore’s campaign, among them former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and then-House Speaker Gib Lewis, who flew to Washington to endorse Gore. Later, Perry said he found out Gore was far from a real conservative. "Going through that (Gore experience) was part of what started me through the process of changing parties," Perry said. "I came to my senses." In the Texas primary, Gore ran third to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. In late 2009, Perry revisited his disagreement with Gore over the human impact on global warming. Suggesting he'd seen the light on the climate issue while Gore had drifted into darker territory, Perry joked: "I certainly got religion. I think he's gone to hell." Don’t count on the two to be joined in a cause again. Per Paul’s comment, Ryan J. Rusak of The Dallas Morning News wondered in an Aug. 11 blog post if it’s fair to say Perry was Gore’s chairman "not too many years ago." Rusak wrote: "Is 23 years really ‘not too many years ago?’ When you're about to celebrate (your) 76th birthday, as Dr. Paul is next week, I suppose not. But in politics, it's a lifetime, no?" It was more than two decades ago. For that reason, we rate Paul’s statement Mostly True. This rating was changed to Half True on Sept. 7, 2011.

pomt-06015	"In 2011, (Debbie) Wasserman Schultz missed 62 congressional votes — one of the worst records of any member of Congress."	/florida/statements/2012/jan/17/karen-harrington/harrington-says-wasserman-schultz-missed-62-congre/	Karen Harrington, a Republican setting her sights on the congressional seat held by Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, says the Congresswoman spends too much time hob-knobbing across the country and not enough time casting votes. Harrington has a "Where is Debbie?" post on her website that includes a map of the U.S. marking the states where Wasserman Schultz has visited. In Florida the map shows a sign reading "Debbie’s District abandoned." Harrington said Wasserman Schultz is "more concerned with headlining fundraisers for President (Barack) Obama and the DNC than she is with fulfilling the responsibilities owed to her constituents," adding, "In 2011, Wasserman Schultz missed 62 congressional votes — one of the worst records of a member of Congress." We decided to see for ourselves: How many votes did Wasserman Schultz miss in 2011, and how did she stack up with her peers? We soon discovered that the numbers add up quickly when you’re talking about 435 members of Congress and more than 900 votes. But a web team at the New York Times tracks congressional votes in an online database. The New York Times posted an analysis in October that showed nearly 20 members had missed more than 10 percent of the votes in 2011 -- mostly due to their own illness or that of a family member. Wasserman Schultz was not on that list. There were some not so-surprising names included. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot Jan. 8, missed the most. Presidential candidates Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Ron Paul, R-Texas, were also on the list. And Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., "might have been the first paternity leave for a gay member of Congress," the Times wrote. The article reflected about 814 votes -- not the full year. We contacted Derek Willis, a web developer at the New York Times, who shared internal data with us that showed 948 votes between January and Dec. 20, 2011. The votes are roll call votes and omit voice votes or unanimous consent. Willis told us in an e-mail that the voting data, which comes from the Clerk of the House, showed that Wasserman Schultz missed 62 votes, which equals 6.4 percent of all House votes in 2011. She tied for 45th among the top missers of votes in the House. The median was 17 missed votes or about 1.8 percent. The New York Times’ analysis showed that Wasserman Schultz didn’t top the Florida delegation for missed votes. Frederica Wilson, D-Miami, missed the most votes -- she ranked No. 11. Wilson had gallbladder surgery in October, according to the Miami Herald’s "Naked Politics" blog. Three other members of Florida’s Congressional delegation missed more than Wasserman Schultz: C.W. "Bill" Young, R-Indian Shores; Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami; and Kathy Castor, D-Tampa. Our ruling Harrington said, "In 2011, Wasserman Schultz missed 62 congressional votes — one of the worst records of any member of Congress." She’s right that Wasserman Schultz missed 62 votes. That means Wasserman Schultz is No. 45 among members who have missed votes, out of 435 sitting members, a fairly high ranking. On the other hand, she's not even the worst in the state and has a better voting record than four other members of the Florida delegation. So the record is mixed on whether she is "one of the worst."

pomt-00823	Says Gov. Scott Walker "has been rated America’s most factually-challenged politician."	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/has-scott-walker-been-rated-most-factually-challen/	The Wisconsin Democratic Party posted a statement on its website March 17, 2015 that criticizes Gov. Scott Walker's state budget proposal -- and claims Walker "has been rated America’s most factually-challenged politician." A belittling label, even coming from the opposing party, for a Republican who is formulating a 2016 run for the White House. Since we’re in the fact-checking business, we wondered what the party was using as its source. Turns out it's us. Flattering. But we’ve never done that kind of rating. And the party’s analysis has some big holes in it. Ratings The party’s statement links to a post on its website from October 2014. That earlier post cites a January 2014 article by PolitiFact National about the 10 most-fact-checked people on the Truth-O-Meter at the time. The article tallied all PolitiFact fact checks -- those done by PolitiFact National (since 2007), as well as PolitiFact Wisconsin (since 2010) and the other PolitiFact state operations. President Barack Obama topped the list, with 500 fact checks. Coming in ninth, with 85 fact checks, was Walker -- just behind Hillary Clinton and ahead of U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. The Democratic Party said that, based on the tallies, 54 percent of the 85 Walker statements had been rated Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire -- and that that percentage was higher than anyone else on the top 10 list. OK. But there are several problems with using our ratings to make the claim the party did. The first is obvious. The Democrats based their claim on only the top 10 list, which -- as one might expect -- was dominated by politicians who ran for president or were from states that had PolitiFact operations. That ignores all of the other office holders, former office holders and candidates around the country that PolitiFact has fact checked -- including more than 130 such politicians in Wisconsin alone. More importantly, we don't rate politicians in the way the Democratic Party's claim suggests. We don’t rate every single claim a person makes. Rather, we choose a statement based largely on whether it is interesting and timely, and we give it a rating based on our research and reporting. And those ratings apply to the individual statements. We don't make sweeping generalizations about a politician's overall facility with the facts. Some notes before we close. To date, PolitiFact has fact-checked 130 Walker statements. Just over 51 percent of them have been rated True, Mostly True or Half True; nearly 49 percent have been rated Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire. Meanwhile, we have previously rated 18 claims from the Wisconsin Democratic Party. One was rated True and one was rated Half True; the other 16 were rated Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire. A few days ago, PolitiFact National put in one snapshot a summary of the Truth-O-Meter records of Walker and nine other likely presidential candidates for 2016. Check it out. Our rating The state Democratic Party said Walker "has been rated America’s most factually-challenged politician." But the party misuses our data to claim we said something we never did. For a statement that is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim, our rating is Pants on Fire.

pomt-01287	Says Rick Scott "spent $800,000 of your tax dollars upgrading the Governor's Mansion."	/florida/statements/2014/oct/31/charlie-crist/crist-says-scott-spent-800k-governors-mansion-reno/	Florida gubernatorial candidates are now taking shots at each other’s wallets in campaign commercials, with Democratic challenger Charlie Crist working overtime to get voters to realize that millionaire Gov. Rick Scott is, in fact, a millionaire. "He flies on a private jet and owns an $11 million oceanfront home," an Oct. 24, 2014 ad says. "Rick Scott is used to the finer things. Maybe that's why he spent $800,000 of your tax dollars upgrading the Governor's Mansion." The commercial then repeats a lot of prior attacks about education spending. Meanwhile, we got to wondering whether Scott, who campaigned in 2010 on cutting government spending, spent $800,000 on his new home in Tallahassee after taking office. Ringing up the renovations As the basis for the claim, the Crist campaign sent us an Oct. 28, 2013, Associated Press story posted on CBS Miami’s website. That story said that more than $800,000 in renovations had occurred at the governor’s Greek Revival mansion at 700 N. Adams St. Those renovations included cleaning oriental rugs, refinishing wood floors, "new wallpaper, pillows, furniture, drapes, paint, window repairs, new screens for the swimming pool and an upgraded kitchen," the story read. According to the story, the state spent almost $3 million on the property during Gov. Jeb Bush’s eight years in office, although a third of that money was for security upgrades after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The story said that during Crist’s four-year term from 2007-2011, the state spent a bit more than $27,000. The AP later corrected this amount to almost $443,000. Of the $800,000 the AP said was spent during Scott’s term, almost $600,000 was taxpayer money that went to grounds upkeep, the story said. More than $200,000 more was donated to the Governor’s Mansion Foundation by U.S. Sugar, Florida Crystals and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida. There were also $20,000 in gifts from lobbyist Brian Ballard, Scott adviser Tony Fabrizio and the CEO of a private prison company, George Zoley. That private money was used to pay for things like $38,000 in new rugs and $2,000 for a new mirror for First Lady Ann Scott, who had been an interior designer, the AP story said. For this fact-check, we won’t look at private donations, because Crist said "your tax dollars." The Scott campaign said the mansion has routinely been funded by both public and private money, and that the public money involved was used according to state law. It paid for things like code compliance in the kitchen, repairing safety hazards in public areas, electrical upgrades and plumbing repairs, spokesman Greg Blair said. We checked in with the Department of Management Services, the agency that handles expenses for upkeep. Spokesman Ben Wolf told us that the DMS has a budget for mansion projects, and periodic fixes are needed. He declined to be more specific for us. He did give us totals for renovations, maintenance and purchases made for the mansion’s improvements using public money, but we found some numbers were a bit different than what the AP reported in 2013. From January 1999 to December 2006, Jeb Bush’s terms in office, the total was $2.87 million, including post-Sept. 11 security upgrades such as buying surrounding property and putting up barriers. The total from Crist’s term, January 2007 to December 2010, was almost $443,000, including almost $254,000 for heating and cooling ductwork and $102,000 for the design and installation of a "fuel cell" designed to cut emissions and power use. Adding in miscellaneous purchases like tools, supplies, building materials, freight and so on, the total went up to almost $628,000. As for Scott, the DMS disclosure said a little more than $499,000 had been spent for the things Blair claimed. Although that measured more than just 2011, that year is when the bulk of the expenses were incurred. (We’ll also note that more than $10,000 in tax money was spent on cabana repairs.) Add in other expenditures, as we did with Crist and Bush, and the grand total from January 2011 to the present is almost $745,000. In 2013, the Department of Management Services said the agency had reviewed the mansion and decided it needed some freshening, without Scott’s input. Scott’s office said then that neither the governor nor the first lady asked for the changes, but the AP reported that May 2011 meeting minutes from a Governor’s Mansion Committee gathering showed Ann Scott had mentioned the house’s condition. "It’s important to me to maintain its beauty and showcase its history, making the mansion a welcome destination for all guests," she said. We also tried contacting mansion curator Carol Beck several times, but never heard back. She was quoted in the AP story as saying Department of Management Services officials "have been exceptionally proactive in addressing concerns of the first lady and myself as it relates to the current condition of the interior and exterior of the mansion proper, as well as the grounds." This wasn’t the only time spending on the manse has been an issue. In 2011 and 2012, staffers were instructed to use private phone lines and email accounts while working to find about $5 million in public and private money to buy commercial property around the mansion and turn it into a public space. Our ruling Crist said Scott "spent $800,000 of your tax dollars upgrading the Governor's Mansion." When we checked with the agency in charge what the totals were, it said almost $745,000 in taxpayer money had been spent during Scott’s term. So the amount of tax money spent on renovations at the mansion is close. However, the ad is trying to make it sound like Scott was being wasteful, and that's not as clear. The Crist and Bush administrations also spent large sums on expensive renovations, and the money doesn't appear to have come from a direct request from Scott (although the Scotts did accept donations to spruce up the mansion). We rate the statement Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-10-31T11:29:41	2014-10-24	['None']

pomt-12831	"Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California."	/california/statements/2017/feb/08/chad-mayes/claim-california-lawmakers-cant-afford-housing-dis/	Is housing in California so expensive that even state lawmakers are priced out? That’s the claim from Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes. "Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California," Mayes, who represents parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, said at a forum hosted by the Public Policy Institute of California on Jan. 17, 2017. Assemblyman Chad Mayes makes his claim at about the 11:30 minute mark in this video. The forum offered legislative leaders a chance to speak about their top priorities. Mayes said reducing the state’s housing costs and its high share of poverty are among his top goals. There’s no doubt California is an expensive place to live. And its housing market has experienced a strong rebound following the Great Recession. But is it fair to say California’s state lawmakers — who receive the highest base salary of any state legislators in the country at $104,000 — can’t afford a home in the Golden State? We set out on a fact check. Our research Several economists pointed us to the California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index. It lists California’s median priced single-family home at $515,940, noting the minimum qualifying income to reasonably afford that home is $100,290. For condos, the median price is $418,230 with a minimum qualifying income of $81,290. All figures are based on home sales data from the third quarter in 2016, the most recent period available. SOURCE: California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index. As a comparison, Zillow.com lists the median home value in California at $485,800, through December 31, 2016. On the realtors index, the qualifying income figures assume homebuyers spend no more than one-third of their income on housing, make a 20 percent down payment, and pay the national average interest rate, plus principal, interest, property tax and homeowner’s insurance. Based on their salaries, and the supplemental pay lawmakers receive, it’s clear California state lawmakers can afford the state’s median single-family home or condo, and less expensive homes. Notably, California’s state lawmakers receive up to $35,000 per year in per diem to cover their costs while working in Sacramento, including housing. Their flights to and from their districts are also paid by the state. High coastal costs When we asked Mayes’ office for evidence to back up his claim, his spokesman Matt Mahon told us the assemblyman is correct if we consider the cost "to buy a home in a number of California cities." That’s different from Mayes’ blanket statement that "Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California." But, for some context, we decided to examine the range of home costs in the state. The realtors association index places a median priced single family home in the San Francisco Bay Area at $785,980 with a corresponding minimum qualifying income at $152,780. In San Diego, those figures are $589,260 and $114,540, respectively. Prices in other coastal cities, from Santa Cruz to Santa Barbara to Ventura, are also considerably higher than the median. State lawmakers, assuming they earned close to base pay, were the sole income earners in their household and had no additional sources of income, would find fewer affordable homes in these markets. "It just depends on where they come from. Maybe in the big cities they would struggle," said Anna Scherbina, an associate professor at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management, who studies investment management and behavioral finance. "If Mayes wants to buy a home in Santa Barbara or San Mateo then, yes, he will have some problems. But if he's looking to buy in Bakersfield, the Central Valley, or South Sacramento, he's not going to have too much of a problem," added Jesus Hernandez, who lectures at the UC Davis sociology department and has written about housing. "Mayes is trying to make a point that housing prices are sky high again making it difficult for even middle class folks to buy. And he does have a valid concern." Members of the California State Assembly take the oath of office. File photo / Capital Public Radio Prices away from the coast Taking another look at the realtors’ index, they show the median price of a single family home in Bakersfield was $224,670, with a minimum qualifying income of $43,670. For Sacramento, the median price was $327,040 with a minimum income of $63,570. In the Inland Empire, which includes much of Mayes’ district, the median price was $318,960 which requires a minimum salary of $62,000. State lawmaker salaries are on the high-end, not just for lawmakers across the country, but for anyone in California. The state’s median household income was $61,818 in 2015 dollars, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Through the third quarter of 2016, just 31 percent of homebuyers in California could afford to purchase the state’s median-priced single family home, according to the realtors’ index. It was the 14th consecutive quarter that the index has been below 40 percent. In addition to their state salaries, many legislators collect income from the small businesses they own, from stocks and rental properties, according to a check of their statements of economic interests. Many also list household income generated by their spouses. Our ruling Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes recently claimed: "Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California." Mayes has a point when considering some of California’s priciest coastal cities. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, it would take a minimum salary of $152,000 to afford a median priced single family home, well above the $104,000 base pay for state legislators. But Mayes did not make this qualification. Instead, he declared legislators in general can’t afford California homes. Based on data from the California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index, that’s just not the case. At $515,000, California’s median priced single family home is expensive. But the salary to reasonably afford that home is $100,290, less than a legislator’s base pay. Many, though not necessarily all, lawmakers have other sources of income including the income of a spouse, or from owning a small business, that would increase their purchasing power. Mayes’ statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13525	The Clinton Foundation "took steps that went above and beyond all legal requirements and, indeed, all standard requirements followed by every other charitable organization."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/31/hillary-clinton/did-clinton-foundation-go-above-and-beyond-transpa/	Hillary Clinton dismissed criticism of the Clinton Foundation for creating the appearance of conflicts of interest for the State Department she led, arguing that the nonprofit has actually been more transparent and ethical than was required. CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Clinton Aug. 24 about Donald Trump’s charge that she "sold favors and access" in exchange for donations to the foundation and why Bill Clinton would leave the foundation only if Hillary Clinton became president. Clinton responded that Trump is "ridiculous." "In 2009, (the foundation) took steps that went above and beyond all legal requirements and, indeed, all standard requirements followed by every other charitable organization, voluntarily disclosing donors, significantly reducing sources of funding, even to the point of, you know, of those funding being involved in providing medication to treat HIV/AIDS," Clinton said. Clinton’s family, campaign and supporters have used similar defenses lately, often calling the Clinton Foundation’s disclosure agreements "unprecedented" and pointing out that charities associated with the Bush presidents didn’t have to abide by the same standards. Just how accurate is this talking point? Clinton is right that the foundation bearing her family name has done more than what is required of charities by law. But the requirements are rather basic to begin with, and other nonprofits, including those tied to presidential candidates and presidents, have been similarly forthcoming. Clearing a low bar The Clinton Foundation, as part of an ethics agreement with the Obama administration, promised to publish the names of all of its donors, roll back Bill Clinton’s involvement in fundraising, and stop accepting donations to the Clinton Global Initiative from foreign governments, among other pledges. The foundation only began to do that in 2008, as a condition of Clinton’s confirmation as secretary of state in order to preempt conflicts of interest (and it hasn’t always lived up to that ethics agreement). Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, pointed out that the Clinton Foundation continued disclosing donors after Clinton left office even though it was "under no obligation to do so." None of what the foundation agreed to do — disclosing donor identities, limiting an official’s role, or not taking foreign donations — is required by tax law. The law doesn’t actually require much from nonprofits like the foundation. "The legal requirements are so absolutely minimal that it’s like saying, ‘No, I haven’t shot anyone today, so you should be grateful,’ " said Daniel Schuman, policy director for Demand Progress, a progressive advocacy group focused on civil liberties and government transparency. Suzanne Friday, legal counsel to the nonpartisan Council on Foundations, agreed that the laws are "basic." Many nonprofits are volunteering a lot more information than what’s required, she said. "Anyone who is more putting more information on their website or wherever goes above and beyond the law," Friday said. Tax-exempt organizations or 501(c)(3) groups only have to reveal a few bits of information to the public when requested. The requestable tax documents can include the last three years of a group’s Form 990, which gives an overview of the organization’s activities, leadership and finances. More specific requirements vary by state and also depend on whether an organization is a private foundation or public charity. Confusingly, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity, not a private foundation, even though it has the word "foundation" in its name. Private foundations (for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) are typically controlled by one person, one family or one corporation and have just a few funding sources. In addition to Form 990, they have to disclose their donors upon request of the public. (This is how we know, for example, that World Wrestling Entertainment gave $1 million to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 2009.) The requirements are less stringent for public charities, which includes schools and churches but also organizations with many funding sources — like the Clinton Foundation. They don’t have to disclose their donors, even if requested, but they do have to prove to the IRS that a third of their revenue comes from fundraising. So the Clinton Foundation is not required by law to disclose its donors, as it does on its contributors page, and most other nonprofits don’t give this information, said David Callahan, editor-in-chief of Inside Philanthropy. (Friday of the Council on Foundations said this is to protect donor privacy.) Minassian referred us to the Clinton Foundation's Charity Navigator rating of four stars out of four stars and a 93 out of 100 in accountability and transparency. The Clinton Foundation, however, is not the only charity disclosing its donors on a website. The Wikimedia Foundation, the Sunlight Foundation, the Center for Global Development and the Center for Strategic and International Studies are are all examples of public nonprofits that voluntarily disclose donors. Many nonprofits like Oxfam and the World Resources Institute publish annual reports that include more comprehensive donor rolls on their websites, said Friday. The Clinton Foundation does not do this. ‘The wild west’ of presidential foundations There are about 1.1 million public charities like the Clinton Foundation, but only a handful are linked to presidents and presidential candidates. Experts told us the Clinton Foundation is among the most transparent in this group of charities, which, for the most part, are foundations associated with presidential libraries. (The Clinton Foundation was initially focused on Bill Clinton’s library and evolved into the organization it is today.) Anthony Clark, author of a book on presidential libraries called The Last Campaign, told us the presidential library foundations follow basic disclosure laws and therefore are notoriously opaque. He agreed with that the Clinton Foundation’s transparency was "unprecedented." "It’s the wild west," he said. "Before 2008, the closest we came to learning the donors was a donor wall with major donors engraved in granite or a bronze plaque." Here are two charts detailing the disclosure and finances of charities related to presidential candidates and presidents: The asset and fundraising amounts reflect the most recent public filings available for each foundation. For a more detailed list with links to sources and information on the private family foundations of presidents and presidential candidates, click here. *Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave two Pinocchios to 2008 GOP nominee John McCain’s claim that he’s unaffiliated with the nonprofit that bears his name. **The Carter Center is the only presidential foundation listed here not associated with a presidential library. ***We did not include the Heinz Endowments, chaired by 2008 presidential candidate and current Secretary of State John Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz. Though it has significant assets ($1.6 billion), it has no donors. As the chart shows, the Clinton Foundation discloses more information than the other presidential foundations. It also fundraises significantly more. For that and a few more reasons — such as the fact that Clinton has served as secretary of state and is running for president — experts told us, it belongs in a category of its own. "The sheer scope and size of the Clinton Foundation is also unprecedented and warrants extra measures to guard against conflicts of interest," said Craig Holman of the government accountability group Public Citizen. Schuman of Demand Progress also brought up Marc Rich, a former fugitive and Clinton Foundation donor pardoned by Bill Clinton on his last day in office, as a conflict of interest issue that preceded the "above and beyond" disclosure steps. Hillary Clinton "doesn’t seem to be meeting her own standards either," said Schuman, referring to unsuccessful legislation she cosponsored in the Senate on disclosing gifts to presidential foundations in 2001. The Clinton campaign specifically forwarded us reports about George W. Bush's continued involvement in his father’s foundation while he was president. We also found reports of Bush foundations taking foreign donations during that time. Experts agreed that more scrutiny should have been placed on the Bush family, but the situations are somewhat different. "Adult children aren’t tied financially and otherwise to their parents the way one’s spouse is tied to another spouse, "said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor who specializes in government ethics. " ‘Hey, they did it too’ — it’s not quite as juvenile as that, but it’s not a particularly persuasive argument." "The Bush foundations did not raise comparable amounts of money and from as many foreign sources as the Clinton Foundation," said Holman of Public Citizen. In contrast to the Bush organizations, three other public nonprofits tied to presidents and presidential hopefuls have been rather forthcoming, though they don't disclose all their donors as the Clinton Foundation does. This election cycle, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush disclosed the vast majority of donors to his Foundation for Excellence in Education early in his campaign, and the foundation subsequently published their names on its website. Bush, who started the think tank in 2008 after his tenure as Florida governor, also stepped down as its chairman when he began to seriously consider running for president in early 2015. Jimmy Carter’s nonprofit is perhaps the most similar to the Clinton Foundation with its focus on international work in human rights, poverty and disease. (Most other presidential foundations function as political think tanks advancing the ideology of its president or as education shops promoting and preserving his legacy, Clark said.) The Carter Center has been disclosing its donors every year in annual reports since 1982, when it was founded. It does, however, take anonymous donations. And then there’s Barack Obama, whose presidential library foundation also lists its contributors who've donated more than $200 and publishes its financial documents. Plus, Schuman added, "He did it without being under duress." Our ruling Clinton said the Clinton Foundation "took steps that went above and beyond all legal requirements and, indeed, all standard requirements followed by every other charitable organization." The law does not require the Clinton Foundation to disclose donors or roll back foreign donations, but the disclosure requirements are rather minimal to begin with. It’s important to note that the Clinton Foundation, already unique in its size, function and relationship to two presidential figures, agreed to take these steps only when Clinton was nominated as secretary of state. Among presidents and presidential candidates, foundations affiliated with Jeb Bush, Obama and Carter have all been forthcoming about their donations and finances.

pomt-06573	Says President Barack Obama failed "to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions of the Simpson-Bowles Commission."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-barack-obama-failed-stand-prop/	With Republicans across the country clamoring for Gov. Chris Christie to run for president, the governor on Tuesday cited various reasons why the administration of President Barack Obama has been a failure. One example is how the president failed to back up the recommendations of his own deficit reduction commission, Christie said in a high-profile speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. "Because each and every time the president lets a moment to act pass him by, his failure is our failure too," Christie said. "The failure to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions of the Simpson-Bowles Commission, a report the president asked for himself." PolitiFact New Jersey investigated whether Obama failed to "stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions of the Simpson-Bowles Commission," and found that Christie is not entirely right. The president did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations at the outset, but Obama later outlined deficit reduction measures similar to those proposed by the commission. Even the commission’s co-chairs -- former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles under President Bill Clinton, and former Republican U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson -- have said so. "We are encouraged that the President has embraced a balanced, comprehensive approach to deficit reduction similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Commission report," Bowles and Simpson said in an April 13 press release. Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts argued that the statement from Bowles and Simpson show "that they praise a similar approach – which isn’t the same as saying he has supported their recommendations." "To date, the President has not endorsed the recommendations as proposed by his own commission," Roberts said in an email. Now, let’s explain the commission’s history and Obama’s responses to its proposals. Obama established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in February 2010. The president asked the bipartisan panel to recommend measures that would address the nation’s debt problem. In December, the commission released its final report, which included dozens of proposals to cut discretionary spending, reform the tax code and Social Security and rein in health care costs, among other measures. According to a previous ruling from PolitiFact National, Obama later proposed deficit reduction measures similar to those recommended by the commission. Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us Obama’s deficit reduction plan from April incorporated many of the broad principles of the commission’s recommendations, but was mostly devoid of specifics. Obama has fleshed out some of those broad principles in a deficit reduction plan unveiled earlier this month, according to Peuquet. Referring to Christie’s statement, Peuquet said: "It seems to not quite give the president enough credit for things he’s done recently." Alice Rivlin, a member of the commission and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under Clinton, said she was disappointed that the president didn't endorse the commission's recommendations immediately, but agreed that Obama later embraced some of its proposals. A former policy adviser to Clinton said Obama has "approached the report very carefully." "He’s kept it at arms’ length," said Bill Galston, now a senior fellow at Brookings. Obama is "not exactly rejecting it," Galston said, but "not exactly embracing it either." During negotiations over raising the debt ceiling, Obama didn't offer exactly the proposals in the commission's report, but "he went much of the way there," said Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Chris Edwards, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s a fair assessment that Obama did nothing with the commission’s report, but said the president has another opportunity to implement recommendations when introducing the federal budget in February. Edwards noted that the commission’s report contained some politically unpopular moves that might explain why Obama didn’t pursue some of the recommendations, such as raising the Social Security retirement age. Our ruling Christie claimed Obama has failed to stand up for the solutions proposed by his own deficit reduction commission. It is true that the president did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations in the immediate months following its December report. But since then, Obama has outlined deficit reduction measures similar to the commission’s recommendations. That’s why the governor is wrong to imply that Obama has done nothing with the commission’s proposals. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02559	"Since I took office in January 2011, we have created 11,100 Rhode Island-based jobs."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/feb/02/lincoln-chafee/ri-gov-lincoln-chafee-says-his-administration-crea/	In his Jan. 15 State of the State address, Governor Lincoln Chafee noted that while the state’s economy still has a way to go to recover from the collapse of 2008, economic indicators such as the unemployment rate and the number of people working had moved "in the right direction." It’s easy to lose sight of the progress, he said, but the signs are there. He cited one statistic in particular. "Since I took office in January 2011," he said, "we have created 11,100 Rhode Island-based jobs." At the time he gave his speech, the state’s unemployment rate was 9 percent, tied with Nevada for worst in the nation. So we decided to check his numbers. The 11,100 figure was derived from statistics compiled by the state Department of Labor and Training. Donna A. Murray, the department’s assistant director of labor market information, said it came from subtracting the January 2011 Rhode Island jobs number - 459,500 - from the November 2013 number - 470,600. She qualified it somewhat by noting that the November 2013 figure is an estimate that will be refined later this year when the state has a chance to review all Rhode Island employers’ unemployment insurance filings. So the jobs number was correct. How about the "we created" part? Determining how much credit a political leader should get when jobs numbers go up -- or down -- can be tricky. Generally, they’re influenced far more by national economic trends than anything a mayor or governor does. During the period Chafee cites, the national jobs number went from about 139.3 million to 143.2 million, a gain of around 2.8 percent, while Rhode Island’s increase was about 2.4 percent. Did the number of jobs in the state increase because of efforts by the Chafee administration or because of the slow but steady improvements in the national economy? When we examined Cranston Mayor Allan Fung’s claim that his administration created more than 1,000 jobs in the city, Fung provided a spreadsheet of 37 companies that had been directly helped by the city. We checked with officials of some of those companies, who confirmed the city’s help, leading us to rule Fung’s claim Mostly True. We asked the Chafee administration for such specific examples. Spokeswoman Faye Zuckerman didn’t have a similar position-by-position count showing how the administration’s help create specific jobs. Instead, she pointed to Chafee’s Workforce Board, which spent about $10 million in 2013 on training and education programs on its own and in cooperation with hundreds of employers in the state. She also noted Chafee’s efforts to increase state aid to public schools, arguing that better-educated graduates would be better able to get jobs. Then we asked Edinaldo Tebaldi, assistant professor of economics at Bryant University, for guidance. Internal economic policies can have an effect on jobs, he said. But because Rhode Island’s economy is relatively small compared with the rest of New England, it is more sensitive to regional and national trends. Tebaldi said all politicians like to claim credit for job growth but it’s hard to tell how much they drove it and how much was floated by a tide that was coming in anyway. "It’s really impossible to quantify," Tebaldi said. "We know they have made a contribution, but we don’t know how much." Our ruling Governor Chafee said "we have created 11,100 Rhode Island-based jobs" since January 2011. The number of jobs added in that period is correct. But the gains came at the same time the national economy was improving. The Chafee administration provided no direct evidence that its actions led to any of those jobs. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-07703	Says Sheldon Whitehouse said on Senate floor: "Everybody in Rhode Island who disagrees with me about Obamacare is an Aryan, is a white supremacist."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/06/kenneth-mckay/mckay-says-sen-whitehouse-said-senate-floor-everyb/	It looked like the 2012 election season was getting under way when Republican Kenneth V. McKay IV was interviewed Feb. 27 on the ABC6 news show "On the Record." McKay, former chief of staff for ex-Gov. Donald Carcieri, and then for the Republican National Committee, is running for the state Republican chairmanship. At one point, the conversation turned to the possibility of either McKay or Carcieri challenging Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse if he runs for reelection next year. "Let’s take a look at the record," McKay said of Whitehouse. "This is a guy who stood up in front of the U.S. Senate and said, ‘Everybody in Rhode Island who disagrees with me about Obamacare is an Aryan, is a white supremacist.’" We remembered Whitehouse making a passionate -- some said inflammatory -- Senate speech in 2009 about the decline in civility in politics. But we didn’t remember him castigating every Rhode Islander who opposed President Obama’s health care plan. We asked McKay for his source and he referred us to the 20-minute speech we remembered, which Whitehouse delivered Dec. 20, 2009, during the health care debate. It was a speech that lit up the blogosphere. Democrats and progressives called it historic and brilliant. Conservatives called it outrageous. One called it a lunatic rant. McKay drew our attention to one paragraph that he called "the relevant part." Here it is: "And why? Why all this discord and discourtesy, all this unprecedented, destructive action? All to break the momentum of our new, young President. They are desperate to break this President. They have ardent supporters who are nearly hysterical at the very election of President Barack Obama: the ‘birthers,’ the fanatics, the people running around in right-wing militias and Aryan support groups. It is unbearable to them that President Barack Obama should exist. That is one powerful reason." McKay wrote that when you read or hear the entire speech, you understand that Whitehouse is talking about Republicans in the Senate and their supporters in the fight against health care. Then he reasoned that Whitehouse was suggesting that "anyone in Rhode Island who is an ardent supporter of the fight against Obamacare are (sic) ‘nearly hysterical . . . the ‘birthers,’ the fanatics, the people running around in right wing militias, and Aryan support groups." We read the speech and disagree on several counts. First, Whitehouse was excoriating Republican senators, not Rhode Islanders. In fact, he said nothing about Rhode Island in the entire speech. Second, despite his strident language, nowhere in the speech did he come close to saying that everyone who disagreed with the health care plan is an Aryan or a white supremacist. He accused his Republican colleagues of engaging in a campaign of obstruction and delay "affecting every single aspect of the Senate’s business.’ He said they engaged in a "campaign of falsehoods: about death panels, and cuts to Medicare benefits, and benefits for illegal aliens and bureaucrats to be parachuted in between you and your doctor." And he accused the GOP senators of voting against funding for soldiers, as another tactic to stall the health care vote. But in the paragraph McKay cites, it’s clear that Whitehouse was criticizing fringe groups who are "nearly hysterical at the very election of President Barack Obama" not just opponents of the president’s health care plan. In suggesting that Whitehouse labeled all opponents of the health care plan Aryans and white supremacists, McKay seriously distorted the senator’s speech. His further suggestion that, by extension, Whitehouse was applying the label to Rhode Islanders who disagreed with the president, is even more of a distortion. Pants on Fire.

pomt-00962	Ninety-six percent of failing schools are spending above $8,400, the average annual per student expenditure, and 26 percent spend considerably more than that.	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/17/nathan-deal/gov-deal-gets-school-math-right-comments-need-more/	Gov. Nathan Deal’s signature education legislation this year calls for a constitutional amendment to create a special school district solely for perennially failing schools. Deal’s office says 141 schools -- more than 60 in metro Atlanta -- currently could land in the proposed district and under state control, having each scored 60 or below for three straight years on Georgia’s annual report card, the College and Career Performance Index (CCRPI). The state would have unprecedented powers in the "opportunity school district." It could run schools, close them, partner with local school districts to operate them or turn them into charter schools. The superintendent of the district would report directly to the governor. Deal acknowledges that it’s a dramatic step and in an interview on Feb. 12 dashed off some statistics to counter those who would say more money is the answer. "I would say to them that 96 percent of those (failing schools) pay more than the average of the state of $8,400 per child per year, and about 26 percent of them spend considerably more than the state average," the governor said. "If they say that money alone will fix this, then the statistics and the information that we have does not bear that out." We wondered if the vast majority of these failing schools are, as the governor said, spending more money per student than the average school. We decided to check the governor’s math. First, a little background. Deal’s proposal would require approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly and would be put before voters in 2016. It would broaden the governor’s powers over K-12 education. Those powers already include the ability to remove dysfunctional local school boards. Some lawmakers and local school superintendents are against creation of a special school district for failing schools. Critics say that approach creates a one-size-fits-all solution for some very complex problems and fails to recognize how those challenges have been compounded by years of underfunding from the state. At least one metro school superintendent has suggested that districts with large percentages of low-income students be given more money when the state’s education funding formula is revamped at Deal’s direction in the next year. Luvenia Jackson, superintendent of Clayton County Schools, said she "applauds the governor for wanting to do more. "But I don’t know if this is the answer," Jackson said. Clayton has three of the failing schools and is a federal Title I school system due to of its overall high poverty rate. "How about restoring some of those (budget) cuts and see what happens," said Jackson, who estimates the district has been underfunded $100 million by the state in the past five years. "Most of our children come in with a level of readiness below what is required. They need more health care, more counselors, things that must be taken into consideration. We have to nourish the whole child." Robert Avossa, superintendent of Fulton County Schools, said the governor "is correct to stand up for these communities and shine a bright light" on the problem of failing schools. Fulton, one of the state’s wealthiest counties, has already started working to bring additional support and resources to its seven failing schools, all located in areas with a multitude of problems, including high mobility, poverty, unemployment and crime, Avossa said. Through a public-private partnership, the school system raised enough money to offer $20,000 bonuses to recruit 15 experienced and talented teachers to three of the schools this year, he said. "This is a people problem more than it’s a money problem," Avossa said. "We need flexibility on how we spend our salary dollars to keep the best in the lowest performing schools." Almost all of the state’s failing schools qualify for Title I federal money because of their high percentages of students from low-income families. Millions more from the state’s Race to the Top grant have targeted failing schools in the past five years. These schools are a tiny share of Georgia’s 2,267 public schools: 1,321 elementary schools, 480 middle schools and 453 high schools according to the state Department of Education. Now to the math Jen Talaber, a Deal spokeswoman, said the governor based his statement on a comparison of a list of the failing schools and a report from the state Department of Education on per pupil spending by district. Information on per pupil spending at the school level is not collected by the state, she said. "Our operating assumption, because of those data limitations, was that the district per pupil expenditure would apply to the school," Talaber said. "That may not be the case in every district, and we have consistently provided that clarification in all of our conversations." Ben Scafidi, a nationally recognized expert on the economics of education and a professor of economics at Kennesaw State University, and PolitiFact both independently confirmed that Deal is correct: 96 percent of the schools with three consecutive years of sub-60 CCRPI scores spend above the state average per student expenditure, identified in the DOE report as $8,400. PolitiFact’s analysis also showed 37 schools with a per pupil expenditure above $10,000, which could fit the governor’s definition of schools spending well above the state average. Scafidi pointed out: :"We cannot say whether schools with more low income or minority students spend more or less than other schools within their districts." The reasons, he said, are three-fold: veteran teachers who are higher paid are usually in schools with more white students and fewer lower income students; federal compensatory programs target funds to individual schools with larger portions of low income students; and federal and state programs target funds to special needs students. Our conclusion; Gov. Nathan Deal is pushing a constitutional amendment to create an "opportunity school district" that would give his office and the state broad powers over failing schools. Last week, the governor cited statistics indicating that 96 percent of the failing schools spend more per student than the state average and 26 percent spend well above the state’s average per student expenditure of $8,400. His statement is accurate and relies on student spending per district in the absence of actual school-level data. His statement doesn’t point out that the failing schools are likely spending more money because they are receiving more money as a result of having high concentrations of students from low-income families. It could be argued that the money they receive and spend isn’t working -- afterall, they are failing schools by the state’s current measure of success, the CCRPI index. Or it could be said that they need more money or a different kind of help, or both. That’s important context in a discussion of what those closest to the ground -- the educators -- say is a very complex problem. For that reason, we rate the governor’s statement Half True.

pomt-10481	The United States is "seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/barack-obama/income-inequality-is-on-the-rise/	At the Democratic debate in Philadelphia, Barack Obama made a case that working families need more help because they're facing harder economic times. "We're seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s," Obama said. Obama is making a broad point here, but several sources support him. The U.S. Census compiles data on income distribution on a year-to-year basis. Since 1967, it's clear that the top 5 percent of all households are capturing a growing share of the nation's aggregate income. From 1917 to 1998, the income share of the top 10 percent dropped and then began rising again, following a U-shaped curve, according to a historical analysis of U.S. tax returns by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez published in 2003 in the Quarterly Journal of Economics . Piketty and Saez found that economic inequality grew further by 2005. That year, the top 1 percent of Americans — people with incomes of more than $348,000 — received their largest share of national income since 1928. Critics may argue whether this change in income distribution is significant or not, or what it's underlying causes are. Earlier in this campaign, Hillary Clinton argued that George W. Bush was to blame, a statement we found only Half-True . But the numbers show that income inequality is at a record high since the 1920s, so we find Obama's statement to be True.

pomt-08806	Pam Bondi "refuses to take a position on the gay-adoption ban."	/florida/statements/2010/aug/17/john-stemberger/ag-candidate-pam-bondis-stance-gay-adoption-under-/	As the Republican primary inches closer, the three Republican candidates running for attorney general -- Holly Benson, Pam Bondi and Jeff Kottkamp -- are trying to establish themselves as the conservative candidate of choice. One big question keeps coming up in forum after forum -- where does each candidate stand on Florida’s gay-adoption ban? So far, all the candidates say that they would follow through on a lawsuit filed by current Attorney General Bill McCollum defending the state’s gay adoption ban. The state’s challenge comes after a Miami judge in 2008 ruled the state’s law unconstitutional, following a lawsuit by a North Miami man who wanted to adopt two foster children cared for by him and his partner. While all the candidates have voiced their opposition to gay adoption, social conservative John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, is not convinced that Bondi, a former prosecutor with the State Attorney’s Office in Tampa, has established a strong enough stance in favor of the adoption ban. On Aug. 8, 2010, Stemberger dispatched an endorsement letter supporting Kottkamp, stating that Bondi "refuses to take a position on the gay adoption ban." We decided to check out Stemberger’s claim. Going straight to the source, we asked Bondi her position on the issue and she responded with an e-mail stating: "As Florida’s next attorney general, I will vigorously defend Florida’s law banning gay adoption in our state. As a veteran prosecutor who has spent her entire career upholding the laws of this state, I have the training and experience necessary to successfully defend our laws in a courtroom." Checking back on newspaper reports of earlier candidate forums and events featuring Bondi, it’s worth noting that earlier in her campaign, she was vague in outright declaring a position. During a June 4 forum in St. Petersburg, when asked about upholding McCollum’s challenge, both Benson and Kottkamp said they would. Bondi said, "Our judiciary will make a fair and just decision regarding that case." Earlier, at a May 18 appearance in Miami Lakes, Bondi was quoted by the St. Petersburg Times as mentioning two gay friends and noting that the adoption process needed reform. "I have friends in Tampa who are in law enforcement who have adopted from overseas, who are in a loving, committed same-sex relationship." Still, calling for an overhaul of the adoption process and clearly specifying whether or not gays should be entitled to adoption are two different things. Bondi, a legal analyst for Fox News, began to clarify her support for the gay adoption ban in subsequent forums and newspaper interviews. When asked by the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald in a June 5 interview whether she would follow through on McCollum’s appeal, she responded: "I will continue with General McCollum’s appeal. If [the Supreme Court] can legally hear it, yes, I will appeal." At an Aug. 7 forum sponsored by the Christian Family Coalition, Bondi pledged to oppose gay adoption. Bondi campaign spokesman Kim Kirtley also pointed to interviews with the editorial boards of the St. Petersburg Times on July 14 and the Sun-Sentinel on Aug. 10 where she was asked about her position on gay adoption and she stated her support for the ban. Both papers have handed Bondi an endorsement. So back to the question. Did Bondi "refuse to take a position on banning gay adoptions"? No. She hedged at first, but she’s made it clear since then that she will pursue the appeal and opposes gay adoption. Therefore we rate his claim False.

pomt-11851	"Eight in 10 people this year can find plans for $75 a month or less."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/barack-obama/can-eight-10-people-get-health-coverage-under-75-n/	Get America Covered, an organization founded by former health officials under the Obama administration, is running an enthusiastic albeit misleading campaign to get people to sign up for health care. On Nov. 1, the first day of open enrollment, the group released a video on Twitter featuring former President Barack Obama talking about HealthCare.gov, a portal to enroll in the marketplace exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act. "It only takes a few minutes and the vast majority of people qualify for financial assistance," Obama says. "Eight in 10 people this year can find plans for $75 a month or less." Can 8 in 10 people get health coverage for $75 a month or less? It depends on who those 10 people are. The statistic only refers to people currently enrolled in HealthCare.gov. That’s not most Americans. Only 3.7 percent of Americans under the age of 65 are enrolled in the marketplace exchanges. So 80 percent of that sliver can find plans for under $75. "The entire video is about HealthCare.gov, and not off-marketplace plans, which is made clear throughout the video," said co-founder Lori Lodes, a former Medicare and Medicaid Services communications director. But that may not be so clear to the average viewer. The bulk of Americans under the age of 65 are getting health care through their employers, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Generally speaking, those people either aren’t permitted or wouldn’t want to shop on the marketplaces. About seven percent of Americans under 65 are purchasing health care individually, on or off the exchanges. But about 6 million Americans don’t bother going through the marketplace because they make too much money to qualify for subsidies. If they, too, were considered, the 8 in 10 figure might look a lot different, according to Chris Sloan, a senior manager at the health care consulting firm Avalere. With subsidies as the biggest incentive to enroll in the marketplace, the HealthCare.gov population is pretty self-selecting. Avalere found that participation in the exchanges declines dramatically as incomes increase and subsidy eligibility decreases. Over 80 percent of eligible individuals with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level enrolled in the exchanges, while only 2 percent of eligible individuals with incomes above 400 percent of the FPL enrolled. (Subsidies are available, with exceptions, to individuals between 100 and 400 percent FPL.) But in the absence of statistics on HealthCare.gov visitors, the 8-in-10 figure is the only data point available to those wondering about their eligibility for low-cost plans within the marketplace. What’s more, the website also helps enroll people who might not have otherwise known they were eligible for other government programs. "The share of people who use Healthcare.gov that actually end up in some form of coverage that gets assistance if you include Medicaid and CHIP is probably even higher," said Matt Buettgens, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the left-leaning Urban Institute. The report found that HealthCare.gov enrollees able to pay $75 or less for health insurance is up by 9 percentage points from last year, and 8 percentage points from 2015. That’s in large part an effect of the Trump administration’s decision not to reimburse insurers for cost-sharing reductions. The uncertainty of those reimbursements drove up premiums on the silver plans used to calculate the tax credits enrollees receive, so anyone eligible for a premium tax credit gained access to more funds. Access to $75-or-less plans depends on whether enrollees stay on their current plan. Sixty percent would qualify for plans $75 or less if they continued to get the same coverage as last year, whereas 80 percent would qualify if they switched. That doesn’t necessarily entail a downgrade. Avalere found that people between 100 and 150 percent of FPL qualified for free Bronze plans in 98 percent of counties, while 10 percent qualified for the more generous gold plans for free. Our ruling Obama said, "Eight in 10 people this year can find plans for $75 a month or less." The video was only talking about an average of 80 percent of less than 3.7 percent of the American population, or the people currently enrolled on HealthCare.gov. This is already a highly self-selected group, as participation in the exchanges declines dramatically as subsidy eligibility decreases. It ignores a majority of the American population because they are enrolled elsewhere, and a large portion of those who could but choose not to use the site because they don’t qualify for subsidies. While enrollees' eligibility for plans under $75 has increased by 9 percentage points from last year, the people who qualify for subsidies hasn’t changed. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-06912	Says state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo) ran a red light and seriously injured a bicyclist.	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/24/wisconsin-family-action/wisconsin-family-action-says-wisconsin-rep-fred-cl/	As the Senate recall elections heat up, the personal lives of candidates are dominating the attack ads. Their criminal convictions and other transgressions are being highlighted -- along with their voting records and stances on the issues. Many of the ads are being aired by outside groups. Perhaps no television ad is more startling -- and graphic -- than one being aired in Green Bay and Madison by a group called Wisconsin Family Action. It targets state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo), challenger to state Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon). The ad, bearing the theme "Legislators should lead by example," runs through Clark’s checkered driving record -- speeding, previous accidents, driving with a suspended license -- and concludes with a disturbing video of an SUV hitting a bicyclist. In the video, an SUV zips into the frame, slamming into a bicyclist who rode into the intersection. As the crash occurs, the narrator intones: "Fred Clark ran this red light, seriously injuring this bicyclist." The audio includes the sound of squealing tires and the shocked voice of a witness on the bus. (The ad is not available online. A Madison television station did a story about the ad, which includes much of its content that you can see here.) Did Fred Clark really crash into a bicyclist? Beyond that, is the video actually from the incident? And who was at fault? Let’s backpedal. A Madison police report shows that Clark was involved in car-bike accident on Aug. 18, 2009, near the state Capitol. According to the report: Clark was driving his 2008 Ford Escape north on Hamilton Street about 4:25 p.m. The bicyclist, a 57-year-old Madison man, was heading north on Webster Street. when he was struck by Clark’s SUV. The report said that Clark "violated the red traffic signal" before striking the biker who had a green light. "I ran a red light," Clark told an officer at the scene, the report says. "I was just not paying attention." The cyclist was taken to University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics with back and lung injuries, which the report called "incapacitating." An officer attempted to speak with the victim at the hospital but said the man was unable to do so because of his injuries. Clark received an $88 ticket for running the red light. After the incident hit the news, his office issued a statement from Clark: "At this time, my first concern is for the well-being of the cyclist who was injured. What occurred was an accident, and my thoughts are with that person and his family." So what of the video in the ad? The video is real, and it comes from the dashboard camera of a Madison Metro bus that was stopped at the light on Webster Street. The light changes and the bus begins to move into the intersection when Clark’s SUV cuts in front of it and strikes the bike, which approached the intersection alongside the bus. Julaine Appling, president of Wisconsin Family Actionl, a group that advocates against same sex marriage and "foundational issues such as marriage, life and liberty" did not respond to requests for comment about the ad. Likewise, neither Clark nor his campaign was available to discuss the ad. So where does that leave us? A television ad produced by Wisconsin Family Action against recall challenger Clark highlights his checkered driving record. With video, the ad says Clark struck a bicyclist. The video is real and the accident happened as described. We rate the claim True.	None	Wisconsin Family Action	None	None	None	2011-07-24T09:00:00	2011-07-21	['None']

pomt-13916	"We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion. Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no — there's nothing out there."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/24/donald-trump/what-do-we-know-about-hillary-clintons-religion-lo/	Donald Trump has once again questioned a presidential candidate’s religious affiliation, accusing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of shielding her religious preference from the public eye. Speaking prior to a gathering hosted by the conservative Christian activist organization United in Purpose, Trump said there has been no public reference to Clinton’s religion. The comment was captured in a video from E.W. Jackson, a former nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor who attended the gathering. "We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion," Trump said in the video. "Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no — there's nothing out there. There’s like nothing out there." This is not the first time Trump has questioned a candidate’s religion. In 2011, Trump floated the possibility that President Barack Obama, whose path to Christianity is well-documented, could be a Muslim. At the gathering, Trump also made the broader claim that Clinton would not protect religious liberty. "We can’t be again politically correct and say we pray for all our leaders, because all of your leaders are selling Christianity down the tubes, selling evangelicals down the tubes," he said. So, what does Clinton have to say about her religion? A lot, we found out. On the campaign trail Let’s get this out of the way: Clinton is a Methodist, and the record on that is abundantly clear. The Clinton campaign directed us to several news articles where Clinton discussed her religion, including a Jan. 25 campaign rally in Knoxville, Iowa. When asked about her beliefs, Clinton cited her Methodist faith and tied it into her support for the poor, citing the teachings of Jesus. "Because it sure does seem to favor the poor and the merciful and those who in worldly terms don’t have a lot but who have the spirit that God recognizes as being at the core of love and salvation," she said. She went on to criticize those who use Christianity to "condemn so quickly and judge so harshly." In February 2016, after the New Hampshire primary, Clinton paraphrased a phrase popular among Methodists and often attributed to John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church. "You know, my family and my faith taught me a simple credo — do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, for all the people you can," she said. She called upon her personal spirituality during her unsuccessful 2008 bid for president. "I was raised to pray, you know, as a little girl, you know, saying my prayers at night, saying grace at meals, praying in, you know, church," she said at a 2007 presidential forum. Clinton has definitely brought up her religious background on the campaign trail this time around to convey both her political and personal philosophies. However, the intended message has not always hit home with voters. A 2016 Pew poll found that 43 percent of people found Clinton "not religious" compared to 60 percent for Trump. A 2008 Pew poll had 31 percent thinking her not religious, 53 percent only somewhat religious. Formative years Religion has played a large role in Clinton’s life even before "there was any political advantage to do so," said Patrick Maney, a Bill Clinton biographer and professor of history at Boston College. Hillary Clinton’s religious upbringing starts around the sixth grade in Park Ridge, Ill., where she attended Bible classes and participated in the Altar Guild at the First United Methodist Church, writes Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Carl Bernstein in his Clinton biography. There, she met Don Jones, a Methodist youth minister who took Clinton under his wing. At Jones’ memorial in 2009, Clinton attributed her pursuit of social justice to Jones’ teaching. "He taught me the meaning of the words ‘faith in action’ and the importance of social justice and human rights," she said at the time. In the conservative community of Park Ridge, Jones was considered to be more liberal and a free thinker, occasionally drawing ire for it. Jones made it a point to teach Clinton how "Jesus would deal with social issues," said William Chafe, a professor of history at Duke University who has studied Clinton extensively. "He took Hillary and the youth group into the slums of Chicago, had them interact with poor blacks and Puerto Ricans, and brought them to hear (Martin Luther King, Jr.) preach," Chafe said. "Even though her father was a Goldwater Republican." Jones was eventually asked to leave by members of the community, notably one of Clinton’s teachers Paul Carlson, who found his teachings too radical. The disagreements they had informed her shift in political philosophy, Clinton wrote in her 2003 autobiography Living History. "Though my eyes were opening, I still mostly parroted the conventional wisdom of Park Ridge’s and my father’s politics," she wrote. "While Don Jones threw me into ‘liberalizing’ experiences, Paul Carlson … reinforced my already strong anti-communist views." Her critics have actually used her relationship with Jones against her as a "radicalizing influence," Maney said. However, even after leaving for Wellesley College, the two kept in touch. "I wonder if it's possible to be a mental conservative and a heart liberal," she wrote Jones in a letter, reflecting on her changing political ideology and its religious influences. Conservative historian Paul Kengor, author of the book God and Hillary Clinton, told PolitiFact that Clinton has deviated from recent Methodist doctrine on abortion and gay marriage. The United Methodist Church recently voted in May on actions to the contrary of Clinton’s views on those topics — withdrawing from a pro-choice group and choosing not to alter its stance on gay marriage. "I think abortion should remain legal, but it needs to be safe and rare," she said at a 2008 forum commenting on how her Methodist tradition has complicated the issue. Kengor said in an interview with Christianity Today hat Clinton "walks step by step with the Methodist leadership into a very liberal Christianity." She continued to attend church at Wellesley, and Chafe noted that her social justice pursuits meshed with her religious convictions once she got to Yale as well. "She immediately identified with Marion Wright Edelman's Children's Defense Fund at Yale and worked with them after graduating from Yale," Chafe said. The group advocated for family rights. The trend continues after moving to Arkansas in the 1970s, where she taught Sunday school at the First United Methodist Church, Maney said. Clinton also attended the Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington as first lady. Kengor told PolitiFact she was considered a "regular" at the church, which is considered to be more liberal than the larger Methodist denomination. Bill Clinton is a Baptist, not a Methodist. Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, was raised a Methodist. In her own words Clinton has said that "advertising" her faith publicly is not her first instinct. Chafe noted she has relied on it less extensively in the recent past. Nonetheless, she has expounded on her faith in several public comments and books since entering the national spotlight with the election of her husband as president in 1992. "Bill and I went into our bedroom, closed the door and prayed together for God’s help as he took on this awesome honor and responsibility," Clinton wrote in Living History of her husband winning the 1992 election. In the same book, she describes meeting her "prayer partners" at the 1993 National Prayer Breakfast, and the gifts of Scripture they provided her. "Of all the thousands of gifts I received in my eight years in the White House, few were more welcome and needed than these 12 intangible gifts of discernment, peace, compassion, faith, fellowship, vision, forgiveness, grace, wisdom, love, joy and courage," she wrote. Her first book — It Takes A Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us — published in 1996, includes a section devoted to Clinton’s religious affiliation, "Children are Born Believers." In the chapter, she marvels about children’s potential to grasp spiritual issues and cites it as reason to defend religious freedom. "We are only children of God, not God. Therefore, we must not attempt to fit God into little boxes, claiming that He supports this or that political position," she wrote. References to Clinton’s faith surfaced in 1998, when news of Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky hit the press, and in 2000 when she campaigned for the U.S. Senate. In 2014, Clinton spoke to United Methodist Women, citing the Methodist Church as inspiring her to "advocate for children and families, for women and men around the world who are oppressed and persecuted, denied their human rights and human dignity." "I’ll always cherish the Methodist Church because it gave us the great gift of personal salvation, but the great obligation of social gospel, and for me, having faith, hope, and love in action was exactly what we were called to do," she said. Our ruling Trump said, "We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion." The reality is we were able to find quite a lot about Clinton’s Methodist upbringing and beliefs, and how she says it ties into her political philosophy. We documented just some of what we found here, and experts agree there is more out there. Trump’s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-07431	"Gov. (Rick) Perry helped balance his budget with about $6 billion worth of federal help, which he happily took, and then started blaming the members of Congress who had offered that help."	/texas/statements/2011/apr/24/barack-obama/president-obama-says-gov-perry-used-stimulus-fund-/	Asked by a Dallas television reporter whether he agreed with Texas leaders that the federal government should take some governing cues from the Lone Star State, President Barack Obama said he saw "a little inconsistency" in that position. "Keep in mind, Gov. (Rick) Perry helped balance his budget with about $6 billion worth of federal help, which he happily took, and then started blaming the members of Congress who had offered that help," Obama said during an April 18 interview with WFAA reporter Brad Watson at the White House. That so? We started our fact-check with Obama’s budget claim. Adam Abrams, a White House spokesman, told us that Obama was referring to stimulus funds when he said Perry plugged the budget with federal aid. The roughly $800 billion federal stimulus package, named the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by Congress, became law in February 2009 after receiving only three Republican votes, all in the Senate. State governments were the primary recipients of the money, although funds have also gone directly to entities such as schools, hospitals and utilities. The law specified that governors had 45 days after its passage to certify that their state would "request and use" the offered funds. On Feb. 18, 2009, Perry sent Obama the requisite letter of certification, assuring the president that the state would accept the funds and use them "in the best interest of Texas taxpayers." According to a February 2009 PBS News Hour online post, some stimulus money was meant "to help states avoid slashing funding for education and other programs that lawmakers could trim to offset shortfalls." Abrams, asked for backup for the president’s statement, pointed us to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which in turn sent us its July 2009 report on state budgets. According to the report, state budget-writing Texas lawmakers in 2009 were short $6.6 billion in revenue for 2010-11 and relied heavily on stimulus funds for a solution. We did our own budget research, finding that lawmakers agreed to spend $80.6 billion in state general revenue on basic expenses over the two-year period, according to a report by the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. However, the stimulus aid let legislators put an additional $6.4 billion toward programs, primarily Medicaid and education, historically financed with general revenue, according to a July 2009 House Research Organization report. Another $5.7 billion in stimulus money went to programs such as highway and bridge construction, child care development programs and weatherization assistance. Counting all funding sources, including the $12.1 billion in stimulus aid, the 2010-11 state budget totaled $182 billion. So, Obama’s dollar figure holds up. What about his claim that after accepting the stimulus money, Perry started blaming members of Congress who voted for the bill — almost all of them Democrats? We searched news archives and websites for such jabs. For the record, Perry has long aired anti-Washington, anti-spending rhetoric. A December 2007 Austin American-Statesman story reported that Perry, while campaigning in Iowa for presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani, said President George W. Bush "is not and he never was" a fiscal conservative. Back to the stimulus: On Feb. 18, 2009, the same day Perry accepted the federal funds, the governor slammed the legislation as being "full of pork and special interest handouts." On his campaign website, Perry wrote: "The Democrats think this bill will change our country's financial fortunes, but you and I know better. … This administration is saddling future generations with an increasingly unbearable debt." He then urged readers to sign an online petition telling "Washington" that they are "fed up with bailouts." In his letter to Obama accepting the aid, Perry said: "As you know, I have been vocal in my opposition to this legislation because I believe there are better ways to reinvigorate our economy and believe (the stimulus plan) will burden future generations with unprecedented levels of debt." Perry also wrote that he opposed using "these funds to expand existing government programs" because the state would be burdened "with ongoing expenditures long after the funding has dried up." (Elsewhere, Perry was quoted as saying that he welcomed federal dollars that could be used for one-time expenses.) During a Feb. 26, 2009, interview with conservative radio host Mike Gallagher, Perry criticized those members of Congress who had supported both the stimulus plan and the earlier $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, which helped shore up struggling banks during the financial crisis. He said: "Voting for the TARP in my opinion is even worse than voting for the stimulus; and they’re both very bad. ... At least some of the stimulus money may actually get into the hands of people where it might accidentally do some good." There’s more. In an April 7, 2009, video posted on his campaign website, Perry urged "fellow patriots" to attend tea party rallies planned for April 15 to let Washington know "what you think about the bailouts, all this stimulus, all this runaway spending that’s going on." And during speeches at tea party rallies that day, Perry said the attendees were sending Washington a message that "we will not stand for our pockets being picked, our children’s future being mortgaged, our rights being taken away." Perry’s criticism of Washington’s policies was not limited to Democrats. Running against U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in the last Republican gubernatorial primary, Perry frequently attacked her by calling out Washington. According to a Sept. 25, 2009, Statesman article, Perry wrote in a fundraising letter, "If Washington Republicans hadn't spent like Democrats for 12 years, they might have maintained enough votes to actually kill Obamacare." More recently, during a January 2010 speech in favor of a proposal to require Congress to balance the federal budget, Perry said that "leaders in Washington … pour out your tax dollars on every challenge, blissfully ignoring the consequences of their largesse while they consign our children, our grandchildren to a life of unprecedented, unmanageable debt." We asked the White House for examples of Perry "blaming the members of Congress" who supported the stimulus plan. Abrams didn’t offer any but told us that the president was pointing out "the well-documented habit of those who criticize Recovery Act assistance while using those funds to balance a state's budget." Summing up: Obama said Perry "happily" took federal stimulus funds that helped balance the state’s 2010-11 state budget. Perry hardly sounded happy about it, but Obama is correct that he accepted stimulus money that was used to help balance the budget. As to whether Perry then started "blaming" members of Congress who had supported the stimulus legislation — well, not in so many words. And as we noted, Perry’s criticism of the federal government had started long before. But Perry criticized the plan specifically and the policies of Washington in general, using rhetoric that painted Congress and the White House with the same big-spending brush.

pomt-06306	Under energy efficiency legislation sponsored by U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, "federal bureaucrats could take over the local building code enforcement in your city if so-called ‘green mandates’ are not complied with quickly enough."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/15/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-federal-bureaucrats-will-take-over/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry didn’t refer to U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen by name when he attacked the New Hampshire Democrat last month over her proposed energy efficiency bill. But, with a conservative audience before him, he didn’t have to. "Instead of relieving the economic burden … you have your counterpart in the United States Senate who is working on a bill that would make things worse for home builders," Perry said to great applause at the Cornerstone Action Dinner, October 28, 2011 in Manchester, N.H. "Under her scheme, federal bureaucrats could take over the local building code enforcement in your city if so-called green mandates are not complied with quickly enough," Perry said. "It is just simply bureaucratic overkill." Just as Perry didn’t mention Shaheen by name, he didn’t identify the specific legislation he was referring to. But a call to the Perry campaign found the governor was referring to the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2011. The bill, introduced in May by co-sponsors Shaheen and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, proposes a host of changes to national energy policies and practices. If passed, it would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation, and it would establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives. But would it really hand control of local building codes over to the federal government? We’re on the case. Under the proposal, which reinforces existing law, the federal Department of Energy would work with building industry groups, such as the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, to develop new model standards for residential and commercial buildings. The new standards would adjust federal targets toward more efficient appliances, lighting, windows and insulation, according to the text of the bill, S. 1000. And states would have two years from the date the new codes are implemented to report whether they plan to adopt the standards or not. "The 1992 Energy Policy Act mandated that states must review and consider adopting each revision of national model energy codes. S.1000 does not change this," Jeff Sadosky, a spokesman for Sen. Portman, the bill co-sponsor, wrote in an e-mail statement. "What it does is require the federal government to more frequently and consistently revise the national codes," Sadosky wrote. "There remains no federal mandate on states to adopt national model energy codes. Those states that do agree to the standards would be subject to a certification process, in which planners demonstrate their building codes meet the federal models or they are working towards them. But, according to the bill text and policy analysts alike, the legislation would not require any states to take part, nor would it offer provisions for any penalties for non-compliance. "Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any model building code or standard established under this section shall not be binding on a State, local government or Indian tribe as a matter of Federal law," the legislation reads. "The voluntary building codes provision contained in Senator Shaheen’s bipartisan energy efficiency bill provides models, not mandates, for the states," Shaheen spokeswoman Faryl Ury added this week in a written statement. "Adoption and enforcement is reserved for the states," she wrote. Financial incentives would be available to states that opt to participate. The bill, which passed the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in July 2011, proposes up to $200 million in incentives to be spread among participating states, among other training and educational resources. But, without any federal mandates, the only thing states stand to lose is access to the incentive money. The bill is awaiting a full Senate vote. "Basically, there’s a lot of carrot with no stick," said Deborah Estes, senior counsel for the Senate energy committee, which is chaired by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat. "We hope that states do the right thing and participate in this. It’s for the good of their citizens and for the good of the nation," Estes said. "But a lot of states, particularly smaller states, might not have the resident expertise to do this." Our ruling: Under Shaheen’s energy legislation, states would be required to report whether they plan to meet the model building codes. Those states that agree to the standards and accept federal dollars would be subject to a certification process to ensure they meet the regulations. But there is nothing in the bill that requires states to take part, nor are there any penalties for non-compliance. The bill is voluntary, not mandatory. We rate Perry’s claim False.

pomt-03968	Says he and Mitt Romney agreed on tying minimum wage increases to inflation.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/14/barack-obama/obama-says-he-and-romney-agreed-indexing-minimum-w/	In his State of the Union address this week, President Barack Obama proposed an increase to the federal minimum wage, from the current $7.25 an hour to $9. And lest anyone hasten to cast that as a partisan proposal, Obama claimed to have support on the idea from an unlikely source: former presidential rival Mitt Romney. "Working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up, while CEO pay has never been higher. So here's an idea that Gov. Romney and I actually agreed on last year: Let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on," Obama said. We know from last year’s dogged fight for the White House that Obama and Romney agreed on very little. But what about the minimum wage? We decided to check it out. Running for Senate Romney first expressed support for the idea of an indexed wage increase back in 1994, when he ran for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts against Ted Kennedy. (Indexing the minimum wage means pegging it to a common measure of inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index. The idea is that when prices overall go up, the minimum wage would go up, too. Obama used the term "the cost of living" to refer to inflation, but the concepts here are the same.) Kennedy criticized Romney for opposing a 30-cent increase to the minimum wage, which was then $4.25 an hour. In defense, he said he favored increasing it even more by tying it to inflation. "I think the minimum wage ought to keep pace with inflation. I think the minimum wage is a good thing to have in our economy and I think it ought to be updated. We've had some inflation since the time it was set at $4.25 in April 1991, so I think an inflationary increase is appropriate," he said at the time. Inflation had risen about 11 percent over the previous three years, so Romney's plan would have boosted the minimum wage by about 45 cents. As Massachusetts governor In 2006, Romney vetoed a bill passed by the Massachusetts legislature to raise the state’s minimum wage to $8 an hour over two years. Again, he defended the decision by asserting that the wage should increase modestly and regularly and be indexed to inflation. He sent the plan back to lawmakers with a proposal to hike the minimum wage from $6.75 to $7 an hour, and study further increases every two years. His spokesman told the Boston Globe, "The governor is not opposed to a minimum-wage increase, but he thinks it should be in line with inflation, so that's what he has put on the table. This is logical and consistent with what the governor has supported in the past." Running for president At a New Hampshire campaign event in January 2012, Romney was asked about his stance on raising the minimum wage. "My view has been to allow the minimum wage to rise with the CPI (Consumer Price Index) or with another index so that it adjusts automatically over time," he said. The interviewer followed up, asking, "So you’d support that as president?" "I already indicated that when I was governor of Massachusetts, and that’s my view," he responded. He confirmed in February that his opinion had not changed, which drew quick criticism from conservative players such as Steve Forbes, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the Club for Growth. Romney’s positioned shifted a bit after that. In a March interview on CNBC he conceded that the timing wasn’t right to raise the minimum wage during an economic recovery: "On a regular basis, I said in the proposal I made (as governor of Massachusetts), every two years, we should look at the minimum wage, we should see what’s happened to inflation, we should also look at the jobs level throughout the country, unemployment rate, competitive rates in other states or, in this case, other nations. "So, certainly, the level of inflation is something you should look at, and you should identify what’s the right way to keep America competitive. So that would tell you that right now, there’s probably not a need to raise the minimum wage." Our ruling Obama said that tying the minimum wage to the cost of living is something he and Romney "actually agreed on." As far back as 1994, Romney favored this approach. He reiterated it in 2006 while governor of Massachusetts, and again as the Republican nominee for president last year. Under criticism on the national stage, he did back away slightly from that position given the fragile economy in 2012. None of this is to say that Romney would support Obama’s current proposal to boost the minimum wage to $9 an hour. But Obama was on firm ground claiming that at least for most of Romney’s political career, the former rivals were in agreement on indexing the wage. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-14293	China is "in the South China Sea and (building) a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-weighs-chinas-island-building-south-c/	Donald Trump warned of China’s military might in a recent interview with the New York Times. "We have rebuilt China, and yet they will go in the South China Sea and build a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen," Trump said. "Amazing, actually. They do that, and they do that at will because they have no respect for our president and they have no respect for our country." We looked at Trump’s that the United States "rebuilt" China in a separate fact-check. But we were curious about Trump’s claim that China is now building a groundbreaking fortress in the South China Sea. The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us about his claim, which is exaggerated. While China is expanding aggressively in the South China Sea, it is not constructing a floating Death Star by any means. Take me to the South China Sea Before we delve into the South China Sea, let’s go through some basics. Several Asian nations have been fighting over hundreds of small islands, reefs, atolls and sandbanks in the South China Sea for centuries. Though largely uninhabitable, the area is a potential treasure trove of oil and gas. The waters are also home to some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, where $5 trillion of trade passes through every year. China and Taiwan both claim the good majority of the area and contend their sovereignty dates back, at the very latest, to Kublai Khan in 1293. Vietnam disputes this and says it’s ruled the key island chains, the Spratlys and the Paracels, since the 17th century. The Philippines’ claim for the Spratlys and the Scarborough Shoal is one of geographical proximity. Malaysia and Brunei, meanwhile, say parts of the waters fall within their United Nations-defined economic exclusion zones. The United States, for its part, has no claim on the territories, but it has significant interests at stake. Assistant Defense Secretary David Shear, in congressional testimony last year, listed "peaceful resolution of disputes, freedom of navigation and overflight, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms, unimpeded lawful commerce, respect for international law, and the maintenance of peace and stability." Of particular concern to the United States is China’s ambitions to militarize the South China Sea and achieve "hegemony in East Asia," in the words of Navy Adm. Harry Harris Jr. China retorted that it’s the United States that’s militarizing in the region and escalating tensions. As a show of force, the Obama administration is sending Navy patrols to the region. According to the New York Times, Pentagon officials said these exercises were meant to convey the message that the "United States is the dominant military power in the region." In response, a spokesperson for Beijing’s defense ministry warned the United States to "be careful," according to the AFP. Historical and legal arguments aside, the grab for the islands didn’t really begin until the 20th century, with military clashes and diplomatic stand-offs springing up every couple of years. And to assert their claims, all of the countries except Brunei have been building outposts and artificial islands in the South China Sea for decades. We’ll explain how an island can be artificial in a bit. Vietnam and the Philippines were the most active in island-building in the early 2000s, and they, along with Taiwan, have stationed military forces on some outposts, according to Reuters. But in recent years, however, China has been the dominant player. Since 2014, China has staked out about 2,000 acres in the South China Sea and built seven artificial islands and three airstrips in the Spratlys. This is "more land than all other claimants combined over the history of their claims," Shear told Congress. Experts say Trump has a point that this reclamation and level of assertiveness is unprecedented. Larry Wortzel, a member of the congressional United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, noted that China’s buildup this time around is significantly improved in technical capacity, scope and modernity. The artificial islands themselves, however, are not "the likes of which the world has never seen." Floating but not exactly fortified Artificial islands are made by building concrete platforms, docks, airtrips and other landmass structures onto reefs and sand cays in the Spratlys. For example, China created about 114,000 square meters (about the size of 20 football fields) of new land in the Spratlys by constructing a large supply platform on a reef, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. (Photo from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative) Though many in the media have taken to calling these artificial islands "fortresses" — a term that typically refers to a stronghold that can defend against attacks — they don’t quite live up to the name yet. "It seems a bit premature to say that China is building a military fortress," said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. For one, while Beijing will likely use the islands for military purposes, it’s been deliberately unclear about its intentions and hasn’t deployed any aircraft or missiles yet, Glaser told PolitiFact. Thus far, these outposts only have radars and dual-use equipment, according to Patrick Cronin, the senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. "A military fortress would be more obvious than China’s preferred exploitation of grey-zone situations and use of incremental tactics — salami-slicing incremental moves to improve China’s position," Cronin said. For another, the military infrastructure China has built is far from unbreachable and, in fact, pretty vulnerable to attack. "These facilities are quite limited and though they offer a headache to the region in peacetime, they would not be a major threat to U.S. or allied forces in a conflict," said Gregory Poling, the director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump may have been referring to the military base on Hainan Island or the surface-to-air missiles deployed on Woody Island in the Paracels. But the two are different from the recently constructed artificial islands. Hainan Island, which is roughly the size of Belgium, is not one of the contested territories. Woody Island, though contested and becoming increasingly fortified, has been under Chinese control since 1946. Cronin noted that some analysts have speculated that China may be looking to form a triangle of bases to fortify its position — perhaps the closest thing to a "military fortress" — but "this is more of a long-term idea than a reality China can defend." Our ruling Trump said, China is "in the South China Sea and (building) a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen." China made large land grabs in the South China Sea and has constructed several artificial islands in the region. However, it's a stretch for Trump to say these outposts that could be used for military purposes amount to a fortress. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

pomt-13627	Says Barack Obama "founded ISIS. I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-pants-fire-claim-obama-founded-isis-c/	Donald Trump has found a ferocious way to describe President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton: as the founder and cofounder of ISIS, the terrorist group behind beheadings of Americans and lethal attacks around the world. Speaking to thousands of supporters at a Broward County arena Aug. 10, Trump vowed to "knock the hell out of ISIS" before pointing the finger at the Democrats. "ISIS is honoring President Obama," he said. "He is the founder of ISIS. He is the founder of ISIS, okay? He is the founder. He founded ISIS. And I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton." Trump has been making similar comments for several months, and he repeated his latest talking point in an interview with Republican radio host Hugh Hewitt the day after his Broward speech. In fact, when Hewitt proposed a more cautious interpretation of his assertion — that Obama and Clinton "created the vacuum" in the region and thus "lost the peace" to ISIS — Trump rejected that formulation, sticking with the most literal version of "founder" and "co-founder." "No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS," Trump told Hewitt. "I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton." Hewitt pushed back, saying, "But he’s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He’s trying to kill them." Trump dismissed that again, saying, "I don’t care. He was the founder. The way he got out of Iraq was, that, that was the founding of ISIS, okay?" And hours after the Hewitt interview aired, Trump tripled down on the attack in a speech to the National Association of Homebuilders in Miami Beach once again accusing them of being the founder and cofounder of ISIS. Trump was already incorrect when he said Clinton "invented" ISIS with her "stupid policies," as he did a few weeks ago. Now he’s taking it a step further with the "co-founded" attack. Let us be clear: It is wildly inaccurate to say Obama or Clinton "co-founded" ISIS. The creation of ISIS Experts have repeatedly told us that the sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected. But Trump’s provocative comment glosses over all of that nuance. For starters, the terrorist group’s roots pre-date Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s role as secretary of state. ISIS has used several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014. The most prominent leader of the group we now call ISIS has been Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who became the leader in 2010. Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But you could also argue Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots and regroup. The Trump campaign sent us links to articles about how the Obama administration handled the situation in the Middle East that influenced the rise of ISIS. As for Clinton, Trump’s campaign has previously pointed to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. While Clinton does bear some responsibility for the Iraq war that gave ISIS an opening, she isn’t solely responsible: The vast majority of senators — from both parties — joined her in supporting the intervention advocated by Bush. "So yes, Hillary's vote for President Bush's misguided policy to build democracy in Iraq directly assisted the Republican decision that opened the door to the radicalization of Iraq and destabilization of the Levant," said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma told us in July when Trump attacked Clinton. "Bush's destruction of the Iraq Army and state is the single-most important decision that led to the expansion of al-Qaida into the region and later emergence of ISIS." Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and that did not include an agreement to leave a large force behind. Trump’s campaign has also pointed to Clinton’s positions on Syria and Libya as evidence for allowing ISIS to grow. As secretary of state in 2011, she echoed Obama’s support for regime change in Syria and said Assad needed to "get out of the way." "Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited," Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact. "That is a fair criticism, in my opinion." In recent years, the United States has targeted ISIS militarily, with some signs of progress and some setbacks. After an ISIS terrorist attack in Brussels, Obama said that destroying the group is his "top priority." (For what it’s worth, Clinton herself was in favor of supporting Syrian rebels but was overruled by Obama. She also advocated for maintaining a moderate troop presence in Iraq after 2011.) As Hewitt suggested in the interview, it’s possible to argue that the administration’s withdrawing from Iraq, its lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and its decision to intervene in Libya contributed to the power of ISIS. These concerns track those we’ve heard from foreign-policy experts. However, this more limited and defensible critique of Clinton’s record is what Hewitt offered Trump on his radio show, and the candidate forcefully rejected it out of hand — twice. Our ruling Trump said Obama "founded ISIS. I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton." There’s a credible critique that Obama’s and Clinton’s foreign-policy and military decisions helped create a space in which ISIS could operate and expand. But Trump explicitly rejected this formulation, saying he literally means Obama is "the founder of ISIS" and Clinton is the "cofounder." In reality, the founder of ISIS was a terrorist. It is run by terrorists. Obama has said destroying ISIS is his "top priority." All this makes Trump’s statement a ridiculous characterization. He’s doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on it in various venues and has reinforced that he meant his words to be taken literally. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-00775	Facebook has unveiled new rules to stop their users from creating posts related in any way to religion.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/10/facebook-posts/facebook-planning-ban-religious-content-no/	Is Facebook planning to ban all posts related to religion? A reader recently sent us links to an article shared on Facebook, titled, "Facebook To Ban Religious Posts, Memes After Criticism From Atheism Groups," asking if we could verify its accuracy. The article was originally published several months ago on a website called the National Report; other versions have circulated as Facebook memes. Here’s a portion of the article: "In a closed-door session with shareholders on Tuesday, Facebook executives wheeled out a set of new rules which, when implemented later this year, will ban their users from creating status updates and image posts related in any way to religion, while also vowing to disband groups and take down pages with religious goals or affiliations." The story goes on to claim that Facebook will implement the new rules in three phases by removing pages with religious themes; prohibiting the posting or sharing of religious images and memes; and implementing filters to weed out status updates that include words like "Jesus," "prayer," "church," or "God." This would be a pretty big deal if it were true, but there’s a problem: The National Report is a fake news site. The website, established in 2013, once included a disclaimer making that point clear. The disclaimer has since been removed, but was archived by urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com. It said, in part, "All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental." As for Facebook banning religion, similar bogus rumors have been floating around cyberspace for years. In March 2014, Snopes investigated a nearly identical claim. The message, allegedly issued by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, said that Facebook would be launching a "No Religion" campaign prohibiting the "spreading (of) religious beliefs," and planned to delete the accounts of those who violated the new policy. Just to put the final nail in the coffin, we went looking and found many religiously affiliated pages on Facebook that have collected hundreds of thousands of "likes." The Facebook page Jesus Daily, which claims to be the "#1 most active Facebook Page in history where you can learn how to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior," has more than 26 million likes. Facebook pages for the Bible, Koran, and Torah have netted more than 40 million likes altogether. None have been deleted from Facebook.

pomt-11567	Says that singer Dolly Parton said, "Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of Bush, Obama put together."	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/05/americanproudinfo/no-dolly-parton-didnt-say-trump-better-bush-and-ob/	Singer Dolly Parton praises President Donald Trump as outperforming his predecessors -- or at least that’s what a fake story on Facebook proclaims. "Singer Dolly Parton: "Trump in one year is already better than 16 Years’ of Bush, Obama ‘Put Together,’" stated a Jan. 22 headline on Americanproud.info. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. It is. The story took a quote by a consultant who served in George W. Bush’s administration and and falsely attributed it to Parton. Earlier this month, Brett Decker spoke about consumer confidence and the economy. in a radio interview with Breitbart. "Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of those guys put together," he said. The Americanproud.info story also used an actual quote by Parton in an interview with CNN in August 2016, but omitted the full context of her comments. "We’re doing good," Parton told CNN. "We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect." Americanpround.info included that snippet in its report, but went on to say that Parton "saw the light" and later called Hillary Clinton "nuts" and that her campaign has been "just crazy." In reality, all those comments were actually from the same CNN interview, but Americanproud.info distorted what Parton actually said. When asked about Clinton and Trump, here’s Parton’s full remarks: "I don't know where they're going to land but I think they're both nuts" she said, joking that "it's like watching the OJ Simpson trial. You just believe whoever's up next. Whoever testified last is who you believe." In the CNN interview, Parton doesn’t come across as committed to either candidate. CNN paraphrased her as saying she might not know who she will vote for and that it's time that both Trump and Clinton stopped talking about each other. In June 2016, the New York Times asked Parton how she felt about a female presidential nominee. "Well, I think that that would be wonderful. Hillary might make as good a president as anybody ever has. I think no matter if it’s Hillary or Donald Trump, we’re gonna be plagued with PMS either way — presidential mood swings! But I personally think a woman would do a great job. I think Hillary’s very qualified. So if she gets it, I’ll certainly be behind her." After much publicity about that quote, Parton issued a statement. "My comment about supporting a woman in the White House was taken out of context. I have not endorsed Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump. I try not to get political but if I am, I might as well just run myself 'cause I've got the hair for it, it's huge, and they could always use more boobs in the race." Proclaiming that a celebrity now loves Trump or hates Clinton is a common theme in fake news stories.

pomt-14589	"Faced with $1 million in campaign debt," Scott Walker "is unloading his campaign security costs onto the backs of Wisconsin taxpayers."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/05/katrina-shankland/heavy-presidential-campaign-ious-scott-walker-fois/	Gov. Scott Walker, once an early favorite among the 2016 Republican candidates for president, doubtless wishes he were canvassing the Granite State, soliciting votes ahead of the New Hampshire primaries. Instead, the news lately about his bid, which ended in September 2015, is his campaign’s red ink. On Jan. 29, 2016 it was reported that despite raising $500,000 in the last three months of 2015, Walker’s presidential campaign was still in debt -- by more than $1 million. The governor announced the same day that his campaign would no longer pay for the travel costs of his state-provided security team when he leaves Wisconsin for political events. Instead, those future travel costs for the security team for political events would once again be the responsibility of state taxpayers. Cueing off those two news items, a top state Assembly Democrat lambasted Walker the same day. "Faced with $1 million in campaign debt, Governor Walker is trying to cut corners in any way he can," Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Shankland of Stevens Point said in a news release. "In this case, he is unloading his campaign security costs onto the backs of Wisconsin taxpayers." Walker is putting travel expenses for his security team for future political trips back onto taxpayers -- as they long have been under him and previous governors -- but Shankland’s claim mixes apples and oranges. Walker is not unloading such expenses from his presidential campaign, or any of his presidential campaign debt, onto taxpayers. The security detail backdrop Wisconsin taxpayers have long paid for security officers to give around-the-clock protection to their governors. But the costs have made more news since shortly after Walker took office in January 2011. Almost immediately, Walker launched legislation that resulted in Act 10, a law that sharply curtails the collective bargaining powers of both state and local government employees. Thousands upon thousands of people demonstrated daily in Madison. Walker beefed up security. Costs mounted. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, for example, that in 2013 taxpayers spent $2.23 million for the 10 state troopers who protect Walker and his family, GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, and dignitaries from other states and countries who visit Wisconsin. That was up from $657,457 paid out by Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, during his last year in office in 2010. Walker’s security bill inched higher in 2014, to $2.3 million. A large part of the increase came because Walker had added five members to what is officially known as the Dignitary Protection Unit in the wake of the Act 10 protests. Both Walker and Kleefisch were the target of death threats during the frenzied debate over the bill. (The security unit did not provide services for lieutenant governors until Kleefisch came into office in 2011.) Another factor, though, was an increase in travel costs due to out-of-state trips made by Walker as he was increasingly seen as a possible 2016 presidential contender. Walker made political trips to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and other states. Taxpayers have routinely covered security costs for governors, on official business in Wisconsin and on political trips out of state. But Doyle, as one example, didn't travel outside Wisconsin on political jaunts nearly as often as Walker did as he pursued his White House run. The presidential campaign In March 2015, Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb, who oversees the security team, told the Legislature’s budget committee that taxpayers would foot the bill for providing security for Walker as he traveled around the country for what was then his budding presidential campaign. "The governor is the governor 24/7," he said, noting that taxpayers paid for security for previous governors on their political travels. In April 2015, Our American Revival, which was then Walker’s presidential campaign-in-waiting, announced it would pick up the security officers' travel costs when Walker attended political rallies, fundraisers and other events related to what eventually would become his official bid for the White House. So, that was a change from past practice, when taxpayers would cover all security expenses for a governor, even for political travel. By early January 2016, Walker’s campaign had reimbursed taxpayers about $260,000 to cover airfare, hotels and other expenses for his security team while Walker ran for president. The most recent payment covered costs from July, August and September 2015. According to Walker’s Department of Administration, Walker’s campaign has reimbursed the state for the travel expenses in full. Our rating Shankland said: "Faced with $1 million in campaign debt," Scott Walker "is unloading his campaign security costs onto the backs of Wisconsin taxpayers." For future political trips, Walker is returning to the practice of taxpayers paying for travel expenses for his state security team. But Walker is not unloading any of his presidential campaign debt onto taxpayers, including travel expenses for the security team. His campaign has already reimbursed the state for those expenses. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-02325	"Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion."	/florida/statements/2014/mar/27/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-tried-slash-school-f/	Both Charlie Crist and Rick Scott will have gubernatorial records to fuel the campaign fire this year. The attacks have already started, with Crist firing a shot about Scott’s budget actions over the years. On a page titled "Top 5 reasons to make Florida Scott-free," Crist brings up education spending as No. 1. "Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion," the site says. "To put that into perspective, $3.3 billion could pay the yearly salaries of more than 70,000 teachers in Florida." Considering Scott came into office during the Great Recession, his budget cutting is well known. We thought we’d dive into the numbers to see whether he proposed that the state’s schools take a $3.3 billion hit. Slash and learn Scott entered office in 2011, facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the state’s $70.5 billion budget. His solution in February 2011 was to propose cutting $4.6 billion in spending and $2.4 billion in state revenue by reducing taxes, regulations and fees. His budget came in at $65.9 billion. His proposal, encompassing two fiscal years, recommended cutting per-pupil spending by about $700, a 10 percent reduction from the state’s current $6,899 spending per student at the time. Part of the cuts included a 10 percent cut in the required local effort portion of property taxes and a loss of more than $870 million in federal stimulus money. In all, that added up to a projected $4.8 billion in cuts to education over the two years. The Scott plan attempted to offset some of those cuts with other federal aid and by requiring teachers to contribute 5 percent to their pension plans, adding back about $400 per student. We’ve broken down some of those dollar figures before. In all, funding would have been cut some $3.3 billion the first year. Legislators did not respond well to such a drastic proposed budget reduction for schools. "Are we looking at the cuts the governor is making? The answer is no, a resounding no," PreK-12 Education Appropriations subcommittee chairman Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, told the Gainesville Sun. After a contentious session, the Legislature passed and Scott signed a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education, from $18.2 billion to $16.5 billion. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, a 7.9 percent cut in funding. The following year, Scott requested a $1 billion increase in education dollars, which was included in the 2012-2013 state budget. The increase was needed to make up for more than 30,000 new students and a decline in property taxes from a 3 percent drop in property values. He then requested $1.2 billion more in 2013; the Legislature agreed to $1 billion. This year he has asked Tallahassee for $542 million more for next year, bringing the totals to $10.6 billion in state cash and $18.8 billion overall. This would be a record amount of spending in terms of dollars, but still less than the amount being spent per student when he took office. The ruling Crist said "Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion," pointing to a budget proposal from 2011, Scott’s first year in office. Scott did propose cutting $3.3 billion from the education budget, alienating members of his own party in the Legislature in the process. He even had suggested cutting $4.8 billion over two years. Part of the cuts were from the loss of federal stimulus dollars, but the state had the power to restore them had it chosen to. In the end, Tallahassee approved $1.3 billion in cuts. Scott has asked for increases in the three years since. Crist’s statement was specifically phrased, saying Scott "tried" to reduce school funding. That is accurate, but it’s important to note that Scott's initial proposal died in the Legislature, and funding has increased since that attempt. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02347	After hiring a campaign manager in 2006, "I got this $100 and something fee ... for hazardous materials."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/23/allan-fung/allan-fung-says-he-had-pay-100-hazardous-materials/	With Rhode Island currently hobbled by the nation’s highest unemployment rate, gubernatorial candidates have been suggesting all sorts of ways to improve the state’s business climate. During a March 7 interview on Rhode Island Public Radio, Cranston mayor and Republican candidate for governor Allan Fung said the state sometimes nickel-and-dimes its businesses. He gave an example from his own experience. Fung said he hired a campaign manager for one of his previous campaigns. "Well, lo and behold, I got this hundred-something dollar fee that came from the Department of Labor and Training, for hazardous materials." Fung said he had only the one employee, and, as a political campaign, no contact with hazardous materials. "But because you have an employee, you have to pay that," he said. Do you? We checked it out. Fung’s political career goes back to 2002, when he won a seat on the Cranston City Council (he was the second highest council vote getter). His first mayoral run, unsuccessful as it turned out, was in 2006, when he lost to Democrat Michael Napolitano by 79 votes. It was for that campaign that he hired a manager, Ryan Bilodeau. Copies of Fung’s 2006 campaign finance reports on file in the State Archives show regular payments to Bilodeau, as well as IRS withholding and state tax payments. They also show, on March 12, 2006, a $42 check made out to the state Department of Labor and Training, with the notation "right to know registration form." The Department of Labor and Training is charged with enforcing what is known as the "Hazardous Substances Right to Know Act," so named because it says employees in Rhode Island have a right to know what hazardous materials are used in their workplaces. The law requires businesses that deal with hazardous materials to notify workers -- and the labor department -- about the materials. Even if a business doesn’t use any hazardous materials, it still has to file the form. In 2006, when Fung hired his campaign manager, all Rhode Island employers were assessed a $42 fee when they filed the required declaration form, DLT spokeswoman Nikki Armstrong said. And that was the law. Until July 2013. That was when the General Assembly passed a budget article, submitted by Governor Chafee’s administration, that eliminated the fee. "This change is the latest in a series of cost-saving initiatives my administration has made to improve regulations and to build a more customer-friendly business climate in Rhode Island," Chafee said in a statement announcing the abolition of the fee, an action he said was projected to save about 10,000 state businesses collectively around $400,000 a year. Fung for Governor campaign manager Patrick A. Sweeney acknowledged that the candidate was off by $58. But he said Fung’s bigger point, "that we have a plethora of regulations that are hurting small businesses across the country," was still valid. Our ruling Allan Fung, recollecting events of eight years ago, said he had to pay a fee of about $100 for filing a hazardous materials notification form when he hired his first campaign staff member. He was right about there being a fee, but he overstated the amount. And in expressing his frustration about the fee, he gave the impression it still exists, when, in fact, it was eliminated a year ago. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09792	Insurers delayed an Illinois man's treatment, "and he died because of it."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/17/barack-obama/obama-says-decision-revoke-insurance-led-illinois-/	To show that insurance companies can be callous, President Barack Obama recently cited the case of an Illinois man who Obama said had died because of an insurer's decision. "More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care," the president told a joint session of Congress on Sept. 9, 2009. "It happens every day. One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it." The man Obama was referring to was Otto S. Raddatz, who died earlier this year. But Lynn Sweet, a reporter with the Chicago Sun-Times , found the president was wrong to blame Raddatz's death on the insurance company. Raddatz, a restaurant owner, was insured by Fortis Insurance Co., according to congressional testimony by his sister, Peggy. In September 2004, at 59, he was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkins lymphoma and began chemotherapy. As he was preparing for a stem cell transplant for which timing was crucial, he was told that his coverage was being rescinded due to a "routine" review that had found that he'd failed to disclose having gallstones and an anyeurism. Explaining that the doctor had never even told him about the discovery, and that no treatment had ever been urged, Peggy Raddatz went to the state attorney general for help. Within weeks, the attorney general's office got the decision reversed, and Raddatz was able to proceed with his transplant. The case drew national attention, including stories in Slate and on National Public Radio, and Peggy Raddatz testified twice to congressional commitees about her brother's story. But the president's version of the story was challenged by a Sept. 13, 2009, blog post by Sweet, who covers the White House for the Sun-Times . She noted that the transplant went ahead and Raddatz lived for another three years — an indication that the company's decision to rescind his treatment didn't cause his death. Peggy Raddatz's testimony backs this up. On June 16, 2009, Raddatz recounted the experience before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Raddatz is still angry with the insurer — in her prepared testimony, she called what the company did to her brother "unethical" and "cruel" — but she gave no indication that the delay hampered her brother's survival. At one point, the full committee's ranking Republican, Joe Barton of Texas, asked Raddatz whether her brother had received the stem cell transplant he needed. "He did indeed receive the stem cell transplant," she responded. "It was extremely successful. It extended his life approximately three-and-a-half years. He did pass away January 6th of 2009, and he was about to have a second stem cell transplant. Unfortunately, due to certain situations, his donor became ill at the last minute, and so he did pass away on January 6th. But again, (the initial transplant) extended his life nearly three-and-a-half years. And at his age, each day meant everything to him." The White House acknowledges that the facts got garbled, but insists that the larger lessons from the story are unchanged. "The story President Obama referenced in his speech underscores what so many Americans have learned the hard way: Insurance companies look for ways to rescind their coverage when you need it most," White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said. "A media account of Mr. Raddatz’s story that the president relied on in his speech confused some of the details, but the underlying point remains the same. President Obama wants to end the practice that allows insurance companies to pull insurance for individuals like Mr. Raddatz when they need it most." In her piece, Sweet noted that a fellow Sun-Times reporter, Cheryl V. Jackson, talked to Raddatz after the speech, and she had no complaint with Obama's account of her brother's death. "The point is that my brother lost his insurance coverage when he was dying," the article quoted Raddatz as saying. Still, the president said that Otto Raddatz's death was caused by a delay in his surgery caused by the insurer's decision to rescind his policy. But as Peggy Raddatz testified, government intervention enabled her brother to have the procedure, and he lived, despite his cancer, for another three and a half years. When Raddatz eventually died earlier this year, his sister said that his death came while waiting for a second procedure that did not happen because the transplant donor unexpectedly fell ill. Critics can still blame the insurance company for insensitivity — and it's true that the company only paid for Raddatz's treatment after the attorney general's office acted — but the evidence shows that it's inaccurate to say a delay in care caused his death. So we rate the president's statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-17T19:16:20	2009-09-09	['Illinois']
pomt-03731	Says Oregon’s high minimum wage is the reason why "by 2011, Oregon's restaurants employed an average of only 13.8 workers, or 2.6 fewer employees than they did before the state's minimum wage began rising above the federal level in 1997."	/oregon/statements/2013/apr/13/melvin-sickler/has-oregons-higher-minimum-wage-hurt-our-restauran/	Melvin "Mel" Sickler, a representative of the National Restaurant Association, recently told a U.S. Senate committee to put the brakes on a bill that would increase the federal minimum wage and tie it to inflation. Why? Boosting the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 would reduce the number of jobs in the food service industry, Sickler said. The claim: In his testimony, Sickler trotted Oregon out as an example of a state with a high minimum wage (it’s $8.95) tied to inflation, saying that’s happened here. Here’s what he said: "Given the experience in states that have raised their minimum wages above the federal rate, we know the impact The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013 would have, if enacted, on the availability of jobs in my industry. "For example, Oregon's state minimum wage is now $8.95, more than a dollar less than what is being proposed in The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013. After peaking at 16.4 employees per establishment in 1996, the average number of workers in Oregon's restaurants declined steadily." Wow, right? And, it gets worse, according to Sickler. "By 2011, Oregon's restaurants employed an average of only 13.8 workers, or 2.6 fewer employees than they did before the state's minimum wage began rising above the federal level in 1997," he said. Oregonians are sensitive about the quality of their restaurants and the size of their workforce so we wanted to figure out if this was true. Has Oregon’s minimum wage hurt the state’s restaurant industry? And what is "employees per establishment," anyway? The analysis: We went to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for some numbers. The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages is the go-to data source for job trends. To find the "employees per establishment" throughout the U.S., we took the average number of employees in the food service industry in 2011 and divided it by the average number of "establishments." Bingo. Oregon’s number in 2011 was 13.8. That’s lower than the national average of 16.4. But that’s just the start. Sickler was making a statement about how we got there. So let’s look at that other question, has the minimum wage in Oregon led to job losses? To dig into that, we started comparing Oregon to other states. That’s where the trouble began. But first, we need to talk a little more about the minimum wage. In Oregon, pretty much everybody has to be paid at least the minimum wage. That’s true in Washington, California and a few other states. But it’s not very common. In most states, tipped employees can be paid less under certain circumstances. The math gets pretty fuzzy pretty fast and lots of states have their own rules. But the main point is this: waiting tables on the West Coast pays better. So if our high minimum wage has hurt the job market for bartenders, the $9.19 hourly rate in Washington and the $8 rate in California has to have done the same thing, right? Well, this is where it gets sticky. Washington had 1.54 fewer employees per establishment than the national average. But California was basically at the national average. Oh, and in Nevada, where you either get the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour if your employer provides health coverage or you get $1 more if they don’t, the average number of employees per establishment was 18.75, 1.8 ahead of the average. Here’s another puzzler. Tipped employees in New York and New Jersey can earn less than $7.25. But New York food service businesses had an average of 12.6 employees. In New Jersey they had an average 12.4 employees. That’s worse than Oregon! Since you’re probably wondering, the state with the lowest average employees per population was Wyoming with 10.4. The highest number came from South Dakota, which had 22.46. Employees in both states earn the federal minimum. We asked Josh Lehner, a senior economist with the state of Oregon, whether this "employees per establishment" thing was a good gauge of the economic health of the restaurant industry. "You have two numbers there," Lehner said. "Your numerator and denominator -- and they can both be moving on their own trend lines for a whole host of reasons." See, lots of things happened between 1997 and 2011. Brewpubs began sprouting up like mushrooms across the state. Food carts blossomed in downtown Portland, then throughout the metro area. Foodie culture hit, increasing the interest in small locally owned restaurants over big national chains. There also were a couple recessions. We weren’t sure of the effects of all those things, so we looked at the underlying data. There we found that the yearly number of food service establishments in Oregon grew each year from 1997 through 2011. Employment grew every year except 2010, when it took a tiny dip. The "employees per establishment" number quoted by the restaurant association, seems to have changed over time, but not because of a massive drop in employment or restaurants. If you control for population growth, you get a clearer indication of the impact of recessions and the business cycle on the industry. That’s just what Lehner did. His conclusion was that Oregon’s a pretty good place to nosh. From 2001 to 2011, Oregon consistently had more establishments per 1,000 people than the U.S. average, and it had more people working in the food service industry per 1,000 people than the national average. During the entire time, Oregon’s minimum wage was higher than the national average and steadily crept up, matching inflation. Finally, we tracked down Michael Reich, director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California Berkeley. "The drop in jobs per establishment in Oregon could be caused by any number of factors. The chart shows a rising trend in jobs per establishment in the U.S. as a whole, even while the federal minimum wage rose several times during the period in the chart," Reich said. "I would not argue, though, that the minimum wage caused the increase. One has to have many more controls to make the transition from correlation to causality." We went back to the National Restaurant Association to discuss our findings. Katie Laning Niebaum said the group wasn’t arguing that smaller establishments were bad for the economy, or that Oregon’s restaurant industry was in decline, but instead, that a change in business model in response to the minimum wage was reducing opportunities for employment. "The data shows that over the last several years since Oregon's minimum wage rose above the national," Laning Niebaum said, "it appears that restaurant owners have changed their business model to employ fewer individuals. The ruling: Sickler wants to connect the shrinking size of restaurants on average in Oregon to the state’s minimum wage being higher than the federal minimum. In a vacuum, his data seem to suggest that link. But when we looked at data from other states, the correlation just didn’t work. And putting employment and the number of restaurants into context, as Lehner did, we can see that restaurant jobs rise and fall with the health of the national economy, not the state’s minimum wage. Oregon’s per capita restaurant employment is higher than the national average, in spite of having a higher minimum wage. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04232	Says she is "entering in the most diverse class ever," of U.S. Representatives	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/nov/21/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-kuster-touts-being-member-most-diverse-congres/	New Hampshire voters made history this month, electing the nation’s first all-female delegation to Congress. And they weren’t the only ones to break down barriers. Across the country, voters broke records, electing the most diverse class ever to enter Congress, according to U.S. Rep.-elect Ann McLane Kuster, who will be sworn in in New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District in January. "I’m … entering in the most diverse class ever," Kuster told MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry, Sunday, Nov. 11 -- five days after the election. "The Democratic caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives will be (a) majority of women and minorities. So, that is a wonderful experience. … I take great pride in that, as well." As Kuster notes, the incoming Democratic caucus includes a majority of women and minorities for the first time in history, according to news reports. Despite the gains, however, white men still hold a two-thirds majority in the 113th Congress. Bloomberg News pointed out that the House floor didn’t even have women’s restrooms until 2011, when Speaker John Boehner had them installed. But, does that make this House of Representatives the most diverse ever? We decided to check the books. According to preliminary counts, the incoming class in the House of Representatives, to be sworn in in January, features 78 women, 42 African Americans and 28 Latinos, among the 435 total representatives. Voters initially elected 43 African American representatives across the country, but that number fell to 42 after U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned his seat Wednesday. If that number stands, the Congressional Black Caucus will have lost two members from the 2012 count, falling from 44. Overall, since other minority groups will have added to their numbers, new records for diversity are poised to be set. The class of 78 women elected to the House this month marks an increase of five over the record 73, who served in each of the last three sessions of Congress, according to the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Federal counts show a total of 277 women have served in the House since 1917, when Rep. Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first elected to Congress. As for Latinos, the 28 members represent an increase of four over the 2012 count -- the previous high, according to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund. In total, 91 Hispanic representatives have served since Joseph Marion Hernandez, of Florida, became the first in 1822. The current Congress’ class of 24 had been the largest until this month’s election. "We are seeing greater geographic representation," said Rosalind Gold, senior director of policy research and advocacy for the California-based Education Fund. "We’re seeing more and more that candidates can both win in districts that are traditional centers of Latino population, but they can also appeal to very diverse constituencies. … There were a lot of milestones in this election." Looking forward, the next Congress also will see more Asian American and Pacific Islander members in Congress than ever before-- 13 in the House-- while Arab Americans retained at least four of their five House seats, as U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana, faces a December runoff election. Our ruling: The 113th Congress, like the ones before it, will go down as the most diverse class in history. The African Americans caucus have lost one seat, but voters elected more women than ever before (78), more Latinos (28) and more Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (13).

pomt-11618	"82-year-old who killed a Muslim in self-defense gets the death penalty."	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/24/patriot-report/fake-story-says-elderly-man-shot-muslims-self-defe/	A story moving on Facebook would lead you to believe that an elderly California man was sentenced to death after defending himself when he was ambushed by two Muslim men, but the story is fake news. "82-year-old who killed a Muslim in self-defense gets the death penalty," said a Jan. 15 headline on The Patriot Report. The story was previously posted by Ladies of Liberty, a website that defines itself as satire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake story has several made up details including that the photo of the elderly man reportedly sentenced to death in California is actually of a drug trafficker caught in Kansas. The story said that in October 2015 William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, Calif., was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims -- Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu. DeLisle, a Marine veteran, pulled a .22 from his ankle holster and shot both men within seconds, leaving one dead and the other paralyzed. The story said that the "Dewey County Prosecutor" said that because the two men were unarmed, the use of deadly force was "extreme and unnecessary." We found no such Dewey County in California, although the county does exist in Oklahoma and South Dakota. The photo allegedly of DeLisle matches a photo of Marshall Dion taken in Junction City, Kan., when he was arrested on drug trafficking charges in 2013. Dion had a long, colorful history with law enforcement dating back to 1985 when he crashed an airplane in Wisconsin and crawled away, denying that $112,000 found inside and around the airplane belonged to him. In that incident, the government confiscated the money, suspecting it was drug money, but he wasn’t charged. We searched the names of the alleged suspects in Nexis and found nothing in news accounts. We found nothing about an elderly William DeLisle in California, however, there was a 19th century British pulp-fiction writer by that name who in one book wrote about whites killing all blacks and Asians to create a paradise. Fake news purveyors have published many false stories that cast Muslims in a negative light, including one about 412 Muslims arrested in a Michigan bust and another story claiming a Muslim man started a California wildfire. In this case, the headline that an "82-year-old who killed a Muslim in self-defense gets the death penalty" is also fake news. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-02037	The five Taliban detainees being released from Guantanamo in exchange for captured Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl "are the hardest of the hard-core. These are the highest high-risk people."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/02/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-five-taliban-detainees-freed-bowe/	When President Barack Obama announced that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl had been freed after five years of being held by the Taliban, it didn’t take long for commentators to question whether the price of Bergdahl’s freedom was too steep. In exchange for Bergdahl’s freedom, the Obama administration agreed to release five members of the Taliban from the United States’ detention facility in Guantanamo, Cuba. The Taliban controlled Afghanistan prior to the 2001 U.S.-led military operation, and even though it’s no longer in power, the Taliban continues to fight for control of Afghanistan. On CBS’ Face the Nation, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sharply questioned whether it was in the United States’ best interests to release the five Taliban members: Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, and Mohammad Nabi Omari. Under the agreement, the five are to be held in Qatar for a year without the right to travel elsewhere. The five freed detainees, McCain said, "are the hardest of the hard-core. These are the highest high-risk people." We wondered whether McCain had sound support for his characterization, so we took a look at the evidence. The most detailed assessment comes from once-secret U.S. government documents made public by Wikileaks. The key documents, written in 2008, were individualized assessments by the Defense Department’s Guantanamo leadership. The documents, which provide most of the direct quotes in the five capsules below, give background and risk assessments of each of the five detainees being freed. According to the documents, all five men were deemed to be of "high" risk to the United States and were recommended for "continued detention." "From my general background, McCain, alas, is on target," said James Jeffrey, visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank that studies American interests in the Middle East. Here’s a rundown of the five former detainees: • Mullah Mohammad Fazl. Experts suggested to PolitiFact that, of the five, Fazl and Noori may be the most dangerous to United States interests. Fazl was an experienced commander against the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance and served as the Taliban’s army chief of staff. He’s "wanted by the UN for possible war crimes including the murder of thousands of Shiites" and had "operational associations with significant al Qaeda and other extremist personnel." The leaked documents say Fazl "wielded considerable influence" and that he’s become a recruiting symbol for the Taliban. • Mullah Norullah Noori. Noori was a "senior Taliban military commander" and the onetime governor of Balkh province who, like Fazl, is on the United Nations’ radar screen for possible war crimes. Fazl and Noori "were responsible for ethno-sectarian massacres in northern Afghanistan, as were some of their enemies who are now in the Afghan government," said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation. "They cooperated with al-Qaida, which was providing assistance to their fight against the Northern Alliance." Leaked documents cite ties to the Taliban’s top leader, Mullah Omar, and "senior al-Qaida members," including the allegation that he passed a message from Omar to al-Qaida’s Osama bin Laden. • Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa. The leaked documents say Khairkhwa was close to both Omar and bin Laden, representing the Taliban in "meetings with Iranian officials seeking to support hostilities against U.S. and Coalition Forces" following the start of the United States war in Afghanistan. He was governor of Herat province from 1999 to 2001 and was alleged to be one of the "major opium drug lords in western Afghanistan." Complicating matters somewhat, Khairkhwa was in discussions with the family of post-war Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, a longtime friend, about possibly cooperating with the new government when he was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and brought to Guantanamo. • Abdul Haq Wasiq. Wasiq was the deputy chief of the Taliban’s intelligence service and "was central to the Taliban's efforts to form alliances with other Islamic fundamentalist groups to fight alongside the Taliban against U.S. and Coalition forces after the 11 September 2001 attacks," according to the leaked documents, which added that he "utilized his office to support al-Qaida and to assist Taliban personnel elude capture" in late 2001. He is believed to have "arranged for al-Qaida personnel to train Taliban intelligence staff in intelligence methods." Wasiq claimed to be offering cooperation to the United States, though the U.S. government has officially been skeptical of those claims. • Mohammad Nabi Omari. Leaked documents describe Omari as "a senior Taliban official who served in multiple leadership roles," including membership in a joint al-Qaida-Taliban cell in Khowst that "was involved in attacks against U.S. and coalition forces." Omari also "maintained weapons caches and facilitated the smuggling of fighters and weapons," the documents say. Omari, like Wasiq, was apprehended while claiming to be providing intelligence of interest to the United States. Experts told PolitiFact that each of the five detainees represented risks to the United States’ national security to one degree or another, with Fazl and Noori at the top of the list. "They were involved in a range of Taliban operations in senior positions," said Seth G. Jones, associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation. After being released, the five will be able to leverage their time at Guantanamo, Jones added. "We’ve already seen Taliban statements that they’re pretty excited about the return of these men." There’s precedent for Taliban officials being released from Guantanamo and then going back to the battlefield. In 2007, the George W. Bush administration released Mullah Abdul Qayyum Zakir. Despite being considered less of a risk than any of the five released in exchange for Bergdahl, he rejoined Taliban forces and pushed a campaign of improvised explosive devices. Because the agreement stipulates that the five men will stay in Qatar for a year, the five released detainees won’t be able to take part immediately in battles on the ground, Jones noted. However, they might be able to provide strategic advice from a distance. "The reason the negotiations took so long was that the U.S. insisted on very strict safeguards against the risk posed by the release of these detainees," Rubin said. "No one claims there is no risk or even a low risk." While experts said McCain is generally correct that the five released detainees are significant figures who could put American interests at risk, some added that his language might have been a bit hyperbolic. Only one of the five -- Omari -- was labeled a "high" risk while in detention. The other four were considered "low" risks while in detention, meaning that they weren’t rabble rousers within Guantanamo. Jones said he wasn’t sure it was precisely accurate to call the five "the worst of the worst," saying he’d leave that description for the Taliban’s very top leaders, particularly Mullah Omar. Still, Jones said, "several of these five are pretty senior." Our ruling McCain said the five Taliban prisoners exchanged for Bergdahl "are the hardest of the hard-core. These are the highest high-risk people." It might be a slight exaggeration to place all five into the highest threat category among Taliban officials and leaders. Still, these were very senior Taliban operatives, and leaked internal documents from U.S. officials at Guantanamo generally back up McCain’s assessment. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11125	"The bottom line is clear: Under the policies of this unified Republican government, American workers, families, and business owners are achieving economic growth that is unmatched in recent memory. … More than 1 million new jobs have been created just since we passed tax reform last December."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/05/mitch-mcconnell/how-strong-have-job-gains-been-tax-bill-passed/	On the heels of a strong jobs report — one that featured 223,000 new jobs in May and an unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took to the Senate floor to tout the success of Republican economic policies. "The bottom line is clear," McConnell said June 4. "Under the policies of this unified Republican government, American workers, families, and business owners are achieving economic growth that is unmatched in recent memory." McConnell went on to cite changes to the tax code and regulatory changes. "After a decade of stagnation," he said, "Republican policies have gotten Washington out of the way and freed American workers and job creators to do what they do best — build a dynamic economy that is literally the envy of the world. But as impressive as some of these statistics may be, I think it is important to keep in mind that these stories are, at the end of the day, human stories. More than 1 million new jobs have been created just since we passed tax reform last December." When McConnell’s office posted the speech to YouTube, it hit the jobs line hard, giving it the title, "More Than One Million Jobs Created Since the Passage of Republican Tax Reform." There's little question that the economy, and particularly the jobs picture, are strong. The 3.8 percent unemployment rate is the lowest since 2000. Asked about McConnell's floor speech, his office offered another quote from the Majority Leader: "I spoke yesterday about the new job opportunities flooding into the U.S. economy. It’s all thanks to the ingenuity of American workers and job-creators, with an assist from Republican policies. … Republicans are proud of the historic tax reform and dramatic regulatory reform that helped make this happen." But is there evidence that Republican policies have boosted job creation? While it’s always tricky to isolate whether specific policies have shaped economic trends, policies implemented by the Republicans in charge of the White House and Congress probably had some effect. That said, the number of new jobs gained since passage of the Republican-backed tax bill in December 2017 is pretty similar in scale to those racked up by both President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump going back to 2010. McConnell is correct on the number. From January to May 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a net increase of 1.037 million jobs. That works out to about 207,000 more net jobs a month. But rather than being a turnaround from weak to strong, that amount of job creation is roughly in line with the gains in each of the past nine years. Here’s a chart showing the month-to-month job gains since the start of 2008. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com And here’s a chart showing the job gains for every January-to-May period in recent years. Since 2010 — the year the Great Recession began to wane and the recovery began — every January-to-May period saw an average monthly job gain of between 160,000 and 236,000. The performance for 2018 was slightly higher than the average, but pretty typical. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, came to a similar conclusion. He looked at all 96 overlapping five-month periods from May 2010 to April 2018 to see how many of those five-month periods saw job creation grow at a faster rate than the first five months of this year. He found that employment increased faster than the most recent five-month period 47 percent of the time, and slower 53 percent of the time. In other words, the past five months were pretty ordinary. "So, job growth since December 2017 does not look exceptional compared with job growth throughout the current economic expansion," Burtless said. Burtless said he didn’t doubt that the changes to the tax code could have had an effect on job creation. But he said it’s hard to measure how much. "In the absence of the tax cut, job growth might have been weaker than what we actually saw," he said. "My guess is that the tax cut probably boosted employment growth at least a bit. It’s just too soon to be sure, and we’ll probably never know with very much confidence." Still, he added, "it is not very convincing to claim recent job growth has been particularly remarkable." Our ruling McConnell said, "The bottom line is clear: Under the policies of this unified Republican government, American workers, families, and business owners are achieving economic growth that is unmatched in recent memory. … More than 1 million new jobs have been created just since we passed tax reform last December." Officially, it’s 1,037,000 new jobs — and it’s likely that the tax cut had some positive impact. However, it’s questionable to suggest that job growth in the past five months has been especially strong, or that recent rates of job-creation represent some kind of turnaround from a poor performance earlier. Job growth in the past five months is in line with the gains seen in previous five-month periods and in previous January-to-May periods going back nine years. We rate the statement Half True. Correction: The original version of this fact-check misstated the last year the national unemployment rate was 3.8 percent. It was 2000.

pomt-13060	Says Scott Walker left college "under an ethical cloud for having tried to fix" the election for student body president.	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/18/howard-dean/one-ex-presidential-candidates-attack-another-scot/	In a post-mortem a week after the presidential election, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, the onetime chairman of the Democratic National Committee, offered a biting assessment of why Donald Trump won. "What this was, was basically a populist revolution," Dean said Nov. 15, 2016 on National Public Radio’s "Morning Edition." "Luckily we have a democracy here, so nobody got killed." Dean’s views are relevant because he ran for president in 2004 and because he is running again to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee, which says needs a strategy to win over the white, working-class voters who were pivotal in Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton. But what caught our attention was the interview’s surprising turn toward Wisconsin, when host David Greene asked about Gov. Scott Walker, who briefly ran for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination before dropping out in September 2015. Dean responded with a claim we want to check: Greene: You made some news in early stages of the campaign. You suggested that Wisconsin’s governor, Scott Walker, would not make the best presidential candidate or president because he hadn’t gone to college. That feels like the kind of thing that might really alienate the kinds of working-class voters who the Democratic Party needs to get back. Dean: I think I was referring to the way that he left college, which was under an ethical cloud for having tried to fix the presidential election for the presidency of his college. Greene: So, that was misreported, you’re saying. Dean: No, it wasn’t misreported. I said he wasn’t fit to be president because he didn’t finish college because he cheated, basically. So, Dean claims Walker left college "under an ethical cloud for having tried to fix" the election for student body president. It’s an attack similar to others we’ve evaluated before. Walker’s college days The definitive piece on Walker’s time at Marquette University is a PolitiFact Wisconsin article from 2013 that examined questions about how Walker left the Catholic university in Milwaukee. The election Dean referred to was for student body president in 1988, when Walker was a sophomore. The winner would not only preside over the government, but get a scholarship and expense money. Among other things, Walker pledged safer streets around campus and bringing in cool bands like INXS and REM. The "cheating" Dean alluded to occurred after the Marquette Tribune student newspaper endorsed Walker’s opponent, though it said Walker was qualified. Students said they’d seen Walker campaign workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings. And Walker’s camp plastered campus with an election-eve flier criticizing his opponent’s political tactics. In turn, the Tribune published an election-day editorial headlined, "Walker unfit," and he lost in a landslide. But there was no evidence that the election tiff, or anything else, led to Walker being forced out of Marquette, or that he was barred from participating in campus elections. Marquette confirmed that he was a student in good standing throughout his time at Marquette, including when he left school two years later, as a senior, without getting his degree. He has said he left to accept a job offer from the American Red Cross to do marketing and fundraising. Prior False claims Aside from the article, we’ve also fact checked three statements regarding Walker’s college days. You might see a pattern here. December 2013: We rated False a claim by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college "not long after" he was "kicked out of student elections" at Marquette. March 2015: We rated False Walker’s own claim that he had "unsealed" his Marquette records. He took only the very limited step of authorizing the school to confirm that he was in good standing during his time at Marquette and that he voluntarily withdrew. We haven’t seen any transcripts or other records. August 2015: We rated False a claim in Facebook posts that Walker "had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating." We noted that because Walker had not released his transcripts, some still questioned his move to leave college early, but there was no evidence to prove any part of the claim. Dean’s staff, meanwhile, did not respond to our requests for information to back his claim. Our rating Dean said Walker left college "under an ethical cloud for having tried to fix" the election for student body president. When Walker was a student at Marquette, there were allegations that his supporters confiscated copies of a student newspaper that endorsed Walker's opponent for student government president. But the available evidence shows no action was taken against Walker regarding the newspaper incident. And Walker was officially in good standing throughout his time at Marquette, including when he left school early, without a degree, to take a job. We rate Dean’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2af1ef0a-e990-409c-b995-61c993c2e5e2	None	Howard Dean	None	None	None	2016-11-18T07:30:00	2016-11-15	['None']
pomt-07818	"It is projected that 3.07 million people will use the train annually. Keep in mind that Amtrak's Acela train in Washington D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore only had 3.2 million riders in 2010."	/florida/statements/2011/feb/16/rick-scott/rick-scott-cites-amtrak-ridership-numbers-announci/	In his stunning but not totally unexpected announcement to reject $2.4 billion in federal money for high-speed rail, Florida Gov. Rick Scott hammered on rosy ridership projections that he believed weren't attainable. Scott said he was briefed on the most recent ridership studies that found 3.07 million riders would use the 84-mile rail line linking downtown Tampa to the Orlando International Airport. Previous studies said about 2.4 million riders would use the rail line in the first year. "Ridership and revenue projections are historically overly optimistic and would likely result in ongoing subsidies that state taxpayers would have to incur," Scott said during remarks announcing his decision on Feb. 16, 2011. He later offered evidence to back up his assertion that the rail line was, as he called it, high risk. "It is projected that 3.07 million people will use the train annually," Scott said. "Keep in mind that Amtrak's Acela train in Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore only had 3.2 million riders in 2010. And that market population is eight times the size of Tampa-Orlando." We wanted to check Scott's comparison between the I-4 corridor of Florida and the bustling northeast. Florida's high-speed line was projected to cost around $2.7 billion to build, with the federal government picking up all but about $300 million. The state originally had said it would put up the remaining funds, but legislators recently suggested that a private business be asked to absorb that cost as part of a contract to operate the rail system. Original ridership estimates said 2.4 million people would ride the system, with one-way ticket prices ranging between $15 and $30. A full third of those riders would use the train to move between Disney and Orlando International Airport. Under the original study, ridership was projected to grow to more than 3.5 million passengers per year by 2025. Scott cited an updated estimate on 3.07 million people per year. Governor's office spokesman Brian Hughes said Scott was briefed about the new estimate from the Florida Department of Transportation and that a copy of the formal study was not yet available. That leaves us to take Scott at his word. (We'll update this item if the number proves incorrect.) As for the Acela, Scott is talking about Amtrak's high-speed rail linking the major metro centers of the northeast United States. The train runs between Washington, D.C., and Boston, with stops in Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. The Acela generally has been considered one of the bright spots in Amtrak's portfolio. Nearly 72 percent of the Acela's 300 seats are selling on peak segments -- figures that have improved substantially over the past five years, the Washington Post reported. And while Amtrak relies on federal subsidies to stay in business, Amtrak officials maintain that the Acela line by itself is profitable. In fiscal year 2010, Amtrak said 3.22 million people rode the Acela, an increase of 200,000 riders compared to 2009. That puts Scott's comparison on solid footing, but it leaves out an important point. The Acela service is just part of the Amtrak system in the northeast. Along with the high-speed Acela, Amtrak operates a more traditional regional rail line connecting the major cities of the northeast. The regional rail line has more stops and is slower. In fiscal year 2010, Amtrak reported that an additional 7.15 million people rode the northeast regional rail line. Total, that means Amtrak trains are serving more than 10 million passengers in the northeast -- not the 3.2 million Scott cited. (For the record, Scott is right about the relative size of the two areas. The population of the Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the northeast is about a combined 38 million, compared to about 5 million for Tampa-Orlando.) In offering a reason for rejecting $2.4 billion in federal money for high-speed rail, Scott said the ridership projections were overly optimistic, and cited train service in the busy northeast corridor to prove his point. But Scott's reference to the high-speed Acela is only one form of service in that corridor, and he omitted the bigger chunk of Amtrak's passengers when comparing ridership. That's an important detail that would have added more context. We find this claim Half True.

pomt-02147	Says Virginia House Republicans are sacrificing $5 million a day in U.S. funds by refusing to expand Medicaid.	/virginia/statements/2014/may/05/democratic-party-virginia/virginia-democrats-says-state-giving-5-million-day/	Virginia is turning down a fortune in federal aid every day the Republican-led House of Delegates refuses to expand Medicaid, according to the state Democratic Party. "Today alone, @VAHouseGOP wasted $5 mil of our tax $ by refusing to #ClosetheGap," the Democratic Party tweeted on April 15. We decided to take a look at the $5 million-a-day figure, which has been uttered by a wide circle of politicians seeking to broaden Medicaid eligibility in Virginia, including Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, and Republican Sen. John Watkins of Powhatan. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, gives states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, about $16,104 in a one-person household and $21,707 in a two-person household. Uncle Sam will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the next three years and pay 90 percent of the cost down the road. The House has twice refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. A stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate is delaying passage of a two-year state budget. Ashley Bauman, a spokeswoman for the state Democratic Party, said the $5 million-a- day figure originates from The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a think tank that analyzes state policies with a focus on their effects on low- and moderate-income people. In February 2013, it released a one-page paper saying if Virginia expanded Medicaid eligibility by the start of 2014, "the state would be able to draw down about $5 million per day in federal funds." Michael Cassidy, president of the institute, told us it used 2012 estimates by the state’s Medicaid agency of the amount of federal money that would flow into Virginia if the Old Dominion began expansion on Jan. 1, 2014 -- the earliest date permissible. Such action would bring $2.99 billion of federal money into the state between the start of 2014 through June 30, 2015, the agency projected. The Commonwealth Institute then divided the $3 billion by the number of days in the span, 546. The daily cost to the federal government would be $5,494,505. But Virginia’s Medicaid agency has since lowered its estimate of expansion costs. Its actuary, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, found that the cost per new enrollee has been lower than expected in states that have expanded their programs. That’s because the new Medicaid recipients are less likely to be disabled or require long-term care than those who already had been receiving benefits. The new estimates were released in January 2014. Assuming that expansion in Virginia would begin this July 1, the state’s Medicaid agency estimated it would receive $1,264,366,699 in new federal payments through June 30, 2015. That breaks down to $3,464,018 a day. The total federal dollars will increase over the decade as more people enroll in expanded Medicaid. The agency projects it would receive an extra $1,655,080,206 from Washington during the state budget year that begins July 1, 2015. That breaks down to $4,522,077 a day. Our ruling The state Democratic Party says Virginia is losing out on $5 million a day in federal funding by not expanding its Medicaid program. It throws that figure at the feet of the Republican-led House of Delegates, which twice has rejected expansion. No doubt, there’s a tremendous amount of federal money at stake. As many as 400,000 Virginians could become eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare, and the U.S. would pay their entire health care costs through 2016. But the $5 million-a-day figure comes from an old state estimate. The most recent estimate of expansion costs, released in January, breaks down to about $3.5 million a day for the budget year that starts this July 1. The federal contribution would be about $4.5 million a day during the following budget year, starting in mid-2015. That’s lots of money, but not as much as the Democrats say the House is now bypassing. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11986	Ending the estate tax would "protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/28/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-about-estate-tax-sm/	During a speech in Indianapolis launching his proposal for tax overhaul legislation, President Donald Trump said that one element of the plan -- elimination of the estate tax -- would lift a burden on many family businesses and farms. "To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax," Trump said in his Sept. 27 speech. He continued, "That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you’ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won’t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax. ... The farmers in particular are affected. They have wonderful farms, but they can't pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm. … So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers." We’ve addressed the question of how many small businesses and farmers pay the estate tax in previous fact-checks, but Trump’s assertion that eliminating the estate tax would "protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer" goes well beyond what we’ve heard before. And the data doesn’t support it. The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. The estate tax was first established in 1916 to offset a decline in tariff revenue caused by the first World War, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Congress has tinkered with it many times throughout the years. In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from the tax, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent. However, family-owned farms and closely-held businesses may be able to pay less or pay in low-interest installments. So how many estates are affected by the tax? Not many, and the people who pay it are usually among the country’s richest families. For 2017, the Tax Policy Center estimated, based on past tax data and modeling, that 11,310 individuals will have estates big enough to file an estate tax return. "After allowing for deductions and credits, 5,460 estates will owe tax," the center concluded. "Over two-thirds of these taxable estates will come from the top 10 percent of income earners and close to one-fourth will come from the top 1 percent alone." The top 10 percent of income earners would pay 88 percent of estate tax revenues, the center found, while the richest 0.1 percent could pay 27 percent. How about small businesses and farms? The center projected that only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses would pay any estate tax in 2017. That would amount to about 1 percent of all payers of the estate tax that year. And the estate tax revenue from small businesses and farms, the center said, would amount to fifteen-hundredths of 1 percent of the total paid under the estate tax in 2017. So, getting rid of the estate tax would hardly "protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer," as Trump put it. Trump's claim doesn't hold up even if you account for small businesses and farms that would potentially benefit from elimination down the road. The number from the Tax Policy Center (80) only refers to the number of small businesses and farms that would have to pay the tax this year. Multiplying the amount of small business and farm-based estate taxpayers who are living today by deaths over the next 70 years would still just result in 5,600 small businesses or farms potentially relieved of the tax — vastly smaller than Trump’s "millions." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said that ending the estate tax would "protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer." That’s a ridiculously high estimate. Only 5,460 estates even pay the tax each year, according to a credible estimate, and of those, about 80 represented small businesses or farms. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-01116	Under the "cromnibus" law, taxpayers must guarantee "incredibly risky" derivatives deals made by the nation's largest banks.	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/07/mark-pocan/new-law-means-taxpayers-must-back-banks-incredibly/	Most of us don't deal in investments known as derivatives, but most of us use banks. That means we should worry about the so-called "cromnibus bill" passed recently by Congress, according to U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison. "Our taxpayer money will back them up on these incredibly risky ventures for the biggest banks out there that do these," Pocan said Dec. 17, 2014 on a Madison-area liberal talk show. So, Pocan is claiming that derivatives are "incredibly risky" financial ventures. And that the new federal law requires taxpayers to back up banks that lose money on them. "Cromnibus" As Pocan indicated, Congress approved a major bill that includes a provision affecting derivatives. The $1.1 trillion measure, signed by President Barack Obama the day before Pocan made his claim, avoided a government shutdown. In the word "cromnibus," the "cr" refers to a Continuing Resolution, or a stop-gap spending bill, to keep the Department of Homeland Security operating into February 2015. And omnibus refers to a catchall bill to fund the rest of the government, through September 2015. Derivatives Derivatives, as PolitiFact National has reported, are an unusual kind of an investment whose value depends on an underlying asset. For example: An airline has to buy jet fuel over the coming year to run its planes. If oil prices skyrocket, the airline loses money. So it enters into an agreement that will pay if oil prices increase, lowering its potential for losses. So, derivatives aren’t inherently bad or high-risk. But as the Washington Post’s Wonkblog has observed, before the 2008 financial crisis "Wall Street firms used more complicated derivative formulas to place risky bets on the mortgage market." They were at the center of the financial meltdown. The risk The financial crisis led to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One of its rules requires banks to push some derivatives trading into separate units that do not have access to federal deposit insurance. In other words, banks could continue to hold derivatives, but in special subsidiaries that didn’t benefit from government backing in the form of FDIC insurance. Since Dodd-Frank took effect, banks have sought to change that rule so they can once again use their deposits to underwrite some more complex derivative trades. And the cromnibus bill rolls back that Dodd-Frank provision. The libertarian Reason Foundation worried about the rollback: "The Dodd-Frank rule prevented traditional banks from betting on financial derivatives with federally insured deposits. The banks could still trade in such exotic securities, but they had to do so with their own capital stock, through non-bank affiliates unsecured by FDIC backing. The idea was to prevent future bailouts like the ones that took place" in 2008. Two national financial publications, however, saw more of a middle ground. Wall Street banks such as Citicorp and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. were "thrilled" with the change made by the cromnibus. But the measure "doesn’t completely let them off the hook," the Wall Street Journal wrote. The change would affect requirements under the Dodd-Frank law that banks spin off certain derivatives-trading activities into units that don’t enjoy access to the government safety net. But the banks would still have to spin off certain riskier derivative transactions "that helped bring American International Group Inc. to the brink of failure in the 2008 financial crisis." Similarly, the Fiscal Times concluded that the cromnibus provision does not mean "that when banks lose money on swaps and derivatives trades, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will have to make them whole. It also doesn’t suggest that, when a bank fails, the taxpayers have to bail out depositors. "The money the FDIC holds in the Deposit Insurance Fund, and uses to reimburse depositors in failed banks, doesn’t come from taxpayers. It comes from the banks themselves. Secondly, there is no sense in which the FDIC is on the hook to make banks whole if a swaps deal or derivatives trade goes bad. The FDIC insures deposits – hence the name – not the bank itself." New York University finance professor Stephen Figlewski, founding editor of the Journal of Derivatives, also staked out more of a middle ground in sizing up Pocan’s claim. Only a small number of the derivatives deals could be considered "incredibly risky," he told us, noting that because of other Dodd-Frank provisions, derivatives have become considerably less risky. And while it is true that taxpayers bear some risk, given that the government guarantees banks as a whole, the risk to taxpayers "is much less than (Pocan) wants you to think," Figlewski said. Louisiana State University finance professor Don Chance, the author of two books on derivatives, also told us Pocan’s claim is partly correct but goes too far. Our rating Pocan said that under the federal "cromnibus" law, taxpayers must guarantee "incredibly risky" derivatives deals made by the nation's largest banks. The federal spending measure does include a provision that makes it easier for banks to use federally insured funds to invest in some investments known as derivatives. But not all derivatives are considered high-risk investments, and there is disagreement over just how much risk the new provision poses for taxpayers. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2015-01-07T05:00:00	2014-12-17	['None']

pomt-09575	"We've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-says-lobbyists-have-been-excluded-policy-mak/	In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama touted his efforts to bar lobbyists from his administration. "We've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions," he said on Jan. 27, 2010. That rang a bell with us because we have tracked a campaign promise he made on that topic. He had promised that "No political appointees in an Obama-Biden administration will be permitted to work on regulations or contracts directly and substantially related to their prior employer for two years. And no political appointee will be able to lobby the executive branch after leaving government service during the remainder of the administration." We rated that one a Promise Broken because his policy has substantial loopholes that have allowed Obama to essentially decide when he wants to ignore the rule. He's right that on his first day in office, he signed an executive order to bar lobbyists from his administration. But the order also included a loophole — a "waiver" clause that allows former lobbyists to serve. Waivers are granted by the administration itself, so they are little more than the administration saying it's okay for the lobbyist to work for the administration. The executive order says a waiver may be granted if "the literal application of the restriction is inconsistent with the purposes of the restriction" or "it is in the public interest. ... The public interest shall include, but not be limited to, exigent circumstances relating to national security or to the economy." Another provision allows lobbyists to serve if they agree to recuse themselves from discussions related to their former jobs. Still, open government groups have given Obama high marks for reducing the number of lobbyists at the White House and for making the process more transparent than other administrations. "I think that by any fair measure ... the reported number is certainly much fewer," said Meredith McGehee, policy director for the Campaign Legal Center. "In fact, I'd say the waivers are good. It allows them to go in and say, 'Here's someone we think has unique skills.' " One of the first Obama appointees to get a waiver was William J. Lynn to be deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 position at the Pentagon. Lynn was a Raytheon lobbyist for six years, lobbying extensively on a broad range of defense-related issues. Jocelyn Frye, director of policy and projects in the Office of the First Lady, also got a waiver. Previously, Frye lobbied for the National Partnership for Women and Families from 2001 to 2008. The organization advocates for fairness in the workplace, access to health care and "policies that help women and men meet the dual demands of work and family." And Cecilia Muñoz, director of intergovernmental affairs in the Executive Office of the President, manages the White House's relationships with state and local governments and is a principal liaison to the Hispanic community. Formerly, Muñoz formerly lobbied for National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization. The White House has issued seven waivers to its ethics rules, which apply to lobbyists as well as to people who served as officers and directors of a company or organization. And agencies have issued 15. The White House has said these waivers are quite rare -- less than 1 percent of the thousands of appointments that have been made. What about those recusals we mentioned earlier? The administration has not made public how many of these have been issued. We do know that Mark Patterson, the chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, took one -- but that information was only released by the White House after lawmakers and media reports started asking questions. Public records show Patterson worked as a lobbyist for Goldman Sachs in 2008. Obama said that he has "excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs." But that's not the case. We know of at least four that have taken on policymaking roles in the Obama administration -- Frye's title even contains the word "policy." While these appointments may be few and far between, and while those who made the cut have signed special waivers, we give Obama a False on this claim.

pomt-02827	On changing the rules for filibusters on presidential nominees	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-among-flip-floppers-senates-nuclear-o/	"What (the American people) don't expect is for one party, be it Republican or Democrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet." Then-Sen. Barack Obama, remarks on Senate floor, April 13, 2005 "I support the step a majority of senators today took to change the way that Washington is doing business — more specifically, the way the Senate does business. What a majority of senators determined … is that they would restore the longstanding tradition of considering judicial and public service nominations on a more routine basis." President Obama, remarks on Senate efforts to confirm presidential nominees, Nov. 21, 2013 After years of threats and retreats by both parties, the Democratic Senate majority on Nov. 21, 2013, enacted a controversial rule change called the "nuclear option." The change eliminated the filibuster — a blockage of floor action, typically by the chamber’s minority party — for executive branch nominations as well as judicial appointments short of the Supreme Court. Under the new rule, the Senate only needs a 51-vote majority instead of a 60-vote supermajority to end a filibuster and move to a final vote on a nomination. The question of whether to change the rule has long divided the chamber’s majority and its minority. In fact, supporting or opposing the "nuclear option" has been much more closely linked to a senator’s position in the majority or the minority than whether they’re a Republican or Democrat. This means that both sides in this recent faceoff made different arguments than they had in previous iterations of the battle. Following the decision, President Barack Obama gave a press conference lauding and supporting the change, which was implemented with the support of all but a few Democrats and no Republicans. Yet the president had strongly condemned the maneuver during his own time as a senator. Time to take out the Flip-O-Meter! PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on whether the change is justified or not. It simply looks at whether they did, indeed, change their stated position. We’ll take a look back to 2005, when the partisan lineup was substantially different. President George W. Bush had recently won a second term, while his fellow Republicans had a majority in the Senate. (The House was also controlled by Republicans, but the House isn’t directly involved in the filibuster fight.) In the Senate, the Democratic minority had filibustered a number of Bush’s judicial appointments, displeasing Republicans, who seriously considered implementing the nuclear option that would allow them to confirm judges with a simple majority. The effort drew the outrage of Democrats, among them then-Sen. Barack Obama, who had won his seat the previous November: "What (the American people) don't expect is for one party, be it Republican or Democrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet," Obama said on the Senate floor in April 2013. He added, "If the right of free and open debate is taken away from the minority party and the millions of Americans who ask us to be their voice, I fear the partisan atmosphere in Washington will be poisoned to the point where no one will be able to agree on anything." The threat to go nuclear was eventually rescinded when a bipartisan group of senators – the "Gang of 14" – pledged to block the effort. Seven Democrats agreed to no longer support their party’s filibusters on judicial nominees, while seven Republicans promised not to vote with their colleagues to invoke the nuclear option. Fast-forward to 2013. Now, Democrats held the White House and a Senate majority. The Republican minority had been stalling nominations and appointments by Obama, including filibustering the nomination of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense. Senate Democrats decided to go nuclear after the Senate GOP made clear that they had no intention of allowing three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be filled. At that point, Senate Democrats took the opposite view they had taken in 2005. Led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., they successfully invoked the nuclear option in a near-party-line vote, 52-48. Obama flipped his position as well. In a statement supporting the rule change, he explained that it would bring the "longstanding tradition of considering judicial and public service nominations on a more routine basis." "A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the result of an election is not normal, and for the sake of future generations, we can't let it become normal, " Obama said. Our ruling In 2005, Obama strongly condemned a proposed Senate rule change by the Republican majority. This week, with a Democratic majority, he supported it. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-09465	"The lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less (on health care). ... To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/03/mitt-romney/romney-says-americans-pay-more-health-care-die-soo/	In his new book, No Apology, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney devotes a chapter to health care policy -- a topic that animated his tenure as governor of Massachusetts. Romney, working with a Democratic-dominated legislature, passed a health care overhaul that was designed to get his state as close to universal coverage as possible. Romney is now often discussed as a presidential candidate for 2012, which has forced him into an uncomfortable balancing act: He seeks to lead a party intent on blocking President Barack Obama's health care proposal, even though he himself enacted a plan that, according to many sources we interviewed earlier this year, shares much in common with what Obama is proposing. We looked through the health care chapter of Romney's book as well as transcripts of his recent media appearances, but we were unable to locate a clear, fact-checkable statement addressing the similarities and differences between the two bills. (He broached the issue on a number of occasions, but in each case he phrased his statements in such a way that made it difficult for us to subject them to the Truth-O-Meter.) So while Romney did not compare the Massachusetts plan with Obama's proposal, in his book he compared the U.S. system with other nations'. "The lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less" on health care, Romney wrote, adding, "To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner." The first place we looked was the statistical archive of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that represents 30 advanced, industrialized nations, mostly in Europe, Asia and North America. Scholars consider OECD figures to be among the most reliable for international comparisons on health care. First, we'll look at life expectancy -- the number of years someone born in a certain year can expect to live. The OECD's most recent figures, for either 2005 or 2006 (the year varies by country), show that the United States ranks 24th -- well under the average level for the 30 nations studied. Specifically, life expectancy in the United States was 77.8 years. That put it behind the following nations, in descending order: Japan (at 82.4 years in 2006), Switzerland, Iceland, Spain, Australia, Italy, France, Sweden, Norway, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Portugal and Denmark. Meanwhile, health and population economists at the World Health Organization devised another measure to gauge life expectancy -- disability-adjusted life expectancy, or how many years one can expect to live before becoming disabled by old-age illnesses. WHO did its last full-blown international comparison of DALE, as it is abberviated, in 2000, and the results are much the same. The United States ranked 24th on the WHO list with exactly 70 years of DALE. It trailed Japan (with 74.5), Australia, France, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg, Iceland, Finland, Malta, Germany and Israel. Now, we'll look at health care expenditures. There are two ways to measure this -- by expenditures per capita, or by expenditures as a percentage of GDP. However you measure it, we're No. 1 -- by a mile. Using the first measure, the OECD reports that the United States spent $7,290 on health care per capita in 2007. The only two other countries where per capita health care expenditures exceeded even $4,000 were Norway and Switzerland. Using the second measure, the United States spent more than 15 percent of GDP on health care in 2006, according to the OECD. Only Switzerland and France exceeded 11 percent. To take one extreme case, South Korea spends less than a quarter per capita of what the United States spends on health care -- yet its people, on average, live past 79 years of age, which is more than one full year longer than Americans do. Ali Mokdad, a professor in global health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, attributes the United States' poor showing in part to a lack of emphasis on preventive care. "We have fallen behind other countries in tackling the root causes of mortality and disease," Mokdad said. "We know, for example, that just reducing salt in people’s diets can save more than 100,000 lives a year, but there is much more discussion in this country about health insurance, which would save, at best, about half as many people." Whatever the reason, and however you measure it, Americans "spend more and die sooner," as Romney so bluntly put it. We rate his statement True.

pomt-15045	Every general City of Milwaukee employee "pays toward his or her pension, but approximately 88 percent of our police officers and firefighters do not."	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/30/tom-barrett/vast-majority-milwaukee-police-and-firefighters-ma/	Unlike every other City of Milwaukee employee, the vast majority of Milwaukee police officers and firefighters make no contributions to their pensions, Mayor Tom Barrett says. Strictly speaking, he’s right. But it’s not quite that simple. Barrett’s claim Presenting his 2016 budget to the Common Council on Sept. 22, 2015, Barrett said he would eliminate three unpaid furlough days that had been imposed on police officers as a cost-saving measure. He said that’s a cost to the city of $1.5 million. In return, the mayor wants the police officers union to agree, during collective bargaining with the city, to more pension contributions from police officers. (Firefighters have not had furlough days, but the city is seeking in contract negotiations more pension contributions from them, as well.) "Today we have a situation where each and every general city employee pays toward his or her pension," Barrett told the aldermen, "but approximately 88 percent of our police officers and firefighters do not." The numbers To check Barrett’s 88 percent claim, we asked for figures from the city pension office on what percentage of city employees make contributions -- as a portion of their pay -- toward their pensions. There are four groups of employees. Here’s the breakdown: Employee group Percentage of employees who contribute to pensions General employees 100% Police officers 11.6% Firefighters 12.3% Elected officials 100% So, Barrett is correct: 88.4 percent of police officers -- along with and 87.7 percent of firefighters -- do not make direct contributions to their pensions. Here’s how that came to be. Pension vs wages, Act 10 As we’ve noted, generally speaking, pension funds are built by contributions made from employees and from employers. But it has long been the case in Wisconsin that many public employers, such as Milwaukee, have covered both the employee and employer contributions. Jerry Allen, executive director of the city pension system, told us that around 1970, unions for the various City of Milwaukee employee groups negotiated contracts in which employees made concessions on wage increases in exchange for the city picking up their pension contributions. John Barmore, vice president of the Milwaukee Professional Fire Fighters union, told us the city sought the so-called "pickup" because both inflation and pay raises were relatively high in the early 1970s. By accepting lower raises, employees have, in effect, continued contributing to their pensions even though no direct employee payments are made, he said. Mike Crivello, president of the Milwaukee Police Association union, made the same point. In 2010, the City of Milwaukee began requiring general city employees hired in 2010 or later to make pension contributions. Then in 2011, Gov. Scott Walker’s Act 10 became law. It requires state and local government employees in Wisconsin -- except for police, firefighters and other public safety workers -- to make pension contributions, as well as to pay higher health insurance premiums. For the City of Milwaukee, that meant general city employees hired before 2010 also had to start making pension contributions. The city also used Act 10 to require that police officers and firefighters hired on or after Oct. 3, 2011 contribute 7 percent of their wages toward their pensions. But it remains to be seen whether unions representing police and firefighters will agree in their contract bargaining to Barrett’s call to have officers and firefighters hired before Oct. 3, 2011 make pension contributions. Barrett has not indicated that he would reinstate furlough days for police officers if they don’t agree to the pension contributions. But he has suggested that the pension issue could affect another priority of the police union: adding more officers. "So I’m fully prepared to have a meaningful conversation about police staffing levels," said in his budget address. "What I’m not going to do is cut public health nurses. I am not going to slow down the reconstruction of neighborhood libraries, gut our increased commitments to infrastructure or interrupt our efforts to build strong neighborhoods and put people to work. The best option is the fair option: everyone should be contributing toward his or her pension." Our rating Barrett said every general City of Milwaukee employee "pays toward his or her pension, but approximately 88 percent of our police officers and firefighters do not." The Act 10 collective bargaining law, adopted in 2011, requires most public employees in Wisconsin, including all general City of Milwaukee employees, to make contributions toward their pensions. Because the law exempts police and firefighters, only Milwaukee police officers and firefighters hired since late 2011 make pension contributions -- the vast majority, 88 percent, do not.

pomt-05354	"Just remember this: the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/11/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-claims-national-health-care-refor/	Many provisions of the national health care reform law have yet to take effect, but U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg recently made it sound like the landmark legislation already has brought coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans. The Democratic senator visited the Rutgers-Camden campus last week to discuss an effort to prevent student loan interest rates from increasing. But in response to a question about health care coverage, Lautenberg touted the benefits of the reform signed into law in March 2010. "Just remember this: the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before," Lautenberg told the crowd on May 3. The number cited by Lautenberg is solid, but the timing is off, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The health care reform is estimated to provide insurance coverage to about 30 million additional people, but not until after many of the law’s provisions are implemented in the years ahead. At the earliest, the number of newly insured Americans would reach 30 million in 2016, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In a statement, Lautenberg spokesman Caley Gray responded to our findings: "The President's health care reform bill is working for millions of people. It's going to put at least 30 million people on the rolls and millions in New Jersey have already benefited from new access, lower costs and better service." Now, let’s explain some of the major features of the health care reform. Signed into law by President Barack Obama, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes various measures to boost health insurance coverage. Some of the most notable provisions are the individual mandate; the expansion of Medicaid; and the creation of insurance exchanges. The individual mandate is the requirement that residents have health insurance, with certain exemptions. Medicaid eligibility will be expanded to individuals under 65 years of age with income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase private health insurance through the new exchanges. Each of those provisions takes effect on Jan. 1, 2014. Given the impact of those provisions, the health care reform is projected to increase the number of nonelderly individuals with health insurance by 30 million as of 2016, according to estimates released in March by the Congressional Budget Office. That number would increase to 33 million in 2021, the budget office said. However, the forthcoming decision of the U.S. Supreme Court could throw off those projections. The nation’s highest court heard arguments in March about, among other issues, the constitutionality of the individual mandate. If the individual mandate is eliminated, the budget office has stated about 16 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2021. Our ruling During his May 3 appearance on the Rutgers-Camden campus, Lautenberg made this claim about the health care reform law: "Just remember this: the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before." Based on the latest projections, the health care reform may lead to insurance coverage for about 30 million additional Americans -- but contrary to what Lautenberg suggested, that has not happened yet. The increase in newly insured people is estimated to reach 30 million in 2016. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04510	Says Austin voters can approve seven bond propositions "without raising taxes."	/texas/statements/2012/oct/04/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-voters-can-approve-bond-propo/	Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell floated a pocketbook reason to support bond proposals placed on the November 2012 ballot by the Austin City Council. "These seven bond proposals offer Austinites an important opportunity to invest in our community’s future without raising taxes," Leffingwell said in an Aug. 31, 2012, press release from a group backing the bonds. Leffingwell, who chairs the Unity PAC urging voter support of the bond propositions, aired his reference to taxes less than two weeks before he voted, alone among council members, against approval of the city’s new $3.1 billion budget. At the body’s Sept. 11, 2012, meeting, Leffingwell said the council had failed to try hard enough to scale back a planned property tax increase. Under the budget, which took effect Oct. 1, the property tax rate grows from 48.11 cents per $100 of property value to 50.29 cents. That means a city tax bill of $897 for the owners of a median-value Austin home of $178,327, a $20 increase over the previous year. So, would approval of the $385 million in proposed bonds not raise taxes? The proposed bonds reflect what remains from an original wish list of $1.3 billion in possible bond-backed projects, the Austin American-Statesman has reported. The balloted bonds would pay to renovate libraries, improve parks, repair roads and build or repair low-income housing. They amount to Austin's first full-scale bond package since 2006. By email, Unity PAC spokesman Mark Nathan said Leffingwell’s no-tax-increase claim stems from a December 2011 analysis presented by city staffers to the council showing that some $385 million in general-obligation bonds could be issued without requiring an increase in the city’s existing debt service property tax rate, meaning the rate needed to generate enough revenue to pay the bonds’ principal and interest costs. Indeed, a chart in the presentation indicates that the issuance of $385 million in bonds would keep the debt tax rate steady. The chart indicates that issuing up to $725 million in bonds would require up to a 3-cent increase in the debt rate. However, another chart in the presentation indicates that if $385 million in bonds were issued, the average homeowner would still pay $38 more in city taxes as of 2016. The chart says that would be the increase in city taxes on a $200,000 home, taking into account modest expected increases in assessed values. By email, Nathan told us there is no certainty property valuations will go up, so it’s possible taxpayers would not pay more in taxes due to valuations. The Statesman’s Dec. 17, 2011, news article drawing on the presentation quotes Greg Canally, a city finance officer, explaining that the debt tax rate could be kept steady despite the issuance of $385 million in fresh bonds because the city is continually retiring previously issued debt. Overall, the story says, the city's tax rate at the time was 48.11 cents per $100 valuation, including the 12.6 cents to pay debt on previously approved bonds. Of late, the debt tax rate is 12 cents, an adjustment driven by an uptick in home valuations, the city says. In his email, Nathan reminded that council members only hold sway over the city’s tax rates. Property valuations are overseen by the Travis Central Appraisal District. "That's why, in my experience, it's almost always the vernacular of elected officials, and very frequently of the media as well, to mean ‘tax rates’ when speaking of ‘taxes,’" Nathan wrote. Nathan noted the Statesman’s Aug. 15, 2012, news article on the council giving preliminary approval to putting the bond issues on the ballot, which included: "The council wants a bond package no larger than $385 million because that number will not require a property tax increase." The story also brings up the possible tax impact of the bond proposals not happening: "If the bond package isn't placed on the ballot or doesn't pass, the debt portion of the city's tax rate would probably stay roughly the same over the next few years, then could go down in 2015, 2016 and 2017, city budget staffers said. They have no estimate of what the decrease would be." In a telephone interview, Canally told us that if none of the bond propositions pass, the debt tax rate would drop about two cents over about five years starting in 2015, "all other things being equal." On a $200,000 house, the resulting city-tied tax reduction would be about $40, he said. A key factor would be changes in home valuations. If valuations surge, there would be less pressure on tax rates, while if valuations drop, there would be pressure to raise rates. Canally said that since the early 2000s, the city’s debt tax rate has dropped from about 21 cents per $100 valuation as a result of increases in home valuations. By email, Nathan agreed the debt tax rate would drop two cents should the bond propositions fail, presuming the city issues outstanding bonds previously approved by voters as planned; city assumptions about assessed valuations hold true; and voters authorize and the city issues no additional general-obligation debt. Our ruling Leffingwell said the bond propositions offer an opportunity to invest "without raising taxes." No tax-rate increase would be required. But this statement overlooks the fact that taxes paid by homeowners and others would still be going up a bit, presuming expected increases in property valuations. Also unsaid: The debt rate would decrease two cents as of 2015 if the propositions fail to pass. Leffingwell’s claim leaves out important details. It rates Half True.

pomt-12429	It is a myth that Florida's education legislation was "negotiated in secret."	/florida/statements/2017/may/17/richard-corcoran/florida-house-speaker-richard-corcoran-misleads-ab/	Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran says his critics are wrong that the main education bill was hammered out behind closed doors. "Time to end the myth of ‘legislation negotiated in secret.’ #transparency #HB7069 #PutKidsFirst," Corcoran tweeted May 12. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Corcoran tweeted that it is "fiction" to say that the "best and brightest teachers and principals provision in HB 7069 was NOT made public." "Fact: these provisions were contained in HB 7069 which was filed on March 10, 2017 passed two committees and the House 79-38 on April 13th, 2017." We found the original legislation about teacher bonuses for the "best and brightest" was unveiled and voted on in public; however, the final version of the bill and important details were negotiated out of the public eye. Mammoth education bill hammered out at end of session The legislative session began in March with dozens of education bills in the House and Senate. Many bills moved their way through the traditional legislative process of public committee hearings and votes. But at the end of the session, at least 55 bills were crammed into one mammoth $419 million, 278-page education bill negotiated by legislative leaders. The final outcome is now in the hands of Gov. Rick Scott, who can veto the entire education bill or sign it in the coming weeks. In March, both chambers produced bills -- HB 7069 in the House and SB 1552 in the Senate -- to expand eligibility criteria for bonuses to top public school teachers under the Florida Best and Brightest Teacher Scholarship Program. Lawmakers wanted to add in bonuses for principals, and the House budget proposal called for $214 million to the expanded program in the 2017-18 budget, up from the $49 million this year. Two House committees voted in favor of the bill at public meetings on March 10 and March 29. Although senators also expressed interest in expanding the program, the Senate’s initial budget proposal included no such funding. The decision was part of a strategic move in hopes that the Senate would get some of its priorities in later negotiations with the House. On April 13, the House version passed the House (79-38). The Senate voted unanimously -- but not to pass the bill, rather to send it to budget conference. HB 7069 was among four K-12 policy bills sent into conference negotiations. Conference negotiations between members of both the House and Senate are common to work out differences in spending allocations, but it is unusual to resolve policy disagreements. Watchdogs raised concerns that policy and funding decisions would be hashed out in secret. Legislative leaders repeatedly vowed a transparent process. But by Saturday, April 29 -- three days before lawmakers needed to agree on a final total state budget in order to end session on time -- House and Senate leaders still hadn’t released proposed language to be discussed, including about the teacher bonuses. House and Senate negotiators -- Hialeah Republican Rep. Manny Diaz Jr. and Altamonte Springs Republican Sen. David Simmons -- told the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald that they would not release draft language until the House and Senate were ready to exchange formal offers. While Florida’s Sunshine Law bans city or county commissioners from meeting in secret to hash out legislation, two legislators are allowed to meet in private under limited circumstances before voting in public on legislation. While a budget conference subcommittee held a brief public meeting that Saturday morning to trade spending offers, they revealed little about what their intentions were for the policy bills. Ultimately, legislators couldn’t agree on the overall state budget on time, which led to an extension of the session from Friday, May 5 to Monday, May 8. During the final week of the regularly scheduled session, Corcoran and Negron -- with help from other key lawmakers, such as Simmons, Diaz and House Education chairman Michael Bileca, R-Miami -- negotiated in private a catch-all education bill that included a final version of the teacher bonuses language, the policies of the other K-12 budget bills and myriad other proposals unrelated to spending. That final version of HB 7069 was made public for the first time on Friday evening May 5. Several newspapers -- including the Herald and Times, the Tallahassee Democrat, the Gainesville Sun, the Orlando Sentinel -- wrote that final legislation was hammered out behind closed doors. "State lawmakers flushed promises of transparency down the toilet," wrote the Gainesville Sun editorial board. There were a few differences in the teacher bonus program as outlined in the final version in May, compared to the original House version in March. The most significant change -- and one not previously contemplated or discussed in public -- was that the final version added the ability for teachers to get bonuses over the next three years of $1,200 if they were "highly effective" or up to $800 if rated "effective." Corcoran and Negron publicly discussed HB 7069 for 10 minutes May 5 without any substantive debate of the contents before formally accepting it. The Times/Herald submitted several questions to Corcoran’s office May 6 after the final language of HB 7069 was made public. An explanation provided in the speaker’s response: "Negotiating solutions when there are significant differences between the two chambers on an issue in conference sometimes requires adding new language and bringing in issues that were not part of the budget conference. That is often what it takes to reach agreement and is inherent to the conference process." On May 8, both chambers met for the final day of the session. Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, the Senate’s appropriations chairman, took responsibility for allowing HB 7069 to balloon so much. But he urged passage anyway. The House (73-36) and Senate (20-18) both voted in favor of the final compromise version of HB 7069 that was decided in budget conference. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo defended the process that led to the final version. He said that Corcoran’s tweet didn’t mention anything about discussions during conference. "I get folks don’t like it, but because it wasn’t talked about during a public budget conference debate doesn’t mean it wasn’t publicly discussed for months beforehand," he said. The same argument could be made about any other type of legislation -- from the environment to health care -- if it was discussed during a conference, he said. Our ruling Corcoran tweeted that it is a myth that education legislation was "negotiated in secret." Corcoran pointed to the filing of HB 7069 in the House on March 10 and its passage in two committees and then the House on April 13. While part of the legislative process was done in public, Corcoran omits that the final dealmaking between the House and Senate was largely done behind closed doors. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02420	"The Russians didn’t wear uniforms when they came in" to Ukraine.	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/04/chris-matthews/hardball-host-chris-matthews-says-russian-troops-a/	Hardball host Chris Matthews is, like the rest of us, keeping up with what’s going down between Ukraine and Russia from half a world away, piecing together storylines from news stories, social media, TV clips and photos. His impression is both sides are treading lightly as they anticipate the other’s next move, he said during a March 3, 2014, episode of Hardball on MSNBC: Watching it from a distance, it’s amazing, you see a couple things. I noticed that a lot of people in the new government in Kiev were walking around the palace and the presidency over there in Kiev wearing ski masks. They weren’t confident at all they weren’t being provocative to Moscow. And secondly I noticed the Russians didn’t wear uniforms when they came in (to Ukraine). Both sides seem to be aware that this is going to go on for a while and they’re hedging their bets a bit. It’s fascinating. The insiders seem to know that this isn’t going to be over for a while. We were interested in Matthews' claim that "The Russians didn’t wear uniforms when they came in" to Ukraine. Over the weekend, reporters for the New York Times, Reuters and Guardian wrote of Russia unloading troops in the Crimea region of Ukraine, a peninsula that includes many people who identify themselves as Russian. Crimea was part of the Soviet Union until 1954, when Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave the territory to Ukraine (more history in this fact-check). Russia maintains a military base in the Sevastopol under a post-Soviet breakup treaty between Russia and Ukraine. News outlets wrote of Russian-speaking, armed soldiers unloaded from armored vehicles whose service uniforms "bore no insignia" though their vehicles featured Russian military plates of the country’s Black Sea force. The troops "swarmed the major thoroughfares of Crimea," wrote the New York Times, shutting down the area’s main airport and surrounding government buildings. Despite their lack of traditional military ID, "there was no doubt among residents they were deployed from the nearby Russian base to take up position outside a Ukrainian border guard base," Reuters wrote. The Guardian estimates 16,000 "pro-Russian troops" are controlling Crimea and blockading Ukrainian bases. In a March 4 news conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied Russian troops were occupying Crimea as he said that Russia would only resort to military action "for the protection of the Ukrainian people." Putin chastised the U.S. government for interfering in Ukraine’s affairs like a scientist with rats. "There are many military uniforms. Go into any local shop and you can find one," Putin said of the so-called pro-Russia "local defense forces," according to a translation in the Times. Foreign journalists have challenged Putin’s claims, often just by asking talkative, possibly bored soldiers if they are Russian military. Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker tweeted the soldiers were "forced to keep up ‘volunteer’ charade," though one "chatty chap" admitted he was from Russia "to defend against ‘terror’ " in a video. Experts we consulted said there’s no doubting the troops are Russian. "It’s clear these are Russian special forces in terms of their performance and in terms of their bearing," said Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Heritage Foundation. Cohen said he was born in Crimea and has friends there who have told him the military men have identified themselves as Russian elite troops. So why wouldn’t Putin say so? Or why won’t Russian soldiers wear patches identifying them as Russian? Plausible deniability, Cohen said. "Russians can still deny these are forces that are working under their direction, so it may facilitate walking this back," Cohen said. There would be nothing new for Russian special forces to be out of uniform in Crimea in an effort to blend in with the locals, said Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University's Department of History and Government, adding the U.S. military does that to operate secretly as well. But since it’s cold over there, he is also seeing pictures of Russian soldiers bundled up in winter clothes, which are less likely to have unit insignias than combat uniforms, he said. "It's also possible that they were ordered to take off unit insignias in order to either confuse the Ukrainians initially or to try and appear a bit less threatening," Janda said. "In any case, I think it's an overstatement to stay the Russians were not wearing military uniforms. The safer, more accurate statement would be that some Russian soldiers appear to have not been wearing uniforms." Janda said the size of the Russian military presence in Crimea "has surely been augmented" since the original reports of 16,000. From a distance, it’s hard to tell. Janda agrees with Matthews’ overall assertion that neither side wants a war, and the Russians "are going in as ‘light’ as they can. ... They just aren't going to risk losing access to the Crimea." Our ruling Matthews said, "the Russians didn’t wear uniforms when they came in" to Ukraine. To be certain, they are wearing uniforms. But we think a reasonable person would infer Matthews was talking about uniforms that identified them as Russians. That does require a bit of clarification. So we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-13054	Says Donald Trump's presidential victory was "an electoral landslide."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/21/reince-priebus/despite-losing-popular-vote-donald-trump-won-elect/	The margin of Donald Trump’s presidential victory might be merely academic -- were it not for his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and fellow Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan declaring that Trump had won a mandate. In his own way, Wisconsinite Reince Priebus, the president-elect’s newly named chief of staff, also hammered home the idea of a surpassing victory. On Nov. 14, 2016, six days after the election, the Republican National Committee chairman repeated the same word on three network television shows: Landslide. Priebus put it this way on ABC’s "Good Morning America": "And look what happened on Tuesday. I mean, it was an electoral landslide and the American people agreed that Donald Trump’s vision for America is what this country has been waiting for." There was considerable political earth shaking after Trump’s triumph over Democrat Hillary Clinton, even though she won the popular vote. But was Trump’s win in the Electoral College, the result that mattered, a landslide? How the Electoral College works Voters cast ballots for candidates, but it is electors from each state who actually elect the president. That’s the way it’s always been in the United States. The states are assigned a number of electors based on population. The total number of electors is 538, with each state being assigned electors based on population. Thus, you need half-plus-one -- the magic 270 votes -- to win in the Electoral College. (Some Democrats want to scrap the Electoral College, but some Republicans have also backed election through popular vote. After Trump’s win, PolitiFact Georgia rated True a claim that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a major Trump supporter, had previously backed using the popular vote.) Go here to see a 1-minute video on how the Electoral College works. The Electoral College doesn’t sign, seal and deliver the final tallies until Dec. 19, 2016, a month and a day before Trump’s inauguration. But the margin, according to the Associated Press, is Trump 290 and Clinton 232, with Michigan’s 16 electoral votes still not officially determined. Trump holds a lead in Michigan, however, and is expected to win the state. So, giving him the benefit of the doubt, the electoral votes would be: Trump: 306 Clinton: 232 Does that constitute a landslide? Some really big landslides Landslide, of course, is not technically defined. When we asked for information to back Priebus’ claim, the Republican National Committee merely recited the electoral figures and repeated that it was a landslide. Countering Priebus, the Wisconsin Democratic Party pointed out that six times since 1952 alone, the winning candidate won substantially more electoral votes than Trump: President Election year Electoral votes won Ronald Reagan (R) 1984 525 Reagan 1980 489 Richard Nixon (R) 1972 520 Lyndon Johnson (D) 1964 486 Dwight Eisenhower (R) 1956 457 Eisenhower 1952 442 Democrat Barack Obama’s totals, by the way, were 332 in 2012 and 365 in 2008. These totals, too, are more than Trump. Still, just because some candidates won by larger margins doesn’t necessarily mean Trump didn’t win in a landslide. So, we consulted 10 experts. Other views One said it was close to a landslide, but none said Trump had crossed the threshold. Costas Panagopoulos, director of the Center for Electoral Politics and Democracy at Fordham University, said Trump’s winning 57 percent of the Electoral College vote makes it "pretty close" to a landslide. He said 60 percent is generally considered to be a landslide, at least when it comes to the popular vote. But the others all said Trump fell short. Taegan Goddard, founder of Political Wire, said the threshold should be 400 electoral votes. He said that was a figure often cited, prior to the election, when there were predictions of a Clinton landslide. Alex Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, went much lower -- 330 -- though still above what Trump has earned. Keyssar, former chairman of the Social Science Research Council's National Research Commission on Voting and Elections, acknowledged the figure is "pure impression." Political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the Trump margin comes up short in another way. From 1952 to 2012, the winning candidate got an average of 73 percent of the electoral votes, well above Trump’s 57 percent. "Losing the popular vote also takes the shine off any Electoral College victory," Burden added, a point echoed by Herb Asher, a political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University. Also voting no on landslide were John Woolley, a University of California, Santa Barbara political science professor and co-founder of the American Presidency Project; and Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Sabato also runs Sabato’s Crystal Ball, an election analysis website. "Calling a 306 electoral-vote victory a ‘landslide’ is ridiculous," Sabato told us. "Trump’s Electoral College majority is actually similar to John F. Kennedy’s 303 in 1960 and Jimmy Carter’s 297 in 1976. Has either of those victories ever been called a landslide? Of course not — and JFK and Carter actually won the popular vote narrowly." Added Boston University history professor Bruce Schulman : "To say that Trump won by a landslide, then Obama won by even bigger landslides." Indeed, the narrower of Obama’s two wins -- in 2012 with 332 electoral votes -- was described at the time as not being a landslide by The Atlantic, Politico, conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg, Fox News’ Brit Hume and others. Our rating Priebus said Trump’s win was "an electoral landslide." But aside from the fact Trump lost the popular vote, his margin in the Electoral College isn’t all that high, either. None of the 10 experts we contacted said Trump’s win crosses that threshold. We rate Priebus’ claim False.

pomt-10338	Obama "hasn't been to Iraq in years."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/21/john-mccain/true-on-the-day-the-ad-was-released-/	An ad for Sen. John McCain makes the case that Sen. Barack Obama is a foreign policy lightweight who has voted against funding for troops. "Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan," an announcer states. "He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops — positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working." See our story for details about the ad's other claims. Here we'll look at the statement that Obama "hasn't been to Iraq in years." The McCain campaign released this ad on Friday, July 18, 2008, a day before Obama was to leave for a widely anticipated trip to Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel. Before that, the last time Obama had been in Iraq was in January 2006. McCain, on the other hand, has been to Iraq eight times as of this writing. The McCain-Obama Iraq tally is now 8 to 2. One catch to this claim is that it was accurate when the ad was released on Friday, but was no longer accurate by Monday, July 21. Because the campaign knew its claim was going to be invalidated in a few days, we deduct one point and call it Mostly True.

pomt-13422	"Over the past eight years, black youth unemployment is up."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/21/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-weak-over-past-eight-years-black-youth-unempl/	In recent weeks, Donald Trump has sought to make inroads with African-American voters, a group that overwhelmingly favors Hillary Clinton. Trump has argued that after decades of loyalty to the Democratic Party, black voters should consider voting Republican because the system is broken and "what the hell do you have to lose?" Seeking to boost Trump’s message, the Republican National Committee sent a blast email on Sept. 17, 2016, responding to Clinton’s remarks at a dinner for the Congressional Black Caucus. (It’s archived here on the RNC website.) A portion of the email said, "Over the past eight years, black youth unemployment is up." This struck us as odd, because the overall unemployment rate has plunged from a high of 10 percent in October 2009 to 4.9 percent in August 2016. Has African-American youth unemployment really moved in precisely the opposite direction as the nation as a whole? We’ve heard talking points like this before, from Democrat Bernie Sanders and Trump himself. Their veracity really depends on how they were phrased. In this case, the RNC is cherry-picking and misinterpreting old research by the liberal Economic Policy Institute, specifically a chart that tracked the "high school graduates age 17–20 who are not enrolled in further schooling." According to the chart, the rate rose from 44.8 percent in January 2009 to 51.3 percent in March 2015. But unemployment is not underemployment. "High school graduates age 17–20 who are not enrolled in further schooling" isn’t the same thing as all black youths. And unemployment generally has declined since March 2015. "I'm sure the RNC can cherry-pick an age group or an ‘underemployment rate’ definition for which the situation has worsened," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. But using the standard BLS statistics, he said, the labor-market situation for African-American youths "has improved since the president took office." Checking the numbers We looked at the unemployment rate over time for two groups of African-Americans -- one broader (ages 16 to 24) and the other narrower (20 to 24). Both ranges would seem to fit the email’s broad definition of "black youth." Here’s what we found when we took the annual average black youth unemployment rate for ages 16 to 24 -- the broader of the two age ranges we looked at -- going back to 2009. This shows that African-American youth unemployment has been going down -- not up -- consistently since 2010 (Obama’s second year in office) and is well below what it was in 2009 (his first year in office). To be precise, the average unemployment rate for black youth fell from nearly 29 percent in 2009 to a bit below 18 percent in 2016. That’s a decline of more than one-third in the unemployment rate over the roughly eight-year period. In fact, 2016 marks the lowest August rate on record since the statistics were first calculated in the early 1970s, said Jed Kolko, chief economist for the jobs site Indeed. The pattern also holds for African-Americans age 20 to 24. Here’s the equivalent graph: Using this narrower age range, the average annual black youth unemployment rate fell from about 25 percent in 2009 to about 15 percent in 2016. So it fell by about two-fifths of its original level over eight years. Our ruling In an email blast, the Republican National Committee said that "over the past eight years, black youth unemployment is up." The RNC has pointed to one narrow comparison that shows a higher rate today than in 2009. But the email seeks to paint this specific subset as illustrative of all "black youth unemployment," and it’s not. The broadest, most standard statistics show that black youth unemployment has declined by one-third or more since the 2009, when Obama took office. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/42b72614-de5e-4757-9548-66e3ee7895f1	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2016-09-21T10:00:00	2016-09-17	['None']
pomt-00722	The money the Clinton Foundation took from from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state "is clearly illegal. … The Constitution says you can’t take this stuff."	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/26/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-clinton-foreign-donations-clearly-vi/	Hillary Clinton is in the political crosshairs as the author of a new book alleges improper financial ties between her public and personal life. At issue in conservative author Peter Schweizer’s forthcoming book Clinton Cash are donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the four years she served as secretary of state. George Stephanopoulos used an interview with Schweizer on ABC This Week to point out what other nonpartisan journalists have found: There is no "smoking gun" showing that donations to the foundation influenced her foreign policy decisions. Still, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich says the donations are "clearly illegal" under federal law. In his view, a donation by a foreign government to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state is the same as money sent directly to her, he said, even though she did not join the foundation’s board until she left her post. "The Constitution of the United States says you cannot take money from foreign governments without explicit permission of the Congress. They wrote that in there because they knew the danger of corrupting our system by foreign money is enormous," Gingrich said. "You had a sitting secretary of state whose husband radically increased his speech fees, you have a whole series of dots on the wall now where people gave millions of dollars — oh, by the way, they happen to get taken care of by the State Department." He continued, "My point is they took money from foreign governments while she was secretary of State. That is clearly illegal." PunditFact wanted to know if a criminal case against Clinton is that open and shut. Is what happened "clearly illegal"? A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation certainly disagreed, calling Gingrich’s accusation "a baseless leap" because Clinton was not part of her husband’s foundation while serving as a senator or secretary of state. We did not hear from Gingrich by our deadline. Foundation basics Former President Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001, the year after Hillary Clinton won her first term as a New York senator. The foundation works with non-governmental organizations, the private sector and governments around the world on health, anti-poverty, HIV/AIDS and climate change initiatives. Spokesman Craig Minassian said it’s reasonable for the foundation to accept money from foreign governments because of the global scope of its programs, and the donations are usually in the form of tailored grants for specific missions. Hillary Clinton was not part of her husband’s foundation while she was a senator or secretary of state. Her appointment to the latter post required Senate confirmation and came with an agreement between the White House and Clinton Foundation that the foundation would be more transparent about its donors. According to the 2008 memorandum of understanding, the foundation would release information behind new donations and could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If countries with existing contributions significantly stepped up their contributions, or if a new foreign government wanted to donate, the State Department would have to approve. Clinton took an active role in fundraising when she left the State Department and the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013. But she left the board when she announced her run for the presidency in April 2015. The Emoluments Clause So how does Gingrich come up with the claim that Clinton Foundation donations are "clearly illegal" and unconstitutional? The answer is something known as the Emoluments Clause. A few conservative websites have made similar arguments in recent days, including the Federalist blog. The Emoluments Clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads in part: "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." The framers came up with this clause to prevent the government and leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free of external influence. (An emolument, per Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is "the returns arising from office or employment usually in the form of compensation or perquisites.") Lest you think the law is no longer relevant, the Pentagon ethics office in 2013 warned employees the "little known provision" applies to all federal employees and military retirees. There’s no mention of spouses in the memo. J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center, said interpretation of the clause has evolved since its adoption at the Constitutional Convention, when the primary concern was about overseas diplomats not seeking gifts from foreign powers they were dealing with. The Defense Department memo, in his view, goes beyond what the framers envisioned for the part of the memo dealing with gifts. "I think that, aside from the unambiguous parts, the burden would be on those invoking the clause to show actual causality that would be in violation of the clause," Pham said. Expert discussion We asked seven different constitutional law experts on whether the Clinton Foundation foreign donations were "clearly illegal" and a violation of the Emoluments Clause. We did not reach a consensus with their responses, though a majority thought the layers of separation between the foundation and Hillary Clinton work against Gingrich. The American system often distinguishes between public officers and private foundations, "even if real life tends to blur some of those distinctions," said American University law professor Steve Vladeck. Vladeck added that the Emoluments Clause has never been enforced. "I very much doubt that the first case in its history would be because a foreign government made charitable donations to a private foundation controlled by a government employee’s relative," he said. "Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing. Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they’re formally — and, thus, legally — distinct." Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas constitutional law professor who worked in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel from 1989 to 2003, also called Gingrich’s link between Clinton and the foreign governments’ gifts to the Clinton Foundation as "implausible, and in any case I don’t think we have the facts to support it." "The truth is that we establish corporate bodies like the Clinton Foundation because the law endows these entities with a separate and distinct legal personhood," Delahunty said. John Harrison, University of Virginia law professor and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel from 1990 to 1993, pointed to the Foreign Gifts Act, 5 U.S.C. 7432, which sets rules for how the Emoluments Clause should work in practice. The statute spells out the minimal value for acceptable gifts, and says it applies to spouses of the individuals covered, but "it doesn’t say anything about receipt of foreign gifts by other entities such as the Clinton Foundation." "I don’t know whether there’s any other provision of federal law that would treat a foreign gift to the foundation as having made to either of the Clintons personally," Harrison said, who added that agencies have their own supplemental rules for this section, and he did not know if the State Department addressed this. Other experts on the libertarian side of the scale thought Gingrich was more right in his assertion. Clinton violates the clause because of its intentionally broad phrasing about gifts of "any kind whatever," which would cover indirect gifts via the foundation, said Dave Kopel, a constitutional law professor at Denver University and research director at the libertarian Independence Institute. Kopel also brought up bribery statutes, which would require that a gift had some influence in Clinton’s decision while secretary of state. Delahunty thought Kopel’s reasoning would have "strange consequences," such as whether a state-owned airline flying Bill Clinton to a conference of former heads of state counted as a gift to Hillary Clinton. Our ruling Gingrich said the Clinton Foundation "took money from from foreign governments while (Hillary Clinton) was secretary of state. It is clearly illegal. … The Constitution says you can’t take this stuff." A clause in the Constitution does prohibit U.S. officials such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from receiving gifts, or emoluments, from foreign governments. But the gifts in this case were donations from foreign governments that went to the Clinton Foundation, not Hillary Clinton. She was not part of the foundation her husband founded while she was secretary of state. Does that violate the Constitution? Some libertarian-minded constitutional law experts say it very well could. Others are skeptical. What’s clear is there is room for ambiguity, and the donations are anything but "clearly illegal." The reality is this a hazy part of U.S. constitutional law.

pomt-05541	"General Motors is the largest corporation in the world again."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/09/joe-biden/vice-president-joe-biden-says-general-motors-large/	Vice President Joe Biden declared General Motors "the largest corporation in the world" in an April 1, 2012, interview on Face the Nation. It was no April Fool’s joke. We knew GM’s auto sales were back on top in 2011 — aided by its joint ventures in China and a tsunami-burdened Toyota — but the world’s largest corporation? We just had to check. (Hat-tip to a reader who asked us whether he was right, emailing a a Fox News piece by Karl Rove that took Biden to task. Email, Twitter, Facebook — send claims our way!) Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer had asked Biden to respond to comments by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney that President Barack Obama’s term had "been a failure." Biden declared the former Massachusetts governor "a little out of touch." "Look, you know, everything that he said, the American people don't think the policies have worked. Romney argued about let — not an exact quote — but let Detroit go bankrupt. Wasn't very popular action the president took. Now they're hiring people. You know, hundreds of thousands of new people instead of losing 400,000 jobs. General Motors is the largest corporation in the world again." Romney had argued for a managed bankruptcy instead of a government-aided turnaround. Detroit automakers are hiring again. But the claim that GM "is the largest corporation in the world again"? It’s not. Top companies lists Fortune and Forbes both annually rank the world’s largest companies. The Fortune Global 500 ranks them by total revenues. The Forbes Global 2000 ranks them by sales, profit, assets and market value. GM didn’t make the top of either list last year. Not even among automakers. Or among U.S. companies starting with the word, "General." Toyota and Volkswagen both beat out GM on the Fortune list. They were No. 8 and No. 13. GM was No. 20. (That other American institution, General Electric? No. 16.) On the broader-based Forbes list, Volkswagen weighed in at No. 24. Daimler (think Mercedes-Benz) hit No. 43. Ford and Toyota ranked No. 54 and No. 55. General Motors trailed at No. 61. (General Electric? No. 3.) When Forbes broke out its rankings by category, GM didn’t lead any of them. Rather, it was: • No. 18 in sales • No. 70 in profit • No. 155 in assets • No. 148 in market value Our ruling Biden may have been reaching for a different statistic — that GM’s sales led other automakers in 2011, subject to a few caveats. But he didn’t say that. He said, "General Motors is the largest corporation in the world again." Surely the vice president of the United States can pick his words more carefully. We rate this claim False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2012-04-09T16:39:20	2012-04-01	['None']
pomt-04891	Says Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed the "Quiñones Plan" because it was "taxation without representation on a large scale."	/florida/statements/2012/aug/06/alan-grayson/grayson-says-jeb-bush-vetoed-quinones-plan/	Let’s say you’re a Florida Republican seeking public office. If there’s one nickname you don’t want, it’s "Tax Man." And if there’s one man you don’t want dissing your ideas, it’s former Gov. Jeb Bush. Alan Grayson, the former Democratic U.S. House member from Orlando, is trying to stick both of these toxic GOP labels on former state Rep. John Quiñones. Grayson is unopposed for the 9th congressional district, but Quiñones, R-Kissimmee, must pass the Aug. 14 primary. "John Quiñones: The Tax Man," claims a mailer from Grayson’s campaign. The mailer says Quiñones voted to raise various taxes as a Tallahassee lawmaker and as a current member of the Osceola County Commission. The kicker: "Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed the Quiñones Plan because it was ‘taxation without representation on a large scale.’ " Grayson cites a June 28, 2006, story by the Tampa Bay Times as backup for the Bush claim. We cracked open the archives and found references to rental cars but nothing about Quiñones or the "Quiñones Plan." We wondered what Grayson was talking about. The plan in question was a wide-ranging transportation bill, SB 1350, that would have raised money for city and county transportation projects by adding a $2-a-day tax on rental car customers, if voters approved it in a county referendum. Central Florida Republicans had backed the idea for years, including former state Sen. Daniel Webster, who ousted Grayson from his U.S. House seat in 2010. They argued the surcharge wasn’t really a tax because it would be up to county voters, and the state needed money to pay for urgent transit needs. An Orlando Sentinel editorial praised the surcharge as "the Holy Grail of Central Florida lawmakers for nearly a decade." The charge would have targeted tourists, who come to Orlando for theme parks and clog the highways. If approved by voters in Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties, the proposal would have generated $40 million for local transportation needs, or $80 million coupled with matching funds, according to the newspaper. SB 1350 passed the House by a vote of 103-14 and the Senate by 34-4. Quinones -- along with now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and most House conservatives -- voted yes. Rental car companies and Americans for Tax Reform, the anti-tax group of Grover Norquist, attacked the plan as unfair to tourists. In the end, Bush agreed. He threw down a veto a few days before the law was to take effect. In his veto message, Bush praised legislators for trying to solve rising transportation costs and make transportation project contracts more competitive. But he drew the line at the optional increase on rental car taxes, and Grayson accurately quotes part of his explanation: "While I appreciate the inclusion of voter approval as a prerequisite to implementing the new tax, these taxes will be paid disparately by tourists visiting Florida, consequently creating taxation without representation on a large scale. Philosophically, I cannot support this." So where does Quiñones come in? Even though his name isn’t on the final legislation, he played a role in the rental car surcharge issue. He introduced the House companion to Webster’s Senate bilion Oct. 31, 2005. Quiñones’ bill, HB 301, exempted motorists who rented cars while their automobiles received repairs. His bill was never brought up for a full floor vote on its own, but the idea was amended to the final version of SB 1350. Quiñones defended the idea in committee. "In this situation, you have an opportunity to allow tourism to help on the transportation problem that we have in our community," he said, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. "This way it would have less impact on the local residents. I didn’t want to have an added burden on the local constituencies." The Orlando Sentinel editorial credited Webster and now-state Sen. Andy Gardiner for guiding the measure through session, "with the help of Rep. John Quiñones." Our ruling Grayson says Bush vetoed the "Quiñones Plan" because it was "taxation without representation on a large scale." His mailer accurately quotes Bush’s veto message but lacks context about what the vetoed "Quiñones Plan" entailed. There’s no denying Quiñones played a hand in legislation that would have allowed county residents to vote on an additional $2 per day surcharge on rental cars, which would mostly have hit tourists. He sponsored language that ended up in the final bill. But the mailer has no details for voters, unless residents somehow connect it with the words "rental cars" in a cluster of items Grayson says Quiñones taxed. It’s unfair to say Quiñones taxed rental cars when the "plan" in question would be up to county voters and it never happened because of Bush’s veto. Plus, even though Quiñones sponsored a version of the surcharge legislation, his clout trails the influence of two Central Florida colleagues widely credited for getting the language in the final version of SB 1350 -- which was certainly not known as the "Quiñones Plan" around the Capitol.

pomt-11268	Says Austin is the "safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running."	/texas/statements/2018/apr/26/steve-adler/steve-adler-jeopardy-austin-safety-best-place-live/	Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who seeks a second term this November, reacted to a game-show moment with a swaggering claim. In an April 25, 2018, tweet, Adler responded to this clue from that night’s episode of Jeopardy: "Per Rick Perry, it’s the blueberry in the tomato soup." Perry, the Republican former governor, often offers the "blueberry" characterization of the Democrat-dominant capital. On the program, a contestant correctly answered "Austin" for $600. Next, Adler said in his tweet, accompanied by a photo of the Jeopardy clue: "What is the safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running?" Is all of that true about Austin? Not all: In 2017, we found Half True an Adler reference to Austin as the state's safest big city. Not for the first time, we noted then that the FBI advises against using crime data it collects to declare one city "safer" than another. That said, such statistics at the time suggested both that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions and that El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin in the first half of 2016. Seeking mayor’s factual backup The morning after Adler posted his comment, which was retweeted more than 200 times, we reached mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford. Stanford advised by phone that Adler didn’t have fresh information to offer in support of his 2018 "safest big city in Texas" statement. He suggested we check federal statistics to confirm Austin’s jobless rate and told us that U.S. News had consecutively named Austin the nation’s best place to live. Checking Austin’s unemployment Our search for Austin’s jobless rate on the Texas Workforce Commission website showed that from January through March 2018, the latest month of available data, the city's jobless rate ran shy of 3 percent. We also fetched a longer view showing the city’s jobless rate mostly staying below 3 percent from January 2017 on (all the rates not seasonally adjusted). Austin's unemployment rate was last above 3 percent, according to the TWC, when it was 3.1 percent in August 2017. The Austin rate's 15-month low, 2.5 percent, occurred in December 2017: SOURCE: Website, "Unemployment," Texas Labor Market Information, Texas Workforce Commission (search completed April 26, 2018) Austin ranked best place to live two times in a row On April 10, 2018, U.S. News announced that for the second straight year, the online publication found Austin the best place to live in the United States among the country's 125 largest metropolitan areas; Colorado Springs, Colo., placed second. The rankings were based on affordability, job prospects and quality of life, U.S. News said, and on surveying thousands of U.S. residents "to find out what qualities they consider important in a home town. The methodology," U.S. News said, also factored in data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI and the Bureau of Labor Statistics--plus U.S. News rankings of the country’s high schools and hospitals. Austin, the self-proclaimed Live Music Capital of the planet, earned a score of 7.7 out of 10 for the 2018 rankings, U.S. News said, with even its few downsides having upsides. The story says: "The median sale price for a single-family home in Austin is well above the national median." Then again, the story says, "Austinites' pocketbooks benefit from no personal or corporate income tax, and a low state and local tax rate." Another semi-warning in the story: "Summers in Austin take some getting used to, with temperatures often scorching." Though, the story says, the "metro area experiences mild weather throughout the rest of the year, though temperatures have been known to drop in the winter." The story also notes: "Austin is among the nation's worst metro areas for traffic congestion." But, the story says, that "can be addressed with flexible work schedules, due diligence when choosing a neighborhood and, for those wanting to get in some exercise while commuting, using public transportation, walking and biking." Our ruling Adler referred to Austin as the "safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running." Hizzoner was right about Austin’s jobless rate of late and Austin getting named the city’s best place to live two years in a row though it’s worth clarifying that the rankings considered only the country’s 125 largest metro areas. Whether Austin is the safest big Texas city rests on interpreting crime data the FBI counsels against using to compare communities. This said, we previously found that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions while in the first half of 2016, El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin.

Exhibit B: MSNBC host Chris Hayes’ recent on-air shouting match with Larry Pratt, executive director of the lobbying group Gun Owners of America. Smart guns -- also known as "child-proof guns" and "personalized guns" -- are designed to work solely for authorized users through features like fingerprint recognition or electronic sensors. The hope is they will reduce deaths by suicide, accidental shootings or someone stealing a law enforcement officer’s weapon. They are not sold in the United States, though two dealers tried before backing down amid intense pressure from activists. Hayes supports the technology, but Pratt and other gun-rights advocates are skeptical. Pratt questions the guns’ reliability, saying smart guns are "only 80 percent effective." When Hayes pressed Pratt for the source of his statistic, Pratt cited the New Jersey Institute of Technology. "Twenty percent of the time it won’t work," Pratt said. "And you’re asking people to put their lives in the hands of a product like that?" Later, Pratt used the figure again. "Is it okay to put on the market a car that 20 percent of the time explodes on you and causes you harm or death?" Since Pratt tripled down on his statistic, PunditFact wanted to check it out. Tracing the source of the claim Pratt pointed to a 2003 column in Popular Mechanics magazine headlined "‘Smart’ Guns: Dumb Idea!" The column was inspired by a 2002 New Jersey law that requires all guns sold in the state to have "smart" technology within three years of the attorney general verifying the first smart gun was sold in the United States. Fear among gun rights activists that more government mandates may come when this happens drive their opposition to smart guns. In his column 11 years ago, writer Cliff Gromer said law enforcement officers are exempt from the law, which proves the technology isn’t solid enough for the mainstream gun market. "According to the New Jersey Institute of Technology, which used government grants to study personalized handgun technology, fingerprint recognition systems work only 80 percent of the time," Gromer wrote. "But the New Jersey law goes into effect regardless of whether the guns are 100 percent -- or 80 percent -- reliable." Article is not the smoking gun You may have read over it, but the 80 percent figure Gromer cited talks about fingerprint recognition systems. Not whether a smart gun will work. That’s important because while some smart guns use fingerprint recognition systems (which work like the new unlocking method for iPhones), not all do. The German-made Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol was expected to be the first smart gun sold in the United States this year until a California gun store owner scrapped plans to sell it after facing aggressive backlash. It happened again with a Maryland dealer. The Armatix does not have a fingerprint recognition system. Instead, the gun works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun to make it active. The signal is akin to what’s emitted from those bulky tags on mall merchandise that aren’t triggered until taken out of the store. Other models work with similar chips implanted in everyday accessories, such as bracelets, pins and rings, and some are implanted in the body. If the badge is too far away from the microchip in the gun, it will stop working. But that means the technology works, not that it failed. And, more critically, the Armatix radio signal has nothing to do with the study Pratt cited, which focused on fingerprint recognition systems, New Jersey Institute of Technology researchers told us. Other smart guns also avoid fingerprint technology. Michael Recce, an associate professor in the information systems department at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, invented "dynamic grip recognition" and applied it to a gun, so that it fires only after it recognizes the user’s grip thanks to sensors on the side of the gun that detect pressure and the contours of the user's hand. The gun starts to detect if the user is authorized as someone starts pulling the gun, he said. Recce said the owner detection rate for his dynamic grip "is within the mechanical failure rate," i.e. the rate at which a standard gun fails. However, two or three people out of 100 adults could also fire the gun in trials because their hand is similar to the owner’s -- a tradeoff with the technology so it is sure to fire for the rightful owner, he said. Other types of smart guns in varying stages of development are outlined in a year-old National Institute of Justice report commissioned as part of President Barack Obama’s gun reforms after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. This research is dated In this case, the New Jersey Institute of Technology research is being misapplied, and it’s old. Researchers told us their work on fingerprint scanners should not be applied to newer guns. Their research, which was not published, was done in the early 2000s on four types of guns using fingerprint readers. None of those guns were as reliable as mechanical firearms, they found, though the guns were a "fragile technology" then, said Donald Sebastian, New Jersey Institute of Technology senior vice president for research and development. "Fingerprint readers may have progressed in the past 10 years," Recce said. "At that time even the readers on laptops would often require you to swipe your finger more than once before they worked. Our opinion was that swiping your finger over the reader multiple times would be a challenge when using a gun." Skeptics of these guns point to many concerns about the reliability of the weapons in a high-pressure situation, like who has time to enter a PIN code, and what if the sensors in the gun die? Michael Bazinet, a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman, said the "strongest statement on their reliability" will be when law enforcement officers use them en masse. But other potential weaknesses don’t change the fact that what Pratt cited is old news. "To make a universal blanket statement based on a 15-year-old analysis of fingerprint detectors just doesn’t pass muster," Sebastian said. "It’s like talking about the reliability of a Model T and comparing it to a race car. Apples and oranges." If not 80 percent reliable, then what? Finding a reliability rate for smart guns is an "almost unanswerable question," said Stephen Teret, a pro-smart gun Johns Hopkins professor and director of the university’s Center for Law and the Public’s Health. "Because there’s a wide range of quality in existing guns, some are better, some are worse. So when you are trying to compute a rate of reliability, are you using one gun or various categories?" Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control (whom Hayes brought in after Pratt to talk about the issue), said in order for the Armatix iP1 gun to be sold in California, it had to pass a reliability test. "The standard was a 99 percent successful fire rate, which it met (fire 600 times with 6 or fewer failed discharges)," Spitzer said. Others stressed that all guns are prone to failure at some point. The mechanical failure rate is often given as 1 in 1,000, and a military weapon’s failure rate is closer to 1 in 10,000, Sebastian said. "Misfire is embedded in our language," he said. Our ruling Pratt said "20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work," which he got from a 2003 magazine story referencing unpublished research from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. The scientists who conducted that research say Pratt’s citation is misapplied. Researchers only looked at smart guns that rely on fingerprint sensors, yet Pratt applied the statistic to all smart guns, including the Armatix pistol that works with a black stopwatch, PIN code and small electronic chips. Even more, their research is more than a decade old, and they say fingerprint matching technology has changed since then. Pratt’s statement is not based on solid evidence. We rate his statement False.	None	Larry Pratt	None	None	None	2014-05-20T16:23:20	2014-05-06	['None']

pomt-01565	Saturday Night Live executive producer "Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/11/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-snls-lorne-michaels-could-be-jailed-/	In his brief time in Congress, first-term Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has attracted national attention for his rhetoric. On Sept. 9, 2014, Cruz gave a stemwinder of a floor speech, criticizing a proposed constitutional amendment backed by Democrats. The backers of the proposed amendment, S.J.Res.19, say it’s intended to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that loosened campaign-finance laws for corporations. They argue that the court’s ruling has opened a floodgate of campaign spending that threatens the democratic process. Cruz, however, argues that the proposed amendment severely threatens First Amendment protections that date back more than two centuries. Perhaps the most attention-getting portion of Cruz’s lengthy speech (which you can read in its entirety here) came when he suggested that Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of NBC’s long-running show Saturday Night Live, would be put at risk of imprisonment if the amendment were enacted: "When I asked the senator from Minnesota (Al Franken, a former Saturday Night Live writer and actor) in the Senate Judiciary Committee, ‘Do you believe that Congress should have the constitutional authority to prohibit Saturday Night Live from making fun of politicians, the good senator promptly reassured me he had no intention of doing any such thing. But what we are debating is not the intentions of 100 senators. What we are debating is a constitutional amendment that 49 Democrats are proposing to be inserted into the Bill of Rights. ... "What the amendment says is for any corporation, Congress would have the constitutional authority to prohibit it from engaging in political speech. Well, NBC, which airs Saturday Night Live, is a corporation. … Congress would have the power to make it a criminal offense. Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician." Political observers expect the amendment to fall well short of the two-thirds vote in the Senate that would be required before it went to the House (where it would need a two-thirds vote) and the states (where it would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states). So the fears Cruz expresses are probably moot. Still, many readers asked us to take a closer look at Cruz’s claim about Lorne Michaels and Saturday Night Live. What the amendment says Let’s start by looking at the proposed amendment. Here are the key passages: "Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections. … Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections. … Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress or the States the power to abridge the freedom of the press." Cruz’s argument Cruz, both in his speech and in a subsequent telephone interview with PolitiFact, made the case for why Michaels might have reason to worry for his freedom if the amendment were to be ratified. Among his points: • Reading the amendment literally, the SNL scenario closely fits its language. That is, a corporation (NBC) is spending money (to produce and air SNL) that could influence an election (it arguably has in the past, as in its characterization of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin). "By any measure, NBC is a corporation," Cruz said in the interview. "And the amendment says the government can prohibit such entities from spending money to influence elections." In fact, Cruz also argued in the speech and the interview that a literal reading of the amendment also would permit restrictions on the speech of entities as diverse as movie studio Paramount Pictures, publisher Simon and Schuster, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the Sierra Club. "Every one of these is a corporation," Cruz said. • SNL is unlikely to benefit from the proposal’s press-freedom exemption. While the amendment contains an exemption for freedom of the press, SNL is an entertainment show, Cruz noted, not part of NBC’s news division. "I agree (the amendment) carves out a specific press exemption, but SNL is by no measure the press," Cruz told PolitiFact. • It doesn’t matter that the amendment’s backers promise that the amendment is narrowly targeted at campaign finance rather than political satire. What matters, Cruz counters, is how future generations of lawmakers will view it, once they have such powerful tools embedded in the Constitution. "Lots of Democrats argue passionately, ‘We don’t intend to prohibit books or movies or Saturday Night Live,’ " Cruz said in the interview. "In all likelihood, Congress would not try to do so. But things can change. I am not content to entrust our free-speech rights to the good graces and whims of Congress and hope that politicians don’t abuse their power." Indeed, Cruz noted that the facts at issue in the Citizens United case involved the ability of a non-profit corporation making a movie critical of Hillary Clinton. "Democrats say it’s unrealistic, but we’ve already seen government go after a corporation making a movie about a politician." What experts say Several legal experts we interviewed agreed that Cruz had a point. "It’s quite obvious that, under this proposed amendment, Congress could pass a law prohibiting corporations and their agents from, say, supporting or opposing candidates during a broadcast other than a news program," said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Congress would get free rein to legislate in this area." Other scholars weren’t as gung-ho as Shapiro was but still agreed that Cruz’s scenario can’t be ruled out. "Generally, if the government has the power to regulate some activity, it can impose civil liability or criminal penalties as it chooses," said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. "If the amendment were broadly construed, I would say it's possible." And Andrew Koppelman, a Northwestern University law professor, said he sees what Cruz "is getting at. Any criticism of a politician by something as expensive to produce as a TV show is spending money in a way that could influence elections." That said, a number of the experts we contacted -- including some of those who acknowledged above that Cruz had a point -- consider the scenario more far-fetched than the senator lets on. Here are the two main reasons why: • Even after the amendment was in force, a lot would need to happen before any satirist felt the heat from prosecutors. Both chambers of Congress would need to pass a bill on this subject, and the president would have to sign it into law. Then, judges would have to agree wholeheartedly with the interpretation Cruz fears and uphold the law. And prosecutors would have to consider it a good use of their time to go after TV comedians or media outlets for speech violations. "The government has many powers that could be used to do bad and stupid things," Roosevelt said. "Congress could ban the sale of milk, for instance. Ordinarily we rely on the democratic political process to stop that." Erwin Chemerinsky, the law school dean at the University of California-Irvine, said that while he opposes the proposed amendment, he believes that Cruz was "engaged in hyperbole. It is not a reasonable way to interpret the amendment." And Douglas W. Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law professor who served in the Justice Department under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, agreed. "If the amendment referred to by Mr. Cruz could possibly be interpreted in the manner in which he described, it would be a triumph of fiction over language, and would be contrary to the well-established interpretive canon that one should certainly avoid interpreting statutes -- let alone other provisions in the Constitution -- in a manner that would negate their validity." • Even if prosecutors started using their newly granted powers, it’s a stretch for Cruz to invoke the word "jail." In theory, it’s possible to go to prison for violations of campaign-finance law -- up to two years, plus fines, according to federal law. This existing law might well come into play under the SNL scenario, Cruz and his allies say. However, in U.S. history, examples of criminalizing speech itself are rare, and prison time is even rarer. Not counting examples of speech accompanied by other law-breaking behavior, such as trespassing, the experts we interviewed could only name the Sedition Act of 1798 and the Espionage Act of 1917 as examples. (Some would also include the trials of comedian Lenny Bruce in the 1960s, though Bruce’s cases involved speech that was allegedly obscene rather than political.) It’s important to note that these precedents, far from carrying judicial weight today, are now regretted and held up as cautionary tales. "Contemporary doctrine repudiates these historical missteps," said Timothy Zick, a law professor at the College of William and Mary. "It would take nothing short of a revolutionary shift in judicial thinking to uphold any measure that criminalized pure political satire." Cruz’s rebuttal Cruz acknowledged to PolitiFact that past history shows few prosecutions and prison terms for purely political speech. But that doesn’t comfort him, for one reason: All of this judicial and historical precedent protecting speech springs from the First Amendment as we know it, not the new reality that would be shaped by the amendment now being debated. Laws like the Sedition Act were "patently unconstitutional," Cruz said in the interview. But the proposed amendment now being debated "does not just reverse Citizens United, it goes much further than that. It was never the law previously that Congress could prohibit a corporation from speaking about politics." Supporters of the amendment, he said, may "point to case law upholding the First Amendment, but none of that matters, because a subsequent amendment would trump those rulings." In this complicated debate, there’s only one thing that seems to be a pretty good bet, said Brett Kappel, a counsel at the law firm Arent Fox LLP. "I’m sure SNL will be mocking Sen. Cruz" on its next show, he said. Our ruling Cruz said that "Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician." Most experts we talked to agreed that the proposed amendment’s language left open the door to that possibility. But many of those same experts emphasized that prosecuting, much less imprisoning, a comedian for purely political speech would run counter to centuries of American tradition, and would face many obstacles at a variety of government levels and run headlong into popular sentiment. In the big picture, Cruz makes a persuasive case that it’s not a good idea to mess with the First Amendment. Still, his SNL scenario is far-fetched. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2014-09-11T16:54:56	2014-09-09	['None']
pomt-09955	"Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal 'supermax' prisons."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/barack-obama/obama-correct-no-inmate-has-ever-escaped-supermax-/	In a speech defending his plans for the detainess at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, President Barack Obama said Americans should not be concerned about them being transferred to the United States because federal prisons are secure. "Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders — highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety," Obama said. "Bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal ' supermax ' prisons." First, we should note that Obama's comment suggests there is more than one federal "supermax " facility. But there's actually just one, the Administration Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Some states have built their own maximum security prisons, but it's clear Obama was referring to federal facilities because they would be the ones to house the suspected terrorists. The security of the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," as the Florence prison is known among correctional program professionals, has been cited frequently by Democrats as lawmakers and the administration battle over where to relocate the detainees. Obama is seeking to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010. Many Republicans believe it should remain open, and many Democrats have also grown wary. A bipartisan group of lawmakers blocked funding to close the facility until Obama comes up with a more detailed plan on what would happen to the detainees. Meanwhile, some Senate Democrats, including Assistant Majority Leader Richard Durbin and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , have suggested that a supermax prison is the best place to house the suspected terrorists. As you might expect, living is austere at the Alcatraz of the Rockies. Prisoners are kept in small cells and have limited contact with others. Florence is already home to several widely known international and domestic terrorists, including the "shoe bomber" Richard Reid, and Zacarias Moussaoui , a man sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks. As for Obama's statement, federal prison officials confirmed that he is correct. No prisoner has ever escaped from the only federal supermax facility since it was opened in 1994, no doubt thanks to the $10 million perimeter fence and the remote-controlled steel doors. We find his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-05-21T18:15:17	2009-05-21	['None']
pomt-09743	The Obama White House is renaming Christmas trees "holiday trees."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/14/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obamas-plan-change-holiday-tra/	On the Internet, the "war against Christmas" wages on — or at least that's what the e-mails claim. A chain e-mail says that the Obama White House is renaming Christmas trees "holiday trees." "We have a friend at church who is a very talented artist. For several years she, among many others, has painted ornaments to be hung on the various White House Christmas trees," the e-mail begins. "She got her letter from the WH recently. It said that they would not be called Christmas trees this year. They will be called Holiday trees. And, to please not send any ornaments painted with a religious theme... Just thought you should know what the new residents in the WH plan for the future of America." "This isn't a rumor; this is a fact," the e-mail says. We always get suspicious when we hear statements like that. It is true that the White House has long commissioned tree ornaments. In 1969, first lady Pat Nixon asked disabled workers in Florida to make velvet and satin balls featuring each state's flower, according to the White House Historical Association. And in 1974, first lady Betty Ford commissioned Appalachian women and senior citizen groups to craft ornaments that emphasized thrift and recycling. And for her first year in the White House, first lady Laura Bush asked artists from all 50 states and the District of Columbia to design replicas of historic homes and houses of worship to hang on the tree. Nevertheless, the Bush administration came under scrutiny for its own politically correct holiday traditions. In 2005, then-press secretary Scott McClellan was asked why the media Christmas party had been changed to the media "holiday" party. Here's what he had to say: McClellan: "I don't know that that's accurate, that the Bush White House eliminated ..." Reporter: "It is. Yes, it's no longer Christmas. It says, 'holiday.' " McClellan: "This is a time to welcome people of all faiths, and all those who are celebrating the holiday season. The president just yesterday dedicated the National Christmas Tree to our men and women in uniform." In the same year, Laura Bush was asked whether she had any misgivings about calling the White House Christmas tree a Christmas tree. "Well, no, not really," she said. "At this season we know that Americans celebrate the season in a lot of different ways. We'll have a Hanukkah party, Hanukkah reception here at the White House later during the month. But I think we've always called this the White House Christmas tree." The Bush White House also recognized Kwanzaa, a holiday traditionally celebrated in African-American communities, and held an annual children's "holiday" party. For the current administration's part, White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield says the tree tradition isn't changing. "There is no truth to this, and the letter referenced in the e-mail does not exist," she said. "No letter has gone out yet from the White House pertaining to Christmas tree ornaments." She added, "The trees in the White House will be called Christmas trees, and the tree on the Ellipse will be called the National Christmas Tree. There will be no name changes." So all this chain e-mail deserves is a lump of coal and a Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-10-14T16:30:37	2009-10-14	['White_House']
pomt-13945	Says Donald Trump has said he loves war, "including with nukes."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/19/priorities-usa-action/super-pac-ad-says-trump-likes-war-even-nuclear-lac/	Donald Trump would be "too dangerous for America," says a new ad from Priorities USA Action, a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton. The 30-second ad, which will air in eight battleground states, features several of Trump’s own comments about foreign policy. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd played a portion of the ad on the June 19 show as an example of the kind of ads Trump can expect to face in the general election. It starts with MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski asking Trump, "Who are you consulting with consistently so that you are ready on day one?" "I’m speaking with myself, number one," he responds. Then the ad cuts to four more of Trump’s comments: "This is the Trump theory on war… I’m really good at war. I love war in a certain way." "Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." "I want to be unpredictable, I’m not going to tell you right now what I’m gonna do." "I know more about ISIS than the generals. Believe me." The "nukes" comment in particular caught our attention. It’s clear that it’s separate from the preceding comment — "I love war in a certain way" — but the implication seems to be that Trump is a warmonger who isn’t afraid to use nuclear weapons. We decided to check out the context of both of those comments and see if the ad is fairly representing Trump's position. We also looked at Trump’s overall views on nuclear policy. ‘I love war in a certain way.’ This comment comes from a 90-minute speech in Iowa on Nov. 12, 2015. In the speech, Trump theorized that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein feigned having weapons of mass destruction to scare neighboring Iran, before briefly sidetracking into his feelings on war generally. "This is the Trump theory on war," he said. "But I'm good at war. I've had a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war. I love war in a certain way. But only when we win." He then moved on to talking about veterans. Earlier in his speech, he railed against the decision to invade Iraq. ‘Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.’ Trump made his comments about "nukes" in an April 3 interview with Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace. Wallace was asking Trump about his suggestion that Japan might be better off with nuclear weapons. Wallace: "You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?" Trump: "In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes." Wallace: "Understood." Trump: "It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea." Wallace: "With nukes?" Trump: "Maybe they would be better off — including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." So Trump was saying Japan might do well to defend itself with its own nuclear weapons, rather than talking about what he would do as president with the United States’ own nuclear arsenal. The way the ad splices Trump's comments together, a reasonable person would think Trump "loves war," including "with nukes." Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky told us that the fact Trump is open to more countries having nuclear weapons supports the ad’s overarching argument — that Trump would be too dangerous. Other comments Trump has offered somewhat conflicting views on using nuclear weapons throughout the campaign. He has said he "wouldn’t rule out" using tactical nuclear weapons against ISIS, but adding in the same interview: "Definitely nuclear weapons are a last resort." Nor would he rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe, if a conflict ever were to arise. "You don’t want to, say, take everything off the table," he said. He also told the New York Times, "It’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation." Our ruling An ad by Priorities USA says Trump says he loves war, "including with nukes." Trump did say the phrase "I love war in a certain way." And Trump has said he wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons. But that doesn’t mean he is enthusiastic about them. He says they would be the weapon of last resort and that he believes nuclear proliferation to be the "biggest problem, to me, in the world." It's worth noting that the Trump comment used in the ad wasn’t about the United States using nuclear weapons, but about his belief that Japan might be better off if it had nuclear weapons. Readers can decide for themselves if Trump’s positions are dangerous. But Priorities USA’s ad is missing a bit of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02110	A majority of Americans "since Harry Truman days" support single-payer health insurance, or "full Medicare for all."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/14/ralph-nader/70-years-most-americans-have-supported-single-paye/	Americans are more politically polarized than they were a generation ago. Yet consumer activist and four-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader argues in his new book that there is "an emerging left-right alliance" in the country that could "dismantle the corporate state." Interviewed about the book on May 7, 2014, Nader told Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardin that majorities of liberals and conservatives agree on a number of issues, such as raising the minimum wage. Then he made an attention-getting claim about the enduring popularity of "single-payer" -- a health insurance system in which everyone is covered by the government and the government pays all the bills. Nader’s quote is a bit jumbled, but his claim is clear. "The reason why single-payer is not discussed -- even though a majority of the American people since Harry Truman days supported full Medicare for all, everybody in nobody out, free choice of doctor and hospital; very efficient, much more than the present wasteful system -- even though that is the status in terms of public opinion, it's not on the table," he said. Wait. How often have most Americans agreed on any one thing for nearly 70 years? And more specifically, has a majority of Americans supported single-payer -- or "Medicare for all," as Nader also referred to it -- dating back to the presidency of Harry Truman (1945-’53)? Single-payer and politicians Under single-payer, private insurers would be eliminated, although private medical providers would remain. Everyone would get health coverage from the government and government would pay all the bills. In that sense, it’s like Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older and certain younger people. Single-payer received mention in the debate during the run-up to Obamacare, which became law in 2010. But even some of its most prominent supporters have wavered on it. In 2009, Obama earned a Half Flip on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter. Compared to his earlier years in politics, Obama had moderated his statements in support of single-payer as he tried to appeal to a wider audience, our PolitiFact National colleagues found. Similarly, after Republican former Gov. Tommy Thompson made single-payer an issue in the 2012 race for a U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin, we gave a Half-Flip to Democrat Tammy Baldwin. Just before she defeated Thompson, Baldwin deflected questions about single-payer and said she was setting aside at least temporarily her efforts toward getting single-payer in place. Nader’s evidence For his part, Nader -- who won 2.74 percent of the vote in the razor-thin 2000 presidential race -- cited through a spokesman portions of three articles to back his claim about the public’s support for the concept. But none of the articles constitute evidence that most Americans have backed single-payer over the past seven decades. A 1982 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, citing polls, argued that most Americans believed there was a "need for national health insurance and that it would require larger government intervention." A 2003 article in the American Journal of Public Health said public opinion generally ran in favor of health care reform. And a 2009 article by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely recognized authority on health care, said polls as far back as the 1930s show Americans have generally supported "the goals of guaranteed access to health care and health insurance for all, as well as a government role in health financing." We wanted to know more about what polls have shown. The polls A Rasmussen Reports poll in April 2014 found that only 37 percent of Americans favored single-payer. And although the proposal has largely been out of the public debate since before Obamacare became law, earlier polling also didn’t find clear support. In 2009, with the Obamacare bill being pushed in Congress, filmmaker Michael Moore said a majority of Americans favored a single-payer system. PolitiFact National rated his statement False. Polls had consistently shown that a majority of Americans wanted some form of universal health care coverage — they want uninsured people to have insurance -- but there was wide disagreement about how to do that. For example, some people supported keeping the current the system, but with tax credits to help uninsured people buy private insurance, while others backed requiring employers to provide employee health insurance, or to pay into a government fund that would pay to cover those without insurance. In other words, not majority support for a government-run health insurance system. To get a longer view of the polling, we contacted two polling experts: Liz Hamel, the Kaiser foundation’s public opinion and survey research director; and Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Kaiser’s latest poll on single-payer, in September 2009, found that less than a majority of Americans -- 40 percent -- favored single-payer. Conversely, seven other ways to expand health insurance coverage -- such as expanding Medicare or instituting an individual mandate requiring all Americans to have coverage -- all received higher levels of support. Three years earlier, a 2006 Kaiser poll indicated possible majority support for single-payer -- but it was constructed as a limited either-or question: "Which would you prefer -- the current health insurance system in the United States, in which most people get their health insurance from private employers, but some people have no insurance; or, a universal health insurance program, in which everyone is covered under a program like Medicare that's run by the government and financed by taxpayers?" Fifty-six percent said they preferred a universal system. Going back further, however, there was no such majority support. In 2001, two directors of the Harvard Opinion Research Program reviewed more than 100 public opinion polls over a 50-year period. One key conclusion was that "most Americans remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right and do not favor a single-payer type of national health plan." Given that it covered much of the period Nader referred to, that article is strong evidence refuting his claim. But we were curious about polling going back to the start of Truman's presidency. The results were mixed. Two examples from that period: On an either-or Gallup poll question in 1945, 53 percent said they favored "a plan set up by the government which would require every person to take part," while 34 percent preferred a voluntary plan "set up by the medical profession" and 13 percent had no opinion. But when asked this question in 1949 -- "Should the U.S. Congress pass the government's compulsory health insurance program, which would require wage or salary deductions from all employed persons to provide medical and hospital care for them and their families?" -- the results were: Yes, 44 percent; No, 47 percent; No opinion, 9 percent. Our rating Nader said a majority of Americans "since Harry Truman days" support single-payer health insurance, or "full Medicare for all." While there are individual poll results dating back to 1945 that indicate majority support for single-payer, overall the results are mixed, at best. In fact, one review of more than 100 polls over 50 years found that most people opposed single-payer. We rate the claim False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.

pomt-04467	Says she "oversaw an audit that won the city $2 million in franchise fees."	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/09/amanda-fritz/did-amanda-fritz-oversee-audit-won-city-2-million/	Portland City Council member Amanda Fritz talks a lot about the money she’s saved the city. It’s a central theme in her pitch for a second term on the council. In a recent campaign mailer, Fritz highlights some of the places she’s been able to earn her keep -- such as when she oversaw the Office of Cable Communications and Franchise Management (now the office for Community Technology). "Saving money with tough audits," the mailer reads. "Amanda Fritz oversaw an audit that won the city $2 million in franchise fees." Any time a politician takes credit for an audit we get a little suspicious -- often they’re not directly involved in the process. So we decided to check this one out. We called Fritz’s policy adviser, Tim Crail, who told us the audit in question was on XO Communications Services. As Crail explained it, an audit of the city’s contract with the company revealed that it had paid none of the franchise fees due to the city for nearly a decade. The city was owed nearly $2.5 million. Initially the city was poised to settle for some $1.3 million, he said, but Fritz, who oversaw the office at the time, "did not want to settle" and pushed to recoup the full amount. Eventually, the city succeeded in doing just that. Crail forwarded us an email that backed up this version of events. We also pulled a copy of the agenda item that approved final settlement with the city’s e-file document archive. It backed up the $2.44 million figure that we’d received from Crail. But it also raised a few questions for us. The item showed a timeline for the audit and eventual settlement that began well before Fritz was in office. The initial audit took place in 2006 and was further bolstered by further investigation in 2007. Fritz didn’t take office until 2008. To be sure, that was the year that negotiations toward a settlement began in earnest. It’s probably also worth noting that even if Fritz had been the commissioner in charge of the bureau when it began, she would not have been involved all that much in it. We spoke with Mary Beth Henry, the manager for Community Technology, and she explained that most audits are done according to a routine schedule, usually a three- or five-year cycle. It’s not until a company is "not responding to our information requests and we begin to suspect they're not paying the right amount" that the office will go to the commissioner in charge for permission to litigate. That’s around the time Fritz became involved. The city granted permission to litigate and, according to the agenda item, "negotiations resumed, and the parties … agreed to settle the issues for the full amount of past due principal and interest." In her mailer, Fritz said that she "oversaw an audit that won the city $2 million in franchise fees." Indeed, while she oversaw the Office of Cable Communications and Franchise Management, the city settled a franchise dispute worth nearly $2.5 million. Still, some clarification is necessary -- namely that the audit began well before she was in office and also that the city was poised to get $1.3 million of the amount due before she intervened. She did push to get more than initially offered, but it’s not as though the city would have left empty-handed otherwise. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-10912	The Black River’s water quality is "rated at the very top in North Carolina."	/north-carolina/statements/2018/aug/01/steve-troxler/defending-hog-farms-steve-troxler-says-north-carol/	If hog farms were wrecking the environment in eastern North Carolina, a local river would be more polluted. That was the logic behind a recent statement by Steve Troxler, the state’s agriculture commissioner since 2005. Troxler was among several Republicans to speak at a rally on July 10 in Duplin County, in rural Eastern North Carolina. They attended the event to denounce a court ruling against Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer and a partner of many N.C. hog farmers. A jury recently awarded $25 million to an Eastern North Carolina couple after they complained that a Smithfield farm caused swarms of flies, bad smells and other nuisances on their property. Troxler called the ruling "un-American" and "a travesty of justice." And he expressed doubt about the extent of damage that hog farms cause. "The Black River starts in Sampson County, runs through Duplin County right through hog country. And the water quality in that river is rated at the very top in North Carolina," Troxler said. "Now, how can that be with all of the stories you’ve heard about environmental disasters associated with the hog industry in North Carolina? It’s just not true," he continued. "But I think it goes back to the old adage that if you say it enough times, it must be true. So we have got to disprove that. We’ve got to educate, and we’ve got to talk about it." During hurricanes and other big storms, hog waste sometimes runs into rivers in Eastern North Carolina. Farmers keep the waste in lagoons, or ponds, often to use for fertilizer. The lagoons can overflow during floods. The Black River is a 50-mile-long tributary of the Cape Fear River, which last year was ranked as one of America’s "most endangered" by the American Rivers environmental advocacy group. The group listed the threat of pollution from hog farms as their reason for concern. So PolitiFact wondered about the accuracy of Troxler’s claim about the Black River. Is its water quality "rated at the very top" in North Carolina? A state classification In an email, a spokeswoman for the state Agriculture Department cited Black River’s classification with the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality. The river is classified as a swamp that has "outstanding resource water," meaning it has "excellent water quality" while "being of exceptional state or national ecological or recreational significance." It’s the highest classification the state offers. And only 900 of the 13,000 water bodies that DEQ examines — about 7 percent — have that label, according to Christy Simmons, a spokeswoman for DEQ. The department measures dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity, water temperature, total suspended solids, turbidity and fecal coliform, among other things. Fecal coliform bacteria come from warm-blooded animals. While coliform bacteria won’t necessarily make you sick, their presence can be a sign the water is home to harmful pathogens. At two stations in the Black River, fecal coliform is elevated about 10 percent of the time, according to DEQ. The Black River doesn’t violate any of the department’s quality standards. However, DEQ doesn’t collect fecal coliform data frequently enough to assess the extent that fecal coliform growth exists and fluctuates in the river, DEQ spokeswoman Bridget Munger said. The "true standard" for measuring fecal coliform levels is to take five samples in a 30-day period, she said, but DEQ collects data only once a month. The lower part of the Black River "is listed as data inconclusive due to low dissolved oxygen levels in this part of the river system," Munger said in an email. PolitiFact asked DEQ whether the Black River is, indeed, ranked as one of the state’s cleanest rivers. "I don’t think we have the data to make this specific claim," Munger said. "It doesn’t violate the water quality standards set for this stream. There are elevated nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria concentrations at times," Munger said. "There is only a single major (wastewater treatment plant) upstream of the Black River but there are many animal feeding operations in the Black River watershed." Lack of testing Thus, environmental advocates say the Black River’s "outstanding resource water" classification isn’t a true reflection of the river’s water quality. Part of the reason DEQ hasn’t found more pollution in the Black River is because it’s not properly looking for it and reporting it, said Grady McCallie, policy director at North Carolina Conservation Network. North Carolina doesn’t have standards for nitrogen and phosphorus in the water — which can cause illness. "If we did, I suspect a lot of the rivers in hog country would show significant burdens of these pollutants. Because we don’t, we rely on chlorophyll-a, a pigment associated with algae, as a marker for too much nutrient pollution," McCallie said in an email. The problem with testing for that kind of algae is that it blooms only when the water slows down, he continued. "That’s why you see significant impairment behind (a dam) on the Cape Fear, because the water slows down and the algae blooms. But as long as the Black River keeps flowing, the pollution is just carried down the river to cause problems downstream," McCallie said. Compounding issues, the state isn’t testing for a wide enough range of nutrients. "Lots of nutrient pollution in the river could be messing up the ecology, but we also don’t have a ‘periphyton’ standard, which would measure whether we have the right kinds or too much algae on the bank and bottom of the river," McCallie said. "EPA had previously recommended that North Carolina develop one, but we haven’t." ‘Hogwash’ Michael Mallin, a research professor at UNC-Wilmington, has conducted research on eastern NC rivers and co-authored the 2016 report "Environmental Assessment of the Lower Cape Fear River System." At the time, Mallin noted high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus at three sites in the Black River. Mallin checks the nutrients monthly and "often" finds nitrogen and phosphorus levels to be higher than the level that scientists would consider healthy, he said in a phone interview. He called the Black River’s ORW classification "outdated." Ryke Longest, director of the Duke Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, went a step further. "But the claim that this proves there are no water quality problems caused by hog farms is pure hogwash," Longest said in an email. "The truth is the Black River may be much more polluted than we know because it lacks sufficient monitoring stations to check its status." Longest, McCallie and Will Hendrick, staff attorney for the N.C. Waterkeeper Alliance, scoffed at Troxler’s suggestion that hog waste isn’t affecting the Black River and that the river’s water quality is among the state’s best. "What Troxler is saying is that because it’s classified at the top, its quality is at the top. But just because you say the quality should be good at this place doesn’t mean it is," Hendrick said. "It has the ORW classification. But that says nothing at all about the current water quality. Period." Our rating Troxler cast doubt on the effect of hog farms, saying the Black River’s water "is rated at the very top in North Carolina." While the Black River has an "outstanding" designation with the state, its environmental regulatory agency says the label doesn’t mean the river is one of the cleanest in the state. And experts say the state probably would find other harmful nutrients — if only it tested for them. We rate Troxler’s claim Half True.

pomt-04878	Says he never voted for a "tax increase."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/08/mark-neumann/gop-wisconsin-senate-primary-mark-neumann-says-4-y/	Wisconsin Republican Mark Neumann has repeatedly cast himself as more conservative than his three opponents in the Aug. 14, 2012 U.S. Senate primary -- and he often cites his record on taxes as evidence. On the tax reform page of his campaign website, Neumann declares he is "the only candidate who has never supported a tax increase." On another page, he says that during his two terms in the House of Representatives in the 1990s, he "repeatedly voted for lower taxes — never raising taxes." And a host of anti-tax groups have given him awards. But congressmen cast many votes. When it comes to Neumann’s claim that he never voted to raise taxes during his four years in Congress, at least two bills he voted for -- the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act -- raise questions. As the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office notes, the two were companion measures that President Bill Clinton signed into law on Aug. 5, 1997. Together they cut taxes by $370 billion, mostly through tax credits for families with children, and raised other taxes, primarily on cigarettes and air travel, by $130 billion. That’s a net tax reduction of $240 billion -- which the budget office pointed out was the first major reduction in federal taxes since the early 1980s. But, obviously, $130 billion in tax increases isn’t small change, either. In response, Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander said: "Neumann has always, always, always said he is fine making changes to our tax structure as long as the overall impact is the same or lower taxes." But that’s not the statement we’re testing. The claim was an absolute. Our rating Neumann said he never voted for a tax increase. But looking at just two of the major bills he supported, although they contained $370 billion in tax decreases, they also contained $130 billion in tax increases. We rate Neumann’s statement False.

pomt-02745	Says "Harry Reid has a better voting attendance record than these three Congressmen!"	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/17/eugene-yu/senate-candidate-blasts-opponents-absent-when-it-c/	What’s the best way to attempt to shame a conservative congressman and score some political points? Compare him unfavorably with the most powerful Democrat in Congress, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Eugene Yu, an upstart Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, recently launched a website that attacked the voting attendance records of three GOP House members who are also vying for the Senate seat: Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston. "Harry Reid has a better voting attendance record than these three Congressmen!" the website says. Yu’s point near the bottom of the website: "Their subpar voting records are evidence they are not representing you in Washington." Yu plans to air television ads making the claim, Morris News Service reported. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Yu’s claim was hyperbole or the truth. Yu’s claim came out close to the same time as an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report that Broun, over a two-year stretch, missed more than 80 percent of the meetings of a congressional Border and Maritime Security panel while being highly critical of federal border security. Yu, a South Korean immigrant whose campaign website notes he served in the U.S. Army and as a Richmond County sheriff’s deputy, used the nonpartisan website Govtrack.us as the basis for his claim. The website logs the votes of each member of Congress -- and when they didn’t vote. Here are the percentages of votes missed for each congressman, according to the website: Gingrey 3.9 percent Broun 3.7 percent Kingston 3.5 percent Reid 1.1 percent The website says the percentage of votes missed by each of the three Georgia members is above the congressional median of 2.3 percent. Case closed? Not entirely, we thought. PolitiFact Georgia looked at the Govtrack.us website and did an apples-to-apples comparsion of the voting records of the four men from the same time period, since each congressman joined Congress in different years. We chose July 2007, since that was the year Broun came to Washington. Broun has the shortest tenure of the four congressmen. Reid, Kingston and Gingrey joined Congress in 1987, 1993 and 2003, respectively. What we noticed is that the three Georgia members had voted nearly three times as often as Reid, a senator from Nevada, since July 2007. The House held more than 5,000 votes since July 2007 while the Senate, where Reid serves, had about 1,850 votes during the same time span. The House has more than four times as many members as the Senate. House members file more pieces of legislation. Since July 2007, Gingrey missed 4.9 percent of House votes, the highest of the three Georgia members, our review of Govtrack’s records shows. Broun missed 3.5 percent of House votes during that time span while Kingston missed 3 percent of those votes. On the Senate side, Reid missed 0.3 percent of the votes. Still, since the House votes more frequently than the Senate, is this a fair comparison? We mentioned this to the Yu campaign, and the candidate’s Augusta campaign office manager, Cole Watkins, sent us a reply via email. "What is important is that our elected officials take the voice of the Georgians to Washington for every vote and every committee meeting," Watkins wrote. "If they feel that they are overworked, then it is time for them to step down." Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said the congressman "strives to make every vote" but sometimes can’t do so because of illness and family emergencies. Crawford said Reid’s position as majority leader gives him an advantage in terms of voting. "Senator Reid sets the vote schedule in the Senate, which should make it nearly impossible for him to miss votes," Crawford said. To sum up, Yu claimed on a website that Reid has a better voting attendance record than three Georgia congressmen that Yu is running against for the U.S. Senate. The numbers show he’s correct. But Reid votes far less than the House members. To us, it’s akin to comparing a baseball player who’s been up to bat 190 times to another who’s had 500 plate appearances. Yu’s claim needs a little context to be fully explained. Under our rating system, this one meets the definition of a Mostly True.

pomt-10518	Obama voted for "tax subsidies and giveways" that have slowed oil companies from pursuing clean energy sources.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/12/hillary-clinton/a-boost-not-an-impediment-to-clean-energy/	At a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., on March 11, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton once again took on Sen. Barack Obama for supporting a 2005 energy bill. "In 2005, when we had a chance to say no to Dick Cheney and his energy bill, my opponent said yes and voted for it with all of those tax subsidies and giveaways that have been used by the oil companies and others to retard the development of clean, renewable energy," Clinton said. "When it counted, I said no, he said yes." Clinton, along with 25 other senators, including 19 Democrats, voted against the bill, which generally reflected the Bush administration's priorities. Obama and 73 Senate colleagues, including a total of 25 Democrats, supported the bill. Obama said the energy bill would help Illinois and promote greater energy independence by doubling ethanol use, spurring investment in hybrid and flexible-fuel vehicles and promoting clean-coal technology. But he said bolder action would have to be taken to rein in high energy costs. "This bill, while far from a solution, is a first step toward decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil," Obama said at the time. Clinton has made much of her opposition to the bill in her campaign — for example, characterizing the legislation during a Jan. 15, 2008, Democratic debate in Las Vegas as "a big step backward on the path to clean, renewable energy." Our examination of that claim found it to be false. This time, while Clinton rightly points out that the legislation included tax breaks for oil companies — $2.6-billion to be exact — those were largely wiped out by a $3-billion extension of taxes on crude oil to help offset costs associated with oil spills. The bulk of the $14.6-billion in tax incentives included in the legislation actually went to "renewable" sources of energy, to accelerate the development of wind, clean-coal and nuclear power, and hybrid vehicles. (Although there is debate over whether coal and nuclear power should be considered renewable.) The bill also included a mandate to produce more alternative fuel, requiring 7.5-billion gallons of ethanol — instead of petroleum-derived methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE — to be blended into gasoline by 2012. The industry is on pace to meet that target ahead of schedule, despite Clinton's claims that oil industry tax breaks have been used to retard development of renewable energy. Responding to a PolitiFact inquiry, the Clinton campaign referred to a speech she made on the Senate floor, citing her opposition to the bill because, in part, it ignored pressing energy challenges, including U.S. dependence on foreign oil. "The bill includes billions in subsidies for mature energy industries, including oil and nuclear," Clinton said in her July 29, 2005, remarks. However, this reasoning ignores the fact that tax breaks for oil and gas producers encourage domestic production, which helps reduce reliance on foreign oil. Clinton is right that Obama voted for the bill and she didn't. But because she incorrectly depicts the 2005 energy bill as a setback to renewable energy and a sop to Big Oil, we find her statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02266	"Seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage are going to see an average premium increase between $50 and $90 per month."	/florida/statements/2014/apr/09/rick-scott/obamacare-will-force-average-premium-increase-betw/	Gov. Rick Scott has made the Affordable Care Act’s cuts to Medicare Advantage a talking point early in his re-election campaign, no doubt spurred on by the fact more than 1.4 million Floridians are enrolled in the program. In an April 3, 2014, Spanish-language editorial in El Nuevo Herald, Scott brought up several talking points about the program, including threatened premium increases. "Seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage are going to see an average premium increase between $50 and $90 per month," he wrote. Many private insurers warned premiums would increase under Obamacare, but we wondered if they would go up as high as Scott said. After Scott's op-ed published and while we were working on this report, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced it would give Medicare Advantage a little more money next year rather than a bit less. But we still wanted to see where Scott got his numbers from and if they added up. First, though, let’s take a look at how Medicare Advantage works. How is Medicare Advantage different? Medicare became available in 1965, offering retirees both hospital insurance (Part A) and medical insurance for doctors visits (Part B). Lawmakers in the 1970s started suggesting private insurers could offer Medicare benefits at a lower rate than the government-run program. By 2003, those private plans came to be known as Medicare Advantage. You can read about the differences between the government-run and private programs here. About 30 percent of all Medicare recipients nationwide are enrolled in an Advantage plan. That ratio is about the same in Florida, with 1.4 million in Medicare Advantage and 4.4 million enrolled in Medicare, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services says. The advantage in Medicare Advantage was ostensibly the savings private companies would realize over what the federal government pays. In reality, that’s not the case; Advantage plans were subsidized at about 14 percent more than regular plans by 2009, when Obamacare was being debated. Some estimates put that overage at about 9 percent or so now. When the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, one of the attempts to pay for subsidized health insurance was to cut payments to the Medicare Advantage program to bring costs more in line with traditional Medicare. The proposal spurred an outcry from private insurers, which said the only alternatives they had were to cut services, shrink networks and increase premiums while cutting into the program’s enrollment. Enrollment has actually gone up, with a 9 percent increase between 2012 and 2013 alone, and about 30 percent since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010. Parsing payments But what about premium increases? Insurance industry advocacy group America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) insists Advantage plans faced cuts of about 6 percent, after a combination of sequestration, a reduction in subsidies, the elimination of bonuses the government paid for quality plans and Obamacare’s tax on premiums. At the start of every year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sets rates for Medicare Advantage so private insurers can bid on selling policies. Those rates are then revised in April and set for the year. Scott’s campaign directed us to an AHIP-commissioned report from February 2013 that stated on a per member, per month basis, Medicare Advantage patients could potentially face premium increases and benefit reductions in 2014 that would cost $50 to $90 a month. It was a national number, not a Florida number, and was only an estimate based on that year’s preliminary suggestion from the government. (AHIP’s projected Florida increase was actually $50 to $60.) AHIP did not readjust its estimates after payments were set in April 2013. This year AHIP released a new report that stated on a per member, per month basis, Medicare Advantage patients nationwide could have faced premium increases of $35 to $75, te report said. In Florida those potential increases could have been $35 to $45 by 2015. AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach said Scott used a number the group estimated, but it was taken from an old projection. "It seems to me if they were looking ahead, they should have used $35 to $75 in the latest report," Zirkelbach said. He added such a number shouldn’t necessarily be used in definite terms, because AHIP changes its estimates based on the latest information. They will address the $35 to $45 estimate for Florida in this year’s report after they have analyzed the rates that were proposed April 7, he said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services changed its initial estimate of a 1.9 percent rate cut to a 0.4 percent increase for next year. We have to note that we're checking what Scott said on April 3, before the federal government reversed its decision to cut payments for 2015 and slightly raise them instead. Even using an old estimate, Scott didn't know for sure that the cuts weren't going to happen. Other companies and insurance groups come up with their own projected cost increases, but they don’t reflect the trend that the Affordable Care Act seems to be doing what it set out to do: lowering the costs of Medicare Advantage. Joe Baker, president of the nonprofit Medicare Rights Center, said that despite the "scare scenarios and sky-is-falling stuff," enrollment is increasing, premiums are down almost 10 percent and coverage hasn’t decreased. Premiums may one day increase, but that hasn’t been the trend since 2010, he said. "People have been forecasting problems and none of those problems have occurred," Baker said. He added that the insurance industry lobbyists (and anti-Obamacare lawmakers) who have been fighting the payment reductions are defending the higher-cost private plans at the expense of the cheaper government-run option, and still manage to make Advantage plans profitable. "They want to keep market share, so they keep their product competitive," he said. "They want as much reimbursement as possible. They’re profit-making businesses, and even if they are nonprofit, they still care about margin." Our ruling Scott said in a Spanish-language editorial that "seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage are going to see an average premium increase between $50 and $90 per month." That’s an estimate made by an insurance lobbying group back in 2013, based on government data that wasn’t finalized. Experts we spoke to pointed out the estimate also was created in the best interest of the industry, seeking to maximize government reimbursements for private Advantage plans. Even the group that commissioned the report from which the projection was culled says it wasn’t the proper number for Scott to use. We should note that the numbers changed again shortly after Scott's editorial appeared. But even before that, the numbers Scott used were off. It’s possible that one day premiums may increase, but data since 2010 don’t reflect that. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-04-09T12:15:29	2014-04-03	['None']

pomt-07391	"One of three patients hospitalized (is) harmed by the care they receive."	/georgia/statements/2011/may/03/kathleen-sebelius/one-three-harmed-during-medical-care-white-house-o/	It’s no secret that health care costs are rising, but comments by a White House Cabinet member about the quality of care surprised us. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a recent Atlanta Press Club luncheon that "one of three patients hospitalized (is) harmed by the care they receive." Sebelius made the claim while discussing the need to provide better health care under the federal government’s Medicare program. The White House has begun a program to reduce preventable medical errors. The secretary attempted to drive home the seriousness of the issue by telling the story of a Stone Mountain woman who got an infection during ankle surgery. The woman, Sebelius said, needed another surgery to remove screws previously put in her ankle. She had to take antibiotics at home, needed weekly visits from a home health nurse and additional treatment from a doctor to make sure the infection went away. Sebelius said such tales are not rare. Still, we wondered about the frequency. Is it really one of three? The secretary’s office said her claim came from a recent study in the journal Health Affairs. The study’s headline said that adverse effects from medical care in hospitals may be 10 times greater than previously believed. "Overall, adverse events occurred in 33.2 percent of hospital admissions," the nine-page study said. Several newspapers reported the findings. "[Medical errors] are a big issue," said Dr. Peter Pronovost, director of the Johns Hopkins University Quality and Research Safety Group, who has received praise for his research on the topic. But is the statistic that Sebelius quoted correct? Doctors and medical experts began paying more attention to medical errors during care after a landmark 1999 study by the Institute of Health, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers concluded that as many as 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors. In November, a team of doctors released its findings on five years worth of medical records from 10 randomly selected hospitals in North Carolina between 2002 and 2007. They chose that state because it has worked hard to improve patient safety in recent years. The research found "25.1 patient harms per 100 admissions." Nearly one out of five patients had an adverse effect from medical care, the study found. The greatest percentage of harms came from medical procedures. Medications were a close second. Infections were third on the list. Dr. Christopher Landrigan, the lead author of the North Carolina study, said the adverse effect from medicine could range from a condition that requires a hospital stay to something as simple as a rash. Landrigan, associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical Center, said medical errors occur because care and treatment are imperfect. "The root cause of it is medicine is very complicated," Landrigan said, explaining why medical errors are so alarmingly high. "There is a high risk of something going wrong." The April report that Sebelius referenced focused on three hospitals of different sizes located in different parts of the United States. The researchers, led by Dr. David C. Classen, randomly selected patients from all adult age groups admitted to those hospitals during the month of October 2004 and reviewed the records of 795 patients. The largest forms of problems, nearly 40 percent of them, were related to medicine given for a surgery or procedure. The second-leading cause, nearly 30 percent, was procedure-related. Infections were the third-leading cause, the study found. About one third of the problems required a longer hospital stay. Nearly 8 percent resulted in permanent patient harm, a lifesaving procedure or death. Landrigan said he didn’t dispute the research in the Health Affairs report. He said Classen and his fellow researchers were more experienced in using some of the tools now used to detect medical errors. Classen and his team did use a broader definition of adverse events than in other studies, saying they did not restrict themselves to whether they were preventable or led to a major disability. "Fundamentally, the methodology was very sound," Landrigan said. To date, other reviews of the study have been well-received. "This is one of the best studies that now gives us a sense of how much harm is happening to patients in American hospitals," Dr. Robert Wachter, chief of medical service at the University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center, told American Medical News. Wachter was not involved in the research. To sum up, Sebelius repeated information from a report that falls in line with other research showing that the problem of medical errors is progressively getting worse. Although the report has not been disputed, there are a few caveats, such as the researchers used a broader definition of adverse events, some of the effects were not life-threatening and the short length of the research of the study. We rate the Sebelius claim as Mostly True.	None	Kathleen Sebelius	None	None	None	2011-05-03T06:00:00	2011-04-19	['None']
pomt-13836	"Each [Corbett administration] budget finished in the black."	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jul/13/mike-turzai/surprising-pa-budget-claim-gop-leader-almost-check/	State House Speaker Mike Turzai criticized Governor Tom Wolf’s stance on budget talks in a PennLive op-ed last month. As Turzai sees it, Wolf wants more taxes. But to balance the state’s books, he argues, it doesn’t have to be that way. "Under former Gov. Tom Corbett, we made some tough decisions. But in the face of a sputtering economy, we delivered four on-time, balanced budgets without increasing broad-based taxes," wrote Turzai. "Each budget finished in the black" With reports of deficits creeping past $2 billion when Wolf entered office, and the gloomy measure of the state’s finances referenced frequently during last year’s nine-month budget impasse, it may seem confusing to read that each Corbett year ended so well. We decided to look into the numbers for a clearer sense. So, a structural deficit occurs when expenditures are set to outpace revenue. Budget experts refer to this for deficits that appear within the fiscal year at hand, but also for projections for the fiscal years to come. Corbett did indeed end each fiscal year with a positive general fund balance. "That result must occur because the Governor is required to certify that the budget for the fiscal year that ends is in balance before agreement can be reached on the new fiscal year," Matthew Knittel, director of the Independent Fiscal Office, a nonpartisan state center for budget analysis, explained in an email. Mark Price, research director at the left-leaning Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, called Turzai’s recollection accurate "on it’s face." But he cautioned, "It’s not a full accounting of the implications of those choices." Nathan Benefield, vice president of policy at the Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank also thought the statement bore truth, but noted that that matter was "nuance[d]." "It depends on what ‘in the black’ actually means," he wrote in a statement. "Three out of the four Corbett budgets spent more than net revenue." But how can this be? Corbett has been largely blamed for the more than $1 billion in education cuts in 2011. His camp and Republicans in-state have long argued that pointing the finger at him is unfair. His predecessor, Ed Rendell, moved $1.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus funds towards schools after a study found the state’s system to be underfunded by $4.4 billion. "I don’t see, from what we’ve seen so far, how you’re not going to leave the next governor with a disaster on their hands," said Centre County Senator Jake Corman reacted in March 2009, according to Philadelphia City Paper. The Corbett administration early on told constituents that financial management would be different under their watch. "All of these events and fiscal realities conspire to make the 2011-12 budget the year we get our fiscal house in order," Charles Zogby, budget secretary at the time, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review roughly two months into Corbett’s term. "No more reliance on federal stimulus funds, no more gimmicks, no more use of one-time funds. We're focused on the core missions of government and making difficult decisions to live within [our] means." That budget would up the state’s contribution to education funding overall, as Team Corbett has reminded reporters plenty since, but did not nearly replace the federal money that had expired. The nearly $900 million shortfall in K-12 funding sent shockwaves through public education, and spawned, in many cases, crises, through school districts across the state. Price pointed out that the state may not have raised "broad-based taxes," cash-strapped school districts upped property taxes. More than six in 10 school districts have increased them for the last six years straight. While Turzai can note that they achieved Corbett’s goal and didn’t raise taxes, local jurisdictions absolutely did. But even with these cuts, the Corbett administration didn’t fix the state’s deficit in his four years. Actually, in 2014, while other states’ general funds swelled, Pennsylvania found itself in the red. His administration argued that they’d inherited a deficit margin of $4 billion; Rendell staunchly denied this, stating that Corbett walked into a surplus. (The Independent Fiscal Office notes that the surplus in 2011 was $1.1 billion.) On the more liberal side, experts and politicians argued that corporate tax cuts had diminished revenue and aggravated an already dire situation. In 2014, revenue came in $509 million lower than estimated, according to the Independent Fiscal Office. "[T]here are many methods that can and have been used to bring historical budgets into balance, such as one-time federal fund transfers, transfers from non-General Fund accounts and spending delays," Knittel told PolitiFact PA in an email. A late 2014 report from Knittel’s office lists a total $1.5 billion in transfers, payment delays and other "nonrecurring" deals "used to balance and enact the FY 2014-15 budget." In other words, Corbett was another governor who solved budget deficits with short-term maneuvers, but failed to fix the looming structural deficit that continues to hang over the state. The report did not celebrate these transfers: "Those measures must be replaced by other one-time measures, permanent funds or expenditure reductions. The reliance on fund balances and nonrecurring measures has allowed policymakers to defer solutions to the long-term structural imbalance identified by this analysis." Our ruling Turzai wrote, "Each budget finished in the black" from the Corbett administration. This is right, but borderline misleading. It conveys that the state was healthy place financially. Pennsylvania wasn’t. Moreover, the administration implemented one-time tactics to balance the books that their own budget secretary had previously decried. We rule this claim Half True.

pomt-09150	Rick Scott's former health care company, Columbia/HCA, committed "fraud."	/florida/statements/2010/jun/10/bill-mccollum/rick-scott-leading-polls-opponents-pull-out-fraud-/	Rick Scott’s opponents for governor are telling reporters to essentially brush off a June 2010 poll that shows the former Columbia/HCA hospital CEO beating both Attorney General Bill McCollum in the Republican primary and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink in a hypothetical November match-up. Focus on the fraud, they say. The fraud. The fraud. “Rick Scott has spent $15 million in half as many weeks to fund his public image repair squad’s pricey and misleading paid media campaign,” McCollum spokesman Kristy Campbell said June 10, 2010. “It’s no surprise he has skyrocketed in the polls since Floridians are just beginning to learn about his questionable past. His lead will evaporate when Floridians learn Rick Scott oversaw the most massive Medicare fraud scheme in American history.” Democrats added their own e-mail titled “Fraud is not a mistake,” and a 2-minute, 40-second web video called “Slick Rick.” “Rick Scott may think that his millions of dollars will allow him to avoid answering hard questions about his record as CEO of Columbia/HCA ... but with your help we will make sure he is held accountable,” said the Florida Democratic Party’s Eric Jotkoff. The fraud. The fraud. PolitiFact Florida had to bite. Here we’ll focus on whether Scott’s old company, Columbia/HCA, committed fraud, and also explain Scott’s role with the company, his part in a federal investigation and the outcomes of the federal probe. To borrow a line from Scott’s television ads — Let’s get to work. Columbia/HCA history Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company by purchasing more hospitals. A hospital network created efficiencies. Efficiencies created profits. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. When Scott resigned as CEO in 1997, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott’s campaign says. The company employed more than 285,000 people. Now about Scott’s departure in 1997. That year, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. In time it became apparent that the investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA bilked Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public and before the depth of the investigation became clear. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. At issue, Scott says, is that he wanted to fight the federal government accusations. The corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle. And settle, Columbia/HCA did. In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced what it called the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history when Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement, which all apply to when Scott was CEO: Columbia billed Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians; The company attached false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals; The company illegally claimed non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education; Columbia billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total fine: $1.7 billion. Plea deals, fraud As part of the 2000 settlement, Columbia/HCA agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. A corporate felony comes with financial penalties but not jail time, since a corporation can’t be sent to prison. Among the 14 felonies, Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Also, four Florida-based Columbia/HCA executives were indicted. Two were convicted of defrauding Medicare in 1999 and were sentenced to prison, only to have those convictions overturned on appeal. A third executive was acquitted and a jury failed to reach a verdict on the fourth. Was Scott close to going to prison for his part in the case? It appears not at all. The former CEO was never indicted and was never questioned in the case, he says. He may have been a target of the investigation — an ABC News report from 1997 says he was — but that never translated into charges. Sorting it out Let’s boil this down. Was Scott running Columbia/HCA when it found itself at the center of a massive federal investigation? Yes. Did the company pay a record $1.7 billion in government penalties and fines? Yes, Columbia/HCA paid. And as we checked in this item, did his former company commit fraud? Yes, it pleaded guilty to fraud charges as part of a settlement. Of course, the million-dollar question is how much of the blame ultimately falls on Scott? And that’s an answer we can’t provide. Scott was in charge so he bears some responsibility and has said so. But there has yet to come to light any detail of how much he knew, and when he knew it. Though that won’t keep us from looking. McCollum's campaign, in a statement, said Rick Scott's former company Columbia/HCA committed fraud. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04452	"Repealing and replacing Obamacare – that’s going to save $1 trillion over a 10-year period."	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/11/george-allen/george-allen-says-ending-obamacare-would-save-nati/	George Allen, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate, offers the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as the prime example of what he says is an overreaching federal government under President Barack Obama. In Monday night’s debate, he and Democratic candidate Tim Kaine were asked how they would avoid $1 trillion in automatic cuts split evenly between defense and domestic programs that are scheduled to begin Jan. 2. The cuts -- called sequestration -- can be averted only if Congress and the White House agree on a debt-reduction package. Allen’s plan included a big-ticket item. "Repealing and replacing Obamacare – that’s going to save $1 trillion over a 10-year period," he said. Allen gave an identical response when he was asked during a Sept. 20 debate how he would reduce debt and avoid sequestration. We were curious if canceling Obamacare really would save the government $1 trillion. The Allen campaign, in a blog, pointed to three studies to back up its claim: *A Jan. 6, 2011, report issued by House Republican leaders entitled, "Obamacare: A Budget-Busting, Job Killing Health Care Law." The GOP said that the health care act would add $701 billion to the nation’s debt over 10 years. *An April 9, 2012, study by Charles Blahous, a conservative policy analyst whom Obama approved in 2010 as the GOP trustee for Medicare and Social Security. He concluded that the law would add more than $340 billion to the nation’s debt woes over the next decade. *An Aug. 2, 2012, paperby the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. It said the reforms would expand the debt by at least $340 billion over 10 years and priced scenarios that might take the number beyond $500 billion. So Allen offered three studies by conservative analysts and none of them came close to saying that repealing Obamacare would save the government $1 trillion over 10 years. Allen also cited a July report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the primary agency charged with reviewing the cost of legislative proposals. He noted that the CBO estimated that the government’s price of implementing Obamacare would easily exceed $1 trillion over 11 years. But Allen omitted a crucial fact: the CBO said the reforms would more than pay for themselves through health care efficiencies, taxes and fees. In a July 24 letter to House Speaker John Boehner, the CBO estimated that repeal of Obamacare would increase deficits by $109 billion over 10 years. Here’s the CBO’s math: By repealing the law, the government would save $1.171 trillion in expanded health care costs. But it would lose $1.28 trillion in savings -- $711 billion in health care efficiencies demanded by the law and $569 billion in taxes and fees. The CBO left itself wiggle room, saying it is difficult to predict how the Affordable Care Act will affect the budget. Contributing to the complexity, the agency said, is a June decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allows states to opt in or out of Medicaid expansion. The studies by House GOP leaders, the Heritage Foundation and Blahous say the government is overestimating savings that will come from health care efficiencies. Those future savings, they say, could be used to pay for other programs and have little impact on deficits. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org last year described as "bogus" the GOP leaders’ contention that the repeal of Obamacare would save $701 billion. They said the Republicans overestimated costs of the law and wrongly claimed that the CBO was "double counting" savings. When GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney claimed that the Affordable Care Act added "trillions to our deficits and to our national debt," PolitiFact National rated it False. The same ruling was given to Romney when he said repealing the law would save $95 billion in 2016. Our ruling Allen, in describing how he would cut debt, said repeal of the health care act would "save $1 trillion over a 10-year period." The three studies he cites from conservative analysts don’t put the debt reduction anywhere near $1 trillion -- the closest he gets is $701 million in a report commissioned by the House Republican leadership. And a report by the nonpartisan CBO says the repeal of Obamacare would increase debt by $109 billion over 10 years. We rate Allen’s claim False.

pomt-02107	Says Dan Patrick "proposed Arizona-style show-me-your-papers legislation."	/texas/statements/2014/may/14/julian-castro/dan-patrick-proposed-arizona-style-law-requiring-p/	In an April 15, 2014, debate on immigration, Democrat Julián Castro said Republican Dan Patrick filed legislation akin to the 2010 Arizona mandate that police officers ask individuals about their immigration status. "He filed (Senate Bill) 1070-like show-me-your-papers legislation," the San Antonio mayor said in the debate aired by the Univision network. Castro said this action left Patrick out of step with Texas Democrats and Republicans who, he suggested, are more supportive of immigrants regardless of origin. Patrick, the Houston state senator in a May 27 runoff with incumbent David Dewhurst for the GOP lieutenant governor nomination, replied: "No, mayor. That’s a lie." Asked to elaborate, Patrick said: "First of all, that bill, which didn’t pass, would have only … come into play had police had suspicions that someone had committed a crime and then" they would "turn it over to" the federal Immigration Customs Enforcement agency, he said, "to try to keep us in line with Secure Communities," the program enabling fingerprints of arrested individuals to be checked against federal crime and immigration databases. Patrick further said he’d decided, "based on things the federal government has done, that that bill will not pass and will not be effective." We wondered if indeed Patrick filed an Arizona-type "show-me-your-papers" proposal. Looks like it. Castro's basis By email, Castro spokesman Jaime Castillo quoted Patrick’s measure, which died without a hearing in the 2011 legislative session, and said it was similar to a vital part of Arizona’s law. As recapped by Castillo, Patrick’s legislation specified: "A peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws (sic)." Castillo said Arizona's law "included language authorizing police officers to check immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe that someone is here illegally and, before" court rulings "to arrest without a warrant, anyone ‘the officer has probable cause to believe … has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States.’" Let’s look at both. Arizona law Arizona’s 21-page measure, signed into law in April 2010, included provisions intended to "work together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present" in the country. A key element of the law--which included state-level restrictions on human smuggling and workers congregating in search of day jobs--directed law officers at all levels to check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Another section said the immigration status of arrested individuals must be checked before their release. The law also provided for officers to transport individuals lacking proof of legal residency to federal authorities. Generally, as noted in a 2010 fact check, the law required legal immigrants to carry papers that confirmed their legal status, though the U.S. Supreme Court later threw out parts of the law that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations, as reported by The Associated Press in June 2012. According to the AP’s account, the court rejected the law’s mandate that immigrants obtain or carry immigration registration papers. It also tossed language making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job, the AP said, and voided a provision permitting police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants. The court let stand the law’s requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. Also, they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges. Patrick’s proposal According to a Texas legislative website, Patrick filed his measure, SB 126, on Nov. 8, 2010 in anticipation of the 2011 legislative session. The proposal called for revising the state’s Code of Criminal Procedure by specifying that a "peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws." If the officer has "probable cause" to believe as much, the officer could arrest the person and "shall identify and report the person to" ICE, the proposal said. Also, Patrick’s measure voided any local ordinance, regulation or policy interfering with an officer carrying out the described duty, furthermore giving legal immunity to an officer, agency or other governmental entity for any cause of action connected to carrying out such duties aside from intentional misconduct, recklessness or gross negligence connected with the intended law. At the time, news stories said Patrick had filed a proposal like the show-your-papers part of the Arizona law, though Patrick stressed in interviews that police officers would be required to ask a person if they were in the state legally only if they reasonably suspected otherwise. A Nov. 13, 2010, news story in the San Antonio Express-News quoted him as saying law agencies wanted the question to be required, instead of being optional, to avoid complaints of profiling. In January 2011, Patrick separately told the Associated Press and an MSNBC host that he’d been to Arizona to see its law in action. Patrick said on MSNBC: "It's workable for our police. And then once a police officer says to someone, are you legally present, because they don't have any identification, we then give the discretion to the officer to take the next step. Is that an arrest, is it detaining that person on suspicion of another possible crime?" Logan Spence, Patrick’s lieutenant governor campaign manager, replied to our query about Patrick’s proposal with an email suggesting Patrick’s proposal was more narrow than the entire Arizona statute. By phone, Castillo said Castro didn’t say in the debate that Patrick filed the entire Arizona law. Our ruling Castro said Patrick "proposed Arizona-style show-me-your-papers legislation."

pomt-14876	Says Hillary Clinton told her daughter and a government official that Benghazi "was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/11/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-hillary-clinton-gave-conflicting-a/	In Ben Carson’s playbook, a good defense is a good offense. Media reports have raised questions about Carson’s account of being violent as a child and whether he was offered a West Point scholarship. So the retired neurosurgeon got a question on his biography at the Nov. 10 debate. "Are you worried your campaign -- which you've always said, sir, is bigger than you -- is now being hurt by you?" asked Fox Business Network debate moderator Neil Cavuto. Carson switched the topic to call Hillary Clinton a liar for her comments as secretary of state about the attack in Benghazi. "When I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video. … Where I came from, they call that a lie." We decided to fact-check Carson’s account of conflicting statements by Clinton and whether that shows she was lying. Carson has a point that Clinton privately told a few people the attacks were the work of terrorists. But he’s not accurate when he says she told "everybody else" that it was a video. Her public remarks were much more measured than Carson suggests. What Clinton said about Benghazi We’ve based our fact-checking of the Benghazi attacks on news accounts, government press releases and congressional investigations, as well as information we’ve received from the Carson and Clinton campaigns. As we have noted before, there was initial confusion about the cause of the attack at the time it happened. One key question was whether Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice purposefully downplayed the idea that it was a terrorist attack when she spoke on five Sunday talk shows days after the incident, instead suggesting that it a spontaneous reaction to a movie that mocked Islam. That movie had drawn protests around the Middle East at about the same time that the Benghazi attack happened. Here are Clinton’s key comments: Sept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks. Sept. 11, 2012: During a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, Clinton said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks, according to notes from that conversation documented in a State Department email. However, Ansar al-Sharia soon retracted the claim. Clinton issued a public statement at 10:08 p.m. that didn’t indicate a cause for the attack but said, "Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. ..." At 11:12 p.m., Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying: "Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Queda-like (sic) group. The ambassador, whom I hand picked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children. Very hard day and I fear more of the same." Sept. 12, 2012: In a call with Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, Clinton said, "We know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack — not a protest. Based on the information we saw today we believe the group that claimed responsibility for this was affiliated with al-Qaeda." Sept. 13, 2012: In public remarks with Moroccan Foreign Minister Saad-Eddine Al-Othmani, she condemned the video, saying, "I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these protests in a number of countries.. ...." Clinton did not say, though, that the video sparked the attack in Benghazi. Sept. 14, 2012: At a ceremony, Clinton said, "This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We’ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We’ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with. The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob." So she mentions Benghazi in one sentence and then more broadly "American embassies" in the next sentence. Sept. 20, 2012: During a press conference Clinton talked about "protests in several countries around the world" and then said, "And as I have said the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it." Clinton didn’t specify Benghazi in these comments. Sept. 21, 2012: Clinton talked at a press conference about protests in several cities in Pakistan and then said: "We found the video that’s at the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible. But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own extremist ideologies. Yesterday afternoon, when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans." It would be possible for a listener to conflate her comments about the video and Benghazi, but if you look closely at her statement she doesn’t do that. She blames the video on protests in Pakistan, but when she talks about Benghazi a couple of sentences later, she blames it on terrorism. One more note: Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods who died in the attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton Sept. 14, 2012, for a Fox News report that aired on Oct. 23, 2015. Woods was in Washington for her testimony about Benghazi and had previously testified himself before a House committee in 2013. "I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son," the entry said. Woods had previously recounted the same conversation to the media starting in 2012. Our ruling Carson said Clinton told her daughter and a government official that Benghazi "was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video." But he’s oversimplifying multiple statements from Clinton during the month of the attacks. He has a point that Clinton told her daughter that terrorists attacked in Benghazi, and she told the Libyan president that a terrorist group had taken responsibility. But those were private comments made hours after the attack. Carson misleads when he said that she told everybody else that it was a video. On the day after the attack, she told the Egyptian prime minister it had nothing to do with the film. At other times, Clinton talked about the video but didn’t say it caused the attacks. At other times, she blamed the video more broadly for protests in various places. A family member of a victim said Clinton blamed the video for his son’s death, but we didn’t find that same sentiment expressed in any of her public comments. Carson is oversimplifying and distorting Clinton’s comments to portray a complex situation in the worst possible light. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-03221	Obamacare provision will allow "forced home inspections" by government agents.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/21/blog-posting/bloggers-say-obamacare-provision-will-allow-forced/	A startling Obamacare claim swept from blog to blog last week: "SHOCKING: Obamacare Provision Will Allow ‘Forced’ Home Inspections." One blogger used a photo of armed officers entering a cottage, with the overline, "We’re from the government and we’re here to raid your home." Another said "this is why the IRS has been training with AR-15s." A reader sent us a post from BenSwann.com, "Obamacare provision: ‘Forced’ home inspections." He wondered if it were true. So did we. South Carolina’s concern "Forced home inspections"? Um, no. The flurry originated with BenSwann.com blogger Joshua Cook on Aug. 13. He picked up the phrase "forced home inspections" from a state lawmaker in South Carolina. Back in March, as a group of state legislators discussed a bill to fight the Affordable Care Act, Rep. Rick Quinn offered a specific example of something in the law that worried him: "The forced home inspections that I’ve heard about." Cook was there. And the comment nagged him. He noticed people weren’t really writing about the issue. "It's just been bothering me," he told PolitiFact. So he wrote about it last week, talking with an attorney who spoke at the committee hearing and posting a video clip of Quinn’s comment. "The point is South Carolina legislators believe it, and are convinced this is going to happen," Cook told us. Quinn, indeed, had added an amendment to the South Carolina Freedom of Health Care Protection Act to prevent state workers from conducting any "involuntary … in-home visitation." It passed the House, but the Senate didn’t have a chance to vote. Cook says lawmakers hope to revive the legislation in the next session. But that Obamacare program that worries Quinn? It already is — by statute — voluntary. There’s literally nothing to suggest raids or weapons. Home visiting programs Concerned bloggers pointed to an Obamacare-funded grant program for "maternal, infant and early childhood home visiting." In 2011, the government announced $224 million in funding. Most of those grants are going to health departments — none, so far, in South Carolina. The idea: fund visits from nurses and social workers to high-risk families to help them develop skills to keep kids healthy, get them ready for school, and prevent child abuse and neglect. Home-visit programs already existed in 40 states. But to Kent Masterson Brown, a health care litigator invited by South Carolina lawmakers to help them avoid implementing Obamacare, the programs suggest overzealous nonprofits telling parents how to raise their children without their consent. Brown raises the specter of a home-schooling family subject to "intervention" for school readiness, their children forced into schools and onto medications and vaccines. "The federal government will now set the standards for raising children and will enforce them by home visits," he wrote about the law. But consent is built into the program. A home visitor could no more compel a family to vaccinate kids than a pediatrician could, said Kay Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School who’s one of the nation’s experts on state home visiting policy. Here’s what the Affordable Care Act says: Home-visiting programs must assure they’ll have procedures that ensure "the participation of each eligible family in the program is voluntary." Here’s how that might work, according to Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, who supports such programs. A low-income mom gets her prenatal care at a community health center. Her doctor asks if she would like visits from a nurse after the baby comes to offer tips and answer questions. Mom could say yes — or no. It’s like the old days of health care, Rosenbaum said, when nurses would visit families to show how to breastfeed, sterilize bottles, care for babies and cope when you’re exhausted. "It's real health education in the home, is the purpose of it," she said. Such programs have a long history backed by peer-reviewed research, she said. They work. "They make sure that you don't go home to nothing. It's done to help families, not to police them." A classic randomized trial in Elmira, N.Y., showed nurse visits to families of newborns reduced child abuse and neglect, even years later. They also reduced government spending for low-income unmarried women. Brown, the lawyer, says he’s concerned families have no protection from social workers. He’s concerned workers won’t be well-trained and will overstep families’ rights. Nobody should knock on your door without a badge, he said. "What I see in this is a monster, frankly. And you can quote me on that," he said. That’s the fear. The law, however, specifies that programs be voluntary, their staffs trained and supervised, and the home-visiting models they follow based on strong research. Any "forced home inspection" wouldn’t be under the law — it would be in direct opposition to it. And if a family welcomed help but later decided it made them uncomfortable? Samantha Miller, a spokeswoman for the U.S. agency administering the program, said families could stop accepting services "without consequence at any time and for any reason." Our ruling Bloggers passed around a claim last week that a provision of the new health care law will allow "forced" home inspections by government agents. But the program they pointed to provides grants for voluntary help to at-risk families from trained staff like nurses and social workers. What bloggers describe would be an egregious abuse of the law — not what’s allowed by it. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2013-08-21T12:10:19	2013-08-15	['None']
pomt-08842	"If we ban the practice of earmarks, we could save the American taxpayer anywhere between $15 (billion) to $20 billion dollars a year in pork-barrel spending."	/florida/statements/2010/aug/10/marco-rubio/rubio-tackles-earmarks/	In his bid for the U.S. Senate, Republican Marco Rubio has unveiled multiple proposals to reduce federal spending, including calling for an end to congressional earmarks. In an Aug. 3, 2010, campaign video, he said: "The practice of earmarks in Congress is really one that lends itself to sort of corruption. It allows for all sorts of dealmaking like what they did with Obamacare to get it passed. But more insidious about it is the fact that these projects are funded without any public oversight, without the attention they deserve. In fact, powerful legislators are able to secure millions and millions of dollars for their home districts at the expense of the rest of the country. It's wrong. .... If we ban the practice of earmarks, we could save the American taxpayer anywhere between $15 (billion) to $20 billion dollars a year in pork-barrel spending." In this Truth-O-Meter item, we wanted to explore whether Rubio cited the correct figure: do earmarks add up to $15 (billion) to $20 billion a year? We are not going to evaluate whether all these projects equal "pork-barrel spending." We can find definitions of "earmarks" but "pork-barrel spending" is an opinion. We decided to look at the most recent three years worth of earmarks because Rubio's campaign sent us sources that pertained to the current fiscal year and the previous two years. Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos directed us to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog group that aims to reduce wasteful spending. The group concluded in a Feb. 17, 2010, report that earmarks added up to about $15.9 billion for fiscal year 2010. Taxpayers for Common Sense has analyzed earmarks since 2004. TCS has a handy Q&A on its website, which defines earmarks as "legislative provisions that set aside funds within an account for a specific program, project, activity, institution, or location. These measures normally circumvent merit-based or competitive allocation processes and appear in spending, authorization, tax, and tariff bills." TCS concluded there were $18.3 billion of congressional earmarks for fiscal year 2008, $17.9 billion for fiscal year 2009, and $15.9 billion for 2010. It's possible to find different totals for earmarks depending upon which entity anyalzes them because of varying definitions of earmarks, according to TCS. So we decided to look at earmark amounts provided by the federal government. We contacted the Office of Management and Budget. The OMB's website has a link to congressional earmarks, which showed about $16.6 billion for 2008, $15.3 billion for 2009 and $11.1 billion for 2010. The OMB, which obtains its information about earmark amounts from federal agencies, provided this definition: "The Administration defines 'earmarks' as 'funds provided by the Congress for projects, programs, or grants where the purported congressional direction (whether in statutory text, report language, or other communication) circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process.'" It's worth noting that when it comes to spending cuts, earmarks are a very thin slice of the overall budget. In fiscal year 2010, consolidated federal government outlays (including Social Security trust funds and the postal service) totaled more than $3,720 billion while earmarks were about $11.1 billion, according to OMB. We also contacted the Congressional Research Service to ask for its conclusions about earmark amounts in recent years. CRS spokeswoman Janine D'Addario told us that since CRS works exclusively for Congress and its staff, it would not provide an employee to interview on the record for attribution. CRS also would not provide a copy of the earmark report for us to post, but D'Addario gave us the name of the report and suggested that we obtain it from a member of Congress. (To provide readers full disclosure, PolitiFact Florida gathers information through on-the-record interviews and posts links to data.) U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson's office sent us a copy of the CRS report, "Earmarks Disclosed by Congress: FY2008-FY2010 Regular Appropriations Bills." That reports shows in Table 6 that the total amount of congressional earmarks disclosed by Congress and requested by Congress was $12.5 billion in fiscal year 2008, $12 billion in fiscal year 2009 and $10.1 billion in fiscal year 2010. We asked Steve Ellis, TCS vice president, how his organization could reach a different conclusion regarding the amount of earmarks than OMB and CRS. "CRS takes as gospel what Congress says is an earmark. The House and Senate don't always agree on what is an earmark. So some things will be disclosed as an earmark in the Senate, the same item will not be disclosed in the House, and in the final bill is not disclosed," Ellis said. At OMB, "they task each agency to actually review their appropriations and to tell them what earmarks were in their bills." We also asked Meg Reilly, an OMB spokesperson, how different entities could reach varying conclusions regarding the amount of earmarks. "It’s true that OMB collects data from federal agencies annually on earmarks in appropriations bills for reporting on earmarks.gov," she wrote in an e-mail. "We can’t speak on behalf of CRS or TCS, but their definition of earmarks may be different, which could account for a difference in numbers." So how do Rubio's numbers stack up? Rubio claimed that the total of earmarks was between $15 (billion) and $20 billion. During his video, Rubio did not explain what years he was referring to for that amount but his campaign provided information about fiscal years 2008 through 2010. Taxpayers for Common Sense concluded that the amounts were between $15.9 billion to $18.3 billion for the past three years -- all within Rubio's range. The Office of Management and Budget concluded the amounts were $11.1 billion, $15.3 billion and $16.6 billion -- so two of the three were within Rubio's range. So far, Rubio is scoring five out of six here. The CRS Congressional earmarks ranged from $10.1 billion to $12.5 billion -- all below Rubio's estimate. But since Rubio was within range for most of the OMB and Taxpayers for Common Sense figures, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04189	Says that "the state spends more money on tax giveaways than it receives in tax collection."	/oregon/statements/2012/dec/10/our-oregon/does-oregon-spend-more-tax-giveaways-it-brings/	Middle ground is a hard thing to find in politics these days. Partisanship, especially at the national level, is almost a sport. And yet, this election cycle there did seem to be one point of agreement: The tax code needs to be reworked and breaks, in particular, need a close examination. In a recent blog post, Our Oregon, an organization backed by several public employee unions and other groups of similar political views, made the same case for the Oregon’s tax code. Here’s part of a recent post their Sockeye blog published on the topic: "Oregon's tax expenditure code is a list of 378 different tax breaks, writing exceptions into Oregon's law for certain income, property, and other items. While some of the tax expenditures are good, common sense ideas (like the earned income tax credit, which provides relief for low-income, working families), others appear completely baffling (did you know that boat owners can take a tax credit for each of their boats?) "Overall, Oregon's tax expenditure code costs the state $32 billion each budget cycle, while Oregon collects about $14 billion in total taxes and other revenue. To put it plainly: Each budget cycle, the state spends more money on tax giveaways than it receives in tax collection." We decided to check it out. First, we called up the Oregon Department of Revenue. Spokesman Dennis Thompson told us to take a look at the Tax Expenditure Report. This report lays the details out pretty clearly for 2011-13. During the current biennium, the state is expected to bring in some $27.2 billion, while its tax giveaways are expected to total $31.3 billion. The numbers support Our Oregon’s statement. There is some important context offered in the expenditure report right before these figures. The dollar impact listed for tax breaks is not the amount of revenue you could gain if you wanted to repeal all of them. Take federal land, for example. Oregon has a lot of it -- and it’s exempt from property taxes. Even though we technically forgo those revenues, we don’t have much of a choice. It’s also true that certain tax breaks should, if working correctly, generate more revenue for the state than they give away -- inducements to attract business, for example. We called Scott Moore, Our Oregon’s spokesman, and spoke with him about all of this. "We tend to speak pretty generally about the money that the state loses through the tax code because there is a great deal of complexity in individual expenditures," he said. But "I don’t think that discounts, in any way, the general statement that the revenue impact of this big collection of tax breaks is astonishing. "There is clearly room to make that system more efficient and more effective and save money." He’s not the only one who feels this way, of course. The Legislature has already instituted a six-year cycle in which all credits will get reviewed before being renewed. The folks at Our Oregon believe they should go further and statistics like this one underscore that. There was, however, one other detail that caught us. The Our Oregon blog post mentioned $14 billion in total taxes and other revenue. The report we read put the figure at $27 billion, nearly double that. Moore told us the Our Oregon figure comes from a separate 2011-13 Budget Highlights document that references the state’s general fund, leaving out property taxes, beer and wine taxes, gas taxes and others. Moore said they went with the $14 billion figure because that’s the money the Oregon Legislature has the most direct control over. Property taxes, for example, usually go to local governments. But if you follow that line of reasoning, there’s also a significant portion of the tax code that the Legislature doesn’t have control over -- again, federal land. In the blog post, Our Oregon said "the state spends more money on tax giveaways than it receives in tax collection." State budget documents back them up. But context matters. In the sentence before the statement we’re ruling on, Our Oregon compares apples and oranges. You can’t count revenues the Legislature has control over and then compare them with tax breaks that include some the Legislature has no say in. We find that additional clarification is needed. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Our Oregon	None	None	None	2012-12-10T16:55:29	2012-12-04	['None']

pomt-12034	"Nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. That needs to change."	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/15/roy-blunt/roy-blunt-points-out-serious-lack-internet-infrast/	The internet has become a part of everyday American life, and people are more connected now than ever before. However, some Americans do not have access to high quality broadband services. At the Missouri State Fair, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt addressed an audience about the importance of broadband access for rural residents, saying that two-thirds of rural Missouri residents are lacking broadband access. Nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. That needs to change," Blunt posted on Twitter Aug.8, 2017. The tweet included a video clip from the address. Blunt went on to talk about why he believes broadband is necessary. He also went on to discuss how he is an advocate for broadband issues on the Senate floor. Blunt’s remarks got us thinking: Are two-thirds of rural Missourians really lacking access to the service? A spokesperson for Sen. Blunt pointed us to a Wall Street Journal piece, as well as some past research by the PolitiFact team as the sources backing the statement. What is broadband? Before we delve deeper into the issue, let’s establish what "broadband" means. The FCC describes it in a 2016 report as the speed benchmark of 25 Mbps download speed and 3 Mbps upload speed for fixed (not mobile) services. The FCC is required by a portion of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to report on whether Americans are able to access advanced telecommunications capabilities. They define this as, "‘high-quality’ capability that allow users to ‘originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video’ services." Basically, high-speed internet. In the same report, the FCC said 10 percent of Americans lack access to broadband — 39 percent of rural Americans and 4 percent of Americans living in an urban area. Currently, many rural Missourians use alternatives to broadband like DSL, or digital subscriber line, which uses the same two-wire copper telephone line used for landlines. Some people just use their phones for internet, but for Northeast and Northwest Missourians, it’s tough to get service. Surprisingly, 8 percent of rural Missourians still use dial-up internet. The numbers While 39 percent of rural Americans live without access to broadband internet, that figure jumps to 61 in Missouri, according to the FCC. Missouri is lagging compared to surrounding states. Forty-nine percent of rural residents in Kansas are without broadband access, 56 percent in Illinois, 37 percent in Iowa and 48 percent in Arkansas. The lack of access affects everything from telemedicine to searching for jobs. It even touches agriculture: Janie Dunning, Missouri Farm Bureau’s consultant for broadband, said farmers utilize technology in order to do "precision farming." By combining computers and farm equipment, production can increase, and business can be easier to manage. Further, when looking at a map provided by the FCC, we can see that in Missouri, even when rural areas have broadband access, most of those residents only have one provider option. It gets worse. "One caution on using broadband maps and data — you need to understand how ‘access’ is being counted," said University of Missouri Extension state specialist for community development Sharon Gulick. "In many cases as long as one person or business in the zip code has access, that zip code is considered covered. Also, having it available and it being affordable are also two very different issues." In most rankings, Missouri is around No. 40 to 47 when it comes to broadband access, Dunning said. Missouri has over 6 million people living it, 70 percent of whom are in urban areas and 30 percent in rural areas, Dunning said. So with almost a third of the population residing in rural areas, how are there so many without broadband? When looking at people per square mile, the state average is 87.1 people per square mile. In urban areas, that number skyrockets to 5,000 people per square mile; conversely, some rural areas have as few as one or two people per square mile. "Even non-profit providers need a return on investment," Dunning said. "Providers prioritize the urban areas since there’s more people who will use their services. It’s just more financially feasible." Our ruling Blunt said that nearly two-thirds of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. FCC numbers back up his statement. Experts agree that Missouri has a broadband access issue, and all cite the same FCC report. The 2016 Broadband Progress Report from the FCC states that 61 percent of rural Missourians lack access to broadband. The report is the most recent and uses a benchmark of of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps for high-speed internet. While 61 percent isn’t 2/3, it’s nearly so, especially in the context of the statement. We rate Blunt’s claim True.	None	Roy Blunt	None	None	None	2017-09-15T11:35:18	2017-09-08	['Missouri']
pomt-13029	Says Indiana Gov. Mike Pence "advocated diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy."	/california/statements/2016/dec/02/gavin-newsom/pences-support-conversion-therapy-not-settled-matt/	EDITOR’S NOTE: On July 28, 2016, PolitiFact California rated as True a statement by Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom that Republican Indiana Governor and now Vice President-Elect Mike Pence "advocated diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy." We based that ruling on a statement Pence made in 2000 on his congressional campaign website, in which Pence says "Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior." Subsequently, our readers and other fact-checking websites examined the claim and made some points that led us to reconsider the fact check. Readers pointed out that Pence never explicitly advocated for conversion therapy in his statement and that he may have been pushing for safer sex practices. Pence’s words are open to other interpretations: Gay and lesbian leaders, for example, say his statement continues to give the impression that he supported the controversial practice of conversion therapy when his words are viewed in context with his long opposition to LGBT rights. Taking all of this into account, we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis. PolitiFact California’s practice is to consider new evidence and perspectives related to our fact checks, and to revise our ratings when warranted. California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom joined in the chorus of attacks on Donald Trump’s choice for running mate during a speech at the Democratic National Convention in late July. Newsom, a prominent LGBT rights supporter, said Republican Indiana Gov. and now Vice-President Elect Mike Pence "advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy." Conversion therapy is a controversial practice that seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation from gay to straight. It’s banned in five states including California, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont and New Jersey. Our research When asked about the claim in late July, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to Pence’s own words. During his first successful run for Congress in 2000, Pence wrote on his campaign website, under a section called Strengthening the American Family: "Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior." Many, including Newsom and other LGBT advocates, have interpreted the last portion of Pence’s statement, about "assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior," as evidence he supported conversion therapy. The statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. And Pence has said little, if anything, specific on the topic. We heard from a number of readers who said Pence’s words could be interpreted as supporting groups that aim to not necessarily change one’s sexual orientation, but instead as supporting groups that advocate for curbing sexual behaviors that lead to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Pence has, for example, advocated for abstinence as a way to prevent sexual diseases. "Indeed, promoting safer sexual behaviour is a common intervention strategy in the fight against HIV/AIDS," reader Justin Goddard of Ontario, Canada, said in an email. Other fact-checking websites, such as Snopes.com, have examined the claim Pence supported conversion therapy and concluded it’s not a settled case. LGBT rights advocates say given Pence’s extensive record of opposing gays and lesbians, his words are indeed confirmation that he supported conversion therapy. "That is very specific language — some might call it a dog whistle — that has been used for decades to very thinly cloak deeply homophobic beliefs," Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force told the New York Times in late November. "Particularly the phrase ‘seeking to change their sexual behavior,’ to me, is code for conversion therapy." "It’s the most likely reading" of Pence’s words, Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California, an LGBT civil rights group, told PolitiFact California. "We view this in the context of the whole record. … You can’t think of someone who is more hostile to LGBT people and people with AIDS than Mike Pence." Also on the 2000 website, Pence wrote: "Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage." And "Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual’s [sic] as a 'discreet [sic] and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities." Statement mischaracterized? In an email exchange with PolitiFact California in late July, Pence’s spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether Pence supported conversion therapy. Four months later, Lotter told the New York Times, however, that it was "patently false" that Mr. Pence "supported or advocated" the practice of conversion therapy. Lotter added that Pence had been calling for federal funds to "be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices" during his 2000 congressional campaign, and he said it was a "mischaracterization" to interpret the statement as a reference to conversion therapy. Newsom’s campaign spokesman said in November he did not have any additional information pointing to Pence’s stance on conversion therapy. As reported by McClatchy DC in July, Pence continues to be at the center of gay rights controversy: "Pence angered gay rights groups (in 2015) when he signed a religious freedom bill that opponents said would allow businesses to discriminate against customers based on their sexual orientation. Pence later backtracked, when state lawmakers changed the law to say that no discrimination would be allowed." At the Republican National Convention this summer, the McClatchy news service noted: "Delegates voted to approve a platform that backs the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children. The platform makes no specific mention of gay conversion therapy, but critics say that passage is aimed at accepting the notion that one’s sexual orientation can be changed." GOP Party Chairman Reince Priebus, who President-Elect Donald Trump has selected as chief of staff for the incoming administration, has denied that passage encourages conversion therapy. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said Indiana Governor and now Vice President-Elect Mike Pence "advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy." Pence’s own words on his campaign website from 2000, specifically a passage that calls for funding groups that give "assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior," have been interpreted by LGBT advocates as supporting the controversial practice. Pence’s statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. Readers and other fact-checking outlets have said Pence may have been calling for safer sexual sexual practices rather than pushing for efforts to change one’s sexual orientation. When asked about the statement in July, Pence’s spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether the Indiana governor supports the practice. Months later, Lotter strongly denied that Pence supports conversion therapy and said Pence was calling for funds to "be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices" Given Pence’s strong and extensive opposition to LGBT rights, his words in 2000 have been widely interpreted as supporting the controversial practice. Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force, has called them "a dog whistle" for like-minded supporters of conversion therapy. Newsom’s definitive claim, however, that Pence advocated for conversion therapy is not fully supported. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-12709	On filibusters for U.S. Supreme Court nominees.	/florida/statements/2017/mar/09/bill-nelson/did-sen-bill-nelson-flip-flop-use-filibuster-supre/	A conservative group misfired in its attack on U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., for being inconsistent on the use of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. America Rising Squared, the policy arm of the conservative America Rising PAC, said in an online post that Nelson, up for re-election in 2018, committed a "filibuster flip-flop" on President Donald Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch. "In 2006, Nelson opposed the use of a filibuster for the nomination of Justice (Samuel) Alito, but now has adopted a different stance," said America Rising Squared, a group advocating for senators to support Gorsuch. We decided to look at whether Nelson flip-flopped on using the filibuster for a Supreme Court nominee on our Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has been consistent on an issue. Experts told us America Rising mischaracterized Nelson’s record. Samuel Alito and the filibuster process As proof of its claim, America Rising Squared points to Nelson’s votes in January 2006 on the nomination of Alito, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to succeed retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Democrats fought against Alito’s nomination mainly due to his criticism of Roe vs. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion nationwide. But in the weeks leading up to the vote, Democrats, including leaders Harry Reid and Charles Schumer showed little interest in using the filibuster to block his nomination. (Reid and Schumer would ultimately go along with the filibuster.) Under Senate rules, a minority of senators -- even just one -- can filibuster, or hold up, a Supreme Court nomination, effectively requiring 60 votes for a motion to end debate and move on to the nomination itself. When the minority party filibusters an initiative, as many Democrats have pledged to do with the Gorsuch nomination, the majority party can force a vote through a procedure called cloture. This effectively ends the filibuster by limiting the debate to 30 more hours. Days before the vote on Alito, Reid said, "Everyone knows there is not enough votes to support a filibuster." Massachusetts Democrats John Kerry and Ted Kennedy led a filibuster effort anyway, drawing interest from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as they contemplated a presidential bid. But the effort failed, as almost half of the Senate's Democrats — including Nelson — voted against it on Jan. 30. We found no statements by Nelson at the time about his opinion on the use of the filibuster, but he didn’t go along with it. The Senate voted 72-25 to end debate on Alito's Supreme Court nomination. A "yes" vote was a vote to end debate, while a "no" vote was a vote to filibuster Alito’s nomination. Nelson was one of 19 Democrats and 53 Republicans to vote "yes." The next day, the Senate held an up-or-down vote on Alito’s nomination. Nelson was one of 42 senators to vote against Alito while 58 voted in favor. Nelson told reporters that he viewed Alito as being against the "little guy" in the face of big corporations and government. Nelson’s statements about Gorsuch process Since the Republicans currently hold 52 Senate seats, it means the GOP needs eight Democrats to schedule a final vote on Gorsuch, assuming no Republican defections. (Then the nomination itself needs only 51 votes to pass.) It will likely be difficult for Republicans to sway eight Democrats, so it’s possible that the GOP will use the "nuclear option." Related to Gorsuch’s nomination, Nelson’s spokesman Ryan Brown pointed to Nelson’s interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. (The Times is PolitiFact’s parent company.) Nelson told the Times he stands with Democrats in insisting on a 60-vote threshold. "You bet I do. The filibuster has always forced the political extremes to come of the middle to build consensus," Nelson said, adding it was a "mistake" for Reid to lower the threshold on other nominees that were stymied by Republicans. Brown told PolitiFact Florida that Nelson doesn’t support the "nuclear option," a procedural shortcut known as the "nuclear option" that would enable Senate Republicans to sidestep the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations. "In 2006, Nelson voted for cloture - that doesn’t mean he supports changing the Senate rules," Brown said. "Just because you vote for cloture, doesn’t mean you support the so-called ‘nuclear option.’ " See our explainer on the "nuclear option" We asked three political science professors to review America Rising’s argument against Nelson’s actions. All three said they saw no inconsistencies in Nelson’s actions. "There is a huge difference between voting for cloture in 2006 (utilizing a process in the existing rules) and not wanting to see the Senate change its rules in 2017," said Gregory Koger at the University of Miami. "Indeed, there is a high level of consistency between these actions: Both affirm the use of the existing cloture rule to address filibusters against Supreme Court nominations." Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political science professor, said that favoring the 60-vote threshold is not inconsistent with voting for or against cloture or the confirmation in any particular case. "In this case, a senator has a point of view about the best rules for the Senate and, under those rules, exercises his judgment in different ways on different issues," Smith said. "There is nothing inconsistent about that." In Alito’s case, Nelson wanted the Senate to vote on the nomination even though he opposed Alito, said Burdett Loomis at the University of Kansas. "Now he says he supports 60 votes (to overcome a filibuster) to bring Gorsuch’s nomination forward," Loomis said. "This is exactly what he did with Alito, even though he might well vote differently in this instance. And this has nothing to do with the nuclear option." One final point: Nelson’s stance related to the process of Gorsuch’s nomination isn’t complete. Nelson, who met with Gorsuch on March 7, has "not yet decided how he will vote on cloture or confirmation," Brown told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Nelson did not join a failed effort by some of his Democratic nominees to filibuster Alito’s nomination in 2006. He voted to end debate and then voted against Alito’s nomination. Gorsuch’s nomination hasn’t reached a vote yet, and Nelson hasn’t said how he will ultimately vote on cloture or confirmation. But he has said he stands by the 60-vote threshold. Nelson made No Flip.

pomt-03799	Says New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says "we can only have three bullets" and "the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/26/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-michael-bloomberg-says-we-can-only-/	Who makes "ridiculous" claims about guns? The other side, of course. National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre appeared on Meet the Press on March 24, 2013, after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. "It’s insane the stuff he says," LaPierre said of Bloomberg, a co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns who’s spending millions on ads in support of stricter gun controls. "We have people all over, millions of people, sending us $5, $10, $15, $20 checks saying stand up to this guy that says we can only have three bullets, which is what he said," LaPierre told host David Gregory. "Stand up to this guy who says ridiculous things like the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them." We wondered: Did Bloomberg say "we can only have three bullets" and "the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them"? ‘Three bullets’ We asked Bloomberg’s office and the NRA about LaPierre’s comments, and searched news databases and the Web. We didn’t find evidence that Bloomberg said "we can only have three bullets." He publicly endorses a ban on "military-style assault weapons" and "high-capacity ammunition magazines," such as in a Feb. 11, 2013 letter to lawmakers from Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Generally, that’s meant opposition to magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, the target of legislation making its way through Congress. Other folks in favor of stricter gun control have argued that magazines with more than three rounds ought to be banned, such as Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., in a December interview on MSNBC. Has Bloomberg? Close. But not quite. The NRA pointed us to a Nightline interview on Dec. 20, 2012, in which the mayor says if you need more than three bullets, you’re a lousy shot. Anchor Cynthia McFadden asked him about the challenge of defining an "assault weapon." "Well, if it can fire a lot of bullets very quickly, that's a good place to start, okay, and then you can argue about what a lot is," Bloomberg said. McFadden starts to interject, and the mayor continues: "Let's pick it. Let's say three. If you haven't hit the deer with three shots, you're a pretty lousy shot. The deer deserves to get away. Let's get serious here." Later, he says: "If it's 30 bullets, or 20 bullets or 10 bullets before you run out, I would suggest, God wants that deer to live." McFadden says: "But according to gun owners, what you've just described would ban most guns used by hunters today." Bloomberg: "If that's what they're using, for God sakes, why aren't they using dynamite? Just make it easier. I mean, what's the sport?" Did that interview constitute a proposal to ban more than three bullets? Not according to Bloomberg’s spokesman, John McCarthy, who shared the Bloomberg speech and letter supporting legislation to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. "Everything we have proposed has been very public. We have never proposed that," McCarthy said. "We have been very clear about what we have wanted and have seven years' worth of public advocacy, reports, press releases and more. We have never called for that, nor did he in that interview." ‘Firearms with nukes’ Did Bloomberg say "the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them"? Almost. He said the group would support the right to own them. Here’s what he told MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski on Dec. 18, 2012’s Morning Joe: "The U.S. Army has a rifle — they call it a rifle. I would call it a cannon. It’s attached to the front of a tank or a moving vehicle," Bloomberg said. "It shoots a nuclear warhead. The NRA would say, ‘Oh, that’s a gun. And people have a right to have that.’ " (We searched for a sign the NRA would indeed say such a thing. At the moment, the group pokes fun at the idea. Meanwhile, it once blessed a ban on fully automatic machine guns, much less ones with nuclear warheads. Still, soon afterward it said it supported "the right of law-abiding individuals to choose to own any firearm, including automatic firearms.") Why did Bloomberg think the NRA would support a nuclear-armed populace? "The NRA used to support background checks, and now they don't," McCarthy said. "The mayor was using a rhetorical device to point out that if you oppose every regulation, you will allow anything." Our ruling LaPierre claimed that Bloomberg has said "we can only have three bullets" and "the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them." He’s partially right. Bloomberg suggested on MSNBC that the NRA would support the right to carry a cannon firing nuclear warheads — but his point was that the organization always supports gun rights, not that it was actively promoting nuclear weapons. And while he hasn’t formally proposed a three-bullet maximum, he does support banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and has said anyone who needs more than three is "a pretty lousy shot." LaPierre hits the target, but it’s no bull’s-eye. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Wayne LaPierre	None	None	None	2013-03-26T16:13:49	2013-03-24	['Michael_Bloomberg', 'National_Rifle_Association']
pomt-12955	"Donald Trump dead from a fatal heart attack!"	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/04/thenewyorkeveningcom/news-trumps-death-fake-his-wrestlemania-appearance/	A fake news website is posting a real image of President-elect Donald Trump and using it to draw a bogus conclusion. "Donald Trump dead from a fatal heart attack!" screamed a Dec. 19, 2016, headline from a site called TheNewYorkEvening.com. The post came with a startling and real image of Trump sprawled out on the ground. The post and photo were flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant’s crackdown on fake news. Obviously Trump is not dead. Reading a newspaper, turning on a TV or radio or going anywhere else on the Internet will prove that. Bu where is that photo coming from? And is it real? It is. It comes from Trump's 2007 appearance at WrestleMania 23. Trump, who knows World Wrestling Entertainment kingpin Vince McMahon, had agreed to the Battle of the Billionaires. In that storyline, Trump and McMahon both chose a proxy wrestler to compete in the annual pay-per-view event, with the loser having his head shaved in front of the roaring crowd. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This screen grab of an image on fake news sites implied that it was taken after Donald Trump's imaginary heart attack, but it's actually Trump suffering from a Stone Cold Stunner during Wrestlemania 23. At the match, Trump clotheslined McMahon prior to Trump’s wrestler winning the match. Trump then shaved McMahon’s head in the ring. Notably absent from many online clips is what happened next: Guest referee Steve Austin delivered a Stone Cold Stunner to Trump, leaving Trump writhing on the mat. That’s the image being used in the fake news still. Trump was involved with the WWE for several years after the match. One storyline in 2009 involved Trump buying the WWE’s Raw from McMahon, then selling it back to him for twice the price. Even though the sale was fake, it still caused WWE stock to drop 7 percent at one point. Trump was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013. Three years later, the president-elect tapped McMahon’s wife Linda McMahon, who donated $6 million to a Trump super PAC, to head the Small Business Administration. TheNewYorkEvening.com seems to mix snippets of real stories, like a recent announcement that Ford Motor Company was abandonding plans to build a new plant in Mexico, with fake ones.

pomt-11234	"Thousands killed as Israel Drops Tactical Nuclear Bomb On Syria"	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/04/blog-posting/fake-news-claims-thousands-killed-nuclear-bomb-syr/	It’s not true that Israel dropped a nuclear bomb in Syria, killing thousands. A website called exclusive103.com shared that false story based on legitimate reports of strikes in Syria. "Thousands killed as Israel drops tactical nuclear bomb on Syria," said the headline of an April 30 post on exclusive103.com. The story claimed an Israeli plane "dropped the first nuclear bomb deployed in armed conflict since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, according to local reports." The post said the nuclear attack targeted an ammunitions depot in Hama, Syria, and created a 2.6-magnitude earthquake. Exclusive103.com’s About Us section says it is "your gallant news out-let that informs you all you needs to know about daily worldwide breaking news." The stories on the website are ridiculous and untrue. Facebook users flagged the April 30 post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Legitimate news outlets, including NBC News and the New York Times, on April 30 reported on missile strikes (not a nuclear bomb) in Hama with explosions powerful enough to cause a 2.6-magnitude earthquake. The strikes targeted an arms depot for ground-to-ground missiles, NBC News and other outlets reported. Media reports said that while the death toll varied, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 26 people were killed (not thousands). Israel was the presumed attacker, but there was no official confirmation from the Israeli government. "Israel’s military does not comment on individual attacks in Syria, and a spokesman declined to comment on Sunday’s attack, most likely because if Israel claimed responsibility it could put pressure on Iranian leaders to strike back," the New York Times reported.

pomt-05701	"If we keep the minimum wage at the current level, then single-parent families earning the minimum wage at a full-time job will live in poverty in New Jersey."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/09/wayne-deangelo/assemblyman-says-single-parent-earning-current-min/	As a tough economy stretches resources, a Democratic legislator said the lifeline for New Jersey families relying on a minimum wage job is thinning -- and soon it may snap. Residents struggling to find work in the recession turned to lower-paying jobs to get by, but the situation hasn’t improved, Assemblyman Wayne DeAngelo, who represents parts of Mercer and Middlesex counties, said in a letter to the editor published Feb. 27 in The Times of Trenton. "Since the economy is slow to grow, these jobs have become permanent, thereby cementing the reality that the minimum wage simply is not a sustainable salary for New Jerseyans," DeAngelo wrote. "At the current New Jersey minimum wage, a full-time employee earns only $15,080. In comparison, the federal poverty level for a two-person household is $15,130. If we keep the minimum wage at the current level, then single-parent families earning the minimum wage at a full-time job will live in poverty in New Jersey. We can’t sit idly by while parents raising their children cannot financially support themselves or pay the bare minimum of daily expenses while earning the minimum wage." Is the state’s minimum wage too little to lift a single-parent family out of poverty, as DeAngelo suggests? PolitiFact New Jersey found the assemblyman is right. A plan to raise the state’s minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $8.50 per hour, then adjust it annually based on any increase in the Consumer Price Index, is coursing its way through the state Legislature. But currently, full-time workers with minimum-wage jobs earn roughly $15,080 annually in New Jersey before taxes if they work 40 hours a week, every week of the year. The federal government releases two measures of poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau sets poverty thresholds using income before taxes, which are used primarily for statistical purposes such as estimating the number of Americans in poverty each year. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets federal poverty guidelines that are used for more administrative reasons, such as determining eligibility for assistance programs. Agencies may apply different income measures -- before taxes or after taxes -- to the guidelines. A spokesman for the Assembly Democrats said DeAngelo based his statement on the federal health department’s poverty measure. For a family of two, the measure tops off at $15,130. That’s $50 more than the gross income of an individual working full-time at a minimum wage job. For comparison, the Census Bureau’s poverty threshold is $15,504 for a two-person household with a parent and child. As the size of a household grows, the poverty measure increases. For a family of four, the federal health department’s guideline is $23,050. The Census Bureau’s threshold, which changes depending on the number of children under 18 in the household, is $22,891 for a family of four, with one parent and three children. There’s debate about the overall economic benefits of an increase in the minimum wage. We’re not wading into that argument in this Truth-O-Meter item. But in the scenario DeAngelo highlights, the annual earnings for a full-time worker would increase to $17,680 if New Jersey increased its minimum wage to $8.50 per hour. That’s $2,550 more than the health department’s poverty guideline for a family of two, but still less than the guidelines for any other size household. Our ruling The assemblyman said: "If we keep the minimum wage at the current level, then single-parent families earning the minimum wage at a full-time job will live in poverty in New Jersey. " A New Jersey resident working full-time at a job paying the state’s minimum wage of $7.25 per hour makes roughly $15,000 annually. For a family of two, the federal health department’s poverty guideline is $15,130. We rate the claim True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10180	McCain "has opposed stem cell research."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/24/barack-obama/obama-ad-distorts-mccains-stem-cell-position/	Competing radio ads from the McCain and Obama campaigns in the last week may have left voters confused about where Sen. John McCain stands on stem cell research. First, you had a McCain campaign ad highlighting McCain’s support for stem cell research. Then you had an Obama campaign ad that portrayed McCain as an opponent of stem cell research. Which one is wrong? For the most part, that dubious honor goes to the Obama ad. Here’s what the Obama ad says: "Stem cell research could unlock cures for diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s too. But John McCain has stood in the way...he’s opposed stem cell research...picked a running mate who’s against it...and he’s running on a platform even more extreme than George Bush’s on this vital research. "John McCain doesn’t understand that medical research benefiting millions shouldn’t be held hostage by the political views of a few." At one time, McCain did oppose embryonic stem cell research. In February, 2000, McCain joined 19 other senators in asking the National Institutes of Health to withdraw its new proposals to fund federal embryonic-cell research. But then McCain changed his mind. McCain explained why in an interview with Tim Russert on Meet the Press on July 15, 2001. "I’ve looked at the issue more carefully," McCain said. "I have talked with numerous scientific experts. I believe that under stringent safeguards and under the most rigorous kinds of procedures, that this can help in finding the cure for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other serious diseases. I had supported, in the past, fetal tissue research, and this is an earlier stage, as you know, of the process. So, I think it’s an issue that I was educated on." In June 2004, McCain was among 58 U.S. senators — most of them Democrats — who signed a letter urging President Bush to change his position and allow federal funding for scientific research on embryonic stem cells. McCain has backed up that position with votes in the U.S. Senate, putting him in the distinct minority among his Republican colleagues. On July 18, 2006, and again on April 11, 2007, McCain voted in favor of a bill that would allow the use of federal funds in research on embryonic stem cell lines derived from surplus embryos at in-vitro fertilization clinics. In both cases, McCain ran counter to the majority of Republicans, although both bills passed with overwhelming support from Democrats. Republican U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, who also voted for the bills, noted that it was a position unpopular in Republican circles. "The fact is John McCain has been a champion for stem cell research, which holds the promise of curing devastating diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease," Specter said in a statement released on Sept. 23, 2008. "John McCain bucked the majority of our party in standing strong with me in urging the Bush administration to lift restrictions on stem cell research, and last year voted to overturn the Bush policy." So how does the Obama campaign back up its claim that McCain has stood in the way of — and opposed — stem cell research? First, the Obama campaign accuses McCain of pandering to social conservatives at a private meeting in Ohio in June. The campaign cites a Los Angeles Times article which states that McCain "told the small assembly that he was open to learning more about their opposition to embryonic stem cell research despite his past disagreements with them on the issue." But the article also notes that "several participants said McCain did not offer any indication he would change his mind, but they said they were impressed that he appeared open to" points made by one of the country’s leading opponents of using embryonic stem cells. The Obama campaign also notes that the recently adopted GOP platform calls for "a major expansion" of adult stem cell research but also "a ban on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos for research purposes." Again, however, this is a position at odds with McCain’s. The Obama campaign also notes that McCain selected a vice presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who opposes embryonic stem cell research. That’s accurate. In a 2006 Alaska gubernatorial debate , Palin said stem cell research ran counter to her prolife position. "Stem cell research that would ultimately end in destruction of life," she said, "I couldn’t support." In an interview that aired Sept. 12, ABC’s Charles Gibson asked Palin about embryonic stem cell research, given McCain’s support. "You know, when you’re running for office, your life is an open book and you do owe it to Americans to talk about your personal opinion, which may end up being different than what the policy in an administration would be," Palin said. "My personal opinion is we should not create human life, create an embryo and then destroy it for research, if there are other options out there. And thankfully, again, not only are there other options, but we’re getting closer and closer to finding a tremendous amount more of options, like, as I mentioned, the adult stem cell research." Palin’s clear opposition to embryonic research is actually our biggest problem with McCain’s ad on stem cell research, which begins by calling McCain and Palin "the original mavericks." The ad states: "John McCain will lead his congressional allies to improve America’s health. Stem cell research to unlock the mystery of cancer, diabetes, heart disease. Stem cell research to help free families from the fear and devastation of illness. Stem cell research to help doctors repair spinal cord damage, knee injuries, serious burns. Stem cell research to help stroke victims. And, John McCain and his congressional allies will invest millions more in new NIH medical research to prevent disease. Medical breakthroughs to help you get better, faster. Change is coming. McCain-Palin and congressional allies. The leadership and experience to really change Washington and improve your health." By including Palin in the ad, it suggests she is in step with his position. And as we have noted, she is not. But it should be noted that when asked about the issue directly, Palin made clear that while her "personal opinion" would be in disagreement with a policy supporting embryonic stem cell research, she would respect a McCain-led administration's right to set such a policy. Ultimately, the McCain ad is substantially more accurate than the one from the Obama camp. We get that it may make some stem cell proponents nervous when McCain tells hard-line opponents to embryonic stem cell research that he is open to listening to their arguments; or that he chose a running mate who opposes embryonic stem cell research; or that the GOP platform calls for a ban on experimentation on human embryos for research purposes. But McCain has not backed away from his position. Asked in a Republican debate in California on May 3, 2007, what he thought about federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, McCain was unequivocal. "I believe that we need to fund this," McCain said. "This is a tough issue for those of us in the prolife community. I would remind you that these stem cells are either going to be discarded or perpetually frozen. "We need to do what we can to relieve human suffering. It’s a tough issue. I support federal funding." And McCain has backed up his words with his vote twice in recent years, even when it meant challenging President Bush and a majority of his fellow Senate Republicans. That’s not standing in the way of, or opposing, stem cell research. We rate the Obama ad False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-09-24T00:00:00	2008-09-16	['None']
pomt-03445	The state GOP ticket "says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control."	/virginia/statements/2013/jun/21/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-claims-gop-ticket-says-its-top-priority-/	Members of the Democratic state ticket gathered recently in Richmond for their first campaign rally an immediately labeled their Republican opponents as extremists. "The Tea Party ticket says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control," Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, told a crowd of about 150 at the Hippodrome Theater in Jackson Ward. The claim caught our attention. There’s no doubt that the members of the GOP slate -- gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, lieutenant governor candidate E.W. Jackson and attorney general candidate Mark Obenshain -- are strongly opposed to abortion. But have they really said their No. 1 goal is to ban abortion and some forms of contraception? We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for proof and spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to a comment Cuccinelli made at a February 2012 rally to support personhood legislation. The bill, which defined life as beginning at conception, had passed the House when Cuccinelli spoke but would subsequently die in the Senate. "It’s hard to believe we actually have to come and advocate for something as basic as life, but we’ve had to do it for decades and we’re going to have to do it for the rest of our lives," The Washington Times quoted Cuccinelli as saying. "The fight for life is going to last for all of our lives." Schwerin cited various press reports and other materials saying the personhood measure would lead to a ban on all abortions and forms of birth control that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. But this Truth-O-Meter is not about the consequences of personhood legislation. We are examining whether the GOP ticket has proclaimed that ending abortion and certain types of contraception is its top priority. So Cuccinelli’s comments at the rally are immaterial. There are plenty of instances when members of the GOP ticket opposed abortion. Cuccinelli helped muscle through controversial new regulations that require clinics performing abortions to comply with building code standards for hospitals -- an action that was criticized as a ruse to force clinics to close. In a May 18 speech at the Republican state convention accepting the gubernatorial nomination, Cuccinelli called for "defending those at both ends of life -- protecting the elderly from abuse as well as the unborn." Jackson, the lieutenant governor nominee, has called abortion "genocide." And Obenshain, running for attorney general, has consistently voted to restrict abortion rights during his nine years in the state Senate. But when it comes to identifying the most important issue facing voters this fall, Cuccinelli has said it’s the economy. He was asked in a Jan. 3 radio interview on The John Fredericks Show how a Cuccinelli administration would differ from current GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell. "In some ways it would be very similar," Cuccinelli replied. "Certainly the same top priority of focusing on economic opportunity would be the same in a Cuccinelli administration." And in a May 7 news conference announcing his tax plan, Cuccinelli said "as governor, job creation will be my top priority." We asked McAuliffe’s spokesman if he had any other evidence that Cuccinelli and his running mates have stated that ending abortions and restricting birth control are their main reasons for running this year. Schwerin pointed to comments Cuccinelli made last September during a visit to Prison Fellowship, a Lansdowne-based ministry. "Start with the priorities. Work your way down: life, family, community, world -- a lot of ways to affect the ones at the bottom," Cuccinelli said. "It gets narrower and narrower as you get to the top. None of those other rights matter a whole lot if you don’t get born." Schwerin provided another snippet of a clip, this one from Cuccinelli’s appearance at a June 2011 conference of homeschoolers in Herndon. "And that’s where the candidate’s responsibility arises. You give a campaign purpose. My purpose was to fight abortion, to shrink government, to protect life and families," Cuccinelli said. That establishes once again that one of Cuccinelli’s key reasons for entering politics is to oppose abortion. But it falls short of a declaration by the GOP ticket of its No. 1 goal. Our ruling McAuliffe claimed the GOP ticket "says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control." A compelling argument can be made that members of the GOP ticket will do everything possible to restrict abortions and those actions could ban certain types of birth control. But McAuliffe went an extra step and put words in the mouths of his opponents. We rate McAuliffe’s statement False.

pomt-11204	Says Joe Manchin displayed an "unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/15/patrick-morrisey/patrick-morrisey-says-joe-manchin-wont-budge-obama/	As the general election for the seat held by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., heated up, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey took a shot in a radio interview with Breitbart, saying Manchin too often stands against President Donald Trump, who remains popular in the state. Referring to Trump’s appointee to the Supreme Court, Morrisey said, "If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge (Neil) Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote" in the Senate. Morrisey went on to say, "Whether we're talking judicial picks, whether we're talking Trump tax cuts, whether we're talking unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare ... Joe Manchin has not stood with President Trump." Morrisey is right that Manchin voted against the tax bill supported by Trump and most Republicans. But he isn’t really right about Manchin’s positions on Gorsuch and modifying Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. We’ll look at the Obamacare assertion here; we separately fact-checked the part about Gorsuch in another item. Bottom line: Despite voting against the major Obamacare overhaul that most Republicans supported, Manchin has been open to making incremental changes to the law. Changing Obamacare Manchin voted against the major Obamacare overhauls that most Republicans supported in 2017. When the Senate took up three varieties of bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Manchin voted against all three bills, siding with all other Democrats. All three failed, due to Republican defections. However, it is wrong to say that Manchin was unwilling to "change" the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, Manchin told West Virginia’s MetroNews radio that he had told Republican leaders that he's "happy to sit down with you to see if we can find a pathway forward" on Obamacare, Politico reported. Six months later, Manchin repeated that sentiment, telling MetroNews’ Talkline that he was still willing to work toward fixes for Obamacare, even as he objected to the Republican plan for a thorough overhaul. "If they want to say, ‘Okay, Joe, we can’t pass this thing. Will you sit down and work with us?’ I’m there tonight with them and I’ll get six or seven or eight other very like-minded Democrats," Manchin said. Manchin then organized a bipartisan health care policy meeting. Perhaps most important, Manchin was one of 24 original supporters — 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans — of a bill written by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., that was touted as a way to fix rather than scuttle Obamacare. The measure would have granted flexibility for states to allow a wider variety of insurance policies while temporarily continuing certain Obamacare payments that were at risk under a repeal. (It remains pending.) Manchin also expressed public support for efforts by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., to modify Obamacare short of repeal, which crystallized as S. 1835, which would allow states to apply for funding for a reinsurance program or high-risk pool program. The Morrisey camp pointed to several votes, including a number of Republican attempts to either repeal Obamacare entirely or make sweeping changes to it. But Morrisey’s use of the word "change" suggests something more measured than those bills offered, so we won’t consider them as evidence of Morrisey’s claim. Of the other votes Morrisey’s campaign cited, three concerned one narrow provision of the law: the "Cadillac" tax on high-cost health care plans. This provision has been controversial ever since the passage of the law, and the effective date has regularly been pushed back by Congress. Manchin declined to push back the effective date on at least three occasions, sometimes alongside Republicans. On one such vote in December 2015, Manchin was joined by six other Democrats and three Republicans. On another vote that same month, Manchin was joined by 26 Republicans and six other Democrats or Democratic-aligned Independents. The third vote, in July 2017, was largely along party lines. Morrisey’s campaign mentioned other Obamacare-related votes on taxes, including a 2013 amendment to repeal Obamacare tax increases that hit "middle-income Americans." These included the tax penalty for not purchasing health insurance, the "Cadillac" tax, expense deductions and penalties for withdrawing funds from health savings accounts. This amendment failed on a party-line vote. These comprise the strongest piece of evidence for Morrisey’s position, but they mostly involve relatively narrow tax provisions affecting how the law is funded. It’s worth noting that Manchin has also pursued his own efforts to tweak the bill narrowly, such as exempting volunteer first responders from the tax for not having health insurance; to delay the individual mandate penalty; and to redefine who counts as a full-time employee under the law. Our ruling Morrisey said Manchin displayed an "unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare." Manchin did oppose the various Republican-led repeal efforts, but he has worked actively to promote incremental changes to Obamacare — not only rhetorically but also by backing bipartisan bills intended as efforts to modify Obamacare without scuttling it.

pomt-06653	"We know that President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/12/michele-bachmann/did-president-obama-steal-500-billion-medicare/	At a debate in Tampa, the Republican presidential candidates were asked this stumper by a Florida tea party supporter: How do you convince senior citizens that Social Security and Medicare need to be changed and still get their vote? Bachmann said she had both the government experience and the private-sector experience to understand how the programs should be changed, but she offered few specifics. She also took the opportunity to criticize the new health care law championed by President Barack Obama, saying, "We know that President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare." We've looked into this topic previously, though we haven't heard the specific allegation that the money was "stolen." We'll begin with a review of how the new health care law handles funding for Medicare and for the new parts of the law. To begin with, the health care law leaves in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. It attempts to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid for the very poor and by offering tax breaks to help people with modest incomes buy insurance. Individuals are required to have insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." And companies that don't offer insurance to employees have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. The national health care reform law also made several changes to Medicare, which makes up roughly 12 percent of the federal budget. In a few cases, the law actually increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source that analyzes the health care system. For instance, the health care law added money to cover prevention services and to fill a gap for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. (That coverage gap is often referred to as the doughnut hole.) Other parts of the law are intended to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage more efficiency and to improve the delivery and quality of care. (An example is paying hospitals less when patients are quickly re-admitted to hospitals after being discharged, to prevent people from being discharged too soon.) The bill doesn't take money out of the current Medicare budget but, rather, it attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in anticipated spending increases over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of future spending growth in Medicare, the law doesn't cut current funding for Medicare. Still, where does the $500 billion in future savings come from? Nearly $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in payments that health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. A new national board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. Then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program, an alternative to traditional Medicare that has turned out to be much more costly than expected. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. If you disregard the incendiary word "stole," it is true that savings from Medicare help pay for other parts of the health care law. That's because Democrats wanted to make sure they did not increase the federal deficit with the new health law. The savings from Medicare offset new spending resulting from the health care bill. Mostly, the new spending in the health care law comes from tax credits to help people of modest incomes buy health insurance and from expanding Medicaid to offer coverage to the poor. The tax credits and other cost-sharing subsidies are estimated to cost $350 billion over 10 years, while the Medicaid expansion costs $434 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Those two initiatives add up to more than $500 billion. So in addition to reducing future Medicare spending, the law also increases Medicare taxes on the wealthy and creates new fees for the health care industry, as well as a few other things, to come up with the needed sums. Now, to address the word "stole." The money was not stolen in any literal sense of the word. Congress passed the law through its normal process, and the cost reductions for Medicare were out in the open during the many weeks that the final law was being negotiated. Bachmann said that, "We know that President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare." There is a small amount of truth in her statement in that future savings from Medicare are planned to offset new costs created by the law. But the law attempts to curtail the rapid growth of future Medicare spending, not cut current funding. Additionally, the money was not "stolen." Congress reduced spending on a program through its normal legislative process. That kind of rhetoric is deceptive, and it undermines Bachmann's basic point. We rate her statement Mostly False.

pomt-03232	Under Obamacare, members of Congress are required to purchase their health insurance from the new exchanges.	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/18/james-langevin/us-rep-james-langevin-says-he-will-be-required-pur/	One complaint about Congress is that its members make rules that apply to everyone but themselves. That complaint, mostly untrue, is being used again in the campaign against Obamacare. For example, Fox News anchorman Bill Hemmer announced on Aug. 8 that President Obama "personally intervened to make sure that members of Congress and their staffers will not have to live with Obamacare." The Wall Street Journal opined on Aug. 5 that the politicians had moved "to create a special exemption for themselves from the Obamacare health coverage that everybody else is mandated to buy." Yet when U.S. Rep. James Langevin, a Democrat representing Rhode Island’s Second Congressional District, was interviewed Aug. 12, 2013, by WPRO's Gene Valicenti, Langevin said flatly that he's now going to have to buy his health insurance from the "exchanges" that serve as online marketplaces for health care policies. "Obamacare, as you mentioned, is going to be in effect very soon. We've seen some very positive effects," he said, citing the elimination of lifetime caps and the ban on insurance companies denying coverage because of a preexisting condition. "And people will very soon be choosing their health care through the health insurance exchanges, including members of Congress." "I’ll be choosing my health care plan from the new exchange that Rhode Island is setting up," Langevin said. (Rhode Island’s exchange, HealthSource RI, starts enrollment Oct. 1 for plans that take effect in 2014.) So who is correct here? We decided to check Langevin's statement that members of Congress will have to buy from an exchange, sometimes referred to as a health insurance marketplace. Here's the short answer: members of Congress are treated differently under the law, but not in the way critics of Obamacare say. Here’s why. Under Obamacare, people must either get health insurance coverage or pay a fine, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. Generally, workers and their dependents who are covered by an employer's health insurance are all set. More than half the population is already covered that way. (Beginning in 2015, companies employing 50 or more must offer coverage or pay a penalty.) The exchanges -- set up by individual states or the federal government (if a state doesn't want to operate one) -- are designed to offer one-stop shopping for small businesses seeking affordable plans for their workers and for people without insurance looking to buy a policy. Because members of Congress and their staffs are already covered by the same health insurance plans that cover other federal employees, they wouldn’t have needed to buy their insurance through an exchange. But when Obamacare was being debated, some argued that Congress and congressional staff members should be required to buy their insurance through an exchange system, saying that would ensure that the system would work properly. If ordinary citizens would have to use the exchange, the argument went, so should Congress. That provision ultimately became part of Obamacare, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In passing it, members of Congress made themselves and their staffers exempt from the provision of the law that would have let them stay with their existing health plan, like everyone else already covered by an employer's health insurance plan. But that opened up a different issue, and it revolves around paying for their insurance. Most individuals who buy their coverage on the exchange will have to pay for it out of their own pocket. Many will get help from a federal subsidy in the form of a tax credit that varies based on family size and income. Yet members of Congress, and some of their staff, make too much money to quality for any subsidy. So they would have to pay twice. Not only would they lose their company-subsidized insurance (in this case, the "company" is the federal government), they would have to pay for their new insurance plan entirely out of their own pocket. To resolve the issue, the Obama administration announced Aug. 7, 2013, that the money already being spent to pay for Congress’ current health insurance plan would be applied to any policy purchased from an exchange. (The government currently covers up to 75 percent of the premiums of the federal plan, with enrollees paying the rest. Members of Congress and their staffs would still have to pay their share of the bill.) It was this proposed rule that prompted critics over the past few weeks to allege that the Obama administration was creating another exemption for Congress members and their staffs. But Congress had already agreed to live by the system it created. What the new rule actually does is continue the federal government’s contribution toward its employees’ insurance coverage. So when U.S. Rep. James Langevin said he would be required to buy his health insurance through one of the Obamacare exchanges, his statement was True.

pomt-08950	"The War in Afghanistan is officially the longest war Americans have ever been asked to endure."	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/23/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-calls-end-americas-longest-war/	Rep. Dennis Kucinich wants the United States out of Afghanistan. In a statement on his website he decries the costs, both monetary and human, in a war that has passed too many milestones. "The War in Afghanistan is officially the longest war Americans have ever been asked to endure." he says in the statement. The greatests casualties, he says, are children of the world "for whom war becomes as ordinary as the sunrise." They pay for the war in hunger, poor health, poor housing, and a lack of education as resources are spent on the war. We thought we'd look at the congressman's statement and see how the War in Afghanistan compares with America's other wars. In terms of casualties, there's no comparison. The death toll in Afghanistan reached 1,000 at the end of May with the death of Cpl. Jacob C. Leicht, a Texas Marine serving his second overseas tour. The war in Iraq has seen more than four times as many deaths. The Civil War remains America's deadliest, with more than 600,000 deaths. More than 400,000 died in World War II. Answering which war is longest is more art then science. James Bradford, a Texas A&M historian, told us previously that the American Revolution may have begun with the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) -- or earlier, with the breakout of hostilities at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Meanwhile, the end of the war could have been the the British surrender at Yorktown (Oct. 17, 1781), the signing of the Treaty of Paris (September 1783), the ratification of the treaty by the Continental Congress (Jan. 14, 1784), the ratification by King George III of England (April 9, 1784) or the exchange of the ratification documents (May 12, 1784). Richard H. Kohn, a historian at the University of North Carolina, told us that how one conceptualizes a war further complicates the answer. "Afghanistan could be considered simply a campaign of the 'war on terror' if one accepts that as a war, just as Korea and Vietnam could be considered campaigns of the Cold War rather than separate wars." We decided not to count the 46-year-long Cold War on the grounds that it belongs in a separate category. We also did not count situations in which U.S. military forces have remained in a long-term role long after the shooting has stopped, such as the U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea for the last 55 years. Finally, we ignored battles that are popularly called "wars" but are usually not fought on military terms, such as the "war on drugs." So, in terms of duration, the Vietnam War was tops -- until now. American involvement in Vietnam spans decades. The Eisenhower administration backed creation of South Vietnam in the 1950s and provided the country with military aid and advisors. President John F. Kennedy expanded that presence. But the formal beginning of U.S. involvement often is dated from Congress' passage of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution on Aug. 7, 1964. It gave President Lyndon Johnson authority to send troops into battle. The last ground combat troops left Vietnam in March 1973, 8 years and 8 months later. More than 3 million Americans served in the war. The casualty lists includes almost 58,000 dead, more than 1,000 missing in action and some 150,000 Americans seriously wounded. President George W. Bush ordered troops be sent to Afghanistan after terror attacks Sept. 11, 2001. Fighting began less than one month later on Oct. 7. Last month, on June 7, the war completed 8 years and 9 months. There's no fighting the numbers. We find this statement True. Comment on this item.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2010-07-23T10:00:00	2010-06-10	['Afghanistan', 'United_States']
pomt-03893	Two-thirds of Wisconsinites receiving unemployment checks "are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/04/scott-walker/two-thirds-collecting-unemployment-dont-have-look-/	When Gov. Scott Walker preached about the need to reform government assistance programs on Feb. 13, 2013, his congregation was a "business day" gathering in Madison. But one could imagine the minister's son giving the same speech at a town hall gathering in Iowa, stumping for the 2016 presidential nomination -- a possibility raised a number of times since the 2012 presidential election. In his 37-minute "dependence to independence"presentation, which was accompanied by a slide show, Walker rejected a federal proposal to expand Medicaid and called for requiring able-bodied, childless adults who receive food stamps to get job training. Then the Republican governor turned to unemployment benefits. People receiving unemployment checks should be required to look for a job four times a week instead of two, Walker said, adding "we want to make sure you’re out hustling each and every week as much as reasonably as possible to go out and find that job. We’re going to give you the skills and the backing and the opportunity to do that, but you’ve got to work to make that happen as well. I don’t think that’s an unrealistic expectation." Although Walker didn’t state it in his speech, he claimed in one of his slides that two-thirds of unemployment insurance recipients in Wisconsin "are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions." That seems like a big number. Is he right? Is there more to the story? Unemployment picture Employment has been a contentious issue since Walker took office in January 2011. As our Walk-O-Meter shows, the governor is far off the pace for meeting his signature campaign promise of creating 250,000 private-sector jobs during his four-year term. At the same time, he emphasizes that the state's unemployment rate has been lower than the national rate and has generally declined during his tenure. In January 2013, Walker proposed tightening the standards for receiving jobless benefits, a move that would have to be approved by the Legislature. Wisconsinites seeking unemployment benefits must file a claim each week they are out of work. Depending on what their previous wages were, their unemployment benefits are between $54 and $363 per week. When filing the weekly claims, the recipients are asked a number of questions, including: Were you able to work full-time and available for full-time work? and Did you contact at least two employers during the week to try to find work? Recipients could lose their benefits if they don’t contact at least two employers "who hire people with your skills or might have other work you can do." However, state regulations waive the work search requirement under a number of circumstances. According to Walker’s Department of Workforce Development: "You may be told that you do not have to look for work if you are definitely returning to full-time work for a recent employer or if you are a member (in good standing) of a trade union that operates a hiring hall or referral system and has signed an agreement with the department. In some cases, you will not have to look for work if you are working part-time." Walker’s evidence John Dipko, a spokesman for the Department of Workforce Development, told us that Walker’s claim is based on calculations by the department. The department estimated that 60,167 people filed an initial claim for unemployment benefits in January 2013 and were paid benefits. In other words, they were filing for the first time since becoming unemployed; that’s when the determination is made on whether they must look for work. Two-thirds of those people -- 40,119 -- were not required to look for work, the department determined. We asked for figures covering a longer period of time and were given statistics indicating that in 2012, an even larger proportion of unemployment compensation recipients -- 68 percent -- were not required to work. We ran the numbers by Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, which says it promotes "help unemployed workers regain their economic footing through improved benefits and services." He didn’t quarrel with the accuracy of the claim that two-thirds of the recipients don’t have to look for work. But Emsellem said it would be counterproductive, both for employers and employees, to require laid-off employees to look for new jobs if they are likely to soon return to their old job, or similar work. Those people are not likely to find better jobs -- or temporary ones -- simply by making "cold calls" to other employers, he said. Getting back to the most recent figures that Walker relied on, for January 2013, here’s a breakdown from the Department of Workforce Development of the 40,119 people who filed new claims for unemployment insurance who were not required to look for work: Laid off, expected to return to job within 12 weeks 29,636 Now working part-time for same employer 5,940 Laid off, but routinely obtains work through union hiring hall 3,837 Enrolled in job training program 442 Expected to start job with new employer within four weeks 258 Other 6 Total 40,119 So, it’s not as though the people exempted from work search are being allowed to idly collect handouts. The vast majority who aren’t required to look for jobs expect to be working again in the relatively near future, either at their same job or for a new employer. Our rating Walker said two-thirds of Wisconsinites receiving unemployment checks "are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions." The statement is accurate, but needs additional information -- namely that the vast majority of unemployment insurance recipients who aren’t required to look for work are expected to be working again relatively soon, many at the same jobs they were laid off from. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-03-04T09:00:00	2013-02-13	['None']
pomt-04430	On Iran sanctions	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/14/tammy-baldwin/after-votes-against-major-Iran-sanction-bills/	Campaigning for U.S. Senate, Republican Tommy Thompson points to Democrat Tammy Baldwin’s votes opposing economic sanctions on Iran as evidence of what he calls his rival’s "record of radical policy." So when Baldwin said in the first debate that she had voted for "tough and biting sanctions against Iran," Thompson pounced. "My opponent just, I think, misstated," Thompson said during the Sept. 28, 2012 debate. "She voted against the sanctions in 2006, 2009 and 2010, then in August (2012) she voted for them because she was running for the United States Senate. Complete change of heart." Cue the Flip-O-Meter. That’s what we use to determine if a candidate has changed position on an issue. An important note: We’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch. We’re looking at whether the candidate has been consistent. So, did Baldwin get tough on Iran as the election neared and -- if so -- was it a change in her longstanding view? While Thompson went back to 2006, we studied dozens of Baldwin’s votes dating to 1999, her first year in Congress. Based on that review and consultations with foreign-policy analysts, we focused on the major sanctions votes -- five before Baldwin’s Senate candidacy, and two after she started running. Here’s a chronology of key actions: July 26, 2001: Baldwin joined a 409-6 House majority in approving a five-year extension of the Clinton-era Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. That law, passed unanimously, had sought to discourage foreign energy firms from investing in those nations. The George W. Bush administration had sought a shorter extension, trying to aid diplomatic efforts. April 26, 2006: With the sanctions due to expire and concerns about Iran’s nuclear program rising, Baldwin voted against extending and toughening sanctions. The vote on the Iran Freedom Support Act was 397-21. Baldwin initially joined 359 others in co-sponsoring the bill, but said the final version was too heavy handed in targeting the oil and gas industries in Iran. Baldwin, a critic of the Bush administration’s Iraq war, said the law would "give cover for a military attack by this administration." December 15, 2009: In President Barack Obama’s first year, Baldwin joined a very small minority of lawmakers in voting against what was introduced as the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act of 2009. It passed the House 412-12. Baldwin said it went too far and would punish ordinary, pro-democracy Iranians by imposing sanctions against companies that supply Iran with gasoline. June 24, 2010: Baldwin voted against a beefed-up version of the 2009 bill, relabeled as the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. The vote to approve was 408-8. A key supporter, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, called it the "strongest Iran sanctions legislation ever passed by the Congress" and necessary because "in the last year, Iran has concealed major nuclear facilities...and openly threatened to, as the Iranian president said, ‘wipe Israel off the face of the map.’'' May 26, 2011: Baldwin joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers opposing a defense funding bill that contained a major new sanctions tactic. Baldwin’s campaign says she voted against it because of her very public opposition to continued funding for the war in Afghanistan. The bill, approved 322-96, contained a provision that sought to disrupt the Iranian financial system by dissuading foreign banks from dealing with the Iranian central bank. The particulars of that move -- which the Wall Street Journal said marked "the sharpest economic confrontation between Washington and Tehran yet" -- had drawn some opposition from the Obama administration. December 14, 2011: Three months after entering the U.S. Senate race, Baldwin supported a major bill that sought to expand sanctions. The legislation, which passed as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, sought a far-reaching expansion of the 1996 sanctions act. A New York Times account said the bill’s measures "target Iran’s oil and petrochemical sectors as well as its shipping trade, (and) intensify existing sanctions intended to choke off the revenue that Iran reaps from its two largest export industries." Baldwin was in the majority on the 410-11 vote. Among those in opposition: U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the Ohio Democrat whom Baldwin had joined in opposing previous sanction expansions. "Proponents of the Iran Threat Reduction Act claim that it's a last-ditch effort to prevent military confrontation with Iran," The Hill quoted Kucinich as saying. "Yet, this bill takes away the most effective tool to prevent war, diplomacy." August 2012: On final passage of the Threat Reduction Act, Baldwin again voted yes on a 421-6 vote. This is the vote Thompson cited. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) blasted the bill as "just one more step to another war that we don't need." We could find no public comments by Baldwin as to her reasoning on the 2012 vote. Her campaign declined to comment on it. Additional factors In our research, though, we found that Baldwin’s congressional webpage struck a tougher tone on Iran in 2012 when compared to before her entry into the Senate race. A month before she entered the race, her page said Iran was subject to sanctions in part due to its "purported support" for terror activities. It now says: "No country poses a greater threat to Middle East peace and stability than Iran. Iran is a major state sponsor of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, which exercises significant control over the government of Lebanon, and Hamas, which operates in the Gaza strip." We consulted four officials about the legislative history: Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a sanctions expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics; Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the pro-sanctions Foundation for Defense of Democracies; Jamal Abdi, policy director at the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group that opposes broad sanctions that hurt ordinary Iranians; and Matthew Irvine, a defense researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a non-profit think tank. All four said the bills from 2001 through 2012 built on the original 1996 sanctions and raised similar issues for supporters and opponents. "I don’t see the ‘pivot point’ for objecting to earlier sanctions and endorsing the Threat Reduction Act (in 2012), nor do I see grounds for supporting the 2001 Act and then opposing the 2006 Act," Hufbauer wrote in an email. Dubowitz agreed, saying: "There’s no way to reconcile 2006, 2010 and 2012 votes from a policy perspective." Elected officials who are concerned about the humanitarian impact of sanctions might have been expected to stand against the 2012 measure, Dubowitz said. Abdi noted, though, that the dynamic was somewhat different in 2012. As the temperature rose over possible Israeli military action against Iran, tougher sanctions became a more attractive alternative for some. Irvine agreed, saying the security environment had worsened. He added that the Democratic caucus aggressively "whipped" the 2012 bill, trying to get everyone on board for the election-year vote. As for the 2001 bill Baldwin voted for, Dubowitz said it would have been surprising if she had opposed it given that it extended the 1996 act approved under a Democrat, President Bill Clinton. We found only other House member who voted as she did on the 2001, 2006, 2009-10 and 2012 votes: Arizona Republican Jeff Flake. Flake, like Baldwin, is seeking a U.S. Senate seat in November 2012. He’s been ripped as a flip-flopper over his sanction votes. John Kraus, Baldwin’s campaign spokesperson, took issue with Thompson’s claim of a "change of heart" by Baldwin. He said Baldwin has a lengthy record of supporting sanctions and has taken a tough stance against Iran. He sent a list of votes showing Baldwin has voted for numerous bills expressing condemnation of Iranian human rights abuses and deception regarding its nuclear programs, or expressing concern over Iran’s potential nuclear capabilities. But the question at hand is Baldwin’s position on sanctions. Kraus also pointed to several votes, long before she got into the Senate race, in which Baldwin supported sanctions, including measures that died in the Senate in 2007 and 2009. We confirmed those votes. The most significant bill she backed was the 2009 Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, which sought to pressure local pension funds to divest from companies invested in Iran’s energy sector. Hufbauer called the Enabling Act "largely symbolic," while Abdi and Dubowitz said it was a significant bill though not on the level of the 2006 and 2010 actions. Whatever the merits, that divestment bill was rolled into the tougher and broader 2010 sanctions bill -- and Baldwin, as we noted, opposed that 2010 legislation. Our rating Overall, Baldwin can point to support of a framework of sanctions and of some specific upgrades, but on the major bills, she consistently stood against expansion. From 2006 to 2011, she voted against the four biggest moves to toughen sanctions against Iran. After she entered the race, and in one case just three months from the November 2012 election, Baldwin was confronted with another major sanctions vote, on the Threat Reduction Act. All of our experts, whose views on sanctions vary, agreed that it was inconsistent to vote in favor of tougher sanctions in 2012, and was not a logical policy evolution based on the specifics of the bill. Was it based on the changing political landscape, the heightening of tensions, the electoral calculus of the Senate race? All of the above? Something else? Whatever the reasons, this amounted to a major reversal of position. That’s a Full Flop on our meter.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2012-10-14T09:00:00	2012-09-28	['Iran']
pomt-11791	"Civil war erupts in Sweden as irate Swedes burn nine Muslim refugee centers to the ground"	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/21/pipo-news/fake-news-civil-war-erupts-sweden/	The Swedes are fed up with the "Muslim invasion" in their country and have fought back with fire, according to a news account on Facebook. "Civil war erupts in Sweden as irate Swedes burn nine Muslim refugee centers to the ground," states the headline in Pipo News, which linked to a similar 2015 article in JewsNews, a fake news website. We found no contact information on the Pipo News website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story and the photo are misleading. However, Muslim refugees have been the targets of suspected arson attacks in Sweden in recent years. Pipo News states that the multiple arsons have been at facilities that house or are slated to house immigrants. But the photo is actually a of a fire of a recycling station in Malmo Sweden in 2013, our fact-checking friends at Snopes noted in 2015. Pipo News cites arson incidents at a children’s summer camp in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna that planned to host asylum seekers and in a refugee center in the town of Munkedal. Fires did occur in those two towns, according to credible news articles. On Christmas Day in 2014, five people were injured in a fire in a mosque in Eskilstuna, near Stockholm, which the authorities also suspect may have been arson, the New York Times reported. (Nothing in the New York Times stated that the site was a children’s camp.) Reuters reported in November 2015 that in the town of Munkedal, a center housing 14 asylum seekers went up in flames. "The Munkedal blaze was just one of more than a dozen at centers across Sweden in the past month -- some confirmed as arson attacks and others suspected as such -- that the police are struggling to solve as the country expects to take in up to a record 190,000 asylum seekers this year," Reuters reported. The fires occurred while a far-right anti-immigrant party, the Sweden Democrats, was gaining more traction, the New York Times wrote in 2015. Sweden had previously been known as a welcoming country for refugees, but that philosophy was tested as an influx of refugees strained government services. Omar Mustafa, president of the Islamic Association of Sweden, told the New York Times in January 2015 that the fires at mosques followed a year of rising anti-Islamic attacks which included vandalism of mosques. ''It is a scary development in Swedish society,'' Mustafa said. ''It is a big movement that is moving from the Internet to the real world.'' Suspected arson incidents have continued in 2017 at Sweden's largest Shiite Muslim mosque and a mosque near Stockholm. While the Pipo News article gives the impression that Muslim immigration has led to civil war, Reuters reported in 2015 that opinion polls showed most Swedes supported welcoming refugees. Pew Research Center surveyed European views of refugees in 2016 and found that in Sweden 57 percent were concerned that refugees would increase terrorism in their country, slightly above the median among the 10 countries surveyed. But of the 10 countries, Sweden had the lowest percentage that viewed refugees from Syria and Iraq as a major threat. Our ruling Pipo News’ headline states "civil war erupts in Sweden as irate Swedes burn nine Muslim refugee centers to the ground." The story uses a misleading photo of an unrelated fire and portrays the situation in Sweden as a war, which is a gross exaggeration. There have been multiple fires at Muslim sites, but there is no evidence that a civil war has erupted as nine Muslim refugee centers burned to the ground. We rate this headline as False.

pomt-14877	Says that Starbucks took "Christmas off of their brand new cups."	/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/11/joshua-feuerstein/evangelical-activist-focuses-lack-christmas-new-st/	Joshua Feuerstein bills himself as an American evangelist and social media personality who connects with the Millennial generation. Feuerstein made a strong connection recently: A video he posted mocking the new Christmas cup from Starbucks was shared over 500,000 times, and got Feuerstein on CNN. In the video, Feuerstein bemoaned the absence of the word "Christmas" on the cups. "Do you realize Starbucks wanted to take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups?" he said. "That’s why they’re just plain red. In fact, do you realize that Starbucks isn’t allowed to say Merry Christmas to customers?" Feuerstein boasted that when he ordered his specialty coffee drink and the server asked his name, he said it was Merry Christmas, so the barista would be required to write Merry Christmas on the cup. "So guess what Starbucks," Feuerstein said. "I tricked you into putting Merry Christmas on your cup." We decided to investigate whether Starbucks took Christ and Christmas off its holiday cups. We asked Feuerstein and Starbucks for comment but did not hear back. If a picture as as good as a thousand words, we thought we’d let the pictures tell the story. We searched year by year, mainly on the photo sharing site Flickr, and were unable to find any previous cups that said Christ or Christmas. Here is what we found: 2013 cup 2012 cup 2011 cup 2010 cup Then we skipped a few years. 2006 cup 2005 cup (the reusable version, we think) 2004 cup We found no evidence that Starbucks ever put the word Christmas on its holiday cups. All the images we found included generic winter and holiday themes. Furthemore, the word Christmas is hardly banned at Starbucks. The caffeine purveyor’s 2015 annual blend drives home that point. An investigative field trip to a Starbucks on L Street in Washington revealed that the coffee company also sells gift cards that say "Merry Christmas" (second row from top, right hand side). Our ruling Feuerstein said Starbucks took "Christ and Christmas" off their cups. Feuerstein’s prank suggested he meant the word Christmas literally. Going back over 10 years, we could find no proof that the words Christ or Christmas have ever appeared on a Starbucks cup. If they weren’t there in the first place, you can’t say the company removed them. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Joshua Feuerstein	None	None	None	2015-11-11T15:29:26	2015-11-05	['None']

pomt-01535	Since I took office, "Wisconsin ranks 11th in the nation in total business establishment growth compared to 47th in the years Mary Burke was Commerce secretary."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/17/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-11th-business-establis/	Following the searing recall elections and years of bare-knuckle brawling in Madison, it wouldn’t have surprised anyone to see Wisconsin’s 2014 campaign season start nasty and get nastier in the closing months. Instead, we have numerical warfare -- an arms race of rankings and comparisons on the economy before and after Scott Walker. Yeah. Here at PolitiFact, that’s just the way we like it. The Republican governor’s new "Wisconsin’s Comeback" plan -- a platform for his 2014 re-election bid -- includes a raft of rankings and statistics in its 62 pages (and 208 footnotes). Many of those rankings compare Walker’s time in state government with that of his Democratic challenger, Mary Burke. She was state Commerce Department secretary under Gov. Jim Doyle from early 2005 to late 2007. Among the comparisons: "Since Governor Walker took office, Wisconsin ranks 11th in the nation in total business establishment growth compared to 47th in the years Mary Burke was Commerce secretary." Walker has argued tax cuts and other moves have helped spur small business growth. But is he right on the rankings? Before the Great Recession hit, was Wisconsin a bottom feeder for business establishment growth, compared to a near Top-10 showing now? Defining terms First things first: Let’s define "business establishment growth." It’s not a reference to job growth, or even new business creation, so it doesn’t carry the weight those figures carry. The phrase is a bit of jargon courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that releases state-by-state data every quarter on employment-related measures. Contrary to what the phrase may suggest, it’s not about how many businesses have incorporated or otherwise formed, compared with how many have folded or otherwise died. Instead, "business establishments" means a business location, such as a new store or factory or farm. A single "company" can have multiple "establishments," and new "establishments" can be opened by existing or new firms. The data comes from a very broad census of employers and economists use it as one indicator of net business activity. Walker cites the data as backup for the claim, and we agree it’s the right data to look at for his very specifically worded statement. Checking the rankings We started with Burke’s time at Commerce. Her tenure as the economic development chief coincides pretty well with the quarterly data collection, though it’s not perfectly aligned. She started in February 2005 and left in November 2007. We used the fourth quarter of 2004 as our starting point and the same quarter in 2007 as the end point. And we looked only at private-sector figures because both Walker and Burke have focused on economic growth in that sector. The numbers showed a ranking of 47, just as Walker claimed. (It was one lower if you use the first quarter of 2005 as the baseline as a nod to the fact that Burke arrived mid-quarter). The number of new establishments grew 1.3 percent in the three-year period from 2005 to 2007, ahead of only Michigan, Massachusetts and Maine. At the top of the heap were Arizona, Nevada and Florida, all with more than 14 percent growth. Illinois had the highest rank in the Midwest (11th). Walker compared Burke’s time at commerce to what happened since he took office. There is no data source we found that brings us to the present -- or even close. That’s because there is a long lag in reporting the quarterly data. (Information for the first quarter of 2014 is scheduled to be released Sept. 18, 2014.) We looked at the most recent data, which covers 2011 through 2013, Walker’s first three years in office. In this period, Wisconsin’s growth rate (5.5 percent) was 11th highest, just behind Iowa (10th) and Illinois (9th). So Walker’s claim is on solid ground. To be sure, the "establishment" rankings don’t necessarily match up with separate ranking of net job gains in the state. During Walker’s first three years, for example, Wisconsin was 35th for private-sector job growth, but 11th in establishment growth. There’s a much stronger correlation during the Burke era -- the state ranked 42nd in private job gains from 2005-’07, and 47th in pace of new business "establishments." So what should we read into these "establishment" growth numbers? It’s important to keep in mind the statistics make no distinction between the size of the firms being created and shutting down, according to economist Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls. "If you have a lot of firms with one to four employees being created, you can get a good ranking for the number of businesses being created, but a bad ranking for total employment growth," he said. Our rating Walker’s second-term blueprint said that since he took office, "Wisconsin ranks 11th in the nation in total business establishment growth compared to 47th in the years Mary Burke was Commerce secretary." The numbers, though not covering Walker’s complete time as governor, are the latest available and support Walker’s statement. We rate the statement True.

pomt-14517	"In New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in number one."	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-compares-his-spending-and-new-hampshi/	Donald Trump brought a souvenir from the New Hampshire primary with him to the GOP debate in South Carolina last weekend, and he appeared eager to dangle it over Jeb Bush’s head. It’s nothing new to see the billionaire businessman tangling with the former Florida governor – but this piece of data he twice repeated was a novel talking point, seeking to illustrate the efficiency of his campaign compared to Bush’s. "In New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1," Trump said. Trump first deployed a version of this line after Bush accused him of getting his foreign policy knowledge "from the shows," but it was garbled as the two went back and forth in a flared exchange. Later, Trump circled back to make the same point with better clarity during a question directed only to him, again trying to paint Bush as a failed candidate. Even if the statistic fits with the storyline – that Bush’s well-heeled campaign and super PAC went all out in New Hampshire, and Trump doesn’t need to spend money to get attention – the gap seemed extraordinary. PolitiFact New Hampshire knew straight away his recollection of the election results was a bit off, so we decided to investigate whether it could be true that Trump tallied more than three times as many votes as Bush, while spending less than one-tenth what the governor did. The results First, we’ll take on the second half of Trump’s statement: Bush "came in five, and I came in No. 1." We only needed to look at the election results to know Trump was right about his position -- he won the Republican primary on Feb. 9 with 100,406 votes -- but wrong about Bush’s. With 11 percent of the vote (31,310), Bush came in fourth place, not fifth. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was the one who actually came in fifth – although the margin was very close. The difference between Bush and Rubio was 1,278 votes, or about 0.4 percent of the total. We reached out to Trump’s campaign and never heard back. The spending Trump said Bush spent $44 million in New Hampshire, but made no mention of super PACs spending money. We won’t hold that wording against Trump, especially since the money was spent on Bush’s behalf, and Bush himself raised money for his PAC before he was an official candidate. Various news agencies have published analyses of the money that campaigns and related super PACs have spent on ads in New Hampshire. NPR, for one, looked at NBC-SMG Delta and Associated Press data through Feb. 3 to consider each candidate’s return on his or her New Hampshire TV ad spending. Their data, which doesn’t include the final few days before the primary, found that Bush and super PACs backing him spent the most per-vote by far: $4.5 million from his campaign and $29.5 million from super PACs. With about 31,000 voters supporting him, that meant a per-vote cost of more than $1,000. Trump, according to the same analysis, spent $3.1 million, all of which came from his campaign and none from a super PAC. With slightly more than 100,000 votes, that’s $31 per vote. To refocus on Trump’s statement, the total spent for each candidate per NPR’s analysis was: Trump $3.1 million; Bush, $34 million. By that measure, Trump appears to be accurate on his own numbers but exaggerating Bush’s. A secondary analysis by Morning Consult, which was published the morning of the primary, accounts for the last few days before voting. It had each candidate’s ad spending slightly higher in line with the additional time. By this time, Bush was at $36.1 million and Trump was at $3.7 million. So Trump’s estimate for himself was slightly low, while his account for Bush was still exaggerated by about $8 million. To put that spending in perspective, we took a look at the numbers for the campaigns that fell in after Bush. Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Hillary Clinton weren’t even close, spending $18.5 million, $15.2 million, $12.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively, according to the Morning Consult analysis. So whether Trump had said $34 million or $44 million, he was pointing out a radically high number. Our ruling Trump said: "In New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1." Bush came in fourth, not fifth, and his campaign and the PACs supporting him spent about $36 million, not $44 million. But it was still the most of any candidate. Trump did finish in first but spent closer to $4 million, not $3 million. Trump is slightly off in three out of the four claims, but his larger point about spending and campaign effectiveness in New Hampshire hold true. We can’t say whether Trump was intentionally exaggerating or not. Either way, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-02-18T20:29:52	2016-02-13	['Jeb_Bush']

Charlie Bass, R-NH voted to "raise his own pay" eight times	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/28/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-mclane-kuster-mark-charlie-bass-salary-claim/	Democratic nominee Ann McLane Kuster, taking her second shot at ousting U.S. Rep. Charlie Bass, R-NH, took aim at his congressional pay increases to plead her case for representing New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District in 2013. In a press release titled, "Congressman Bass’ Hypocrisy on Congressional Pay," Kuster targeted Bass’ proposal to reduce congressional pay if Congress fails to act to avoid the sequester. "After voting to raise his own pay eight times during his fourteen years in Congress, Congressman Bass has apparently had an election-year change of heart," Kuster said. "While we need to cut and cap Congressional pay, New Hampshire voters deserve better than election-year gimmicks from politicians like Congressman Bass who have spent their careers raising their own pay and protecting their Congressional perks." PolitiFact has seen its share of jabs over congressional pay increases. PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Virginia have each checked similar claims against congressmen in their states and rated those statements Half True and Mostly True, respectively. Both checksfound those claims -- like Kuster’s statement -- aren't that clear cut. In 1989, Congress passed an ethics reform law that included an annual cost of living adjustment. The automatic pay raise was created in exchange for not getting paid for private speeches. The pay raise, based on a formula, is automatically included in appropriations bills unless Congress takes a vote to stop it. The law -- even if it had the best of intentions -- created a system where members of Congress receive raises without having to be on-record voting for them. What does exist though, are roll call votes on whether members of Congress were willing to hear amendments to suspend their pay increases. Members of Congress have seen their pay increase over time. Members initially received $6 a day in 1789; today they receive $174,000 annually. But because the pay raises are now essentially automatic, the only thing Congress can do is vote to stop them. Bass Represented New Hampshire's Second Congressional District from 1995-2007 and was re-elected in 2010. From 1995-2007, congressional salaries rose from $133,600 in January 1995 to $174,000 in January 2012. To Back up Kuster's claim, her campaign provided eight votes that they say show Bass voted to increase his own pay. Roll Call 261 on H. Res. 865 H.R. 5576, June 13, 2006 Roll Call 327 on H.

Res 246 on H.R. 2490, July 15, 1999 We’ll break them down, starting with the earliest:1999: On July, 15, 1999, the House voted 276-147 with Bass in the majority on "ordering the previous question" to essentially defeat a measure to stop the pay raise. The vote was on House Resolution 246, which related to H.R. 2490, the $13.5 billion treasury and general government appropriations bill. The effect: members of Congress accepted a$4,600 pay increase from $136,700 to $141,300 in January 2000. 2000: On July 20, 2000, the House voted 250-173 with Bass in the majority on "ordering the previous question" on House Resolution 560, which quashed an amendment to prohibit a pay raise, and allowed for consideration of H.R. 4871, the fiscal 2001 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. Congressional salaries increased$3,800 to $145,100 a year in January 2001. 2001: On July 25, 2001, the House voted 293-129 with Bass in the majority, to order the previous question on House Resolution 206, which prevented an amendment to block the pay increase, and allowed consideration of H.R. 2590, the $32.8 billion fiscal 2002 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. In January 2002, House members saw a $4,900 pay increase to $150,000. 2002: On July 18, 2002, the House voted 258-156, Bass in the majority, to order the previous question on House Resolution 488, which prevented consideration of an amendment to stop the cost-of-living raise, and allowed consideration of H.R. 5120, the fiscal 2003 Treasury Appropriations bill. The vote cleared the way for a $4,700 salary bumpin January 2003 to $154,700. 2003: On Sept. 4, 2003, the House voted 240-173, Bass in the majority, to order the previous question on House Resolution 351 for consideration of H.R. 2989, the fiscal 2004 Transportation and Treasury Appropriations bill, therefore an amendment seeking to halt a pay raise was not in order, paving the way for Congress’ salary to increase $3,400 in January 2004 to $158,100. 2004: On Sept. 14, 2004, the House voted 235-170, with Bass in the majority, on ordering the previous question for consideration of House Resolution 5025, the fiscal 2005 Transportation and Treasury Appropriations bill. By doing so, the House rejected Rep. Jim Matheson, D-UT's procedural attempt to get a direct vote on the pay raise. Congress received a pay adjustment of 2.5 percent in January 2005, increasing their salary $4,000 to $162,100. The only House member to speak out against the automatic raise in 2003 or 2004, according to Fox News, was Rep. Matheson. "Now is not the time for members of Congress to be voting themselves a pay raise," Matheson said. "Let us send a signal to the American people that we recognize their struggle in America's economy." 2005: On June 28, 2005, the House voted 263-152with Bass in the majority, on ordering the previous question to again essentially stop Matheson from introducing a measure to block the pay raise. The vote was on House Resolution 342, which related to H.R. 3058, an appropriations bill for transportation and other areas. Congress would receive a $3,100 pay raise, bringing their salary to $165,200. Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's spokesperson, explained the procedural move. "Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question," she told PolitiFact in an e-mail. "Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered his amendment to deny the annual Congressional pay raise. The process is designed to be obscure -- which is Matheson’s primary concern -- that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries." 2006: On June 13, 2006, the House took a similar vote -- this time 249-167 with Bass in the majority -- on ordering the previous question which again halted Matheson's attempt for an up-or-down vote. The vote was on House Resolution 865, which related to H.R. 5576, an appropriations bill. The result: members would receive a $3,300 pay raise increasing their salaries to $168,500. But then campaign season kicked in. Democrats vowed not to accept the 2007 pay raise until Congress approved an increase to the minimum wage. On. Dec. 8, 2006, the House voted 370-20 with Bass in the majority or a stopgap funding measure H.J. 102 until mid February 2007 -- delaying the pay raises. Democrats had planned to offer an amendment to delay the congressional pay raise, so "House GOP leaders decided to include language deferring the pay raise in the bill, taking away the Democrats' ability to make it an issue,"Congressional Quarterly Today wrote in an article we found in Nexis. So, did Bass vote to increase his own pay here? Not exactly, his spokesman says. "Kuster continually cites procedural votes that have nothing to do with pay raises beyond what certain Members of Congress said they intended to do if this procedural vote failed to move the underlying bill along the House floor process," said Scott Tranchemontagne, a spokesman for Bass’ "Victory Committee," in an email to PolitiFact. "However, that same argument could be applied to any issue that was not addressed in the underlying legislation being considered at the time. It’s parliamentary shenanigans." Tranchemontagne added that Bass has voted for extended freezes to congressional pay several times, including recently, with H. Res. 3835 and H.J. Res. 117 which extend Congressional and federal employee pay freezes; and H. Res. 3630-- which would prohibit any pay adjustment for Congress prior to December 31, 2013. Our ruling: Since Congress has essentially built a system that allows for pay raises without direct votes by its members, it’s difficult to say who voted for the raises, which were a tiny part of much larger appropriation bills. What can be seen are votes on procedural moves to block the pay raises, or force an up or down vote. Still, Kuster is exaggerating to cite these eight votes to say Bass voted to raise his own pay, because the votes didn’t do that on their own. Still, Bass cast procedural votes that effectively allowed automatic pay raises to stand for eight years, and the practical effect of those votes meant Bass saw raises. And Kuster left out the fact that Bass has voted for pay freezes. To us, the two caveats amount to a Half True.	None	Ann McLane Kuster	None	None	None	2012-09-28T17:57:39	2012-09-19	['None']

pomt-08975	"There have been 30 published polls in this election cycle and Harry Reid's been trailing in every single one."	/texas/statements/2010/jul/17/john-cornyn/reid-only-clearly-trailing-two-thirds-polls/	U.S. Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah, the Republican who lost his bid for re-election in May when he finished third at his party's nominating convention, warned last week that tea party "mischief" could cost Republicans in hotly contested Senate races this November. "The Utah senator said he fears tea party extremism could end up costing the GOP seats that they otherwise would have been able to win," the Associated Press reported July 9. Namely, Bennett said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., doesn't have to worry about Republican Sharron Angle, who was nominated to challenge Reid with the Tea Party's blessing. "My sources in Nevada say with Sharron Angle there's no way Harry Reid loses in Nevada," he said. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas later fired back, suggesting Bennett's suffering from sour grapes. "I realize we're hot and heavy leading up to the election, but voters are going to make the right decision," Cornyn was quoted saying in an article posted July 13 by Talking Points Memo, an online political news organization. "There have been 30 published polls in this election cycle and Harry Reid's been trailing in every single one." Is Reid really down and out all over? Brian Walsh, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which Cornyn chairs, said there have been "at least" 30 polls taken in the "last 18 months of this election cycle," or since January 2009. Walsh didn't share the senator's breakdown of polls, so we went surfing. We turned up several online compendia of poll results: Rasmussen Reports, Real Clear Politics, and Talking Points Memo, all looking at who voters would pick in a matchup between Reid and Angle, and Reid and Sue Lowden, who was a promising GOP primary candidate. Rasmussen, Real Clear Politics and Talking Points Memo yielded summaries of 27 polls and we scrounged up three more polls from the Talking Points Memo "PollTracker." For each poll, we checked to make sure that Reid was tested for re-election and that there was a clear-cut indication of who was ahead — Reid or an opponent. All told, we found, there have been polls testing Reid's chances against various possible challengers since at least August 2009. That's when the Mason-Dixon poll showed Lowden leading Reid by 5 points, though the margin of error was also 5 points. Of the 30 polls we reviewed — including five Democratic polls and one Republican poll — a Republican led Reid in all but two of them, both Democratic. We sought more information on the two exceptions, and this is what we found: In May, a poll by Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates reported that Reid had a seven point lead on Lowden; Angle wasn't included in the poll. Jonathan Brown, a senior researcher for the pollster, told us the result was unique because Lowden had just made some "extremely ill-advised comments" about her idea to have Americans barter with their doctors for health care. In June, Research 2000, working with the liberal-leaning Daily Kos, reported Reid had a six-point lead on Angle and a four-point lead on Lowden. (That month, Daily Kos severed ties with Research 2000, and has since sued the pollster for faulty polling.) Among the remaining 28 polls, 21 showed Republicans clearly leading Reid. Seven showed a GOP candidate ahead, but not by enough to exceed the poll's margin of error — meaning their race would have been too close to call at that time. In one of them, Reid led when voters were asked to choose between Reid and Lowden, but when asked to choose between Reid and Angle, Angle led. In another, Reid was leading Angle, but behind Lowden. On average, Talking Points Memo found Angle leading Reid an average of 45.9 percent to 41.7 percent from December 2009 to July 2010, and Lowden leading Reid by an average of 45.6 percent to 39.6 percent from August 2009 to June 2010. Looking solely at data from April to June, Real Clear Politics found the since-defeated Lowden 2.7 points ahead of Reid. From May to July it found Angle leading Reid by 1 percentage point, on average. The most recent Rasmussen survey of 750 likely Nevada voters taken July 12 showed Angle leading Reid by 3 points at 46 percent, with a 4 point margin of error. "This is Reid's best showing all year and follows a visit by President Obama to the state to help his campaign," Rasmussen said. "Angle's support continues to edge down following the bounce she got a month ago following her GOP primary win." As we were wrapping up this item, Talking Points Memo posted a July 1 poll by the Democratic Patriot Majority PAC that showed Reid with a four-point lead over Angle, without revealing the poll's margin of error, and a July 14 Mason-Dixon poll that showed Reid with a seven point lead on Angle. We didn't include these polls in our count because they weren't available when Cornyn made his claim. In its July report, Rasmussen said Reid is "creeping forward and now is nearly tied" with Angle, and rated the Nevada Senate race as a "toss-up." Though the latest polling hints that Reid's numbers may be picking up, he clearly trailed Republican opponents in two-thirds of the 30 polls we reviewed; in those seven polls showing a closer race, Reid was behind in five. Had Cornyn said that Reid was behind in nearly every poll, we wouldn't quibble. But in two polls, Reid was the clear leader — and that means he didn't trail "in every single one." We rate Cornyn's statement as False.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2010-07-17T06:00:00	2010-07-09	['Harry_Reid']
pomt-00643	The average age of planes in the Qatar Airways fleet is about four years while Delta Air Lines flies planes that are 35 years old.	/georgia/statements/2015/may/19/akbar-al-baker/qatar-airways-leader-mark/	Some harsh words have been hurled by the CEOs at the forefront of what some say is a struggle for dominance of international aviation. They include recent remarks from Akbar Al Baker, chief of Qatar Airways, suggesting that his airline flies airplanes that are superior to those flown by Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines by virtue of their age. "I am delighted that (CEO) Richard Anderson of Delta is not here," Al Baker said in an interview March 16. "First of all, we don’t fly crap airplanes that are 35 years old. The Qatar Airways average fleet (age) is only four years and one month." PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Al Baker’s claim. But first a little background. Al Baker first made the unflattering claim about Delta’s fleet when he met with a reporter to address a complaint being spearheaded by Anderson. The complaint accuses three major Middle East airlines -- Etihad, Emirates and Qatar -- of receiving $42 billion in "unfair" subsidies. Delta, United and American Airlines say the subsidies give the Gulf carriers an unfair advantage and are allowing them to expand around the world. Qatar Airways currently flies into Washington D.C., Chicago, New York, Houston, Miami and Dallas and is scheduled next year to launch service to Los Angeles, Boston and Atlanta. Al Baker denies receiving any "subsidies." "The state of Qatar is the owner of Qatar Airways and whatever funds are put into the airline is as equity, which is quite legitimate," he has said. Al Baker and Anderson sparred earlier this year after the Gulf carriers complained that some U.S. airlines received their own subsidies in the form of Chapter 11 bankruptcy and federal loan guarantees and aid after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. U.S. airlines countered that bankruptcy is not a subsidy, and the restructuring process is transparent. Anderson in February told CNN: "It's a great irony to have the United Arab Emirates from the Arabian peninsula talk about [bailouts for U.S. airlines] given the fact that our industry was really shocked by the terrorism of 9/ 11 which came from terrorists from the Arabian peninsula that caused us to go through a massive restructuring." Al Baker shot back: "I think he should be ashamed to bring the issue of terrorism to try to cover his inefficiency in running an airline." The numbers Now, to the specifics of Al Baker’s claim. Qatar Airways, the national carrier for the State of Qatar, was launched in 1997 and bills itself as "one of the fastest-growing airlines operating with one of the youngest fleets in the world." We contacted the airline for documentation that it had a fleet of airplanes, averaging 4.1 years in age. We received data that showed the fleet was actually newer -- averaging 3.1 years. The airline, based in Doha, has 152 passenger and cargo airplanes, including some Airbus A330s with "designer sleeper suites’ for first-class passengers. Data on the age of U.S.-registered aircraft is available at the FAA website, which helped with our research. At Delta, spokesman Trebor Banstetter told us the the airline has about 1,250 airplanes, averaging 14 years in age and 15 years on its trans-oceanic fleet. "Of our 1,200 plus aircraft, there are a total of four that are older than 30 years," Banstetter said. "They are all about 30.5 years old, and all scheduled for retirement this year." The average age of the fleet is shown as slightly higher -- 17 years --- on Delta’s quarterly filing to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s largely a reflection of change -- new Boeing 737s being purchased; planes being moved into retirement; and others salvaged for parts, Banstetter said. We were unable to contact Al Baker to ask where he got the information to suggest Delta was flying 35 year old airplanes. Aviation expert Richard Aboulafia said airlines are defined by their products, not the age of their jets. "Business class passengers, who are the only ones who really drive these considerations, look at the state of interiors, seats, food, and other amenities," Aboulafia said. "Jet age is largely irrelevant. And Delta's average fleet age certainly is nowhere near 30." Our conclusion Al Baker was conservative in saying that Qatar Airways had a fleet of airplanes that was 4.1 years on average. The age of Qatar’s 152 passenger and cargo airplanes is actually on average 3.1 years. But Al Baker veered off course when his comments morphed into an attack on Delta. Delta has more than 1,200 aircraft. Four are due to retire this year. Each of those is about 30.5 years old, Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said. The majority of Delta’s fleet is much newer. Al Baker’s comments contain an element truth but they ignore critical facts that would give the average reader a different impression We rate Al Baker’s comments Mostly False.

pomt-10831	"Congressman Paul introduces numerous pieces of substantive legislation each year, probably more than any single member of Congress."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/17/ron-paul/lotsa-bills-but-not-the-most/	On his campaign Web site, Rep. Ron Paul makes this claim: "Congressman Paul introduces numerous pieces of substantive legislation each year, probably more than any single member of Congress." We'll give him points for qualifying his claim by saying it is "probably more" than others, but our tally shows he falls short. By early September 2007, Ron Paul has introduced 49 bills this year. That puts him fifth out of 540 members of Congress. Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., has the most at 59. Most of Paul's bills are substantive – that is, he doesn't often introduce legislation such as naming post offices, reducing the duty on a specialized piece of manufacturing equipment or congratulating a sports team. Indeed, he's introduced substantive bills such as the Sanctity of Life Act, which fixes the beginning of life at conception; a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to children of illegal immigrants; and a constitutional amendment with the effect of abolishing income, state and gift taxes. But in the last Congress, he was far short of being the most prolific bill-writer. He was 25th overall in the number of bills introduced, with 71 bills, 66 of which could be called substantive. We give Robert E. Andrews, D-N.J., the prize for most substantive bills in the 109th. He introduced 128, 119 of them that were substantive.

pomt-01082	Says he "secured the highest possible bond rating" for the city of Tampa.	/florida/statements/2015/jan/15/bob-buckhorn/buckhorn-secures-highest-possible-bond-rating-comm/	In touting Tampa’s fiscal health, an ad that Mayor Bob Buckhorn’s re-election campaign is running on television says that he "secured the highest possible bond rating" for the city. Four times this year, credit rating agencies have looked at the city’s finances and "said, not only is this a well-run operation, it is a superior operation, and our ratings reflect that," Buckhorn told PolitiFact Florida in an interview at his office in City Hall on Jan. 13, 2015. In September 2014, Standard & Poor's raised its rating on what's considered to be the city's general credit from AA+ to AAA, its highest rating for municipalities. Also in September 2014, Standard and Poor’s upgraded the city's occupational license revenue bonds from AA to AA+. In July 2014, Fitch Ratings raised its rating on Tampa's water and sewer bonds from "AA+"' to "AAA," its highest rating. In November 2014, Moody's Investors Service upgraded its rating on $101.1 million in solid waste bonds from A3 to A2. (Its highest rating is Aaa.) Higher ratings let the city hold down costs by borrowing money at lower interest rates. City officials say they also validate difficult choices they've had to make in balancing the budget during the recession and its aftermath. But the city has hundreds of millions of dollars in other bonds, including utilities tax bonds, sales tax bonds and special purpose bonds, that do not have the highest ratings assigned by those credit rating agencies. All of them are rated "investment grade," which is better than being rated speculative grade. But for different bond issues, at least some -- and sometimes all -- of the ratings from the three rating agencies are a notch or more below the top. In addition, Standard & Poors is the only agency to give its top grade so far to Tampa’s general credit rating. Moody’s rates it Aa1, just below Aaa. Fitch rates it AA, just below its top rating of AAA. Buckhorn said it wouldn’t have been possible to summarize all of the city’s bond ratings in a 60-second commercial, but he checked with his chief financial officer to make sure he made the most accurate statement possible. And he acknowledged that Tampa could earn even higher credit ratings on some of its debt. "We strive for that," he said. "So is all of our debt Triple-A? No. I would venture to say there’s probably not a city in America where all of the debt is Triple-A. Is a big portion of our debt Triple-A? You betcha. ... I’m proud and I’ll say it wherever I go. The folks who vote for me should be pretty happy with that." Buckhorn’s campaign ad said he had "secured the highest possible bond rating." Loking at the campaign’s use of the phrase "highest possible," we find there’s still room for improvement in the ratings on some of the city’s debt. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-00354	Says Joe Manchin "strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after she said, ‘We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work.’"	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/13/patrick-morrisey/did-joe-manchin-stick-hillary-clinton-after-contro/	Appearing at a rally with President Donald Trump in Charleston, W.Va., Patrick Morrisey -- the Republican challenger to Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin -- riled up the crowd by invoking a particularly embarrassing remark by Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential nominee of Manchin’s party. "Joe Manchin strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after she said, ‘We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work,’" Morrisey told the crowd after Trump turned over the podium on Aug. 21, 2018. Morrissey's statement has a basis in truth, but it glosses over some context. (We're not addressing the portion of Morrisey's remark about how Manchin voted, since ballots are cast privately, making it impossible for us to verify independently.) What Clinton said On March 13, 2016, as she was running for president, Clinton appeared at a televised town hall in Columbus, Ohio. At one point during the event, Clinton said, "I’m the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity — using clean, renewable energy as the key — into coal country. Because we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business." She continued, "And we're going to make it clear that we don't want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on." While the latter portion of her comments communicated empathy for coal-mining families, her remark that "were going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business" drew intense criticism, not only from Americans in coal country but also with her allies, who said Clinton’s phrasing seemed to trivialize the seriousness of coal workers’ economic dilemma. Manchin’s support for Clinton So how did this episode affect Manchin’s support for Clinton? Let’s review. Manchin and Clinton had known each other for years, and he endorsed her on CBS’s Face the Nation on April 19, 2015. "I support Hillary Clinton. I know Hillary Clinton, and I find her to be warm and engaging, compassionate and tough. All of the above, " Manchin said. After the town hall remark, MetroNews reported that a senior advisor to Manchin was "troubled and concerned by the comments and reached out directly to the Secretary and her senior advisor for energy." In June 2018, Manchin told Politico that he repeatedly threatened to revoke his support for Clinton after her remark. "First, Manchin told Bill Clinton that he would withdraw his support, as the former president pleaded with him not to," Politico reported, "Then Hillary Clinton called him. ‘She said, ‘Please don’t. Let me come to West Virginia, I need to explain.’ I said, ‘That’s a bad idea, you shouldn’t come,’" Manchin recounted. But the two sides reconciled, and on March 15 -- two days after the town hall -- Clinton formally reacted to the fallout from her remark, sending a letter to Manchin. "Simply put, I was mistaken in my remarks," she wrote. "I wanted to make the point that, as you know too well, while coal will be part of the energy mix for years to come, both in the U.S. and around the world, we have already seen a long-term decline in American coal jobs and a recent wave of bankruptcies as a result of a changing energy market — and we need to do more to support the workers and families facing these challenges." She also said in the letter that she supported the Miners Protection Act backed by Manchin, which would provide health benefits and pensions for former miners and family members. "I pledge to you that I will focus my team and my Administration on bringing jobs to Appalachia, especially jobs producing the carbon capture technology we need for the future," Clinton wrote. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com About six weeks later, on May 2, Clinton came to West Virginia for a roundtable at the Williamson Health and Wellness Center. At that event, she talked with Manchin and a former coal miner, Bo Copley. "I don't know how to explain it, other than what I said was totally out of context from what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time and I did put out a plan last summer," Clinton said. "It was a misstatement, because what I was saying is that the way things are going now we are going to continue to lose jobs. What I said was that is going to happen unless we take action to try to help and prevent it." At the roundtable, Manchin also expressed his discomfort with Clinton’s initial statement. "I have two ways to go when that statement came out," Manchin said. "I could have said, 'I thought she was my friend, by golly I'm done, I'm gone.' Now that's not the way we were raised, I wasn't raised that way. So, I said I'm going to call" her instead. He added, "If I thought that was in her heart, if I thought she wanted to eliminate one job in West Virginia, I wouldn’t be sitting here, and she wouldn’t be sitting here if she felt that way.". Manchin’s office did not respond to an inquiry, but CNN reported on June 17, 2016, that Manchin remained one of the Democratic Senators who were "backing" Clinton for president. And in the 2018 Politico interview, Manchin called his decision to stick by Clinton "a mistake. It was a mistake politically." But the article added that to Manchin, "her $20 billion commitment to his state was too much to pass up. ‘Is this about me? Or trying to help a part of my state that’s never recovered and is having a tough time?’" Our ruling Morrisey said Manchin "strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after she said, ‘We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work.’" It’s worth noting some of the context that Morrisey left out -- that Clinton had also expressed empathy for coal miners’ economic challenges in her initial remark, that she later clarified what she had meant to say, and that Manchin had worked to convince Clinton of why her remarks had been unacceptable. Still, none of that changes the gist of Morrisey’s assertion -- that Clinton said the remark, and that Manchin remained in her camp through the election (while we know he endorsed her, we do not know for sure he voted for her, as ballots are secret).

pomt-06260	Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on supporting "the president's Recovery Act."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/28/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-obama-stimulu/	On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues. For this item, we’ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on President Barack Obama’s stimulus plan, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items. Here’s the relevant portion from the DNC ad: On-screen text: "Opposed the stimulus" Video clip of Romney: "I have never supported the president's Recovery Act, alright -- the stimulus. No time, nowhere, nohow." On-screen text: "After he was for it." Different video clip of Romney: "I think there is need for economic stimulus." We asked the DNC for citations for these clips, and they responded that the first one came from a town hall at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., on Sept. 28, 2011, and the second one came from a Romney appearance on CNN’s Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer on Jan. 4, 2009. Upon learning this, we immediately noticed that the CNN interview -- when Romney said, "I think there is need for economic stimulus" -- took place before Obama had even been sworn into office and therefore came before there was an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. To get the full context of the CNN interview, we looked to the transcript. Blitzer said that Obama, then president-elect, was "talking about a $750 billion economic stimulus package. He wants it to be passed as soon as possible. It's unclear if whether it can be passed before he's inaugurated on January 20th. What do you think about this proposal?" Romney replied, "Well, I frankly wish that the last Congress (had) dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president could have signed that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time. And that's one of the reasons why I think a stimulus program is needed." He continued, "I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies. But let's not make this a Christmas tree of all of the favors for various politicians who have helped out the Obama campaign, giving them special projects. That would be wrong. You'll see Republicans fight that tooth and nail if that happens. Let's do what's right for the economy, and let's not do what's a political expedient move." The DNC ad has some support for its flip-flop claim. Romney did indeed say, "I think there is need for economic stimulus," and at the time of the interview, there was in fact an outline of a stimulus plan from Obama. But it’s misleading to say Romney flip-flopped on supporting "the president's Recovery Act." At the time of the CNN interview, no Obama stimulus bill had been introduced, much less enacted. With such complex bills, the devil’s in the details. Given that Romney outlined a whole list of conditions he’d impose on such a bill, we think it’s unfair for the DNC to say Romney once supported "the president's Recovery Act." Our ruling In the CNN interview, Romney expressed support broadly for "economic stimulus" -- not for a specific measure known as "the president's Recovery Act." And even as he offered his support for the concept of stimulus, Romney articulated a pretty specific vision of the kind of bill he’d support. Some of this vision did ultimately overlap with what the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act offered -- tax relief for "middle-income families" and businesses, for instance, and investments in infrastructure and energy. But Romney’s two comments can be easily reconciled by arguing that the dollar amounts in the Obama stimulus bill -- or the ratios of various provisions in the bill -- went beyond what he was envisioning. We rate the DNC’s charge of flip-flopping Mostly False.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-11-28T17:51:49	2011-11-28	['None']

pomt-10076	The Rev. Rick Warren "has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/13/people-american-way/seeing-red-over-warren/	President-elect Obama's selection of evangelical Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration drew sharp rebuke from some of Obama's liberal supporters due to Warren's hard line against abortion and gay marriage. Warren, senior pastor of the evangelical Saddleback Church in Southern California and author of the bestselling The Purpose Driven Life , is viewed in many circles as a social moderate, but he is on the outs with many liberal groups due to his outspoken support for California's recently passed Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution to ban same-sex marriages. Among the groups that expressed "grave disappointment" over Obama's inclusion of Warren at the inauguration was People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group. In a news release issued on Dec. 17, the organization warned that despite an "affable personality and his church's engagement on issues like AIDS in Africa," Warren has "promoted legalized discrimination and denigrated the lives and relationships of millions of Americans." The organization attributes several recent statements to Warren to back its contention that Warren is more of an extremist than many people know. "He has recently compared marriage by loving and committed same-sex couples to incest and pedophilia," the release states. And, "He has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists." We looked at the contention that Warren "has recently compared marriage by loving and committed same-sex couples to incest and pedophilia" when U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., made similar comments (see PolitiFact statement "Warren on gay marriage and incest"). Here, we'll look at the claim that Warren "has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists." The statements come from an interview of Warren in mid December by Beliefnet editor in chief Steven Waldman. In the interview, Warren sought to provide historical perspective for the split between main-line Protestants and evangelicals a century ago. As with the incest comment, the Warren comments in question come in the middle of a fairly long quote to make a larger point, so bear with the lengthy excerpt, because we think context is critical. "Along about the beginning of the 20th century there were some Protestant theologians who started using the term 'social gospel,' " Warren said. "And what they meant by that was, 'We don't really need to care about Jesus' personal salvation any more. We don't really have to care about redemption, the cross, repentance. All we need to do is redeem the social structures of society and if we make those social structures better, the world will become a better place.' Really, in many ways, it was just Marxism in Christian clothing. And it was in vogue at the time. If we redeem society then man will automatically get better. It didn't deal with the heart. And so they said, we don't need this personal religion stuff. So Protestants split into two wings. The main-line Protestants — Methodists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians — said, ‘We're going to take the body, and we're going to care about poverty and disease and charity and social justice and racial justice. And the evangelicals and fundamentalists ... said ‘We're going to take the soul and we're going to care about personal morality and pornography and protecting the family and personal moral issues and personal salvation.' Who's right? Well, in my opinion, they're both right. And part of my desire as a leader is to bring these two wings back together." Warren did liken the social agenda of some early 20th century Protestant theologians to "Marxism in Christian clothing." But Warren is referring to the ideas and agendas of theologians at a time when socialism and Marxism were part of the national dialogue. To put Warren's comment in the present tense — saying Warren "has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists" — is a serious distortion of his comment. And we note that Warren concludes his thoughts by saying he believes both positions are right, and that he'd like to bring both wings together. We rate the People for the American Way's characterization of Warren's comments Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	People for the American Way	None	None	None	2009-01-13T19:52:36	2008-12-17	['Rick_Warren', 'Marxism']
pomt-12036	"So the number on DACA is 800,000, but every one person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status. So it's 3 or 4 million, right?"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/15/dave-brat/rep-dave-brats-false-claim-about-daca-chain-migrat/	Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va. said that a program that protects young immigrants from deportation needs to be looked at in a broader context and that a bipartisan deal to protect the program is misguided. NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Brat if he was open to granting legal status to DACA beneficiaries if Democrats supported funding Trump’s promised border wall. "I don't like these little pieces, as I was just saying," Brat said Sept. 7. "That's not the problem. If you want to know if people are going in good faith on immigration reform, first you've got to do e-Verify and then you've got to take a look at chain migration, right? So the number on DACA is 800,000, but every one person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status. So it's 3 or 4 million, right?" Brat went on to say that "8 billion people would love to come here" but that such migration "ain't going to work." Todd interjected that the number at issue was not 8 billion, "we're talking about 800,000." The 800,000 is the approximate number of young people who are part of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA program. DACA spares from deportation immigrants in the country illegally who came to the United States as children. President Donald Trump gave Congress six months to pass a bill that would deal with the hundreds of thousands of people protected by the program. Brat said the 800,000 number was deceptive. "The DACA problem is the immigration problem. And once you put up a green light, it's a green light. Once you legalize and say, hey, once you make it in here, the American people are generous, always have been. We're a country of immigrants. But once you put up that green light, kwoom, right? Surges come every time." Brat left us wondering if in fact DACA recipients could bring in extended family members "once they reach a certain status" and if that could add up to 4 million additional immigrants. His office said this could happen once they got green cards. But green card recipients can only petition for spouses and unmarried children. On average, DACA recipients came to the United States before they were 7 years old. ‘Every one (DACA) person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status’ DACA gave individuals temporary deportation relief, but did not grant them legal status. Having DACA does not allow them to petition a family member to come to the United States. What "certain status" was Brat referring to? "Currently a loophole exists for DACA recipients to become eligible for green cards," said Juliana Heerschap, Brat’s communications director. "Individuals with a green card status can petition to bring their immediate and extended family into the United States." Heerschap pointed us to a Sept. 1 press release from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that said "the Obama administration allowed thousands of DACA recipients to exploit an immigration law loophole to obtain green cards," and that some of them had become U.S. citizens. Grassley said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services preliminary data showed that as of Aug. 1, 2017: • 45,447 DACA recipients were approved for advance parole (3,993 applications denied); • 59,778 DACA recipients had applied for green cards and 39,514 were approved; • of those who received green cards, 2,181 had applied for U.S. citizenship, and 1,056 had become U.S. citizens. Advance parole is issued at the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security, and DACA recipients can request it for humanitarian, education or employment purposes. It allows them to travel outside the United States and re-enter lawfully. (Individuals with other immigration statuses or protections can also request advance parole.) Simply re-entering lawfully thanks to an advance parole does not lead to legal permanent residence. A DACA recipient would still need to be eligible for a green card under established categories. However, coming in with advance parole can make the green card process easier and faster for immigrants who initially entered the country illegally. Brat’s office told us people who have green cards could petition for their immediate and extended family. But per U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, green card holders can only petition for spouses and unmarried children. Only U.S. citizens can petition for extended family members, such as parents and siblings, and in those cases the petitioner must be at least 21 years old. While the majority of DACA recipients are now adults, it’s worth noting that to be approved they had to be in the United States before they were 16 years old. Also, DACA recipients on average were 6.5 years old when they came to the United States, according to an August survey of 3,063 program beneficiaries, fielded by Tom K. Wong, an associate professor of political science at the University of California-San Diego. The median age of arrival was 6, according to the survey. ‘So it's 3 or 4 million, right?’ How did Brat determine that DACA beneficiaries could bring in 3 or 4 million people? "Rep. Brat calculated the 3 or 4 million number based on a rough estimate of total immediate and extended family members potentially eligible for chain migration if DACA recipients receive green card status. This is a very back of the envelope estimate and conservative at best," said Heerschap said, his communications director. Heerschap referred us to a paper on chain migration published by Negative Population Growth, which studies overpopulation and advocates for gradual population reduction and reversal, including through an 80 percent decrease in legal immigration. Contemporary studies found that in recent years each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 additional immigrants, the paper said. Federal data up to March 31, 2017, show that 787,580 people had been approved for DACA. If each of the 787,580 people approved brought in 3.45 family members, that would be 2.71 million more immigrants. But green card holders cannot petition for extended family members and it’d be unlikely that the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients have spouses and unmarried children back in their home country, because many came to the United States after they were 6 years old. DACA beneficiaries also must have continuously lived in the United States since June 15, 2007. Brat’s office also linked us to data from Migration Policy Institute that estimated the number of people who may benefit under House and Senate bills introduced in 2017 to help so-called "Dreamers." Under the Senate bill, about 1.5 million immigrants would be eligible for a green card, compared to an estimated 938,000 under the House proposal, MPI reported. Our ruling Brat said, "So the number on DACA is 800,000, but every one person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status. So it's 3 or 4 million, right?" Brat’s office said the status he meant was lawful permanent residence. However, even if DACA recipients were to become lawful permanent residents, as green card holders they cannot petition for extended family members to enter the United States, only spouses and unmarried children. DACA recipients were on average 6.5 years old when they arrived, making it less likely that they all have children and spouses back in their home country. Brat’s statement is not accurate, we rate it False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Dave Brat	None	None	None	2017-09-15T10:45:57	2017-09-07	['None']
pomt-07803	Says John Kitzhaber’s proposed budget for upcoming biennium represents 8 percent increase over last	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/18/shawn-lindsay/shawn-lindsay-says-john-kitzhabers-budget-proposal/	Gov. John Kitzhaber’s budget has been fairly well received by Republicans. The key to his budgeting success has a lot to do with the fact that he has set levels according to what the state is projected to take in, not what departments say they need to keep providing current services. Still, it’s quickly becoming a Republican talking point that the budget Kitzhaber proposed represents an increase over our current two-year budget. It has popped up in a note from Rep. Gene Whisnant, R-Sunriver, to his constituents; a newsletter from Rep. Kevin Cameron, R-Salem; and in an e-mail from Rep. Shawn Lindsay, R-Hillsboro. For the purposes of this fact check, we’ll focus on Lindsay, who, based on the e-mails we’ve seen, takes the most aggressive approach. In an e-mail to constituents, he writes: "Under the Governor's proposed budget, the state would have $1.2 BILLION more to spend in 2011-12 than it had in 2009-2010. That's an INCREASE not a BUDGET CUT. If I only got an 8% pay raise when I wanted a 30% pay raise, there's no way I'd call it a pay cut." We wouldn’t call that a pay cut either, so we decided to look into this one. (For those interested, in the full statement, Lindsay also says the following: "Increases in DHS (Department of Human Services) and OHA (Oregon Health Authority) spending is out-pacing increases in Education. In other words, DHS and OHA spending increases are done at the expense of Education." We already fact-checked a similar allegation and found it to be Barely True.) Kitzhaber has proposed a combined general and lottery fund budget for the 2011-2013 biennium of $14.5 billion. There’s an extra $220 million that Kitzhaber has not allocated; he’s saving that as a cushion of sorts. That puts the budget at about $14.7 billion in all. Kitzhaber based that total on the most recent state revenue forecast. Now, for comparison, the current two-year budget clocked in at $13.5 billion. When you take these two numbers -- $14.7 billion and $13.5 billion -- side by side, it does indeed look like an increase of some $1.2 billion, or 8 percent. Hey! That’s what Lindsay said. So he’s right, right? Not so fast. That $13.5 billion total for the current biennium isn’t really the full extent of what the state spent. Remember that stimulus the federal government passed two years ago? Well that and a few other smaller bills infused the state’s budget with some $1.3 billion in one-time cash. Generally, you wouldn’t count that as part of the general and lottery fund budget, as those dollars went to very specific places in the total funds budget. That said, those dollars helped loosen up other dollars to go toward services that receive their money from the general fund. All of that is a complicated way of saying that the state has been working with a $14.8 billion two-year budget. Bottom line: Kitzhaber’s spending proposal is on par with the current biennium. We called Lindsay to see what he had to say about this. He argued that his e-mail was talking about the general and lottery funds only -- not the total fund budget. But he doesn’t make that clear in the e-mail. And even so, that seems to us to be a little deceiving. Let’s look at this another way. Say last year you made $30,000 for the year and got an end-of-year bonus of $5,000. This year, however, your boss has said no bonuses, but your annual salary got bumped up to $35,000. By Lindsay’s standards, that’s a raise because he’s not counting the bonus -- or, in the state’s case, the federal stimulus money. Fact is, though, you’d probably fold that bonus into your budget just as you would the extra cash in your paycheck. Well, without the bonus the following year, that extra $5,000 in wages wouldn’t feel much like a raise, would it? Not as far as we’re concerned. And yet that’s what Lindsay and his fellow Republicans seem to be arguing here. Sorry, we just don’t see it. We rate this claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question, 'Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors’ (of the Benghazi attack)?"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/ron-johnson/what-you-need-know-about-hillary-clintons-infamous/	Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who for weeks declined to endorse Donald Trump, called for party unification on the second night of the Republican National Convention against the "cold, calculated lying" of Hillary Clinton. Johnson is one of the only vulnerable GOP senators to appear in Cleveland, and he devoted the majority of his short speech to clobbering Clinton. " ‘What difference, at this point, does it make?' I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question, 'Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors’ (of the Benghazi attack)?" Johnson said. "Instead of doing that, she hatched a cover-up story and repeatedly lied to the American people." Is that how their exchange unfolded? We found that Johnson is accurately recounting the testimony, but being selective. Clinton’s answer was longer and more nuanced. During a January 2013 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Johnson did repeatedly press Clinton about not making contact with Americans in Benghazi to "ascertain immediately that there was no protest." Clinton did give her exasperated answer (which has been hashtagged and criticized). "Ron's questioning from start to finish was about how a simple phone call could have led to the truth — a fact that clearly got under Secretary Clinton's skin just as he described," Brian Reisinger, Johnson’s spokesman, told us. But Johnson’s account requires some more context, as Clinton answered the senator’s question twice before her infamous comment. Here is a transcript of their exchange, per PolitiFact Wisconsin, with the parts Johnson highlighted in bold: Johnson: "Okay, when you read the ARB (State Department Accountability Review Board), it strikes me as how certain the people were that the attacks started at 9:40 Benghazi time. When was the first time you spoke to — or have you ever spoken to — the returnees, the evacuees? Did you personally speak to those folks?" Clinton: "I‘ve spoken to one of them, but I waited until after the ARB had done its investigation because I did not want there to be anybody raising any issue that I had spoken to anyone before the ARB conducted its investigation." Johnson: "How many people were evacuated from Libya?" Clinton: "Well, the numbers are a little bit hard to pin down because of our other friends — " Johnson: "Approximately?" Clinton: "Approximately, 25 to 30." Johnson: "Did anybody in the State Department talk to those folks very shortly afterwards?" Clinton: "There was discussion going on afterwards, but once the investigation started, the FBI spoke to them before we spoke to them, and so other than our people in Tripoli — which, I think you’re talking about Washington, right?" Johnson: "The point I’m making is, a very simple phone call to these individuals, I think, would’ve ascertained immediately that there was no protest prior to this. This attack started at 9:40 p.m. Benghazi time, and it was an assault. I appreciate the fact that you called it an assault. But I’m going back to then-Ambassador (Susan) Rice five days later going on the Sunday shows and, what I would say, is purposefully misleading the American public. Why wasn’t that known? And again, I appreciate the fact that the transparency of this hearing, but why weren’t we transparent to that point in time?" Clinton: "Well, first of all, senator, I would say that once the assault happened, and once we got our people rescued and out, our most immediate concern was, number one, taking care of their injuries. As I said, I still have a DS (Diplomatic Security) agent at Walter Reed seriously injured — getting them into Frankfurt, Ramstein to get taken care of, the FBI going over immediately to start talking to them. We did not think it was appropriate for us to talk to them before the FBI conducted their interviews. And we did not — I think this is accurate, sir — I certainly did not know of any reports that contradicted the IC (Intelligence Community) talking points at the time that Ambassador Rice went on the TV shows. And you know I just want to say that people have accused Ambassador Rice and the administration of misleading Americans. I can say trying to be in the middle of this and understanding what was going on, nothing could be further from the truth. Was information developing? Was the situation fluid? Would we reach conclusions later that weren’t reached initially? And I appreciate the — " Johnson: "But, Madame Secretary, do you disagree with me that a simple phone call to those evacuees to determine what happened wouldn’t have ascertained immediately that there was no protest? That was a piece of information that could have been easily, easily obtained?" Clinton: "But, senator, again — " Johnson: "Within hours, if not days?" Clinton: "Senator, you know, when you’re in these positions, the last thing you want to do is interfere with any other process going on, number one — " Johnson: "I realize that’s a good excuse." Clinton: "Well, no, it’s the fact. Number two, I would recommend highly you read both what the ARB said about it and the classified ARB because, even today, there are questions being raised. Now, we have no doubt they were terrorists, they were militants, they attacked us, they killed our people. But what was going on and why they were doing what they were doing is still unknown —" Johnson: "No, again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and that something sprang out of that — an assault sprang out of that — and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact, and the American people could have known that within days and they didn’t know that." Clinton: "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The IC has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we’ll figure out what was going on in the meantime." Johnson: "Okay. Thank you, Madame Secretary." So the transcript makes a few points fairly clear: Johnson was the guy who got Clinton riled up by asking why she didn’t call Benghazi survivors; Clinton did say "What difference at this point does it make?" in response to that question. But Clinton also did provide Johnson other answers. She said her priority was figuring out how to rescue those still at the compound and how to treat their injuries, not pressing them for information. She said it wasn’t appropriate for the State Department to talk to them before FBI interviews. Finally, she said her department and the administration were still trying to sort out the confusion in the days following the attacks. Our ruling Johnson said, "I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question, 'Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors’ (of the Benghazi attack)?" During a 2013 hearing, Johnson suggested repeatedly that had Clinton phoned the Benghazi compound, she would have known the attack wasn’t related to alleged protests. Clinton did get exasperated and say, "What difference, at this point, does it make?" But Johnson’s phrasing omits the fact that Clinton did provide other detailed responses to Johnson’s question. The claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bea4535d-04cb-444a-a32e-8a2c8a67d2ba	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-07-19T23:43:32	2016-07-19	['Benghazi']

pomt-05993	Rick Santorum says Rick Perry requested 1,200 earmarks as governor of Texas.	/texas/statements/2012/jan/20/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-rick-perry-requested-1200-congr/	Rick Santorum, who once took fire from Rick Perry for seeking earmarked spending while in Congress, lashed back after a town hall meeting in South Carolina. On Jan. 11, 2012, eight days before the Texas governor suspended his presidential campaign, Santorum said: "Rick Perry requested 1,200 earmarks as governor of Texas," according to a blog posted by MSNBC. "It’s sort of hard for somebody who’s been in public life and elected office for 25 years to be the outsider when he also requested over a thousand earmarks from Washington," he added. We wondered how Santorum arrived at Perry’s 1,200, a figure the former Pennsylvania senator aired again a few days later, according to a Jan. 16, 2012, post on ABC News’ blog The Note. A refresher: According to the nonpartisan group Taxpayers for Common Sense, an earmark is a legislative provision that sets "aside funds within an account for a specific program, project, activity, institution or location. These measures normally circumvent merit-based or competitive allocation processes and appear in spending, authorization, tax and tariff bills." Earmarks, which Congress banned from its budgeting and appropriations process in 2011, draw fire in some quarters because they enabled individual lawmakers to carve out funding for pet projects without public scrutiny. Some advocacy organizations say they’re still finding earmarks--sometimes called pork--in legislation. Earmark requests that raised some eyebrows include: the so-called Bridge to Nowhere project in Alaska--something for which Santorum voted, says a Perry ad (that’s Mostly True, PolitiFact found); $522,000 for cranberry and blueberry disease and breeding in New Jersey, and $1 million for a Woodstock museum, honoring the 1969 music festival in upstate New York. Santorum’s campaign didn’t reply to our requests for his backup. It would not be a shock, though, if Perry was involved in seeking earmarks. As noted in a Dec. 29, 2011, Austin American-Statesman blog post, headlined "Texas has sought its own earmarks under Perry’s leadership," a July 2006 strategic plan for the Texas Office of State-Federal Relations, which then lobbied for the state in Washington, said that with the Texas Department of Transportation, it had secured "over $669 million in highway earmarks for the state, $78 million in bus and bus facility earmarks, and $505 million in New Starts transit earmarks in the five-year surface transportation bill." At the time, the blog post says, Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and then-House Speaker Tom Craddick, comprised the advisory board for the state-federal office. For this article, we looked for signs of Perry seeking Santorum’s proclaimed 1,200 earmarks. Steve Ellis, who studies earmarks as vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that says it works to advance government transparency and cut wasteful spending, told us that from October 2007 through September 2010, Texas received 1,342 earmarks valued at $1.7 billion. That money could have gone to projects anywhere in Texas, he said, from Fort Hood to county governments. "It’s the entire state of Texas so it could be Democrats, Republicans, whomever, asking," Ellis said. "Whether Gov. Perry wanted them all, didn’t want them all, I have no idea." Ellis said that after October 2007, federal disclosure laws required Congress to list any earmarks in each piece of legislation. Staffers at Taxpayers for Common Sense would comb the legislation for additional earmarks and do their own calculations to determine things like the number of earmarks that went to each state. Citizens Against Government Waste, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that started when Ronald Reagan was president, also tracks earmarks. Its president, Tom Schatz, told us by email that between 2008 and 2010, Texas received 1,151 earmarks worth $1.4 billion, according to the organization’s earmarks database. The database, also known as the "Congressional Pig Book," is compiled by staffers at the organization who review legislation in search of earmarks, Schatz said. But there’s no way of telling how many of the earmarks originated with any governor, Schatz said, because earmarks are requested by members of Congress. "I’ve never seen a letter from any governor asking for a specific earmark," Schatz said, adding: "The only way to say that Gov. Perry ‘requested’ 1,200 earmarks, or more than 1,000 earmarks, is to attribute all of the (Texas) earmarks over that three-year period to him." Full disclosure: In 2010, the group’s political arm, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, endorsed Perry for governor and, Schatz said, the council might endorse a presidential hopeful later this year. Schatz said he was speaking about earmarks on behalf of the group, not its PAC. The figures Schatz gave us--1,151 earmarks worth $1.4 billion--differed some from those we received from Taxpayers for Common Sense: 1,342 earmarks valued at $1.7 billion. Ellis said the discrepancy is likely the result of slightly different definitions of earmarks. He said that everyone would have the same initial list of earmarks, provided through disclosure laws, but additional searching of legislation could yield findings that some groups would call an earmark and some wouldn’t. Citizens Against Government Waste lists seven criteria for determining earmarks. According to news accounts, some Texas-tied requests for earmarks during Perry’s time in office were claimed by Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. A Feb. 4, 2010 news article in The Houston Chronicle said that Hutchison, a "senior Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, points with pride to the $2.3 billion in Texas earmarks she has obtained over the last two years. Among the projects delivered by the senator are highway construction, NASA funding and expansion of Fort Hood and other military installations in an era of base cutbacks." In November 2010, PolitiFact Texas examined Hutchison’s record on earmarks by citing a study by Taxpayers for Common Sense, which ranked Hutchison 19th out of the 100 U.S. senators for steering tax dollars to specific home-state projects. The state’s junior senator, John Cornyn, ranked 54th. In October 2009, The Dallas Morning News reported that by Hutchison's accounting, she had steered $8.7 billion to Texas over the previous five years. "And as Congress finalizes the 2010 budget," the News' story says, "the haul will probably exceed $10 billion – a staggering sum that has never been tallied before. It ranks her among the most successful earmarkers in congressional history." Ray Sullivan, a Perry campaign spokesman, said the governor has a history of rejecting earmarks, something Perry noted when he faced off with Hutchison in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary. "Perry has long been opposed to congressional earmarks and other irresponsible spending in Washington," Sullivan said in an email. We asked Sullivan how many earmarks Perry sought. "I was chief of staff for two years and recall no such requests from the Governor’s Office during that time," Sullivan said in another email. "From time to time Gov. Perry asked the federal government to return Texas taxpayer money to Texas for priority needs, including disaster assistance and border security." Upshot: We failed to come up with a count of earmarks pursued or supported by Perry. Put another way, the only count we found that might potentially support Santorum’s 1,200 figure was the total earmarks that went to all of Texas over a recent period. State government may have played a role in requesting some of that funding. But it’s more than a stretch to say that Perry himself sought all the earmarks. It’s Pants on Fire!

pomt-07287	"Tommy Thompson wanted to implant data chips in humans."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/22/michael-mc-auliff/huffington-post-reporter-says-possible-gop-senate-/	Over the past few years, Wisconsin Republican Tommy Thompson has toyed with making another run for public office about as often as Brett Favre pondered retiring and un-retiring from professional football. Thompson, the former Wisconsin governor and U.S. health and human services secretary, said in 2009 that he might run again for the Wisconsin governor’s seat the following year, but he didn’t. In 2010, he was said to be weighing a challenge to then-U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., but he never jumped in. Nevertheless, considerable buzz followed a Politico.com report on May 17, 2011, that Thompson had told he friends he plans to run in 2012 for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated after 24 years by Democrat Herb Kohl. Later that day, this headline appeared on the liberal and widely read HuffingtonPost.com: "Tommy Thompson wanted to implant data chips in humans." The headline stopped us because it read like it might have come from the Onion satirical newspaper. So we decided to do some peeling to see if the claim was accurate. Was Thompson an advocate of chip implantation? Was it to be voluntary or something more forceful, as the headline seemed to suggest? The headline topped an article by Michael McAuliff, senior congressional correspondent for Huffington Post and a former Washington reporter and editor for the New York Daily News. McAuliff is the "king of headlines," according to a fan of his on Twitter who re-tweeted the article about Thompson. The article recalled that in 2005, Thompson joined the board of VeriChip Corp., a Florida company that implants digital chips in people. He joined the board a few months after resigning from the health and human services post he held under then President George W. Bush. VeriChip, McAluliff wrote, "makes something called radio frequency identification chips that are implanted in an arm, and can help doctors track a person's medical history, or can be used in high-tech security systems." The article linked to two sources that contained statements Thompson made in July 2005 about the chip: Spychips.com, which says the chips "pose serious risks to consumers," posted two video clips from an interview Thompson gave to the former CBS Marketwatch, a financial news operation that was a partner of CBS News. Saying human implantation was "completely voluntary," Thompson called the chips a "giant step forward to getting to what we call an electronic medical record for all Americans." In a TV interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" business program, Thompson said he would get such a chip implanted in his arm. "I certainly would and I think it's the coming thing," he said. "And the problems is, is that medical technology is so far behind that (the chips) are going to really be the impetus in order for us to get new technology in the medical field that's going to help people improve their quality of care, and that's what it's all about." So, the two Thompson statements show he was enthusiastic about the chips, although he wasn’t advocating they be implanted in people involuntarily. We asked McAuliff if he had other evidence to back the headline. He said the two videotaped Thompson statements meant "case closed" -- in other words, it was clear, he said, that Thompson wanted to implant data chips in humans. McAuliff also said he didn’t think the headline suggested that Thompson wanted people to be implanted involuntarily. We sought comment from Thompson, but one of his advisers, Madison lobbyist Bill McCoshen, didn’t respond. We found other accounts of Thompson’s support of the VeriChip chip for humans, including two more statements from July 2005. When Thompson joined VeriChip's board, the company issued a statement quoting Thompson as saying: "We are all well aware of the need to enhance information technology in health care. It is my belief that VeriChip is an important and secure means of accessing medical records and other information. I look forward to working with the company as it continues its growth." U.S. News & World Report quoted Thompson as saying he planned to have the chip implanted. "People are dying all the time because they can't access their medical information overseas," he said. It’s unclear whether Thompson ever did get the chip implanted, as later reports quoted him as saying he was waiting for more hospitals to be able to read the chips. When Thompson resigned from the VeriChip board in 2007, he held options for 55,556 shares of VeriChip stock and, in 2006, had been paid $40,000 by the company, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. By 2010, the majority owner of VeriChip, which had become known as PositiveID Corp., said the company had stopped marketing the chip that Thompson had touted as an electronic medical record and instead would use the technology for medical diagnostic purposes. We’ve peeled enough of this onion. What’s left? The headline of an article by HuffingtonPost.com reporter Michael McAuliff said Tommy Thompson "wanted to implant data chips in humans." Thompson certainly was a major cheerleader for the product, although he made it clear he was only advocating that people choose to be chipped voluntarily. The headline was accurate, but needed clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Michael McAuliff	None	None	None	2011-05-22T09:00:00	2011-05-17	['Tommy_Thompson']

pomt-02106	"No Republicans voted for" recent hikes in the income tax, payroll tax, capital gains tax, dividend tax and estate tax. "These taxes were all passed under … Obamacare."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/14/chain-email/chain-email-overstates-tax-increases-incorrectly-s/	Numerous readers have asked us to fact-check a chain email they’ve received recently about rising tax rates from Obamacare. Here’s the full text of the email, with its original typos intact: Here is what happened on January 1st 2014: Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6% Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2% Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28% Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6% Estate tax went from 0% to 55% Remember this fact: if you have money, the democrats want it. These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the affordable care act, aka Obamacare." We’ll take these claims in order: "Here is what happened on January 1st 2014" To the extent that these tax rates were changed -- and as we’ll see most of them didn’t change in the way the email says -- the changes didn’t take effect on Jan. 1, 2014. They took effect on Jan. 1, 2013. That may seem like a minor difference, but in this case, it makes all the difference. The tax rates that changed on Jan. 1, 2013, were all passed as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. That was the bipartisan deal -- and we’ll discuss just how bipartisan in a bit -- that passed after the 2012 presidential election to avoid the "fiscal cliff." The "cliff" refers to the expiration of tax cuts originally passed under President George W. Bush, combined with mandated federal spending cuts. The law made permanent many of the Bush-era tax cuts, but it did raise some taxes that primarily hit upper-income taxpayers. That’s what the email is attempting to spotlight, but it does so in a way that introduces a host of inaccuracies. "Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%" The timing is wrong, but the numbers are correct. "Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%" Usually people think about income taxes and payroll taxes separately. But it’s not uncommon for tax experts to look at the combination of income and payroll taxes together, because they give a sense of the overall burden of direct taxation on individuals. That’s what the email did here. On Jan. 1, 2013, the top combined rate for the income and payroll tax went from 37.9 percent to 42.5 percent. The top combined rate to 43.4 percent due to an additional Medicare tax in Obamacare. So if you just look at the federal rate, the email overstates the current top rate. If you take state taxes into account, the email is closer, but still inaccurate. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that also receives funding from individual donors and foundations, has calculated 2013 combined tax rates for each state. The group found that the top marginal tax rate, averaged across all states, is 47.9 percent. Of course, any state taxes would have been imposed by state governments, and thus were not part of the Affordable Care Act. And this would not be an apples-to-apples comparison; to make the comparison fair, the initial tax rate would need to be adjusted upward for state and local taxes as well. "Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%" On Jan. 1, 2013, the capital gains tax rate went from 15 percent to 20 percent. The health care law took that up to 23.8 percent. So the email is high by more than 4 percentage points. If you add in state and local taxes, the Tax Foundation says the current rate, averaged across the 50 states, is 28.7 percent, but Tax Foundation economist Kyle Pomerleau said this is "sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison." "Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%" This next line would have been correct if the Bush tax cuts had expired the way they were initially supposed to. But the December 2012 deal ended up going with a top marginal tax rate of 20 percent on dividend income instead of the pre-Bush rate of 39.6 percent on dividend income. It rose to 23.8 percent due to Obamacare. So the final rate cited in the email is far higher than the current rate. "Estate tax went from 0% to 55%" Both ends of this claim are wrong. The estate tax was gradually wound down by the Bush-era tax cuts, disappearing entirely in 2010. For 2011 and 2012 it was reimposed at 35 percent, then raised to 40 percent on Jan. 1, 2013 as part of the "fiscal cliff" bill. "These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the affordable care act, aka Obamacare." Most of these changes were passed as part of the 2012 fiscal cliff deal, which was enacted with bipartisan support. Facing expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would have meant a massive tax increase up and down the income scale, both parties felt compelled to strike a deal that neither side was really enthusiastic about. In the Senate, the measure passed by an 89-8 margin. Forty Republicans voted for it, and just five Republicans voted against it. In the House, it passed by a 257-167 margin. While a majority of Republicans (151) voted against the bill, 85 Republicans did vote for it. So the email is flatly wrong to say that no Republicans voted for these taxes. It’s also incorrect to say that these taxes were all raised by Obamacare. The health care law did add marginally to three of the five taxes -- 0.9 percentage points extra on the top payroll tax rate, and 3.8 percentage points higher for the capital gains and the dividends tax -- but the bulk of the increases came from the fiscal cliff deal. All told, less than a third of the actual increases in the taxes cited by the email came from Obamacare. Our ruling The chain email said that "no Republicans voted for" recent hikes in the income tax, payroll tax, capital gains tax, dividend tax and estate tax, arguing that they "were all passed under … Obamacare." The email gets many things wrong, including the effective date of the increases and most of the rates, which are uniformly higher than the actual rates. Most obviously, the email is flat-out wrong when it blames Democrats, and Obamacare, exclusively for the increases. The bulk of the tax hikes stem from a different bill entirely -- the fiscal cliff bill, which received support from a large majority of Senate Republicans and a significant minority of House Republicans. This email is so riddled with errors -- and gets so few things correct -- that we rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-12997	"Democrats Filing TREASON Charges Against Trump, McConnell, Giuliani, & Comey."	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/15/realtime-politics/websites-offer-false-headlines-about-treason-c/	Social media platforms have lit up recently with various combinations of the words "treason" and "Trump." But there’s less to the rhetoric than meets the eye. One prominent example making the rounds comes from the aggregation site Realtime Politics. A recent post was headlined, "BREAKING: Democrats Filing TREASON Charges Against Trump, McConnell, Giuliani, & Comey MONDAY MORNING" (That would be President-elect Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, former New York City mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani, and FBI Director James Comey.) The article begins, "Following the news that the CIA has determined Russia was involved in swaying the election for Donald Trump, both Democratic and REPUBLICAN senators are calling for an investigation into the Russian cyber-attacks that interfered with the presidential election. Four senators issued a statement, Chuck Schumer (D-New York), Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island), John McCain (R-Arizona), and Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina). ... "Now a group of Democrats plans to file treason charges against Trump, and others that knew about Russia's interference in the election. The group, democraticcoalition.org, announced their plan on Twitter." So what’s happening here? As we were preparing our fact check, the page in question appears to have been taken down, replaced by a "404 error" message. But similar headlines have also surfaced on such sites as Bipartisan Report and New Century Times. We should start by noting that that none of the senators cited in the Realtime Politics article, despite their criticism, have filed any treason "charges" (and it’s not clear that they could in any case). Rather, the story is based on a Dec. 11 tweet by a Democratic strategist and fundraiser, Scott Dworkin, who is advising the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, an advocacy group founded earlier this year. In the tweet, Dworkin wrote, "Breaking: We are filing complaints for treason tmrw on Trump, McConnell, Giuliani & James Comey. #DworkinReport #TrumpLeaks Russians #AMJoy Dworkin did not reply to a call from PolitiFact or an email sent to the firm he founded, Bulldog Finance Group, so we don’t know whether he actually filed a complaint on Dec. 12 -- or, perhaps more important, what kind of complaint it was. But if Dworkin did file a complaint, it wouldn’t have carried much legal weight. Treason is a serious crime that is cited by name in the Constitution, so an ordinary member of the public can’t file "charges" over treason on their own. "Private citizens can’t initiate prosecution," said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania constitutional scholar. All they could do is "tell some federal prosecutor that they think a crime has been committed," Roosevelt said. It would then be up to the prosecutor and their superiors to determine whether to proceed -- a move that would not be taken lightly. A previous complaint filed by Dworkin was somewhat more logical. As our friends at Snopes.com have outlined, Dworkin on Oct. 28, 2016, wrote a letter to the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility, requesting that the office open an investigation into possible violations of the Hatch Act by Comey, who many Democrats blamed for airing allegations about Hillary Clinton’s emails late in the presidential campaign. The Office of Professional Responsibility is a Justice Department unit "responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct" involving Department attorneys and law-enforcement personnel that "relate to the exercise of their authority to investigate, litigate or provide legal advice, as well as allegations of misconduct by law enforcement personnel when related to allegations of attorney misconduct," according to the office’s web page. So the complaint to the Office of Professional Responsibility about Comey at least made some sense, even though experts have previously told PolitiFact that Comey’s potential to be prosecuted under the Hatch Act is uncertain at best. But accusing anyone -- much less the president-elect and other high officials -- of treason represents a whole other level, experts said. For treason, there is "a high bar for prosecution, because such prosecutions were common under the King of England, and the founders wanted to protect against frivolous allegations," said Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in government ethics at the law firm Akerman. Not surprisingly, Kappel said, the resulting statute on treason "has been narrowly construed in keeping with the founders’ concerns." Experts agreed that since the treason statute refers to "giving aid and comfort" to "enemies" of the United States, initiating a prosecution -- to say nothing of winning a conviction -- is a steep climb. The statute, Kappel said, has long been interpreted to refer to "states with which the Unites States was then at war – not merely states that are in some way hostile to the United States. … Since we are not currently at war with Russia, there is no legal basis for a treason complaint. For that reason, the Justice Department is unlikely to act on any such complaint." Roosevelt agreed. "Russia doesn’t meet that criterion," he said. The complaint "sounds empty to me," he added. Our ruling Realtime Politics, echoing posts elsewhere, headlined an article, "Democrats Filing TREASON Charges Against Trump, McConnell, Giuliani, & Comey." It’s unclear whether such a request has been made, but calling the complaints "charges" is wrong. Only prosecutors, not ordinary Americans, can file "charges." Moreover, experts told us that the likelihood of actual criminal charges for treason being filed are small, at least given what’s known about the evidence so far.

pomt-07312	"The (border) fence is now basically complete."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/16/barack-obama/obama-says-border-fence-now-basically-complete/	In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, President Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is "now basically complete." Still, he predicted that many Republican opponents won't be satisfied. "We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement," Obama said. "All the stuff they asked for, we’ve done. But even though we’ve answered these concerns, I’ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time." "They'll want want a higher fence," Obama said. "Maybe they’ll need a moat. Maybe they want alligators in the moat. They’ll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That’s politics." Fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border has long been a thorny political issue, so with Obama declaring mission accomplished, we decided to check it out. Department of Homeland Security officials told us they have finished 649 out of 652 miles of fencing (99.5 percent), which includes 299 miles of vehicle barriers and 350 miles of pedestrian fence. But the same day as Obama's speech, Sen. Jim DeMint penned an op-ed for National Review in which he countered that the Obama administration has "not done its job to finish the border fence that is a critical part of keeping Americans safe and stopping illegal immigration." "Five years ago, legislation was passed to build a 700-mile double-layer border fence along the southwest border," DeMint wrote. "This is a promise that has not been kept. Today, according to staff at the Department of Homeland Security, just 5 percent of the double-layer fencing is complete, only 36.3 miles." So what gives? Is the border fence "now basically complete" or not? Not to go all Clinton on you, but it largely depends on how you define "fence." You need to go back to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico. The act specified "at least two layers of reinforced fencing." But the law was quietly altered in a significant way the following year. Responding to urging from the Department of Homeland Security -- which argued that different border terrains required different types of fencing, that a one-size-fits-all approach across the entire border didn't make sense -- Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, proposed an amendment to give DHS the discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read, "nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location." In other words, Border Patrol would have the leeway to decide which type of fencing was appropriate in various regions. The amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite being condemned by legislators such as Reps. Peter King, R-N.Y., and Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill. At the time, Hutchison told the San Antonio Express-News, "Border patrol agents reported that coyotes and drug-runners were altering their routes as fencing was deployed, so the amendment gives our agents discretion to locate the fence where necessary to achieve operational control of our border." DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been vehicle barriers, which are designed to stop vehicles rather than people (see here), and single-layer pedestrian fencing (see here). The design specifications vary depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, it includes "post on rail" steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings; "Normandy" vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh. That's not enough for some opponent of illegal immigration. "They are interpreting the requirements of the Secure Fence Act in a way that is clearly contrary to what Congress intended," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tougher enforcement against illegal immigration. There may be a role for the vehicle barriers, but "your grandmother could hop over them," he said, and "that's not what Congress thought it was voting for." Krikorian said, "The president's claim that the job is done is misleading." A Government Accountability Office report on border security, issued in February 2011, paints a mixed picture. The report acknowledges progress on the fences, as well as hundreds more miles deemed to be under "operational control," but "DHS reports that the southwest border continues to be vulnerable to cross-border illegal activity, including the smuggling of humans and illegal narcotics." T.J. Bonner, retired president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents all the front-line border patrol agents, said the type of fencing is less important than whether the border is secure. It is estimated that for every person caught (Border Patrol reported apprehending over 445,000 illegal entrants in 2010) two more get by, Bonner said. "To me, that doesn't seem like border security." But is it accurate for Obama to claim that "the fence is now basically complete"? DHS reports that there is now fencing for 649 of the 652 miles described in the Secure Fence Act of 2006. But the vast majority of the requirement was met with vehicle barriers and single-layer pedestrian fence. The original act specifically called for double-layer fencing, and only 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing currently exist. However, the act was later amended to allow Border Security the discretion to determine which type of fencing was appropriate for different areas. So Obama can make a case that the vehicle barriers and single-layer pedestrian fences meet the amended letter of the law. But we also think Obama misleads, particularly when he mocks Republican opponents, saying that even though the fence has been built, "They'll want want a higher fence. Maybe they’ll need a moat. Maybe they want alligators in the moat." The Border Patrol has not gone "above and beyond" what Republicans requested, as Obama claimed. What they originally requested was a double-layer fence, and they didn't get much of it. And so we rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08901	Dave Aronberg "was the first to demand that BP create a billion-dollar fund to pay for the devastation."	/florida/statements/2010/jul/29/dave-aronberg/aronberg-says-he-was-first-demand-bp-escrow-fund/	In the wake of the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, Florida politicians have been boasting about their own responses to the disaster. State Sen. Dave Aronberg, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, said in a campaign mailer that hit mailboxes this week that he "was the first to demand that BP create a billion-dollar fund to pay for the devastation." PolitiFact Florida previously ruled on a similar claim by Democratic political consultant James Carville that CFO Alex Sink, a Democrat running for governor, was the "first official who said that BP should pay $25 million for an ad campaign to promote Florida tourism." We found two state legislators who raised the issue of BP funding tourism ads before Sink did. So we wondered, was Aronberg the first to call for BP to pay for a $1 billion escrow account? First, we contacted Aronberg's campaign to ask what he meant by "first" since the ad didn't explain. The first politician in Florida, the first attorney general candidate or some other first? Campaign spokeswoman Allison North Jones said that the mailer referred to the first state legislator or member of Florida's Cabinet. Aronberg wrote a letter to Gov. Charlie Crist on May 5, asking that Crist reach out to BP and the other firms involved in the explosion to ask them to set up a $1 billion escrow account. "With the representatives of these three firms actively engaged on the rig’s activities at the time of the Deepwater explosion, it seems obvious that all three should be stepping up to the plate of financial responsibility," Aronberg wrote. "While the $25 million BP has offered to our state is a start, it is by no means sufficient." The letter goes on: "Florida should be insisting that an interest-bearing escrow account by established, under the control of the Cabinet or CFO, with each responsible party in this disaster committing a share to total $1 billion. The funds would be drawn down to fund preparations and prevention, wildlife recovery, loss to the local fishing industries, and mitigation as the damage rolls in." We asked Jones how the campaign determined Aronberg was first. She said that in Aronberg's role as chair of the Senate's Committee on Military Affairs and Domestic Security, he regularly received briefings on "what public officials were or were not doing in terms of response to the cleanup and any recommendations on how to hold BP accountable. In May he really felt the need to do something to make sure the money was tied up for the state to pay for the cleanup. That's when he came up with the idea for the escrow." Jones pointed to a June 14 Miami Herald Naked Politics blog that criticized Attorney General Bill McCollum for taking credit when President Barack Obama called for BP to establish the escrow account. McCollum sent a press release stating "Obama has followed McCollum's lead," according to the blog. "But really, McCollum followed the lead of state Sen. Dave Aronberg, a Democrat running for attorney general," Naked Politics wrote. "In a May 5 letter to Gov. Charlie Crist, Aronberg wrote that 'Florida should be insisting that an interest-bearing escrow account be established, under the control of the Cabinet or CFO, with each responsible party in this disaster committing a share to total $1 billion.' (The total is smaller than the one McCollum proposed, but it was also much earlier in the crisis.)" Although the blog puts Aronberg ahead of McCollum, it doesn't rule out other politicians. While Aronberg's campaign -- after the fact -- said that by "first" they meant state legislators or Cabinet members, in this Florida election season with candidates everywhere, we think the average voter could assume "first" refers to any politician or candidate. When we searched news articles, we found only one reference to a Florida politician asking for BP to provide an escrow fund before Aronberg: Republican Congressman Jeff Miller, who represents the Pensacola area. A May 4, 2010, article in the Pensacola News Journal quoted Miller at a May 3 press conference at the Mobile Regional airport. Miller said: "And we are asking BP to put money in an escrow fund so local governments, if possible, can draw upon it." Miller said the escrow fund was needed because many local governments are having to dip into their reserve funds to spend money for the disaster. Miller was not quoted as asking for a specific amount for the escrow fund. He made the statement accompanied by Florida Sen. George LeMieux and Alabama senators. We e-mailed Miller's spokesman to ask if May 3 was the first time he brought it up and whether he had also put a dollar amount on it by that point. Dan McFaul said Miller had a phone conversation with David Nagel, a top BP executive, on May 3 asking for a $1 billion escrow account. Miller reiterated his request in an in-person meeting with Nagel May 6 and in a letter May 10. We e-mailed BP in an attempt to verify the May 3 conversation. BP spokeswoman Kathleen Randall said that she left a message for Nagel about it but he was out of the office. We also reached out to LeMieux's office -- and Sen. Bill Nelson's office -- to ask if either had made a similar request. LeMieux sent a letter to BP on May 11 asking that it provide $1 billion to the gulf states. Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin wasn't certain when Nelson first raised the topic of an escrow account. "I think Bill may have even discussed the concept with Tony Hayward during a May 4 meeting here between the two," McLaughlin said. "But I don’t think we made any 'official' public request in writing for money in such a fund until we had a better idea of the scope of the damages and until the president was preparing to sit down to negotiate with BP. That would be our letter in early June seeking $20 billion. Within a week or so after that, BP did agree to the $20 billion figure." We also contacted Florida's Cabinet. CFO Alex Sink, Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson and Gov. Charlie Crist asked either BP or the federal government to help Florida pay for activities related to the disaster, but none made a request for an escrow account. Finally, we contacted Hope Lanier, a BP spokeswoman who helped us determine who the first official was to ask BP to pay for tourism ads. She said she had no information related to Aronberg's claim. "I don't have any reason to believe that it's inaccurate,'' she said. "I'm unaware of anything that would dispute it one way or another." After a meeting with Obama, BP agreed to establish a $20 billion claims fund, according to a June 16 BP press release. Aronberg said he was the "first" to call for a $1 billion escrow fund but didn't define first -- although his campaign said that meant first state legislator or Cabinet member. There's no certain way to rule Aronberg first among state legislators without contacting every legislator. We didn't find anything showing any Cabinet members demanding an escrow fund before Aronberg, who wrote his letter May 5. We did find evidence that Florida Congressman Jeff Miller asked for an escrow fund May 3. Aronberg should have been more precise in his mailer, such as "first state legislator." For that omission, we give him a Half True.	None	Dave Aronberg	None	None	None	2010-07-29T18:33:10	2010-07-26	['None']

pomt-05569	If the Supreme Court throws out the federal health care law, it "would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/04/barack-obama/obama-attaches-stark-terms-possible-supreme-court-/	After remaining mostly silent on the topic, President Barack Obama stepped into the debate over how the Supreme Court might rule on the health care law, the signature legislation of his presidency. In a Rose Garden press conference on April 2, 2012, the president expressed confidence that the nine justices will uphold the law and said that to do otherwise would be an example of "judicial activism" so often maligned by Republicans. He listed some benefits of the law that have already taken effect -- drug discounts for Medicare beneficiaries and millions of children gaining coverage. "So there's -- there's not only an economic element and a legal element to this, but there's a human element to this. And I hope that's not forgotten in this political debate. "Ultimately, I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress," he said. Two terms stood out to us in that statement: "strong majority" and "unprecedented." Is Obama, a Harvard Law-educated president, correct in his characterization of how the bill passed Congress? We remembered the vote as quite narrow. And what about the historical implication of overturning it? First, ‘strong majority’ For this part of the claim, we turned to the congressional record of votes on the health care bill from late 2009 and early 2010. The health law took an unusual path to passage. Usually, the House and Senate pass different versions of a bill, then they work out their differences in a conference committee. A unified bill comes out of that committee, and both bodies vote again on the new bill. Then, if it passes, the president signs it. In the case of the health care bill, the House and Senate had each passed different versions in 2009. It was expected the two bills would be integrated in conference committee, then voted on again. But before that could happen, the Democrats lost their 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. (Republican Scott Brown in January 2010 won the seat formerly held by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.) Anything that came out of conference committee at that point could have been held up in the Senate, blocked by 40 Republican senators. Democrats decided to get around this by having the House simply accept the Senate’s version of the bill. Then Democrats in the House and Senate used a different measure -- a reconciliation bill, which requires only a simple majority -- to modify the law they had just passed. The vote to pass the Senate version of the bill had been 60-39. The bill passed the House 219-212 on March 21,2010. Numerically speaking, neither vote reflects a very large margin of victory. In the Senate, 60 votes was actually the exact minimum needed to prevent a filibuster -- not a vote more. And in both chambers, not a single Republican voted for for the bill. The notion of ‘unprecedented’ This one, we’ll acknowledge, puzzled us. The Supreme Court routinely reviews laws passed by Congress and either upholds or overturns them. For Obama to suggest that such an action would be unique in American history is something of a head-scratcher. We could name numerous examples of the Supreme Court tossing laws passed by a "democratically elected Congress," starting with Marbury vs. Madison, in 1803. For a more recent example, Senate historian Don Ritchie cited the 1990 Gun-Free School Zones Act, which made it a federal offense to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone. But in United States vs. Lopez, the court said the federal government could not use the commerce clause to restrict guns. "Lots of laws have been overturned," Ritchie said. "That’s what the Supreme Court does." Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California at Los Angeles and blogger who considers himself center-right or libertarian-conservative, even cited a case that was passed by a large majority in Congress and then tossed out by the court. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 passed unanimously in the House and by a 97-3 vote in the Senate. The law protected religious individuals and organizations from government interference with the practice of their faith. But the court, in the 1997 case City of Boerne vs. Flores held that the statute was unconstitutional because it exceeded federal power. Volokh said the Boerne case is noteworthy in the health care debate because it was also a federalism case, meaning it was being challenged under the 10th Amendment that says powers not specifically granted to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states. Another interesting point: Ruth Bader Ginsberg and John Paul Stevens, two of the court’s liberal justices, joined the majority opinion. "Were they stopped by the fact that this was a federal statute enacted by a nearly unanimous vote of the Congress? Absolutely not," Volokh said. What’s more, he said, the Supreme Court is not supposed to consider a law’s popularity. "It’s not its job to do that," Volokh said. "You could imagine justices being influenced because justices are human. But according to the Constitution, a law is a law. … and a law that unconstitutional is unconstitutional. "They’re not supposed to look at these things, and there’s considerable evidence that they often don’t." What else might Obama have meant when he said overturning the health care law would be unprecedented? He was asked for just such clarification a day after the press conference at a luncheon with members of the Associated Press. Obama’s response: "We have not seen a court overturn a law that was passed by Congress on an economic issue, like health care ... at least since Lochner. Right? So we’re going back to the ’30s, pre-New Deal." He further explained that, because the court has extraordinary power as the final say on laws, it "has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected Legislature, our Congress. And so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this." The president seemed to be framing the health care case in historical terms. He said that no law on an economic issue such as health care has been overturned in decades, and he cited Lochner vs. New York, a controversial 1905 decision striking down a New York labor law because it interfered with employer/employee contract rights. The case marked the beginning of what came to known as the Lochner era of the court, when justices overturned several laws through the 1930s on the grounds that they were an overreach by government into business. Obama further added that overturning such a far-reaching law as the health care bill would be atypical use of the court’s power. So, when given the chance to explain, Obama wasn’t saying it would be unprecedented simply for the Supreme Court to overturn a federal law. But "this is not any law," said Norman Ornstein, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "At least since the early part of the New Deal, when you had a Supreme Court that blocked at least a few initiatives of the new Roosevelt administration, we haven’t had a major social policy overturned," he said. "And I don’t think any of them were as sweeping or significant in their effect on the country as this one (the health care law). They didn’t overturn Social Security; they didn’t overturn the (Works Progress Administration)." He continued: "If you’re looking at things that have had a big effect on people’s lives, you’d say Social Security and Medicare are the two biggest ones in the last 80 years. And I think you could make the case that while this (the health law) doesn’t affect everybody in the same way -- most people already have health insurance -- but everybody’s lives would be changed by this law because of the way that insurance would be provided and other changes in the law that affect how you deliver health care. And we’re talking about something that impinges on 17 percent of the economy, and that’s big stuff." Ornstein said that since the 1930s, there has been "a wide acceptance of the role of government in the economy and affecting the social fabric of the country." "A decision that would not only affect the health care law but would also raise questions about other mandates... this could challenge the entire New Deal and post-New Deal structure of America. You’d have to say that’s unprecedented." Our ruling That was a lot of Supreme Court history. First, let’s review Obama’s statement: "Ultimately, I am confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress." There’s simply no support for the assertion that the law was passed by a "strong majority." It was passed along party lines in a sharply partisan climate, and the 60 votes in the Senate were the minimum needed to keep Republicans from bottling it up in a filibuster. But the "unprecedented" idea is more nuanced. It’s without question that the Supreme Court overturning a law passed by Congress -- by any margin -- is a common and routine occurrence, and by no means without precedent. Volokh gave us a close analogy with the case of Boerne vs. Flores, a religious freedom law that glided through Congress but was held unconstitutional by a majority of the court, including two of its liberal justices. However, Obama’s elaboration a day later at least gives us more to think about. He argued that invalidation of the health care law would represent a court action unseen since the Great Depression on an issue that affects every American. Ornstein echoed that interpretation, saying that a ruling by the court which overturns a major social policy and challenges prior court rulings would be unprecedented. But we’re taking Obama literally, and that historical perspective was not reflected in his original statement, which is what we're ruling on. He simply said the law passed with a strong majority and overturning it would be unprecedented. Wrong and wrong. We rate the statement False.

pomt-01791	Says Common Core is a federal mandate.	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/25/joe-leibham/federal-government-required-states-adopt-common-co/	Gov. Scott Walker joined other potential Republican candidates for president when, in a surprise move, he called on the Wisconsin Legislature to repeal the Common Core education standards. State Sen. Joe Leibham, one of four Republicans seeking the GOP nomination for an open seat in Congress, applauded the announcement two days later. "Like Governor Walker, I believe education decisions should be made at the local and state level, not through federal mandates like Common Core," he said in a July 19, 2014 news release. Common Core -- a federal mandate? No. That's a lesson we've learned before. Let's review. The race GOP U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, who has represented east-central Wisconsin in Congress since 1979, announced in April 2014 that he would not seek re-election. That was a week after state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-Campbellsport, announced he would run. Jumping in later were Leibham, of the Town of Sheboygan, state Rep. Duey Stroebel of the Town of Cedarburg and political newcomer Tom Denow of the Town of Algoma in Winnebago County. The winner of the Aug. 12, 2014 primary will face Winnebago County Executive Mark Harris, who is running unopposed in the Democratic primary, in the November 2014 general election. On the GOP side, much of the campaigning has centered on which candidate is the most conservative. Common Core's origins Increasingly, conservatives around the country have attacked the Common Core State Standards, a set of standards for English and math that were unveiled in 2010. The criticism has stirred debate about the federal government's role in the standards and whether the renewed focus on them is strictly political. Tony Evers, the elected Wisconsin school superintendent, used his authority to have the state adopt Common Core in June 2010. More than three years later, in October 2013, the GOP-majority Legislature began holding hearings with the aim of reviewing and perhaps replacing Common Core. At the time, Evers said the pushback in Madison and elsewhere "is all about what's going on in Washington. It's all about controlling the message and the next (presidential) election." Also in October 2013, we rated as Mostly True a claim by state Rep. Sondy Pope, D-Cross Plains, a Common Core supporter. She said Common Core "is not from the federal government," they "do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all." Here's what we learned at the time: Common Core came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. In 2009, that council and the National Governors Association agreed to create Common Core. They developed the standards with the help of teachers, parents and experts. Although Common Core is voluntary, the federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards. States earned the equivalent of extra points in the competition for grants from Race to the Top, Obama’s signature education program, if they had adopted standards to prepare students for college and work. They didn't have to adopt Common Core, but they were better positioned for federal money if they did. Linking Race to the Top funding and Common Core is what Leibham cited to defend his claim. "In this era of tight budgets, tying federal funding to the adoption of specific education initiatives like Common Core is inherently coercive," Leibham campaign spokesman Ryan Terrill wrote in an email. "As Wisconsin struggles to maintain appropriate funding for K-12 education amid increasingly scarce (state) resources and declining property tax revenues in many districts, any individual suggesting that Wisconsin not try for RTTT funding would be ridiculed. Therefore, Wisconsin’s grant application and the strings attached really were not entirely a matter of choice." But that doesn't make Common Core a mandate -- a fact that has been reported repeatedly since we checked the Pope claim. Four examples, from March and April 2014: 1. PolitiFact Georgia noted that one of the leaders in developing Common Core, former Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia, said it was a way to "prevent a federal mandate" in education. 2. U.S. News & World Report, in an article headlined "Common Core: Myths and Facts," labeled as the first myth: "The Common Core State Standards are a federally mandated curriculum." The article pointed out that the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act forbids the federal government from intervening in school curriculum development and that states independently adopted Common Core. 3. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, reported that Common Core is voluntary and, the curriculum and teaching methods are decided locally. 4. The Washington Post -- reporting on Indiana being the first state to pull out of Common Core after being among the first of 45 states to adopt it -- said Common Core isn't a federal mandate, and noted it was developed in part through the National Governors Association. Indeed, the fact that not every state adopted Common Core -- and that Indiana, as well as Oklahoma and South Carolina adopted it and later dropped it -- underscore that the standards aren't mandatory. As does the fact that Walker is calling on the Legislature to repeal them. Our rating Leibham said the Common Core education standards are a federal mandate. States put themselves in better position for federal education funding by adopting Common Core.

pomt-09766	Gas will reach $4 a gallon under a cap-and-trade plan.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/30/energycitizensorg/energycitizensorg-claims-gas-will-cost-4-gallon-un/	In a full-page ad in the Sept. 30, 2009, edition of the Washington Post , was this eye-catching claim about gas prices: "$4 GAS - Another unfortunate truth about the House's climate bill," said the ad from EnergyCitizens.org . "As Congress considers new climate legislation, Americans aren't getting the whole truth. A recent study found the House-passed bill could lead to $4 per-gallon gasoline. America is in the middle of a harsh recession. Think about the impact of $4 gas." We've heard a lot about the cap-and-trade plan — that it will increase the cost of energy and that it will eliminate jobs — but it's been a while since we put claims about the price of gas to the Truth-O-Meter. The concept of cap-and-trade is relatively easy to understand. A cap is put on greenhouse gas emissions, and firms are required to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting. Iterations of a cap-and-trade plan have been introduced in Congress previously, but the most recent legislation, written by Democrats Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, has been passed by the House of Representatives. Their bill aims to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass on the cost of buying those permits. And that's where the argument from EnergyCitizens.org comes into play. The group, a coalition of business organizations, antitax groups, transportation companies, and Washington heavy hitters such as the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau Federation, says those higher prices will hit consumers in the form of higher gas prices. The ad cites a Heritage Foundation study of the bill published on June 16. The conservative think tank, which has been critical of the Waxman-Markey bill, contends higher energy prices "will spread throughout the economy as producers everywhere try to cover their higher production costs by raising their product prices. ... Even after adjusting for inflation, gasoline prices will rise 58 percent over the 2035 baseline price." We checked with the Heritage Foundation to find out if EnergyCitizens.org was correctly interpreting Heritage's study, and were told that the group was. Heritage also pointed us to another study the think tank did that looked at gas prices per state. Heritage assumes that under Waxman-Markey, gas will be at a minimum $3 a gallon in 2035, depending on where you live. A 58 percent price increase as a result of cap-and-trade would put the cost of a gallon of gasoline at more that $4. So, based on Heritage's data and assumptions, EnergyCitizens.org is in the ballpark. However, the group leaves out an important detail in its ad: These predictions are for 2035, 26 years from now when, presumably, our economic landscape will be very different. EnergyCitizens.org plays on people's anxiety about the recession by portraying these prices as something that would take effect immediately. To get more perspective, we looked at other estimates. For comparison, keep in mind that the current national average is $2.60 for unleaded regular. The Energy Information Administration, a branch of the Energy Department, published an analysis of the bill on Aug. 4, 2009, which predicts gas price increases will be relatively small compared to increases in the electricity sector, in part because emissions reductions from the fossil-fuel sector will only account for 12 to 20 percent of overall reductions. If the bill is enacted, gas prices will only be about 20 cents more per gallon in 2020 and 35 cents more in 2030, the report predicts. Another analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency predicts impacts on future gas prices would be minimal under the Waxman-Markey bill. Specifically, prices would go up $0.13 in 2015, $0.25 in 2030, and $0.69 in 2050, according to the June 23 report. Clearly, there's a difference of opinion on how much the price of gas will change as the result of cap-and-trade. For the most part, those differences have to do with what kind of assumptions are made about nonfossil fuels, such as nuclear and wind power. The EPA, for example, assumes that cleaner technologies and renewable energy will replace fossil fuel more quickly, which would translate to lower costs to consumers. Heritage takes an austere approach, assuming that traditional energy sources would be scaled back to meet new emissions standards, but would not be immediately replaced by new technology or renewable fuels. As a result, fossil fuel prices will go up and continue to rise. Another point to put this all in perspective: Gas prices fluctuate dramatically. In January 2009, a gallon of gas cost about a $1.80 a gallon. This week, gas costs $2.60 — about a $1.20 less than it was a year ago. So predicting how much gas will cost next week — let alone in 2035 — is an imperfect science. Based on the estimates, it's probably a safe bet that the price of gasoline will ultimately increase as a result of cap-and-trade. And the estimates vary based on reasonable disagreements about methodology. But Energycitizens.org is guilty of a significant exaggeration because the ad strongly implies the price hike would happen very soon. It fails to mention that $4-a-gallon gasoline wouldn't be the norm until 2035 — if it ever is. The group also leaves out other important studies that predict smaller increases. For a serious case of cherry-picking, we rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	EnergyCitizens.org	None	None	None	2009-09-30T17:47:16	2009-09-30	['None']

pomt-08208	"The (Ohio) economy is on the mend. … It is in better shape than it was when we took office."	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/19/pari-sabety/state-budget-director-pari-sabety-says-ohios-econo/	The perception that Ohio’s economy is in terrible shape is a big part of why John Kasich is Ohio’s next governor and Ted Strickland will be Ohio’s newest unemployed citizen next year. Kasich hammered home the theme of 400,000 lost jobs in Ohio in his rather narrow win over Strickland. And it’s a perception that is a bone of contention with some Strickland supporters who see the state again on the road to prosperity. State budget director Pari Sabety appears to be in that crowd. She spoke two days after the Strickland defeat at a roundtable discussion at the Columbus Convention Center as part of the Impact Ohio Post-Election conference. During her Nov. 4 remarks, Sabety took pride in how the Strickland administration has managed the state’s finances during the worst recession since the Great Depression. To give those in the audience a sense for why she thought things were moving in the right direction, Sabety passed out an "economic dashboard," a color-coded chart that depicted 11 key economic indicators shaded red, yellow or green. Those indicators were a mix of red, yellow and green in Nov. 2007, and today they are almost all green, she explained to the audience. Praising the Strickland administration fiscal management, Sabety said Ohio is now on a steady course. She added, "The economy is on the mend. … It is in better shape than it was when we took office." That got our attention. Is Ohio’s economy really on the mend? And is it really in better shape today than it was when Strickland became governor in 2007? We first looked at the "economic dashboard" Sabety used to support her assertions. Developed by Jim Koons of the governor’s council of economic advisors, the dashboard covers 11 categories, including Ohio’s employment rate, new building permits, wage and salary information, initial jobless claims as well as U.S. retail sales, light motor vehicle sales and other measures. But the dashboard is only of limited use in evaluating Sabety’s statement, primarily because it dates from November 2007, not January 2007 when Strickland took office. Koons said he didn’t design it until November 2007. Furthermore, it’s not designed to give a snapshot of Ohio’s economy at a given time, but rather more of a "forward-looking" sense of what trajectory the state is on. Ultimately, Koons said, it’s a tool to help predict whether the state’s revenue forecasting will be on target in the coming months — a handy thing to know if you are running a $25 billion-a-year enterprise like state government. And it’s weighted to favor the short term over the long term, he said. Asked if the state’s economy is better now than 2007, Koons couldn’t say. "I haven’t really spent much time thinking about that," he said. "I would definitely say we are moving in a better direction." We put the same question to a trio of other independent economic analysts — all based in Ohio. They consider the assertion false, laughable and downright bizarre. That’s because a state’s employment figures are the true measure of the health of a state’s economy, they all said. "Frankly, an economist getting up in a meeting and saying things have improved in Ohio since 2007 would be laughed at," said Bob Rogers, an economics professor at Ashland University and former president of the Ohio Association of Economists and Political Scientists. Said Ken Mayland, an economic analyst who is president of Clear View Economics in Pepper Pike: "I think on the face of it that statement is blatantly false." Said George Zeller, a economic research analyst based in Cleveland: "When you look at it in terms of jobs, it’s kind of a bizarre statement actually." All three said the state’s employment record is clear — 5.65 million people employed in January 2007 when Strickland became governor and 5.32 million today -- a difference of 330,000 jobs. And they all said that is clearly the best way to measure the health of the state’s economy. "It’s a macromeasure," Mayland said. "When people are employed they are producing things." Our trio of experts were somewhat more split when asked if Ohio’s economy was on the mend. Mayland said he thought Ohio’s economy was definitely on the upswing. "I do believe that the Ohio economy is recovering, we are probably going to get a pretty big share of the national economic recovery," he said. "Manufacturing, in general, and the auto industry in particular, they are rebounding," he said. "But when I say they are recovering you have to keep in mind there had been permanent job loss that will never be recovered, so they won’t get back to their former selves." Professor Rogers agreed there has been a bit of a rebound in Ohio’s economy this year. "Steel has made a little bit of a recovery, but in the last month or two it’s backed down. The auto industry is better, but it’s certainly not back to where it was before the crash." Other outside experts have seen signs that Ohio’s economy is rebounding including the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which rated Ohio as having the fifth-fastest growing economy during the past 12 months. And personal income tax collections are up 5 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as well as sales tax collections over the past four months when both are compared to the same period a year ago. By far, the most pessimistic was Zeller who said that small gains in employment in Ohio that have been reported are a mirage caused by a faulty national modeling which has overestimated new firms being born. He predicted that the state’s employment figures will be downgraded by 86,000 in January when the national model is evaluated by federal officials erasing, the 15,000 or so jobs that Ohio has gained on paper in 2010. Instead, Ohio will have lost 70,000 jobs this year. "There is no evidence at all that Ohio has gained even one job in 2010," said Zeller. "Ohio is still losing jobs right now, so therefore the economy is not on the upswing. I will say that the rate at which we’re losing jobs has slowed dramatically." Zeller compared it to a football team that is getting destroyed, but manages to tack on a few points. "If the Browns are behind 48-0, and they kick a field goal, are things on the upswing?" he asked. "Well, yes, because they have three points now, but they are still way behind. That’s kind of the position the state’s economy is in." So add it all up, and what do we have: Sabety used an "economic dashboard" tool designed to show the trajectory the state is on to argue that the economy is on the mend and that the state’s economy is in better shape than when the Strickland administration took office in 2007. But the dashboard doesn’t go back to when Strickland first took office and is most useful as a way to figure out if the state’s revenue projections will stay on track, according to its creator. A trio of independent economic experts contacted by PolitiFact Ohio was somewhat split on the first part of Sabety’s statement -- whether the economy was "on the mend." There does seem to be evidence that Ohio’s economy is rebounding, although the gains in jobs in Ohio this year are either minimal or perhaps even a mirage caused by faulty modeling. All three of the experts contacted found the second part of Sabety’s claim, her assertion that Ohio’s economy was in better shape now than 2007, to be laughable, "blatantly false" and "bizarre." All three agree that employment is the best measure of a state’s economic health, and there are 330,000 fewer people are employed in Ohio now there were in 2007. Had her claim only been this assertion, we likely would have rated it Pants On Fire. Allowing for the evidence that Ohio’s economy is rebounding, we’ll give Sabety credit for the first part of her claim. But we take away points for the second part. We rate her statement that the economy is on the mend and that it is in better shape than when Strickland took office to be Half True.

pomt-05048	Gov. Rick Scott "tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls."	/florida/statements/2012/jul/10/moveon/moveon-says-gov-rick-scott-tried-kick-180000-peopl/	The liberal group MoveOn.org warned its supporters in a blistering email that Florida Gov. Rick Scott is engaged in voter suppression. The subject line: "Secret GOP plan revealed." "Republican Governor Rick Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls in his state and is now suing the Department of Justice after they stepped in to stop him," the June 27 fundraising email said. "Rick Scott's racist voter purge -- which directly targets Latino voters -- is so egregious that every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in the state -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- has so far refused to carry it out." MoveOn also has run TV ads in Florida (watch them here and here) about the state-led effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. Some of the email’s claims struck us as a bit off, so we decided to investigate. Here, we’ll fact-check whether Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls. In a related fact-check, we will explore whether every election supervisor has "refused" to carry out this project. The origins of the list Scott’s quest to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls began shortly after the governor took office in 2011. He asked the state’s chief elections official at the time, Kurt Browning, to look into whether noncitizens were illegally voting. Two departments, the Florida Department of State and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, compiled a list comparing voter registration information with driver's license data. It’s possible for a noncitizen to get a driver's license, but it’s illegal for a noncitizen to vote. So the agencies looked for noncitizen drivers to see if they had also registered to vote. There’s a catch there, though: The driver's license data is not updated when people become citizens, at least not until they need to renew their licenses. The state found 180,000 names that they considered potential noncitizens. But the state government itself does not have the power to remove people from the voting rolls -- that power lies with the local supervisors of elections. It’s important to note here that the state did not send all 180,000 names to the local supervisors. Instead, the state identified a much smaller subset of potential noncitizens and sent those names to the local supervisors in April. The first batch of about 1,200 names included people who get annual drivers' licenses because they are on work or student visas. Another 1,400 were the first ones that the state verified that names on the driver's license list and the voter registration list matched, said Chris Cate, a spokesman for the Florida Division of Elections. So that came to 2,600 names that the state sent to the local supervisors, not 180,000 names. The state gave supervisors a sample letter to send to the registered voters asking for proof of citizenship. If the voters failed to comply, state law indicated they would be removed from the voter rolls within one or two months. The largest contingent came from Miami-Dade County, which has a high foreign-born population. Democrats questioned the motives and timing of a Republican governor months before a presidential election. Republican leaders pointed out that it’s a felony for noncitizens to vote. A Miami Herald analysis determined that there were more Democrats than Republicans on the list and that about 58 percent were Hispanic. The feds step in And then the dueling lawsuits began. The U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to the state ordering it to halt its noncitizen purge on May 31. On June 11, the state Division of Elections filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, seeking access to the SAVE database, which contains information on noncitizens. The state had been trying to access that database for about a year. (MoveOn wrote that the state sued DOJ, but the state actually sued DHS.) The next day, June 12, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against Florida. On June 27, a U.S. District Court Judge denied the DOJ’s request for a restraining order. But that wasn’t really a game-changer, because the state hadn’t sent additional names to counties after April. By late June, many counties had either finished or halted the process. (See our related factcheck here.) Before and after the feds got involved, state officials left open the possibility that they might send additional names from the list of 180,000 to the counties. "When we are able to improve the information we have from the driver’s license database by accessing SAVE, we will begin sending additional names to supervisors," Cate told PolitiFact in an email. We asked MoveOn specifically about the 180,000 number being overblown. MoveOn spokesman Nick Berning said that the 180,000 are "at risk" of being thrown off the rolls. "Florida’s State Department of Elections has disclosed that it has a list of 180,000 people that was assembled in connection with the purge, which is why the U.S. Justice Department has written that the purge ‘may ultimately target more than 180,000 voters.’ … To clarify, our intention was to identify for our members the large number of voters that are at risk of being purged off the rolls, and we will endeavor to use language that more accurately explains this as we continue our campaign to protect voters from this discriminatory purge." Our ruling MoveOn.org said, "Republican Governor Rick Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls in his state...." The 180,000 was the state’s starting point for gathering data on potential noncitizens. But the state forwarded less than 2 percent of that list -- about 2,600 -- to the counties for further review. Also, state officials were careful to say that the list was "potential" noncitizens and asked counties to contact those registered voters for proof of citizenship. That means the county officials had the power to decide whether anyone should be kicked off the list. MoveOn wildly exaggerated the number of voters that Scott tried to "kick off" -- it wasn’t close to 180,000. It was 2,600. If the state had forwarded the full list of 180,000 names, or even close to that number, MoveOn would have been on more solid ground. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03469	Wisconsin is "not walking away from a dime" in federal funds by rejecting the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/15/kitty-rhoades/wisconsin-not-leaving-any-federal-funds-table-reje/	Gov. Scott Walker announced in February 2013 that Wisconsin would refuse what has been portrayed as a financial windfall for state governments -- an expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare that would be financed almost completely with federal funds. Democrats have ripped the Republican governor, with some citing estimates that his proposed alternative will cost Wisconsin state taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet four months after the announcement, Walker's secretary of health services, Kitty Rhoades, painted a different financial picture. Many people had said, "Why did you walk away from all of the money on the table?" the former GOP state lawmaker told a business-sponsored health care seminar in Madison on June 6, 2013. "Which is a line that just drives me insane." Later in the speech, Rhoades added: "We believe and we know that based off of our modeling, we’re not walking away from a dime. We actually will have more federal dollars flowing through the state of Wisconsin than we would have had by taking the enhanced rate of including people of 133 percent of federal poverty level into Medicaid." So, despite estimates that state government is losing out on hundreds of millions of dollars, is it the case that ""we’re not walking away from a dime" in federal funds? The wording of Rhoades' claim is key. Medicaid and its expansion Medicaid, a federal- and state-run health care program for the poor, serves more than 1.1 million people in the Badger State. Federal taxpayers pick up about 60 percent of the cost in Wisconsin. But President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act offers an even larger share of federal funding if states make more people eligible for Medicaid, starting in 2014. From 2014 through 2016, Uncle Sam would pay 100 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage for adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that means an income of $15,282; for a family of four, it's $31,322. After 2016, the federal share would gradually decline until it reaches 90 percent in 2020, with the states picking up the remaining cost. That gives the appearance of a lot of federal money going to state governments. And indeed, that’s what the experts say will happen. The number crunchers Walker himself has acknowledged the federal government is offering more money to states that do the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. But he says that because of the federal budget deficit, he believes the federal government won't follow through on the promised funds. That, of course, remains to be seen. What is clear from budget experts is the State of Wisconsin is, in fact, giving up federal funds by declining the Medicaid expansion. (Although, with the state budget due to be adopted in a matter of days, the top Democrat in the state Senate held out hope that a compromise might be reached to at least give the Obamacare Medicaid expansion a try.) A week before Rhoades’ speech, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which both political parties have long cited as a neutral scorekeeper on budget matters, weighed in. For the 2013-2015 state budget, currently being debated in the Legislature, opting out of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion would cost state taxpayers $119 million, the fiscal bureau estimated. The total could exceed $459 million through 2021, the bureau said. Similar findings were produced a few days later by RAND Corp., a California-based independent think tank. According to its study (subscription required), Wisconsin and 13 other states that said, as of late April 2013, they won't do the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, would forgo $8.4 billion per year in federal payments. So, what is Rhoades talking about? Rhoades’ evidence Her spokeswoman, Stephanie Smiley, said Rhoades doesn't dispute the fiscal bureau's estimates of state government losing out on hundreds of millions of dollars by not expanding Medicaid through Obamacare. Rhoades instead cites a different flow of federal funds. She argues that under Walker's alternative, even more federal money will come to Wisconsin -- but to health insurance companies and health care providers, rather than state coffers. Walker's plan expands Medicaid eligibility to people with incomes at 100 percent of the poverty level, but not to 133 percent, as Obamacare would do. Under the governor's plan, people with incomes between 100 and 133 percent of poverty would get health coverage from private insurers through "exchanges," another feature of Obamacare. Citing the fiscal bureau report, Rhoades notes the federal government would give the state a total of $489 million during the 2013-2015 budget cycle if it agreed to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. But she contends that "modeling" done by her department -- not the fiscal bureau -- projects that under Walker's alternative, $776 million to $784 million in federal money would flow into Wisconsin during that period. It would subsidize premiums and health care for people who go into the exchanges. The problem here is that the fiscal bureau can make solid estimates knowing how many people would be eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare. But the Department of Health Services has to guess how many people will buy insurance through the exchanges and thus bring federal dollars into Wisconsin. That's a difficult calculation, given that the fiscal bureau has determined many people eligible for coverage through the exchanges will decide they can't afford it. In fact, the fiscal bureau has said the Walker administration is "unreasonably optimistic" on the question. So, it's unclear whether Walker's plan will result in more federal money coming to Wisconsin insurers and health care providers than would be paid to the state under the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid. What is clear, is Walker's alternative to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion comes at a cost to state taxpayers of $119 million in 2013-2015 alone -- which is the criticism Rhoades was trying to refute. Our rating Responding to criticism that state taxpayers are taking a financial hit because Walker chose not to expand Medicaid through Obamacare, Rhoades claimed "we’re not walking away from a dime" in federal funds. There's an element of truth in her claim, in that under Walker's alternative plan, some level of federal funds will flow to Wisconsin insurers and health care providers based on the number of people who choose to buy health insurance through Obamacare exchanges. But the criticism focused on the impact on state government by not taking the Obamacare offer -- $119 million just in the next two years, a figure Rhoades doesn't dispute. Because of that, we rate her claim Mostly False.	None	Kitty Rhoades	None	None	None	2013-06-15T06:00:00	2013-06-06	['None']

pomt-02033	"This generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they’ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/04/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-claims-college-students-graduate-300/	Tammy Baldwin has the younger generation’s future in her sights as she looks to the burden of student loan debt weighing on college graduates. "This generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they’ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt. And it’s going to impact our economy, our future," Baldwin said May 8, 2014 on the Devil’s Advocate show on Madison radio. A week later, Baldwin announced her support for a bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) that would allow borrowers to refinance student loans at an interest rate of 3.86 percent, much lower than most federal loan options. With graduation season in full swing, we thought we’d take a look. Studies show seven out of every 10 college graduates has student loan debt, but is Baldwin right about the $30,000 figure and that it affects an entire generation? Spokesman John Kraus said Baldwin’s source was a December 2013 report from the Institute for College Access & Success, an independent, nonprofit group that tracks student loan debt by state. The California-based group advocates for more available and affordable higher education. Various funders support its efforts, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Ford Foundation. To complete its 2012 report, the institute relied on federal data and a survey sent to colleges through Peterson’s, a college guide publishing company. The report says the average debt nationally for those 2012 graduates who took out loans was $29,400. Among Wisconsin graduates, the average debt was $28,102, the nation’s 14th highest. So Baldwin’s claim was pretty on target for both national and state levels. The debt itself, however, varies widely by state, from $18,000 to $33,650, and even more so by college, from $4,450 to $49,450. The likelihood for graduating seniors to have debt after college also stretches from 41 percent to 78 percent depending on the state. But the report itself notes its data offers an incomplete picture because only about half of all public and private nonprofit four-year colleges reported their student-loan debt figures 2012. That can skew the results. Additionally, the figures don’t differentiate between federal or private loans. Private loans make up one fifth of overall student loan debt, which colleges cannot document as easily. And no for-profit colleges are included because none reported their debt figures, while the report shows they have the most borrowers at 88 percent. They also rack up the highest debt at an average of $39,950 per borrower. "Colleges that accurately calculate and report each year’s debt figures rightfully complain that colleges may have students with higher average debt but fail to update their figures, under-report actual debt levels, or never report figures at all," the report says. What it means for the Class of 2014 Other studies show a slightly different picture. A study released in May 2014 by the National Conference on State Legislatures concluded that 2014 graduates with student loans will owe an average of $26,500, somewhat lower than what Baldwin cited. Another study released in May 2014 by Edvisors, a network of websites that offer insight on ways to pay for college, analyzed data from the National Center for Education Statistics to conclude that borrowers would graduate with an average of $33,000 in debt. This led a Wall Street Journal article on the study to call the class of 2014 : "the most indebted class ever." State legislatures instituted tuition freezes and increased funding last year that have slowed down the rise in tuition that began in the early 1980s, which another NCSL study shows is a major factor in a decrease in student loan debt. Outstanding student loan debt also totaled $1.7 trillion in the third quarter of last year to surpass credit card, mortgage, and auto debt as the fastest growing portion of debt since 2008, according to a recent study from the Federal Reserve of New York. The study shows students struggle to pay back these loans that also have the highest delinquency rate -- 11.5 percent of loan balances are more than 90 days delinquent or in default. A final note: while the amount of student loan debt continues to soar, its rate of growth decreased from 12 percent in early 2012 to 8.25 percent in late 2013, according to the Federal Reserve. This led them to conclude that "the more-rapid expansion" of student loan debt in early 2012 has not been as fast this past year. All this research undermines Baldwin’s point. The level of college debt is a moving target. While Baldwin painted the $30,000 figure as affecting a generation of students, the data she cited is limited to a specific graduating class. And studies show three of every 10 graduates finish without student loan debt. Our rating Baldwin claimed that "this generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they’ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt." While she cites a figure from a legitimate source, that data has limitations that are not acknowledged. Notably, about half of the colleges were not included in the data used to create the state-by-state breakdown. Additionally, the national figure is for 2012 and more recent studies show a more mixed picture and in some cases suggest the level may be lower. We rate her statement Half True. (Note: This item was changed June 5, 2014 to clarify the source of data used to calculate the average student-loan debt and that additional, more recent studies show the debt level may be lower, not decreasing.)

pomt-09351	"I never considered myself a maverick."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/06/john-mccain/mccains-ultimate-maverick-move-denial/	During the 2008 presidential campaign, Republican nominee John McCain was so closely identified with the term "maverick" that it became a national punchline. On the Oct. 4, 2008, edition of Saturday Night Live, Tina Fey reprised her famed imitation of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, closing an opening skit spoofing the vice presidential debate with the line, "Oh, and for those Joe Six-packs out there playing a drinking game at home: 'Maverick.' " So it came as a surprise to us when McCain was quoted on Newsweek magazine's website on April 3, 2010, saying, "I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." Debunking this one wasn't a question of "if" but rather "how can we avoid piling on?" We ignored cases in which Palin or other campaign surrogates used the term on McCain's behalf, sticking instead to instances when McCain himself used it, or when he blessed television advertisements using that term with the words, "I approve this message." (This message, by the way, is a requirement of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which McCain himself spearheaded.) Here are the instances we found: • "A maverick, John McCain tackled campaign reform, military reform, spending reform. He took on presidents, partisans and popular opinion. He believes our world is dangerous, our economy in shambles. John McCain doesn`t always tell us what we hope to hear. Beautiful words cannot make your lives better, but a man who has always put his country and her people before self, before politics can. Don`t hope for a better life, vote for one. McCain." -- "Love" campaign ad, July 7, 2008 • "He reformed Wall Street, battled big oil, made America prosper again. He's the original maverick. One is ready to lead -- McCain." -- "Broken" campaign ad, Aug. 5, 2008 • "The original mavericks. He fights pork barrel spending. She stopped the 'Bridge to Nowhere.' He took on the drug industry. She took on big oil. He battled Republicans and reformed Washington. She battles Republicans and reformed Alaska. They'll make history. They'll change Washington. McCain/Palin: real change." -- "Original Mavericks" campaign ad, Sept. 7, 2008 • “If you want real reform and you want change, send a team of mavericks." -- campaign appearance in Colorado Springs, Colo., Sept. 6, 2008 • "And what 'maverick' really means, what this team of mavericks really means is we understand who we work for. We don't work for the party, and we don't work for a special interest, and we don't work for ourselves. We'll work for you and the American people." --campaign appearance in Lancaster, Pa., Sept. 9, 2008 • "Stand by, because change is coming. And real change is coming to Washington, D.C. And we're going to shake things up. And you've got a team of mavericks, a team of mavericks." -- campaign appearance in Lebanon, Ohio, Sept. 9, 2008 • "Can I just mention one other thing? You know there's now this going around that there's differences between myself and Sarah Palin. We're very close. We're both mavericks." -- interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Oct. 28, 2008 • "When two mavericks join up, we don't agree on everything, but that is a lot of fun." -- campaign appearance in Hershey, Pa., Oct. 28, 2008 • "We get along fine. Sarah is a maverick. I'm a maverick. No one expected us to agree on everything." -- interview with CNN's Larry King, Oct. 30, 2008 And finally: • Worth the Fighting For: The Education of an American Maverick, and the Heroes Who Inspired Him -- book by John McCain and Mark Salter, published 2003 In McCain's (slight) defense, we should say that he has on a number of occasions expressed a degree of ambivalence about the title "maverick" -- including his highest-profile use of the word, in his 2008 Republican National Convention acceptance speech. “You know, I’ve been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum," he said. "Sometimes it’s meant as a compliment and sometimes it’s not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don’t work for a party. I don’t work for a special interest. I don’t work for myself. I work for you.” Meanwhile, in the prologue to the book that used "maverick" in the subtitle, McCain wrote, "I'm 64 years old as we begin this book, which seems a bit old to be routinely described as a maverick. American popular culture admits few senior citizens to its ranks of celebrated nonconformists. We lack the glamorous carelessness of youth and risk becoming parodies of our younger selves. Witnessing the behavior can make people uncomfortable, like watching an aging, overweight Elvis mock the memory of the brash young man who had swaggered across cultural color lines." That's not exactly an aggressive embrace of the term. But even if McCain is now listening more closely to his inner ambivalence about the term, it cannot erase the eagerness with which his 2008 presidential campaign touted that particular characteristic as a major selling point for candidacy. So we rate his statement that "I never considered myself a maverick" to be Pants on Fire!	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2010-04-06T18:51:46	2010-04-03	['None']

pomt-05625	"Every poll you see, the overwhelming majority of people want [E-Verify]."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/25/peter-palumbo/rhode-island-state-rep-peter-palumbo-says-all-poll/	State Rep. Peter G. Palumbo was on WHJJ’s "Helen Glover Show" recently to talk about his latest attempt to crack down on illegal immigration in Rhode Island. The Cranston Democrat has submitted legislation in the General Assembly that would require companies with three or more employees to check on the immigration status of any job applicants using the federal E-Verify database. During his talk-radio appearance March 20, Palumbo told Glover that not only is E-Verify the "simplest way to curb illegal immigration," it’s also a program that has broad public support. "Every poll you see, the overwhelming majority of people want the bill," he said. Does E-Verify really have such overwhelming support? E-Verify is a federal government program that allows companies to check on a worker’s immigration status through an online database. The program compares information on the worker’s Form I-9 to records from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. If the records match, there’s no problem. If the records don’t match, the worker may be in the country illegally. When we asked Palumbo to show us some polls on E-Verify, he referred to only one, conducted a year ago by Brown University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy & American Institutions. We found that poll, but it didn’t ask any questions about E-Verify. The closest was a question about the controversial law in Arizona that requires local police forces to enforce federal immigration laws. Fifty-four percent of the Rhode Islanders in the survey were in favor of such a law. We did our own research and found many polls that asked about a variety of illegal- immigration questions, but few that asked specifically about E-Verify. The one poll that supporters of E-Verify around the country most frequently cite was conducted by Rasmussen Reports, a nationally recognized polling firm. That poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted May 27-28, 2011. The poll asked this question: "The federal government maintains an E-Verify system which allows employers to determine the immigration status of potential employees. Before hiring a new employee, should businesses be required to check and make sure that each potential employee is in the country legally?" Eighty-two percent of respondents answered yes, 12 percent said no and the remaining 6 percent were undecided. That is an overwhelming majority in favor of E-Verify. But that’s only one poll. What about others? NumbersUSA, a group that opposes illegal immigration and also advocates for limits on legal immigration, last month released the results of a poll it commissioned from Pulse Opinion Research, a subsidiary of Rasmussen Research. The poll asked: "On the issue of illegal immigration, do you favor or oppose mandating that all employers electronically verify the immigration status of their workers?" Seventy-eight percent were in favor, 12 percent were opposed and 9 percent were unsure. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, another group opposed to illegal immigration that also seeks to curb legal immigration, released the results last year of a poll it also commissioned from Pulse Opinion Research. According to FAIR, 88 percent of respondents supported the use of an "electronic verification system to check worker eligibility," while 11 percent were opposed. A 2010 poll of 616 Arizona residents conducted by The Arizona Republic newspaper found that 66 percent supported a state law that would require employers "to prove that all their workers are U.S. citizens or have valid work visas." As for Rhode Island, we found two polls, both conducted in 2008 by Rhode Island College’s Bureau of Government Research and Services, that asked voters about then-Gov. Donald Carcieri’s executive order to use E-Verify to screen state workers and employees of companies that do business with the state. In the first poll, done that June, 75 percent of the 500 Rhode Islanders in the survey agreed with the governor’s order. In the second poll the following September, 73 percent agreed with it. Our ruling Palumbo said that "every poll" shows "overwhelming support" for E-Verify. Obviously, we can’t guarantee that we found every poll on E-Verify. But we did find several, some conducted by independent pollsters, others financed by groups that favor stronger enforcement of immigration laws. All of the polls that we found -- both national surveys and others conducted in Rhode Island -- showed strong support for E-Verify, ranging from 66 percent of respondents in favor to 88 percent. We rule Palumbo’s statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-07905	Says there are "a half a trillion dollars in cuts to Medicare that are going to go in place" as a result of health care reform.	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/02/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renacci-characterizes-medicare-savings-hea/	Less than a week after taking office as a member of Congress, GOP Rep. Jim Renacci held his first town hall meeting at Walsh University in North Canton. Local news reports indicated about 225 people attended, some of whom grilled Renacci about his campaign pledge to overturn the health care reform bill that Congress adopted last year. In an exchange between Renacci and a senior citizen identified as Dan Fonte, Fonte cites facets of the the health care bill that he approves of, and asks Renacci why Republicans don’t present a replacement plan for people to examine before the repeal vote. Renacci replies that he and more than 80 other freshmen Republicans were elected to Congress with pledges to repeal the new law. "I agree with you, there are some good things, but there are also a half a trillion dollars in cuts to Medicare that are going to go in place," Renacci told Fonte. That statement had a familiar ring to it. We decided it was one worth another look. Renacci’s exchange with his constituent hit on the same themes as the health care debate in 2010. And more than once during the election season we looked at the claims from Republicans and groups that opposed the reforms that the health care package would cut $500 billion from Medicare. But it’s important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, as Renacci and the bill’s foes make it sound. Rather, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act slows the program’s projected growth in Medicare spending by about $500 billion over 10 years. That’s a big difference. Medicare spending will still increase. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated it will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. About $136 billion in savings is projected to come from Medicare Advantage, an optional program where the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients. About a quarter of Medicare recipients were enrolled in the Medicare Advantage plans in 2010, which often offer benefits like dental and vision coverage that aren’t available to traditional Medicare beneficiaries. It was hoped that competition between private insurers for Medicare Advantage programs would drive down costs and make the system more efficient, ultimately saving the federal government money. But it has not worked out that way. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than traditional Medicare. The health care law that President Barack Obama signed in March will phase out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The law aims to save the Medicare program another $220 billion by reducing annual payment increases health care providers would otherwise get. More savings would come from requiring seniors with yearly incomes over $85,000, or $170,000 for couples, to pay higher Medicare premiums. PolitiFact examined repeated claims by politicians and interest groups in 2010 that the health care reform bill would cut Medicare by $500 billion, including one by the 60 Plus Association in an attack ad against Renacci’s election opponent, Democrat John Boccieri. Each time the claim was found to be Barely True, no matter who or where it was uttered. Neither a new year, nor the GOP takeover of the House of Representatives makes it any more accurate. We still rate the claim as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08376	Says "Scott Walker favors cutting up to 350,000 families and children off health care."	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/25/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/scott-walker-wants-kick-350000-families-badgercare/	In his quest for the Republican nomination for governor, Scott Walker offered a consistent answer when asked for examples of how he would cut taxes and trim the state budget. His answer: Start by limiting the time Wisconsinites can stay on BadgerCare Plus, the state health care program At least, that was the answer up until a few weeks before Walker trounced Mark Neumann in the Sept. 14, 2010 primary. In a new campaign ad, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Political Fund is aiming to make Walker pay for his earlier position. In the ad, as an iPhone replica flashes onto the screen, a narrator asks: "Don’t you wish there was an app that told you when politicians were lying?" Then a knockoff of PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter fills the screen, as Walker is rated on three sound bites. (Sure, imitation is a form of flattery. But we’re in real danger of being over-flattered this election.) "I support BadgerCare," Walker says in one of the three. The needle jumps to False as the narrator snarls: "Fact, Walker favors cutting up to 350,000 families and children off health care." We’ll look at the 350,000 charge, not Walker’s pronouncement of support. The Greater Wisconsin Committee made the same claim in an ad that started Sept. 2. The group is a political action committee that gets big money from organized labor, the Democratic Governors’ Association and at least $1 million from outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle’s soon-to-be defunct campaign fund. Needless to say, the group is backing Democrat Tom Barrett as Doyle’s replacement. So, does Scott Walker support tossing hundreds of thousands of people off BadgerCare? The answer would have been easier -- and the group’s charge more accurate -- a few months ago. First, a little about BadgerCare. The program, targeted to the working poor and low-income unemployed, provides health insurance coverage to children, pregnant women, parents and childless adults. Its rolls have swelled dramatically -- to 767,910 in September 2010 -- due to eligibility expansions and the fallout of the recession. Walker voted for the program when he served in the state Assembly. After a late-August primary debate with Neumann, in which Walker reiterated his support for time limits, Walker backed off that position. Walker told the Journal Sentinel’s Patrick Marley the next day that he had "misspoke" in saying he endorsed BadgerCare time limits -- he said he meant time limits on W-2, the state’s welfare-to-work program. The Journal Sentinel reported that story on page 1 on Aug. 27, 2010. To back up its claim that "up to 350,000 families and children" would lose coverage, the Greater Wisconsin Committee cites a lengthy Appleton Post-Crescent interview of Walker from June 2010 -- and several other public statements. It also points to state BadgerCare data -- provided by the state to us for this item -- showing more than 350,000 individuals now on BadgerCare have stayed longer than the 24 months Walker has discussed. That’s fine, but Walker’s position on it clearly has changed -- even if the group’s charge has not. So, let’s dig in again. PolitiFact Wisconsin listened to hours of Walker media interviews and concluded that over 11 months he unequivocally endorsed time limits in response to BadgerCare questions time and again. In the Appleton interview in June he suggested a 24-month limit. But since the late August debate, Walker instead has emphasized possible tighter income rules and sounds open to dropping low-income childless adults from the program. That group was just added to the program in 2009; there are more than 50,000 enrolled. In addition, Walker has made vague statements about getting back to the "original intent" of BadgerCare, which he defines as for the "truly needy like the disabled, children from low-income families and low-income single parents." Walker says the state’s exploding Medicaid population has put BadgerCare in a financial crisis. The new, mushier position makes quantifying the true impact of Walker’s position very difficult. The Greater Wisconsin Committee says the language in its ad is still supported by the facts. Of course, with the "up to" qualifier, that leaves an awful lot of room. Some numbers: If you tighten up recent changes that made it easier to qualify, you would knock 68,000 people off the program, according to calculations by Jon Peacock, a researcher who studies state welfare issues at the liberal Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. If you go back to pre-2008, before Doyle consolidated several programs into BadgerCare and made other changes, there were 267,000 fewer people on the program than today. There are 400,000 people in working families on BadgerCare. Walker objects to BadgerCare insurance being a permanent entitlement. Does that mean he objects to people continuing in the program once they get a job? His campaign declined to be specific beyond saying Walker thinks it ought to cover the truly needy like the disabled, children from low-income families and low-income single parents. The numbers above include a lot of children. That may not be fair, given that Walker said in the Post-Crescent interview that he wants to "make sure kids are covered." But it is unclear if Walker means all children currently eligible or just those of unemployed parents. A lot of questions and few answers. Peacock said it best: "I think it’s very hard to quantify how much Walker might affect BadgerCare participation – partly because his statements have either been vague or fluid, and partly because it sounds like he might reduce eligibility below the level initially recommended by Governor Thompson." The target may be moving, but the Truth-O-Meter has to stop somewhere. The Greater Wisconsin Committee charges that Walker’s original position could move as many as 350,000 people -- or fewer -- off BadgerCare. Their claim rested primarily on the time limits that Walker supported for almost a year but then backed away from just days before Greater Wisconsin’s first ad in September. Walker changed course to a muddier position, while Greater Wisconsin has continued to cite the number. It adds an important qualifier though -- "up to" 350,000. Walker’s new position, while unclear, still focuses on reining in BadgerCare enrollment -- whether it’s the 68,000 or some other number remains to be seen. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-01207	Says "93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks."	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/25/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-93-black-murders-committed-blacks/	This is a case where a statistic is accurate, but it doesn't address key elements in the bigger picture. The turmoil in Ferguson, Mo., has spurred a lot of talk about what has gone wrong in America. Some say it reveals core problems in the criminal justice system and policing. Others believe it points to problems in the black community itself. One vocal spokesman for the second approach is former New York mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani. When NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd brought up the number of cities where the police departments are mainly white while the communities they serve are mainly minority (as in Ferguson), Giuliani aimed to take the conversation in a different direction. "I find it very disappointing that you're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks," Giuliani said in his Nov. 23, 2014, appearance on the show. His point was that the death of a black teenager at the hands of a white cop was "the exception," and if the country is concerned about black homicides, then it would do better to focus on African Americans. We will set the larger questions aside and deal simply with Giuliani’s statistic about black homicides. He accurately recites a federal statistic, but he would almost equally be right if he were talking about white homicides at the hands of other whites. On the other hand, blacks do suffer from higher murder rates than whites. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, 93 percent of black homicides were indeed committed by other blacks between 1980 and 2008. In 2012, the most recent data posted on the web, the figure was 91 percent. This overlooks many deaths because it’s only possible to gather this information when a crime leads to a conviction and some cases are never solved. It’s important to note that whites were almost equally likely to be killed by other whites. According to government data, 84 percent of white homicides were committed by whites. This was true between 1980 and 2008 and in 2012. The last time we looked at this topic, we asked Professor David M. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, why this might be. "Homicides overwhelmingly happen among people who know each other," Kennedy said. "There are relatively few absolutely straight-up stranger homicides. Homicide is a phenomenon of social networks. ... Most peoples’ relationships are primarily with someone of their own race or ethnicity. As long as anybody has studied homicide, this has been the pattern." So Giuliani’s point about black-on-black homicide doesn’t carry us very far in exploring murder in America. The percentage is higher for blacks than for whites, but only by seven to nine percentage points, depending on the time period you use. We did find that young black men, ages 14 to 24, suffer disproportionately from murder. While the numbers have been falling since the mid-1990s, in 2008 about 16 percent of homicide victims were young and black. As a group, they represented just 1 percent of the population. Young white men were also disproportionately at risk, but the situation was not quite as dire. They comprised about 6 percent of the population and 10 percent of murder victims. On the offender side, young black men accounted for 27 percent of everyone who committed murder in 2008. Young white men accounted for 16 percent. Our ruling Giuliani said that 93 percent of blacks are murdered by blacks. That’s in line with federal statistics. However, it actually tells us little about violence in black communities. The percentage of whites killed by whites is only about seven percentage points lower. The strong historical trend is that in a society with persistent pockets of segregation, most homicide occurs within each ethnic group. Giuliani’s claim is accurate but needs clarification.

pomt-01938	Says Scott Brown voted with President Barack Obama 70 percent of the time in 2011.	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/jun/25/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-claims-fellow-republican-scott-brown-vo/	When New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens came face-to-face with Scott Brown in the race for a U.S. Senate seat, Rubens didn’t waste any time going on the attack. "In 2011, you voted with president Obama 70 percent of the time," Rubens said to Brown, his GOP primary opponent, in his opening remarks during a June 20, 2014, forum televised on WMUR-TV. It was a line that underscored criticism from Brown’s opponents about the strength of Brown’s conservative beliefs. Brown has touted his bipartisan credentials in the past, and while representing Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate from 2010-2012, Brown developed a track record as one of the lawmakers most willing to reach across the aisle. But did Brown really support Democratic President Barack Obama’s agenda 70 percent of the time, as Rubens stated? This isn’t the first time a candidate’s record of support for Obama has been invoked in the U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire. For instance, Brown has claimed several times that the Democrat who currently holds the seat, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, voted with Obama 99 percent of the time. PolitiFact New Hampshire previously ruled that claim Mostly True, based on research conducted by the publication Congressional Quarterly. In its annual Vote Studies, CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is an examination of presidential support, or the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills on which the sitting president has staked a position. The 2011 CQ analysis found that, out of the pool of votes on which Obama took a clear position that year, Brown’s vote matched the president’s stance 69.6 percent of the time. That score is in line with the claim Rubens made. Out of all Republicans in the Senate, only Maine Sen. Susan Collins recorded a higher presidential support score that year, based on CQ’s analysis. Brown’s presidential support score was somewhat lower during his first year in office. In 2010, CQ determined, Brown supported Obama’s positions about 60.7 percent of the time. The number rose to about 78 percent during Brown’s final year in office in 2012. It’s important to note that there are limitations to gauging any politician’s support for the president based solely on the small number of votes represented in the CQ analysis. In 2011, for example, the Senate took 235 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on only 89 of those votes, most of which were taken on presidential nominations. After he was criticized by Rubens, Brown pointed out that he was proud to join Obama in supporting pieces of legislation such as the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which provides tax incentives for businesses that hire unemployed veterans. Brown’s campaign also pointed out that Brown’s presidential support score in the 2011 CQ analysis placed him midway between the average Republican and average Democrat in the Senate. According to CQ’s figures, the average Senate Republican voted with the president 53 percent of the time, while the average Democrat supported the president 92 percent of the time. Our ruling Rubens said that when Brown was serving in the U.S. Senate in 2011, Brown voted with President Obama 70 percent of the time. In 2011, Brown took the same position as the president 69.6 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. Rounding off, Rubens was right on the money. But it’s important to note the president doesn’t take a clear position on all legislation and outlined his position on only 38 percent of the roll call votes taken in 2011. Overall, the number is accurate, but needs additional clarification. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Jim Rubens	None	None	None	2014-06-25T11:49:19	2014-06-20	['None']
pomt-11265	The nuclear deal gave Iran "$150 billion, giving $1.8 billion in cash — in actual cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-150-billion-and-18-billion-c/	In a wide ranging phone call to Fox & Friends, President Donald Trump repeated his objection to the 2015 nuclear agreement that rolled back Iran’s nuclear program. "The past administration made a horrible deal giving $150 billion," Trump said April 26 on the Fox News morning show. "Giving $1.8 billion in cash — in actual cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes." Of the two numbers he gave, $150 billion and $1.8 billion, the first is dodgy and the second is slightly exaggerated. And there’s no evidence that barrels and boxes were involved. We reached out to the White House and will add their response when it arrives. The $150 billion The 2015 agreement freed up Iranian assets that had been frozen under sanctions. Called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal included Iran and the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. The agreement only affected sanctions imposed to punish Iran for its nuclear program. Iran has other assets that remain frozen. Some conservatives have put the amount released after lifted sanctions as high as $150 billion, which is the highest of estimates we have seen. Another estimate from Iran’s Central Bank topped out at about $29 billion in readily available funds, with another $45 billion tied up in Chinese investment projects and the foreign assets of the Iran’s Oil Ministry. After talking with officials at Iran’s Central Bank, Nader Habibi, professor of economics of the Middle East at Brandeis University, believes the actual total is between $25 billion and $50 billion. In July 2015, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told lawmakers Iran would gain access to $56 billion. It’s important to know that little of that money was under the control of the United States or any U.S. bank. Most of it, Habibi said, was in central and commercial banks overseas. Furthermore, it was Iran’s money to begin with, not a payment from any government to buy Iran’s cooperation. The $1.8 billion The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, reviewed this cash transfer in a 2018 report. It gave a total of $1.7 billion. That was the amount that U.S. and Iranian negotiators settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment, and it was never delivered. As of 1990, there were $400 million in that account. Negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount, which is a lot of money — but 25 years is a long time for interest to build up the balance. The United States sent the money to Iran in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies. Trump embellished when he mentioned barrels and boxes. Reports at the time said the money was packed and loaded onto pallets, similar to how other bulk goods are shipped. Our ruling Trump said that the nuclear deal with Iran gave the country $150 billion, including $1.8 billion from the United States in cash. The $150 billion is the highest estimate we've seen, and the one with the least evidence to support it. The high-end estimate from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2015 was $56 billion, and outside analysts believe the number could be lower. The $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. The official amount is $1.7 billion. However, there’s no evidence that barrels and boxes were involved. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03772	Says "94 percent of (Marco Rubio's) constituents support a universal background check."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/02/mark-kelly/mark-kelly-says-94-percent-floridians-support-univ/	Former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of Arizona shooting victim Gabby Giffords, said that while "gun control" doesn’t poll very well, there’s "incredible momentum" to pass a universal background check law. Never mind five Republican senators, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who say that they’re going to filibuster any new "Second Amendment restrictions." "I would say to Marco Rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check," Kelly told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on March 31, 2013. National polls this year show strong support for universal background checks, from Pew Research Center’s 85 percent to Quinnipiac University’s 92 percent. We wondered, is it true that 94 percent of Floridians —who share their state with NRA superlobbyist Marion Hammer and a Stand Your Ground law — favor universal background checks? The polls We reached out to Kelly and Gifford’s advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, but didn’t immediately hear back. Still, we quickly found a poll supporting Kelly’s "94 percent" figure. It came from a group co-chaired by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The February survey of 600 voters was conducted by the polling firm of Democratic consultant Doug Schoen. We wouldn’t call that an independent survey. However, Quinnipiac University conducted state surveys in March. And its poll of 1,000 registered voters found 91 percent support for universal background checks. The question: "Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?" That also supports Kelly’s "94 percent" claim — within the Quinnipiac poll’s 3.1 percentage point margin of error. It’s also decent evidence that Floridians are in line with the country on expanding background checks from just sales by federally licensed dealers to sales between private sellers, sometimes referred to as closing the "gun show loophole" or "private seller loophole." Even among Florida Republicans, the Quinnipiac poll showed 87 percent support. Rubio hasn’t been so clear. In January, he gave an interview that made it sound like he was open to universal checks. ("I think you'll find support for that so long as there's not a public database that people can look up and see who owns what guns and where they live.") Then his spokesman clarified he wasn’t. ("Expanding it to private sales is problematic because you are asking an individual to conduct a background check on another individual. That is expensive and hard to do, and he does not support that.") His most recent statement doesn’t endorse background checks and opposes "new Second Amendment restrictions." Our ruling Kelly said "94 percent of (Rubio's) constituents support a universal background check." A major state poll conducted in March shows 91 percent of Florida voters favor requiring checks "for all gun buyers." Kelly’s claim is within the poll’s margin of error. We rate his statement True.

pomt-02071	Milwaukee has seen "an uptick in violence" since 2010, and "the only period of calm we get is when winter sets in."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/23/david-clarke-jr/sheriff-clarke-cites-violent-crime-uptick-2010/	Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. hasn’t declared himself a candidate for mayor or county executive, but he continues to expand his critique of Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and County Executive Chris Abele. After at least 12 people were wounded and three died in shootings during the city’s "Ceasefire Week," Clarke ripped Barrett as a do-nothing mayor in the face of stubbornly high poverty and joblessness, then labeled Abele a know-nothing on crime strategies. The sheriff, who stands for re-election later this year, added a statistical layer to his reaction to the shootings in a statement to reporters. "This uptick in violence is not new. It has been going on since 2010. The only period of calm we get is when winter sets in," the statement said. "The reason crime and violence rise in the summer is NOT due to the hot weather, leading to short tempers, like so many think. It rises in summer months because you have more human interaction due to more people being on the streets enjoying what little summer we have." There’s little doubt about summer being too short. But is "violence" up since 2010, with the only let up in the winter? To get at the question, we examined the trend in homicides, non-fatal shootings and the broader violent-crime index by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That index includes homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Homicides After a sharp drop in 2008 and 2009, homicides were at their lowest count since the 1980s. Then they jumped in 2010 from 72 to 95. The figure fell in 2011, but rose in 2012 and 2013, when 105 were recorded. That put the total back to where it was in 2007, shortly before Chief Edward Flynn was sworn in as Milwaukee’s chief. Of the 31 total zip codes that make up the City of Milwaukee, the majority of homicides last year occurred in four, the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission reported -- 53212 (14%), 53204 (14%), 53209 (13%) and 53206 (11%). Milwaukee saw a surge of of 33 homicides in just two months in 2013, August and September. Non-fatal shootings The trend is similar to homicides, but not identical. The number of people wounded by firearms dropped 35 percent between 2006, when it was 621, and 2010, when the figure was 400. But the total has risen three straight years starting in 2011, reaching 532 last year. As in homicides, it’s overwhelmingly the case that the victims are African-American men, according to the commission. Overall violent Crime Total violent crime has risen 21 percent since 2011 -- 1,300 more violent crimes were reported in 2013 compared to 2011. Most of that increase came in aggravated assaults. Milwaukee Police data shows that in every violent crime category the 2013 totals are higher than the 2010 totals. And for the most part, the upward trend has been consistent since 2010, though the uptick in overall violent crime began more recently, in 2012. "We were as frustrated as the rest of the community was with the increase in violent crime in 2013 over 2012," Police Chief Edward Flynn told reporters in March 2014. In contrast, the much larger category of property crime has fallen six straight years, and total crime (violent and property added together) in five of six, according to the department. Seasonal variation The other part of Clarke’s claim was that crime and violence rises in the summer, with winter the "calm" period. Criminologists have debunked some other seasonal crime explanations, such as the full moon effect. So we wondered if the numbers back it up. Homicide Review Commission reports and data show a seasonal difference is real, though winter is far from "calm." The ugly business of homicide certainly doesn’t close up shop in the colder months. In 2013, the months of December, January and February saw 20 of the year’s 105 homicides. But, the commission noted in 2014 that, "Generally, in years past, the number of homicides increases during the summer months." Typically, about 30 percent of annual homicides occur in June, July and August, our analysis of commission data showed. In non-fatal shootings, in both 2012 and 2013 the number of incidents generally increased during the summer months of June through September, the commission reported. "Specifically, in 2013, 262 nonfatal shootings occurred in June through September," the commission reported. In those four months, nonfatal shootings accounted for 49 percent of such incidents in all of 2013. Why? As Clarke said, it’s not just the abstract fact of sinking temperatures. Alcohol consumption and arguments are more common in the hotter months, noted Stephen Hargarten, director of the Injury Research Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin. "We do know weather has an effect, both ways," Hargarten said. "It has a limited effect but some effect." Our rating Clarke said Milwaukee has seen "an uptick in violence" since 2010, and "the only period of calm we get is when winter sets in." Violent crime rates have roller-coastered in recent years, but Clarke’s observations about the trend since 2010 is on target. His observation about a winter "calm" period is a bit of a stretch, but it’s certainly calmer than the hot days of summer. We rate his claim Mostly True. Update: an earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that Sheriff Clarke faces re-election in November 2014. He would first have to clear an expected August 12 primary challenge to reach the November 4 general election.	None	David A. Clarke Jr.	None	None	None	2014-05-23T16:26:18	2014-05-19	['None']

pomt-12088	Says Marco Rubio took "three quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives" during the 2016 Senate election.	/florida/statements/2017/aug/29/marco-rubios-heckler/marco-rubio-took-three-quarters-million-fossil-fue/	A college student and climate activist interrupted U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio during a recent speech to question Rubio's ties to the energy industry. September Porras, a Swarthmore college student who is a member of the Sunrise Movement, a national group of climate change activists, challenged Rubio's links to fossil fuels at the Seminole County GOP fundraiser held at a hotel in Altamonte Springs on Aug. 22. Here is a partial transcript of the exchange: Porras: "Senator, if you really care about young Americans, why did you take three-quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives in your last Senate election?" Rubio: "I’m so glad I live in America where she can say that, in a lot of countries you go to jail, I am grateful that I live in America where ... (applause drowns out a few words) ... I don’t have a problem with protesters..." Porras: "I’m not a protester, I just want to know why you aren’t answering our questions." Rubio: "I don’t have a problem with hecklers. I don’t have a problem with any of that. You know why? Because one of the issues I am working on now involves nations where that’s not possible," a reference to his work related to U.S. policy on Cuba and Venezuela. "I am grateful that I live in a nation where people can disagree, I am grateful that I live in a nation where people get to vote every two to four years. I am grateful that I live in a place where people can speak their minds and they can settle their differences at a ballot box." Rubio then made a call for the United States to achieve energy independence: "I believe as a cornerstone of allowing us to succeed economically we need to be able to power a 21st century economy, and I believe technological advances are making that energy more efficient and cleaner than ever before. I absolutely believe that America needs to be energy independent. We are crazy as a nation if we don’t utilize all of the resources that God’s blessed this great land with and I will continue to be a strong supporter of that." The part of the exchange we will fact-check is whether Rubio took three-quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives during his 2016 Senate bid. We did not hear back from Rubio’s spokespersons. Rubio’s donations from oil and gas industry Porras told PolitiFact that she obtained the dollar amount from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data that publishes its data at opensecrets.org. The center’s data for the top 20 recipients of oil and gas donations during the 2016 cycle showed that Rubio received $753,201. That amount put Rubio in fourth place for oil and gas donations behind three other presidential candidates: U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Separately, the center compiled industry donations for the Florida Senate candidates in 2016. That analysis shows that Rubio received $524,877 from oil and gas. Rubio received more money from six other sectors, including retirees, security/investment and Republican/conservative. Over Rubio’s career as a federal candidate and politician between 2009-18, he has taken $1.1 million from oil and gas. (Porras cited Rubio’s oil and gas donations but coal is also a fossil fuel. The Center of Responsive Politics found Rubio got $48,800 from the coal industry in 2016.) Compiling Rubio’s donations during the 2016 cycle is complicated because he ran in two elections -- presidential and Senate. The Center for Responsive Politics provided PolitiFact with a more specific breakdown for his oil and gas donations: $339,194 - to his presidential campaign $207,500 - to outside groups that supported both his presidential and Senate runs $271,571 - to his Senate campaign and leadership PAC That adds up to $818,265. That’s higher than the other totals shown for Rubio because it is the center’s most up to date analysis. So the dollar amount cited by Porras is valid, but while she referenced Rubio’s "last Senate election" the amount she cited included some donations to his presidential campaign. Another caveat: Porras said that the donations to Rubio were from "executives" but the donations could be broader than that. The donations reflects contributions from any individuals who list their employer as an oil and gas firm as well as as corporations and unions who donate from their treasuries. However, the vast majority of money reported to the Federal Election Commission comes from executives, CEOs and PACs, said Sarah Bryner, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics. The donations don’t include external lobbyists who represent a whole host of interests, not just oil and gas, but it would include an in-house lobbyist for an oil company. Donations from the oil and gas industry have generally been increasing over the past decade, particularly in presidential cycles. The donations peaked at about $103 million in 2016, with about 88 percent going to Republican candidates. Rubio has previously called for the United States to become energy independent, and that includes the use of oil and gas. He criticized international climate efforts, as well as President Barack Obama’s regulatory measures. "If you’re overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption," he said at an event in January 2016. "I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy." Our ruling A heckler said that Rubio took "three quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives" during the 2016 Senate election. While the heckler was referencing Rubio’s Senate election, that amount also includes donations to his presidential race. That's an important distinction, because presidential fundraising tends to draw more donations. The figure comes from an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics which found that Rubio received $753,201 during the 2016 cycle. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-05032	"83% of doctors have considered leaving the profession because of #Obamacare."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/12/jeff-duncan/gop-lawmaker-jeff-duncan-repeats-survey-finding-83/	As the House was taking another vote to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law in mid July 2012, a number of Republicans offered a grim view of the health care system’s future under "Obamacare" by citing poll results that said many doctors were thinking about quitting. One example: a July 10, 2012, tweet from Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., who wrote: "83% of doctors have considered leaving the profession because of ‪#Obamacare‬ ‪#repealandreplace." Many readers urged us to fact-check this statistic, which was circulated widely in the blogosphere in addition to being mentioned by other Republican lawmakers, such as Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington state in an MSNBC interview. We found it came from a survey by the Doctor Patient Medical Association Foundation, a group founded last fall that is opposed to the health care law. The group asked: "How do current changes in the medical system affect your desire to practice medicine?" According to the group, 83 percent answered, "Makes me think about quitting," 5 percent said, "I’m re-energized," while 13 percent said they were unsure or had no opinion. So while the number is right, it's important to examine whether Duncan has accurately explained the results. Are the poll’s respondents actually talking about "Obamacare"? Despite the linkage by Duncan and other lawmakers to Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as "Obamacare" is officially known, the question actually does not mention the law. In fact, only the final question in the poll mentions anything about it, in passing. Instead, the question asks about "current changes," which could include not just the law, but many other factors, such as changes driven by insurance companies and hospital systems. There’s no way of knowing what specifically the respondents were referring to. In an interview, Kathryn Serkes, the founder and CEO of the Doctor Patient Medical Association, emphasized that the group was not asking specifically about the health care law. She noted that other findings in the survey painted a more nuanced picture than pure anti-Obamacare sentiment. For instance, when asked to provide their top three choices for "who’s most to blame for current problems in medicine," 65 percent of respondents did choose "government involvement in general," but the next three categories were "health plans/insurance," "third-party payers" and "lawyers," with 50 percent, 42 percent and 42 percent, respectively. And while 27 percent cited "president" as one of their three choices, an almost equal number, 26 percent, cited "Congress," which is most visible today for a House Republican leadership that is dead-set against Obama’s health care law. "What we know from the other answers in this survey is that there are two main things going on for doctors -- government control and corporate control," Serkes said. "The rest of the results in the survey show doctors bemoaning corporatization as a very close second to government control. Many doctors don’t separate the two." The poll’s sponsor As with any poll, it’s always important to know who paid for it. The group’s website says, "It is DPMA's position that PPACA is the Destruction Of Our Medicine, attempting to insert the government and bureaucrats between the relationship and decisions of medical professional and their patient." It was founded by a longtime representative of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group that stands for "individual liberty, personal responsibility, limited government, and the ability to freely practice medicine according to time-honored Hippocratic principles." By itself, this doesn’t mean that the poll is untrustworthy. But it's important to consider that the group is strongly opposed to the law. The poll’s methodology Survey experts expressed some concerns about its design, noting that it's difficult to get accurate surveys on specific groups and occupations. The DPMAF was transparent about its methodology. The survey was conducted by fax and online from April 18 to May 22, 2012. Of 16,227 faxes that were successfully delivered to doctors’ offices, 699, or 4.3 percent, submitted responses. Experts said they were concerned with two aspects of the poll: • Respondents weren’t given much of a middle ground. The choices for answering this question were "makes me think about quitting," "I’m re-energized" and "unsure/no opinion." "It’s a poorly worded question that does not offer a complete range of likely alternatives, such as 'no effect,'" said Don Dillman, an expert in mail-based polls and a professor at Washington State University. Charles Franklin, a polling specialist at the University of Wisconsin, agreed that the response categories offered were "odd." In addition, interpreting the question requires caution, because asking about whether someone has "considered" something as dramatic as quitting their lifelong profession is a long way from saying they will do so. Serkes acknowledges this. "Do I expect doctors to quit en masse? " she said. "No, I don’t. Doctors don’t do anything en masse in the U.S." • Because the response rate was only 4.3 percent, it’s hard to gauge how representative the survey was. A different recent survey of doctors with a similar response rate -- conducted by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions -- took the extra step of weighting their sample "by years in practice, in combination with gender, region, and specialty to reflect the national distribution of physicians in the (American Medical Association) master file." DPMAF did not. If a respondent knew about or could detect DPMAF’s conservative policy orientation from the questions, or if they learned about the group’s orientation during the weeks-long period they were given to turn in the survey, they might have been likelier to take part. If they disagreed with the group’s stance, they might have been less likely to take part. Still, there’s no way to prove that DPMAF’s sample was biased. Either way, Serkes noted that her group never claimed scientific authority for the poll. "We didn’t say specifically that this was a scientific poll, nor did we state confidence levels or margins of error," she said. "We were very transparent about that." Other estimates We looked for alternative estimates in similar surveys and found that the Deloitte poll asked doctors if they agreed that "physicians currently practicing will stay in practice." Fifty-four percent said yes, while 34 percent said physicians would stop practicing. That's far below the 83 percent who told the DPMAF that they were considering quitting. Our ruling Duncan said "83% of doctors have considered leaving the profession because of #Obamacare." But that's an inaccurate description of the foundation’s poll. The poll did not specifically ask about the federal health care law and was meant to measure concerns about a wide range of changes in health care. Also, it's worth noting that the poll had a small return rate and the group that conducted it is opposed to the law. We rate the claim False.

pomt-14613	"Between 1990 and 2013, the maternal mortality rate for women in the U.S. has increased by 136%."	/texas/statements/2016/feb/01/sheila-jackson-lee/rep-sheila-jackson-lee-says-maternal-mortality-rat/	Shortly before the December holidays, Sheila Jackson Lee, a 10-term U.S. House member, inserted remarks into the Congressional Record in regard to women’s legal and human rights. The Houston Democrat, sharing initial findings from the U.S. visit of a United Nations Working Group that focuses on discrimination against women, touched on the nation’s gender wage gap, the increasing percentage of women in poverty and disparities in access to reproductive health. A figure that got our attention had to do with the maternal mortality rate. "Between 1990 and 2013," Jackson Lee said, "the maternal mortality rate for women in the U.S. has increased by 136 percent." Were women in this country dying at a significantly higher rate from pregnancy-related causes compared with almost a quarter century ago? We had to find out. We checked with Jackson Lee’s office to find the source of the 136 percent claim, and staffers sent back a Euro News article from Dec. 14, 2015. The article also referenced the U.N. working group’s U.S. visit, and attributed the 136 percent increase to U.N. rights workers. Similarly, several media outlets have used the 136 percent figure often. We also found the figure in a 2014 report compiled by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division titled "Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2013." It showed that yes, from 1990 to 2013, there was a 136 percent increase in the maternal mortality rate in the United States. Before we get into the figures, some definitions. The maternal mortality rate is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, regardless of duration and site of pregnancy, but not including accidental or incidental causes. A WHO fact sheet attributes 75 percent of maternal deaths to these complications: Severe bleeding (mostly bleeding after childbirth) Infections (usually after childbirth) High blood pressure during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia) Complications from delivery Unsafe abortion According to the WHO, 99 percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries. Nicholas Kassebaum, professor at Seattle Children’s Hospital and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, also analyzed the maternal mortality rate for an article in the medical journal The Lancet. His team put the rate increase between 1990 and 2013 at closer to 49 percent. Kassebaum suggested the difference in percentages could be attributed to model predictions the World Health Organization used. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation used a larger volume of data than the WHO/UN report, Kassebaum said, which showed the rate peak in 2009, and subsequently go down slightly the following years, settling at 18.5 deaths in 2013, or close to a 49 percent increase. The original WHO report used 5-year projections that predicted an increase every year. Experts such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Bill Callaghan warn against indiscriminately using the 136 percent figure. To make his point, the 2015 report (the following year) from WHO, UNICEF, et. al. showed only a 16.7 percent increase in maternal mortality rate for the United States. In an email, Sebastian Oliel, a spokesman for the Panamerican Health Organization, attributed the new figures to a change in methodology intended to allow a better comparison of mortality rates from different countries. Instead of relying on vital statistics (information gleaned from death certificates), which Callaghan said are not the most accurate, the WHO/UN began using CDC data for the United States in reports after 2014. Also, the current methodology uses estimates on an annual basis, instead of the previous method that estimated figures every five years, based on vital statistics. While the new rate looks like it’s telling a less drastic story, Callaghan said there still is a legitimate cause for concern. "The maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is unacceptably high," said Callaghan, chief of the CDC’s Maternal and Infant Health branch. "I’ve borne witness to women dying in pregnancy, it’s an awful thing. Whether it’s 18 out of 100,000 or 12 out of 100,000, it’s too high. Whether we’re first in the world or 89th in the world, it’s too high." He said that in the 1980s and ‘90s, health experts knew maternal deaths were underreported. Vital records, such as death certificates, were the main source of information and there was no way to ensure accurate reporting of deaths due to pregnancy-related issues. "The system was not nuanced. When women die in pregnancy, it’s not like counting people who died from colon cancer. Women who die in a particular state from a multitude of causes, it’s hard to account for it." The CDC began the pregnancy mortality surveillance system in 1986. Callaghan says reporting has "incrementally gotten better," but the process remains imperfect since states do not report every death identically. The 2014 WHO report (where the 136 percent increase originated), used older methods of modeling based purely on vital statistics, "which we know are problematic," he explained in an email. The more recent estimates in the 2015 report (source of the 16.7 percent increase) are based on CDC pregnancy mortality surveillance system data. While better reporting could account for more maternal deaths, Callaghan said he believes there is a definite increase beyond that. It could be attributed to a multitude of causes, including changing demographics of women giving birth (people giving birth at older ages) and worsening health outcomes (higher rates of obesity, heart disease) in the general population. But, there has been a proportionate decrease in common causes of maternal deaths, such as hemorrhages and blood clots in the United States, he said. One ratio that has been consistent since the CDC began collecting this data has to do with health disparities between white and black women. Black women face a three- to four-times greater risk of dying from complications of pregnancy. Callaghan explained that black women aren’t dying from different causes, but they are more likely to die from complications. That could be a reflection of differences in care, or being more susceptible to certain diseases, or a "complex combination of both," he said. To find a solution, there has been an increasing focus on patient safety, establishing national guidelines and rooting out possible variations in care, facility to facility. By having protocol at all facilities to handle the "low-hanging fruit" of hemorrhages, blood clots and women with severe hypertension, the rate in the United States could improve for all women. Our ruling Sheila Jackson Lee said the maternal mortality rate in the United States increased 136 percent between 1990 and 2013. A 2014 report compiled by the World Health Organization, UNICEF and The World Bank presented just that figure. However, experts agree it is inaccurate and based on a modeling method WHO no longer uses. While there has been an increase in U.S. maternal mortality in that time -- possibly due, in part, to better reporting and worsening health conditions in the general population -- experts said it was not as drastic.

When Wright announced her run in a Nov. 6, 2015 op-ed in the Wausau Daily Herald, she attacked GOP support of voucher schools and argued that the program draws resources away from public schools in her own district. “Just in the 85th Assembly District, we’re spending half a million taxpayer dollars on private school tuition for students that often attended those private schools already. That money is needed in our public schools, where there is public oversight for public funds and all children are welcome.” So how much money does the Wausau School District spend on vouchers?

pomt-04461	High school students arrested on campus are twice as likely not to graduate and four times less likely to graduate if they’ve appeared in court.	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/10/steven-teske/judge-links-arrests-high-school-drop-out-rates/	Crime costs Georgia, and state leaders are trying to find a smarter approach to deal with teenagers who run afoul of the law. Last month, a commission of judges, police officers, attorneys and others met to discuss ways to improve Georgia’s juvenile justice system. By some estimates, Georgia deals with 40,000 juvenile delinquents a year. The budget for the state juvenile justice system for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2013, is about $300 million, nearly as much as Georgia will spend on its technical college system. One judge at the meeting relayed some information that piqued the Truth-O-Meter’s interest. "We know from the research that if you arrest a kid on campus, he’s twice as likely not to graduate," Clayton County Juvenile Court Judge Steven Teske said. "If they appear in court, they’re four times as likely not to graduate." Teske said in an interview that his concern is about "zero-tolerance" policies that more schools across the country have adopted concerning students who get in trouble on campus. The policies can result in more students being arrested and expelled. "[T]he problem with zero tolerance is that it does not distinguish between the kids who are bullies and those who make stupid decisions," Teske told us. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the numbers Teske used to base his case are correct. Teske said his claim was based on a widely used study of graduation rates among high school students who go through the court system. The study by Gary Sweeten, an associate professor of criminology at Arizona State University, was published in December 2006. Sweeten claimed it is the first study to estimate the effect of arrest and court appearance jointly. "[F]irst-time arrest during high school nearly doubles the odds of high school dropout, while a court appearance nearly quadruples the odds of dropout," Sweeten wrote. In his study, Sweeten also found evidence of what are called labeling effects. The concern is that young people who get arrested are labeled as delinquents and continue to get heightened scrutiny and punishment. Scholars on the subject say that can explain why a disproportionate percentage of students who wind up in the criminal justice system do not graduate from high school. "This perspective argues that official intervention can be a stepping stone in the development of a delinquent career," two authors wrote in a 2003 study on the subject cited by Sweeten. That study of 1,000 seventh- and eighth-graders in the Rochester, N.Y., school system over a nine-year span found that an arrest nearly quadrupled the odds of being a high school dropout, and involvement in the justice system increased the odds by about the same rate. In his study, Sweeten wrote: "Court involvement may put youths in close contact with other delinquent youths who may encourage further delinquency, and less attachment to high school, leading to poorer educational outcomes." "They think of themselves as a troublemaker now," Sweeten said in a telephone interview. Sweeten’s study, though, did not focus solely on on-campus arrests. He selected a random sample of people who answer an annual survey done by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics with an oversampling of disadvantaged youths. The respondents answer a series of questions on many issues, including their educational background and criminal history. Sweeten told PolitiFact Georgia that he hasn’t seen much research about the impact of on-campus arrests on graduation rates. He said his research "implies" there may be a connection. A separate study casts a little bit of doubt on the research. Another group of researchers studied about 2,000 Philadelphia students interviewed after they finished eighth grade and then seven years later. "We found that arrest has no significant impact on the likelihood of a student dropping out of high school, but it does have a strong and consistent impact on a late graduation," the researchers wrote. Christopher Weiss, one of the authors of that study, said they could not distinguish which arrests were made on campus. Weiss said on-campus arrests were a rare occurrence at that time. One study of Chicago inner-city high school students arrested during the ninth or 10th grade found they are at least six times more likely to drop out of school. A 2012 study by the American Civil Liberties Union and Citizens for Juvenile Justice concluded that students in the three largest school systems of Massachusetts who are arrested at school are three times more likely to drop out than those who are not. To summarize, Teske referenced on-campus arrests and court interaction at the meeting. "We know from the research that if you arrest a kid on campus, he’s twice as likely not to graduate," he said. "If they appear in court, they’re four times as likely not to graduate." The first part of Teske’s claim is troublesome because there’s not much research on the subject of on-campus arrests and high school dropout rates. The most recent study we found, though, supported Teske’s claim. As far as the latter part of his statement, there is more support for what Teske said at the meeting. We rate his entire claim as Mostly True.	None	Steven Teske	None	None	None	2012-10-10T06:00:00	2012-09-18	['None']
pomt-07508	﻿Says JoAnne Kloppenburg’s side had a "3-to-1 money advantage" in the Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign.	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/10/charlie-sykes/charlie-sykes-says-joanne-kloppenburg-had-3-1-adva/	Conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes was in a pretty good mood the day after his preferred candidate for state Supreme Court battled to a virtual dead heat against the more liberal JoAnne Kloppenburg. Justice David Prosser avoided defeat, Sykes told his WTMJ (620-AM) listeners on April 6, 2011, despite the efforts of labor and the left to use public anger over Gov. Scott Walker’s anti-union legislation against Prosser, a former Republican legislator. It was especially remarkable, Sykes said, because liberals had such a huge fundraising edge. "They put in as much money as they will ever be able to," Sykes said. "They will never again, in Wisconsin, be able to mobilize a 3-to-1 money advantage." He repeated the "3-to-1" claim at least twice more, at one point attributing it to an unidentified "political observer" who wrote up some pro-Prosser thoughts late on election night. The claim surprised us. The two candidates both agreed to public financing, so they were limited to public grants. And spending by outside groups was heavy on both sides. Sykes wasn’t the only one to sound this theme. A National Review story two days before the election said outside groups on the conservative side were being "heavily outspent" by liberal counterparts. And Bob Dohnal, publisher of the Wisconsin-based Conservative Digest, circulated an email on April 7 saying conservatives were outspent 10 to 1. He told us the figure was based on information "bandied around the Internet and the talk shows for weeks." What’s more, it’s much broader than Sykes’ claim. Dohnal said his number included all efforts by the unions and liberal groups dating back more than a month to the protests over Gov. Scott Walker’s budget bill -- not just the Supreme Court race. We asked Sykes for backup for his statement, but he did not respond. So, we turned to the numbers, which fall into three categories. -- Candidate fundraising. As noted, both candidates opted for public financing, limiting their intake almost exclusively to $400,000 in public financing each ($100,000 for the primary, $300,00 for the general). So that’s a draw. -- Independent expenditures by political action committees. This is a small category, but Kloppenburg had a decided edge, according to state Government Accountability Board reports of spending through April 6, 2011. Groups supporting her or attacking Prosser spent $135,152. On the Prosser’s side, the tally was $12,386. -- Media spending by special interest "issues advocacy" groups trying to influence voters. This is the big outside money that came in record amounts for a state judicial race. By law, these ads can’t explicitly endorse the defeat or election of a candidate, but they are essentially indistinguishable from ads that do. The two tallies we found both showed a big advantage for Prosser’s side -- not Kloppenburg’s. The first was a report -- released on election day -- by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School that looked at broadcast TV spending by outside groups. It is the only organization we could find that attempts to put a hard number on such spending by outside groups. The left-leaning think tank/advocacy group relies on TV satellite data collected by TNS Media Intelligence/CMAG, an ad-tracking firm. It says its numbers are estimates that may underestimate the precise amount of actual expenditures. The Brennan study was reported widely by Wisconsin and national media, including the Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, and the Journal Sentinel. It found there had been $2.2 million spent by four conservative groups through election day vs. $1.36 million by one liberal group, the Greater Wisconsin Committee. (The conservative groups are the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce’s issues mobilization council, Citizens for a Strong America, Wisconsin Club for Growth and the State Tea Party Express). That’s an $840,000 advantage for the conservative side. The Brennan study also was picked up on WisPolitics.com, a widely cited online digest. The website added some of its own reporting and wrote on election day that pro-Prosser groups outspent the Kloppenburg side, $2.5 million to $1.9 million. That’s a somewhat smaller $600,000 advantage. WisPolitics had broader information -- including cable TV and radio -- though it cited the Kloppenburg campaign as its source for the additional information. Kloppenburg, the WisPolitics story said, had tracked ad spending by both sides, and provided some numbers to WisPolitics. Prosser’s campaign manager Brian Nemoir said he had not tracked the spending totals by outside groups and couldn’t comment on which side spent more. We also asked the biggest spending groups on both sides to release spending figures -- or to confirm or dispute the Brennan Center tally. The liberal GWC group said they do not release their spending figures -- nor are they required to do so. Officials with Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, Citizens for a Strong America and Wisconsin Club for Growth could not be reached. Kloppenburg’s side did not respond to a question about spending. To be sure, the information that is available is not perfect. State and federal laws allow undisclosed spending by a variety of groups, on a variety of election and issues-related advocacy. Robo-calls and mailings by outside groups are not tracked. There are limitations to the TV data, though it likely covers a very large chunk of the TV spending by outside groups, said Ken Goldstein, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who tracks ad spending. Still, it is the best and most complete information. And it all was available when Sykes made his comments the day after the election. Indeed, the Brennan numbers and WisPolitics story both came out the day before. So what were the grand totals, when paired with the other categories? For the Prosser side: $2,628,000. For the Kloppenburg side: $1,900,000. That’s a $728,000 spending advantage on Prosser side, or a 38 percent edge. The gap is smaller, but still substantial, if you use the figures reported by WisPolitics. Let’s wrap this one up. Sykes repeatedly claimed that the pro-Prosser forces were outgunned financially by a 3 to 1 ratio by the Kloppenburg side. He did not specify a source of his own, cite any information from the Prosser side or debunk the widespread media reports of the spending advantage on the Prosser side. His assertion may have become an article of faith in some circles on the right, but we could find no basis for any spending advantage by Kloppenburg, much less a 3 to 1 edge. His statement warrants a Pants on Fire. (Editor’s note, April 11, 2011: Sykes did not respond to our April 7, 2011 request for information that would support the claim he made about spending in the Supreme Court race. He went on the air April 11, 2011-- the day after the item was posted – and led off his segment by saying: "I don’t have a problem admitting if I made a mistake." Amid criticism of PolitiFact Wisconsin, Sykes said it was his "good faith" impression from about two weeks prior to the election that the Kloppenburg side was outspending the Prosser side. He acknowledged the balance might have tipped by election day and said no one can know the true amount that was spent because, by law, it is not officially reported. He did not provide any information to support his claim that the Prosser side was outspent 3-to-1.)	None	Charlie Sykes	None	None	None	2011-04-10T09:00:00	2011-04-06	['None']

pomt-04148	"Over $1 trillion" was spent on anti-poverty programs in 2011, enough to "give every single poor American a check for $22,000."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/30/paul-ryan/anti-poverty-spending-could-give-poor-22000-checks/	In a speech shortly after the presidential election, Republican vice-presidential contender Paul Ryan decried what he called the government’s ineffective approach to fighting poverty, saying spending alone isn’t the answer. "Just last year, total federal and state spending on means-tested programs came to over $1 trillion," the Wisconsin congressman and House Budget Committee chairman said Dec. 4, 2012, referring to programs that have eligibility based on income. "What does that mean in practical terms? For that amount of money, you could give every single poor American a check for $22,000 -- every man, woman and child." Really? Let’s check Ryan’s math. Ryan’s evidence To begin with, a little background: -- Ryan made his indictment at a time when poverty is at one of its highest rates in decades. In 2011, 46.2 million people, or 15 percent of the U.S. population, lived in poverty. -- For 2012, the income levels to be eligible for certain anti-poverty programs was $11,170 for a single person and $23,050 for a family of four. -- More than half of Americans -- 51 percent, according to an October 2012 Rasmussen poll -- think the government spends too much fighting poverty. That’s up from 38 percent in an April 2011 Rasmussen survey. As for the numbers in Ryan’s speech, it turns out he had used them before -- on the campaign trail less than a month before the election. Here’s the evidence Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert provided us to back the two numbers. How much was spent: Some $1.03 trillion was spent on means-tested programs for the poor in 2011, Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee said in October 2012. Most of that amount -- $746 billion -- was federal spending, based on a detailed memo by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, with the committee itself estimating that states picked up the remainder of the $1 trillion. But it’s not as though all of that money was being given to people in poverty as cash or food. The largest category was for health care, primarily through Medicaid. How many in poverty: Ryan cited census data, noting as we did earlier that 46.2 million people lived in poverty in 2011. From there, Ryan takes the $1.03 trillion and divides it by 46.2 million people living in poverty. The result, he says, is each poor person could have been written a check for $22,000. The math itself is accurate, and there’s no dispute about the number of people in poverty. But let’s go to some experts for a closer look. The conservative Heritage Foundation calculates the cost of means-tested federal and state spending on welfare programs in 2011 as $927 billion, with half the amount going to health care. Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, puts the 2011 anti-poverty spending figure at $952 billion -- although he counted local government spending as well as money spent by the federal and state governments. That amounts to $20,610 for every poor person, Tanner wrote. So, both groups give support to Ryan’s claim, although their spending figures are somewhat lower than Ryan’s claim of $1 trillion. The liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research says that even if the $1 trillion is accurate, it is spent on "a population that is more than twice the size" of the 46 million people living in poverty. That’s because two of the major programs, Medicaid and the earned income tax credit, have income eligibility limits above the poverty line. Moreover, some of the $1 trillion, the center said, is paid to school districts and other institutions to help educate the poor -- the poor themselves don’t get the money. LaDonna Pavetti, a family income support researcher at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said of Ryan’s claim: "It’s not so much the numbers as what he does with them." Noting that the single largest portion of spending cited by Ryan is on health care, Pavetti pointed out that the largest Medicaid expenditures are made on people who live in nursing homes and other institutions -- they, by definition, are not included in the number of people living in poverty. And the list of programs Ryan includes in his $1 trillion in spending "is sort of anything and everything that is targeted to low-income people," Pavetti said. That includes money that aids schools and low-income communities but do not directly benefit the poor, she said. Our rating Ryan said "over $1 trillion" was spent on anti-poverty programs in 2011, enough to "give every single poor American a check for $22,000." As a sweeping statement, Ryan’s claim is partially accurate, in that roughly $1 trillion was spent on means-tested programs, and if you divided that by the number of people living in poverty, it would amount to roughly $22,000 per person. But Ryan mixes apples and oranges, in that the $1 trillion is actually spent on far more people than the 46 million counted as living in poverty. Moreover, much of the money goes to institutions, such as nursing homes and schools, and not directly into the pockets of the poor. We rate Ryan’s statement Half True.

pomt-15087	Says that President Barack Obama said an attack on Syria "was going to be a pinprick."	/florida/statements/2015/sep/18/marco-rubio/obama-called-potential-attack-syria-pinprick-rubio/	Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida defended a 2013 vote not to authorize President Barack Obama to use military force in Syria by saying the strategy wasn’t worth risking American lives. During a presidential debate in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 16, 2015, radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt asked Donald Trump if he thought three senators — Rubio, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky — who opposed intervention against Syrian President Bashar Assad were now responsible for the current Syrian refugee crisis. Rubio defended his stance after Trump said he thought they were partly to blame. "We have zero responsibility, because let’s remember what the president said," Rubio said. "He said the attack that he was going to conduct was going to be a pinprick. Well, the United States military was not built to conduct pinprick attacks." Rubio went on to say he wanted a strategy that would put "men and women in a position where they can win." Obama’s Syria policy has been a target for Republicans during the campaign, but did Obama refer to potential strikes against Assad as "a pinprick" attack? Pinning down strategy We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s campaign when we contacted them, but the crux of his reference is Obama’s response to Assad’s chemical weapons attack against civilians in 2013. While initially planning a military response against the Syrian government, Obama suddenly switched gears on Aug. 31. He announced he would first ask Congress to authorize intervention, likely starting with surgical missile strikes from Navy destroyers — an approach that faced questionable results, according to a July 2013 report from the Institute for the Study of War. Involving Congress was widely seen as a political gamble to bring lawmakers into the decision to move against Syria. Prior to that, Obama had struggled with whether to act unilaterally, without support from the American public, Congress, the United Nations or U.S. allies. Obama did use the term "pinprick" several times, but he used the word to say that's what he was not doing. Take, for example, an interview blitz on Sept. 9. Obama told Savannah Guthrie on the Today show that day that "the U.S. does not do pinpricks. Our military is the greatest the world has ever known. And when we take even limited strikes, it has an impact on a country like Syria." Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution’s Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, told us the term "pinprick" certainly is not a technical description of any kind of military strike. But in his experience, when the word is used, "it is always pejorative." Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who favored military action in Syria, questioned Obama’s commitment to using force. McCain said on Face the Nation on Sept. 1 that he had wondered whether surgical strikes are "just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America." By Sept. 4, Rubio and Paul voted against a Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolution allowing Obama to use limited force against Assad’s regime. (Cruz, who was not on the committee, made it clear he would have opposed the resolution.) It passed by a 10-7 vote and was sent to the Senate. Meanwhile, during a hearing for the House Foreign Affairs Committee on strategy in Syria on Sept. 4, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel tried to dispel notions Obama wasn’t planning an effective response. "The president has said ... this would not be a pinprick. Those were his words. This would be a significant strike that would in fact degrade his capability," Hagel said. Now, Obama’s case wasn’t necessarily helped when then-Secretary of State John Kerry gave the opposite message on Sept. 9, saying during a meeting in Britain that the United States planned an "unbelievably small, limited kind of effort." But the strikes, pinpricks or not, never happened. Facing shaky support in the Senate, Obama asked majority leader Harry Reid to pull the measure. On Sept. 10, Obama said in an address to the nation from the White House that he would postpone a military solution, but was committed to his stance that future intervention was a possibility. "As some members of Congress have said, there's no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria," Obama said. "Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn't do pinpricks." A year later, Rubio voted in favor of arming Syrian rebels, which Paul and Cruz opposed. Our ruling Rubio claimed Obama said an attack on Syria "was going to be a pinprick." In reality, Obama said the exact opposite of that, stating several times that a U.S. military response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons on its citizens would involve a significant show of force. While the president’s full strategy was somewhat unclear, at the debate Rubio echoed Obama’s own past statements that the U.S. military was not built for small-scale engagements that could be characterized as "pinpricks." We can pop Rubio’s talking point here.

pomt-05094	"People who wash cars at home will use approximately 80 percent more water than they do in a car wash."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/01/helio-melo/ri-state-rep-helio-melo-says-washing-car-home-uses/	In the closing hours of the state budget debate last month, as talk on the House floor turned to a new sales tax on select businesses, Rep. Helio Melo, D-East Providence, suggested a reprieve for one targeted retail group. Melo, chairman of the House Finance Committee, advocated exempting the state’s car washes from the 7-percent sales tax increase. With car wash supporters in the gallery holding signs reading "Save Our Jobs," Rep. Karen L. MacBeth, D-Cumberland, wanted to know: "Why car washes? Why not taxis and charter buses?" which were also subject to the tax increase. Melo replied: "We noticed there was an environmental impact to it that was brought to us by environmentalists. People who wash cars at home will use approximately 80 percent more water than they do in a car wash." Ultimately, the car washes won out and were saved from the tax. The taxi and charter bus businesses weren’t so lucky. But we were left wondering: Eighty percent more water used for a driveway wash? Was there a shortage of hose nozzles and two-gallon buckets out there? The statement cried out for a PolitiFact scrubbing. In a phone interview, Melo said the information supporting his statement came from literature he received from the carwash industry, as well as earlier testimony before the House Finance Committee by car wash owners. Daniel E. Paisner, former president of the New England Carwash Association and owner of a ScrubaDub car wash in Warwick, spoke passionately at that March 7, 2012, hearing. In a video Paisner is seen and heard saying that the sales tax increase would "create an environmental concern" if it kept customers away. Car washes "are water conservationists," Paisner said. "At the professional car wash, we recycle water. We’re very, very careful with it. We use about 28 or 30 gallons a car. When you wash your car in the driveway, you can use as much as 140 gallons." (If you accept Paisner’s statement that would mean homeowners use 400 percent more water than a professional car wash.) Further, said Paisner, car washes trap the oil, chemicals and grime that comes off a car, whereas those pollutants drain into storm drains during driveway washes and sometimes flow directly into nearby watersheds. While most research on water use at car washes comes from the industry, regional offices of the federal Environmental Protection Agency have in the last decade honored carwash associations for efforts to curb pollution and conserve water. David A. Nickerson, spokesman for the Providence Water Supply Board, says professional car washes do prevent pollutants from entering waterways and, "It’s generally assumed more water can be saved at a carwash than by doing it yourself." But the numbers of just how much water is used during a home care wash versus a professional job seem, well, fluid. Nickerson says he’s seen industry figures showing a car wash uses between 37 and 40 gallons of water per car, whereas the homeowner will use between 80 and 100 gallons in the driveway. In that scenario, the car wash uses 50 to 60 percent less water. That’s about what the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection says on its website: "the average driveway car wash uses a total of 116 gallons of water! Most commercial car washes use 60 percent less water..." Apparently, the Massachusetts DEP is using industry numbers as its source; its website refers readers to the New England Carwash Association for more information. The website for the ScrubaDub Auto Wash Centers, a chain of New England car washes, boasts that professional car washes use "about 25 gallons" while a driveway wash can use between 60 and 120 gallons. That’s as much as a 400 percent difference. Here at PolitiFact we’re not afraid of using a little elbow grease in search of the truth. And so, rather than rely on the varying findings of published reports, we turned to a dirty midsize pickup in need of its annual bath. First, we filled a bucket with two gallons of water and marked the waterline. Two gallons, plus detergent, seemed more than enough to wash the truck. (Following the father-knows-best principle, we would wash the truck in sections, working top to bottom.) Then we took our hose, set the nozzle on soak and measured how long it took to wet and rinse each section of the truck after each soaping. Total time: 153 seconds (including hubcaps). We took our time, but we didn’t go out of our way to waste water either. Finally we timed how long it took to fill the bucket to the two-gallon mark, making sure to use the same nozzle setting to match the water flow used during the washing. It took 34 seconds. That's 17 seconds per gallon. Dividing 153 seconds by 17 seconds per gallon revealed that we had used 9 gallons of water to wet and rinse the truck. Add the original two gallons in the bucket to soap the pickup, and you have a Dakota Sport that has come clean using just 11 gallons of water. Even if we had taken twice as long to wet and rinse (and used 18 gallons), that's a total of 20 gallons used -- nowhere near the 60 gallons, 80 gallons, 116 gallons, or 140 gallons, that car wash industry representatives claim people can use washing their cars at home. In other words we used half the amount of water a professional car wash might use -- not almost twice as much, as Melo claimed. Our ruling This is a claim that's easy to check with a stopwatch, a bucket of suds, a hose, and that all-important spray nozzle most people use. Professional car washes do provide an environmental service by keeping pollutants out of watersheds. But Melo’s comparison between the water used during a driveway wash versus a professional car wash is all wet. If Melo doesn't believe us, we'd be glad to demonstrate by washing his car. And he can use the water we save to douse his Pants On Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-09796	"Medicare began as a public option and now holds 97 percent of the market share."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/16/tom-price/medicares-history-public-option/	Rep. Tom Price of Georgia sent a letter to doctors in September 2009 urging them to oppose Democratic initiatives on health reform. "If health care reform is taken down the wrong path, it will end in nothing short of disaster," the three-term Republican wrote. Price, who is an orthopedic surgeon, singled out plans for a public option for the most criticism. "As a fellow doctor, I know you have personally navigated the federal health care system of our first 'public option' — Medicare," Price wrote. "And I know your experience will tell you that government-run programs many times mean restrictive coverage rules, endless bureaucratic delays, and inadequate financing structures. . . . "There will be no turning back, no reversing the government intrusion that Democrats desire," he warned. "Medicare began as a public option and now holds 97 percent of the market share." We were interested in checking whether Medicare began as a public option and whether Price is right about its current market share. To check this, we turned to several books on the history of Medicare and spoke with a couple of experts in the field. It's difficult to concisely summarize decades of health policy and legislative history, but we'll try. Medicare had been discussed by presidents since the 1940s, but its big moment began in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson was elected by a large margin, along with Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate. Johnson relied on Rep. Wilbur Mills, a conservative Democrat from Arkansas, to craft the legislation and move it through the House Ways and Means Committee. Johnson kept close tabs on the process. There were arguments about what should be in the bill and how it should be paid for. Mills decided to combine the proposals of several factions into one package to maximize support. He started with the administration's proposal to cover hospital services for the elderly, now known as Medicare Part A. He also included a proposal promoted by the committee's senior Republican member, John Byrnes of Wisconsin, who wanted coverage for physicians' services, now Medicare Part B. Finally, Mills included coverage for poor elderly Americans, which is today's Medicaid. The histories of Medicare that we reviewed emphasized that the part of Medicare that covered visits to doctors' offices was voluntary. Here's how an April 8, 1965, report in the New York Time s described the plan: "As revised, the bill provides the basic hospitalization and nursing care benefits originally proposed by the administration while covering major doctor bills and many other medical expenses under a supplementary insurance program in which participation would be voluntary. "The basic benefits, financed by increases in the Social Security payroll tax, would be automatically available to persons over 65. The additional coverage would be available to those over 65 who enrolled in the voluntary plan and paid premiums of $3 a month. Half of the voluntary plan's cost would be financed by federal subsidies of about $600 million a year from general tax revenues." Johnson signed the Medicare law on July 30, 1965, and the program's aministrators began an intensive recruitment drive. At the end of the first year, participation was up to 93 percent of the elderly, according to The Politics of Medicare , a history by Theodore Marmor. Subsequent research indicates that Medicare participation has remained very high among those who qualify for the program, at roughly 97 percent in recent years, according to Medicare: A Policy Primer , a 2005 book by Marilyn Moon. All of this supports Price's statement, with one exception. As we reviewed the history of Medicare, we noticed that legislators and policymakers drafting the legislation seemed to assume that Medicare participation would be very high. We could find nothing implying that Medicare coverage would compete with private insurers in paying for coverage. Marmor, author of The Politics of Medicare , confirmed that perception when we asked him. Marmor witnessed the Medicare negotiations firsthand when he worked as assistant on the drafting of the 1965 legislation. "The voluntary part was a mirage," he said. "They fully expected most people to join, because the terms were so attractive. And that's exactly what happened." This is markedly different from today's debate and discussion about the public option. Obama has said the public option would be one among many insurance proposals from which people could choose, and that it would be a backstop to keep private insurers honest. He also said it should not be subsidized by other tax revenues but pay for itself with customer premiums. A spokesman for Price said the Democrats can say the public option will be limited, but it won't be. "While they claim it's a public option, the end goal is saturation," said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Price. We're noting that disagreement for the record. For a fuller explanation of the public option and how it fits into overall reform effort, read our story Health care reform: A simple explanation . But getting back to Price's statement, we find the following: He is right that Medicare was a public plan and its coverage of physicians' services was voluntary, which is another way to say "optional." And its participation rate among eligible seniors is close to 97 percent. But we take a notch off our rating to acknowledge that people disagree about whether the words "public option" today are the same as Medicare's "voluntary" Part B in 1965. It's important to note that the founders of Medicare expected that nearly every senior would be covered by Part B, while the Democrats' "public option" today is envisioned as just one of many options in the health care exchange. We rate Price's statement Mostly True.	None	Tom Price	None	None	None	2009-09-16T14:21:50	2009-09-14	['None']

pomt-09239	"McCollum admitted he didn't think that the subprime mortgage crisis was a big deal, telling reporters he thought that the subprime collapse had been exaggerated by the media and investors and that 'it's not the end of the world.' "	/florida/statements/2010/may/11/florida-democratic-party/florida-dems-bill-mccollum-subprime-mortgage/	Florida Democrats say Attorney General Bill McCollum's recent South Florida Mortgage Fraud Community Forum was little more than a political stunt crafted to help the Republican running for governor. The truth, they say, is that for years McCollum has been negligent when it comes to dealing with the state's mortgage and foreclosure crisis. "Although Bill McCollum holds a 'mortgage fraud forum' in Miami today (May 8), his election-year attention to the foreclosure and mortgage fraud crisis is too little, too late for millions of Florida homeowners," Democratic Party spokesman Eric Jotkoff said in a May 8, 2010 news release. "Florida's families have been dealing with the fallout of misleading loans and irresponsible lenders for years, while Attorney General McCollum has not paid attention to the issue. "Just two years ago McCollum admitted he didn't think that the subprime mortgage crisis was a big deal, telling reporters he thought that the subprime collapse had been exaggerated by the media and investors and that 'it's not the end of the world'." The forum, which was co-hosted with the Florida InterAgency Mortgage Fraud Task Force, a group McCollum established in 2009, was held to help homeowners prevent mortgage fraud and avoid or deal with a foreclosure. McCollum said that "helping Floridians suffering from this severe foreclosure crisis is a top priority," in a posting on Twitter after the event. Florida has ranked first in the nation in mortgage fraud every year since 2006. For this item, we wanted to check the Democratic Party's claim that McCollum said he didn't think the subprime mortgage crisis was a big deal, that it had been exaggerated by the media and said that "it's not the end of the world." A subprime mortgage is a home loan granted to people with poor credit histories or other financial issues that prevent them from qualifying for a conventional mortgage. A subprime mortgage has higher interest rates and represents a bigger risk to lenders. But lenders were liberal in issuing the loans from 2004-2006, largely due to lower interest rates and a booming housing market. When the housing market started to decline along with the economy in 2007, the rate of subprime foreclosures skyrocketed, shaking the entire American financial system. Florida Democrats say McCollum was late to realize the severity of the problem, claiming that he sat in a Nov. 15, 2007, meeting of the Florida Cabinet and declared the crisis mostly a media creation. At that meeting, Cabinet members heard a report that the state investment pool had taken a $2.28 billion hit as a result of the subprime crisis. State Democrats pointed to an account of the meeting published in the Fort Myers News-Press to back up their claim. The last two lines of the News-Press story include the only mention of McCollum: "Attorney General Bill McCollum thinks the subprime collapse has been exaggerated by the media and investors," the News-Press article said, and then quoted McCollum as saying "it's not the end of the world." We couldn't find the quote in any other story. But the state does keep typed transcripts of Cabinet meetings online. We went to the transcript from the Nov. 15 Cabinet meeting to see the context of McCollum's statement. Coleman Stipanovich, the then executive director of the State Board of Administratrion, which oversees the state's investments, ended the Cabinet meeting with a discussion of risk exposures to the state's investment portfolio. He provided the Cabinet with a report, based on a request from Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, identifying risks and the state's monitoring activities due to the collapse of the subprime residential market. As the News-Press reported, Stipanovich said the state's investment pool -- which was then about $188 billion -- had lost about $2.28 billion as a result of the subprime crisis through something called "write-downs." A write-down is when someone reduces the paper value of an asset because it is overvalued when compared to the market value. When he got a chance to speak, McCollum asked Stipanovich to explain the write-downs, which McCollum called downgrades, saying he believed that they were not so much losses as a reflection that the state would be earning less. From the transcript (starting on page 93): McCOLLUM: "What's the meaning of a downgrade in practical terms? If a paper is downgraded, does that mean that we're going to earn less on it? It doesn't mean it's worthless." STIPANOVICH: "No, it's certainly not worthless, but you do have the potential -- and this is why we're trying to work through these issues. You do have the potential of earning less on it. We're optimistic that that's not the case. We have dug down into these holdings and looked at the collateral, and the collateral looks good to us. The collateral, you know, has a very high rating." McCOLLUM: "That's my point. I'm just trying to make a point to anybody observing this out there who might not be as sophisticated in the world of finance that this is not the end of the world. You would rather see us have higher ratings than we have on some of the paper that has been downgraded or some of the holdings, but it doesn't mean that we're going to necessarily lose money because of that." After McCollum's remarks, Stipanovich -- not McCollum -- says the subprime mortgage crisis was being sensationalized by the news media, according to the transcript. "This has been exaggerated. It has been sensationalized, and you're probably going to see more in print that's, you know, going to be sensational possibly," Stipanovich said. Interestingly Sink, a Democrat running for governor, didn't have that different of a take from McCollum when it came to the state investment report. She said that if the state took any losses as a result of the 2007 subprime write-downs, they would be "de minimis," according to the transcript. (De minimis, a Latin word, means of little or no significance, inconsequential.) The transcript differs with the news account in two critical ways. First, McCollum didn't say the subprime mortgage crisis was being sensationalized by the media, that was Stipanovich. McCollum did say however during the meeting that he believed many subprime mortgages were functioning properly. Second, and more important to our analysis, when McCollum said it's "not the end of the world," he was referring to the specific $2.28 billion in write-downs in the state's investment portfolio and not the subprime crisis in general. So Florida Democrats are being incorrect and misleading. They attribute one quote to McCollum that was actually said by Stipanovich. And when they use McCollum's actual words, they quote him out of context. They portray McCollum as a callous state official who belittlies the overall impact of the subprime crisis. But his comment was referring to the impact on the state's investments, not on homeowners. That's a big difference. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00437	"I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And we’ve got it. We’ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/23/donald-trump/united-states-not-cleanest-country/	President Donald Trump touted the United States’ environmental health during a speech in coal country. "I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And we’ve got it. We’ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now," Trump said in an Aug. 21 rally in Charleston, W.Va. "There’s nobody cleaner than us, and it’s getting better and better." Does the United States dominate when it comes to water and air quality? Let’s take a look. The Environmental Performance Index is the go-to source for questions on environmental quality. Yale and Columbia University researchers teamed up with the World Economic Forum in 2018 to compile the data. Using 10 categories, they ranked the United States 27th. On air it ranks 10th and on water, 29th. Among wealthy democracies, the United States ranks toward the bottom, according to Zachary Wendling, principal investigator at the Environmental Performance Index. Switzerland ranked first on the overall index, Barbados ranked first on air quality, and eight European countries tied for first on water. European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Japan tend to top the United States in environmental performance. Clean air The air quality ranking is broken up into three parts. On indoor air quality, the United States ranks first. We don’t cook by burning biomass, so that isn’t surprising, Jeffrey Geddes, a Boston University professor who studies air quality, told us. The United States ranks 88th on exposure to particulate matter, which Geddes called "a really good indicator for health effects from air pollution." The scientists used satellites and ground-based measurements to collect the data for 228 countries and territories dating from 2008 to 2015. That predates Trump. In general, however, changes between 2018 scores and the baseline (roughly 10 years earlier) are mixed and small, Wendling said. The Environmental Protection Agency’s own research shows a continued decline in air pollutants from 1990. But experts said Trump’s deregulatory practices may have the opposite effect. "Deregulation of automobile emissions standards will increase air pollution, particularly in dense urban areas," said Elizabeth Albright, an environmental science professor at Duke University. Crystal clean water The United States ranks 29th overall in water quality. In drinking water, it ranks first (alongside nine other countries) and in sanitation, 31st. "For both drinking water and sanitation, the United States is performing okay in absolute terms, with about 3.3 disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 people from risks due to unsafe drinking water, as compared to 6.4 for unsafe sanitation," Wendling said. Wendling said the lower sanitation ranking might be explained by rural populations that rely on septic tanks, but there is enough uncertainty in the data that estimates for high-income countries should be treated with caution. Experts said the United States still had a long ways to go before being ranked cleanest. "Any idea we have the freshest water is entirely laughable," said Ashok Gadgil, an environmental engineering professor at Berkeley University. "The U.S. does a very good job of producing relatively clean drinking water at very low cost, but we fall far short on our investments in water infrastructure investments—that was the case in Flint, and it also is the case in thousands of other water systems around the country," said Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer. "Some people could argue it is clean enough for the price, but we are not the cleanest." In 2016, 5,363 water systems serving 17.6 million people violated EPA's lead and copper rule, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalist non-profit group. The White House did not respond our request for comment. Our ruling Trump said, "I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And we’ve got it. We’ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now." No ranking places the United States at the top of their list for cleanliness. The United States has ample room to improve on air quality when it comes to other developed democracies. While some cities’ water systems violate domestic environmental standards, the United States overall ties for best when it comes to drinking water. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-08065	Says that "all those who do not answer directly to the president, they've said (repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell) is a terrible idea."	/texas/statements/2010/dec/23/louie-gohmert/louie-gohmert-says-those-who-dont-answer-directly-/	Objecting to a proposal repealing the law preventing gays and lesbians from serving openly in the U.S. military, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, said he had received hundreds of letters from military personnel vowing not to re-enlist if the change went through. "The hundreds I've heard from, that I didn't bring their quotes down here, have said, you pass this and I will tell you personally, but I will not say it in the presence of my commander, you pass this, I will not re-enlist," Gohmert said on the House floor Dec. 15. "...Because we know what this president, this commander in chief, wants, just as does the secretary of defense, the two people that the president appoints said let's do it, because they know the president appointed, he's their boss, and all those who do not answer directly to the president, they've said this is a terrible idea." The House subsequently voted to repeal the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" law and the Senate followed suit. President Barack Obama signed the change into law Wednesday. Regardless, was Gohmert correct that the two people the president appointed supported the change in law, but that everyone who doesn't answer to Obama gave the idea thumbs-downs? To our request for back-up evidence, Gohmert sent this statement: "The top officers in the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps have voiced grave concerns with ending the DADT policy during a time of war. Any disruption to our military at a time when our troops are in harm’s way is dangerous and could cost lives. One single life lost to a degradation of combat-unit cohesion on the front lines is one life too many." That sent us scrambling for testimony. To recap: On Feb. 2, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each told the Senate Armed Services Committee he favored dropping the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law put in place in 1993. Mullen testified: "No matter how I look at the issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens." According to a Feb. 2 New York Times news article, Mullen was the first sitting chairman of the Joint Chiefs to support repealing the law, saying it was his belief that "allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do." According to the Times, Gates "was more cautious, even as he acknowledged that the question was not whether the law would be repealed, but how the Pentagon might best prepare for the change." Next, we turned to news articles on testimony about the change posted online by the American Forces Press Service. On Dec. 3, the joint chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee; Gen. James Cartwright, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said he favored repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Adm. Gary Roughhead, chief of naval operations, is quoted saying: "With the exception of the moderate risk associated with projected retention and some Navy irregular warfare specialties, I assess the risk of readiness, effectiveness and cohesion to the Navy to be low. Based on my professional judgment and informed by the inputs of our Navy, I recommend repeal." Gen. George Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, is quoted saying he supports repealing the law, but not during wartime. Gen. Norton Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff, and Gen. James Amos, the Marine Corps' top officer, also recommended not repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell while the United States is at war. Scorecard? The defense secretary, chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified in favor of repealing the law. So too did the Navy's Roughhead. However, three of the four joint chiefs — the top officers Gohmert refered to in his statement to us — recommended not repealing the law now. According to federal law, members of the joint chiefs of staff are military advisers to the president, with the chairman — Mullen — being the primary adviser. The chairman is appointed by the president, with advice and consent from the Senate. Next, we turned to the results of a nine-month Pentagon study on the effects of repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell. According to the results, released Nov. 30, the study amounted to one of the largest in the military's history, drawing 115,052 responses to a survey issued to nearly 40,000 active-duty and reserve service members. From the study: "When we asked about how having a service member in their immediate unit who said he or she is gay would affect the unit's ability to 'work together to get the job done,' 70 percent of service members predicted it would have a positive, mixed or no effect... when asked about the actual experience of serving in a unit with a coworker who they believed was gay or lesbian, 92 percent stated that the unit's 'ability to work together' was 'very good,' 'good,' or 'neither good nor poor.'" According to the study, 15 to 20 percent of service members said repeal would have a positive effect, while 30 percent said it would have a negative effect. So, some—not all—military personnel objected to repealing the law, some saying the timing is bad. And not all who don’t answer directly to the president labeled the change a terrible idea.

pomt-13953	There are "500 failing schools in North Carolina"	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jun/16/americans-prosperity-north-carolina-chapter/americans-prosperity-exaggerates-number-failing-sc/	In vouching for a law that would allow some struggling public schools to be taken over by charter schools, the state chapter of the conservative group Americans For Prosperity said one in every five North Carolina public schools is failing. "This Achievement School District legislation is a small first step testing one approach to the long-overdue process of improving 500 failing schools in North Carolina," wrote AFP’s North Carolina director, Donald Bryson, on the group’s website. North Carolina has 2,583 public schools, including 148 charter schools. So if Bryson is right about 500 failing schools, that means nearly 20 percent of schools fall into that category. His proposed solution, a relatively new and controversial program called an achievement school district, or ASD, is moving forward in North Carolina. The ASD program was approved by the N.C. House on June 2 (the day after Bryson published his argument) and is now up for a vote in the Senate. The idea is to take a handful of the lowest-performing schools away from their districts and turn them over to charter school operators. Bryson said it’s noteworthy that there are 500 failing schools because such schools "remain broken education communities, systematically failing to teach tens of thousands of students without any path towards meaningful, long-term reform or improved achievement." We wondered if the picture was really so bleak. How many schools are failing? The state has give out school grades since the 2013-14 school year. Last year, 146 schools received Fs. That’s a far cry from 500, so we asked Bryson where his number came from. He said he was actually underestimating it – that there are 547 low-performing schools, according to a state law that defines the term. However, "low-performing" is not the same as "failing" – the law that Bryson cited includes F schools as well as D schools. And as any slacker can tell you, D’s get degrees. For Bryson to count D schools as failing seems to be self-evidently wrong. But that’s not the whole story. The state gave its schools a grading scale that we all would’ve loved to have had ourselves. While a typical grading scale gives any score below 60 an F and then goes up by 10-point intervals, North Carolina uses the following scale to grade its schools: F: 0-39 D: 40-54 C: 55-69 B: 70-84 A: 85-100 The scores are mostly based on how students do on standardized tests, with a small amount of consideration given to whether the schools met their expected student growth goals. Grades for high schools also include factors like graduation rates. If the state used a traditional scale, every D school (and even some C schools) would have instead received an F. That’s a pretty good argument in Bryson’s favor. We decided we needed to talk to an expert on education policy to determine whether the state had a good reason to give itself this scale, or if it was simply protecting its image. Eric Houck is a former public school teacher who now teaches education policy at UNC-Chapel Hill. He said many academics, including himself, don’t really pay attention to school grades – including the question of whether the scale is too generous. The rubric doesn’t give much weight to how much students improved in a given year, Houck said, and instead focuses mostly on raw scores. He said that punishes schools for having students who came to them below grade level and largely ignores how well teachers did getting those students caught up. "The entire grading system is a little suspect in terms of being able to accurately identify what schools are actually failing," he said. Using growth to measure schools The "low-performing" metric that Bryson cited includes all D and F schools that didn’t meet their growth goals, as well as those that met their growth goals. Those that exceeded their growth goals are not considered low-performing. That’s a bit more in line with Houck’s philosophy on how to best judge schools, but it’s still misleading to say all those students are being left behind. By equating "low-performing" with "failing," Bryson’s claim considers a school to be failing if its average student is a D student whose scores are improving as much as the state expects. A reasonable person wouldn’t say that student is failing. He’s below average, but above the threshold for failure and on track for improvement. And nearly half of the schools Bryson is talking about, 225 of them, are in that category. Paying a bit more attention to growth, like Houck suggested, we found that a better estimate of the number of failing schools could range from 80 to 415, depending on how much you trust the state to have given itself a fair grading scale. 80: The number of F schools in 2014-15 that did not meet their expected growth. 146: The number of F schools in 2014-15. 299: The number of low-performing schools that did not meet their expected growth (out of 547 total low-performing schools). 415: The number of schools that scored 59 or below in 2014-15 and thus would’ve received an F on a traditional grading scale, and which also didn’t meet growth goals. Our ruling It’s hard to say exactly how many failing schools are in North Carolina, but we do know there are not 500 like AFP state director Donald Bryson said. He was referring to low-performing schools, but the majority of low-performing schools are D schools – which most people don’t consider failing. We counted failing schools in a number of ways, with the results ranging from 80 to 415 depending on the grading scale used to define what an F is. Any way you slice it there are clearly dozens, and maybe hundreds, of failing schools statewide. Bryson’s statement was overly broad, but it’s not totally wrong. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03097	"Thanks to (Rick) Perry's bad budgeting, the (Texas) highway department has to convert some modern paved state roads back to gravel."	/texas/statements/2013/sep/24/texans-americas-future-pac/texas-governors-bad-budgeting-not-blame-announced-/	A Democratic group reacted to Republican Gov. Rick Perry bringing his move-to-Texas pitch to Maryland by airing an ad on Baltimore radio stations. In the ad from the Texans for America’s Future PAC, two men twang about Texas starting with one reminding listeners of Perry’s "oops" when during a 2011 Republican presidential debate he did not come up with the name of the third agency he intended to eliminate. Perry similarly has forgotten that one in four Texas children "lives in poverty," the fellow says in the ad. In 2011, some 26 percent of the state’s children lived in households with incomes below the federal poverty line, according to a Sept. 12, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article. In the ad, the second man intones: "And thanks to Perry's bad budgeting, the highway department has to convert some modern paved state roads back to gravel." The Texas Department of Transportation has revealed plans to convert to gravel some paved roads battered by heavy trucks traveling to oil and gas fracking sites. And did this decision result from Perry’s "bad" budgeting? Jeff Rotkoff, Austin spokesman for the group, reminded us by email that as governor, Perry signs lawmaker-advanced state budgets into law. More specifically, Rotkoff said, news accounts show that TxDOT cited finances as a reason to gravel the selected roads. On July 25, 2013, TxDOT’s chief engineer, John Barton, told the agency’s oversight commission that a dozen short farm-to-market road segments, adding up to 83 miles of pavement, were in such poor shape that they were not worth repairing, the Statesman reported in a news article posted online that day. The story said that concurrently, speed limits on the roads would be reduced from a typical 55 mph to 30 mph. The paper quoted Barton as saying TxDOT also planned to post weight limits on an additional 518 miles of roads, some to as low as 20,000 pounds, and restrict vehicles widths to 10 feet or less on an additional 517 miles of road. "We’re at a point where it’s really not safe to have them be asphalt," Barton told the Texas Transportation Commission. A Texas Tribune news story posted that day said that the chosen roads were in four South Texas counties — Live Oak, Dimmit, LaSalle and Zavala — and two West Texas counties — Reeves and Culberson — and that they included a three-mile stretch of frontage road for Interstate 37 in Live Oak County. A month later, though, the agency announced a pause, saying that aside from more than three miles of damaged roads that had already been converted to "high-end gravel," it would enter a two-month review period for the other proposed conversions to see if county governments stepped forward to pay for maintaining the paved roads, the Statesman said in a news story posted online Aug. 29, 2013. Several news accounts said budgetary pressures played into the initial decision to gravel roads. A July 26, 2013, Houston Chronicle news story, for example, quoted Barton as saying: "Our resources are being strained to the point we are having to make difficult decisions." The July Statesman story said that "TxDOT, thanks to more than $20 billion of borrowing, has had a several-year surge of road building, but that bubble of money is due to pop in the next couple of years." The newspaper described TxDOT executive director Phil Wilson as saying that unless lawmakers found new TxDOT funding sources, the agency’s existing level of road contracts, about $6.2 billion this year, would fall to $2.5 billion by the 2015-16 fiscal years and stay there. A Sept. 11, 2013, San Antonio Express-News news article quoted Barton as telling residents at a community meeting about the asphalt-to-gravel plans: "If resources were different, different decisions would be made." The story also quoted Wilson as saying the intent is to repave the roads in the future when funding is available. But none of that news coverage referred to Perry as being to blame for TxDOT’s budget crunch. Perry has long opposed pitches to raise the state’s gas tax, which would generate more money for roads. But he’s also called for money for building and keeping up roads. In his Jan. 29, 2013 State of the State address, Perry urged lawmakers to shift $3.7 billion from the state’s rainy day fund to make one-time investments in road and water projects. Perry also called for ending the diversion of tax revenue from the state’s highway fund, which he said would free up $1.3 billion every two years for road maintenance and construction. Lawmakers later agreed to prevent the diversion of $400 million from the highway fund through 2014-15 and also sent voters a proposed constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would shift $1.2 billion a year in "rainy day" funds to building and maintaining roads and acquiring related right-of-ways. By email, TxDOT spokeswoman Veronica Beyer sent figures indicating that during Perry’s governorship, the agency has annually committed at least $3 billion a year to build and maintain highways. More than $9 billion in commitments occurred in the fiscal year running through August 2009, Beyer said. Over all of Perry’s years, she said, expenditures came from the highway fund, bond funds approved by lawmakers and/or voters and federal aid. Beyer said bringing the 83 miles of roads slated for gravel up to highway strength would cost more than $40 million. Separately, we reached Tim Lomax, a senior research engineer at the Texas Transportation Institute, which says it annually works on hundreds of transportation-related research projects. Lomax, who said he has worked on projects for TxDOT, said by phone he doubts budgetary moves by Perry drove the roads-to-gravel decision. Instead, he suggested, TxDOT rationalized that keeping the particular roads paved didn’t make sense. "Those roads are difficult to maintain," Lomax said. "They could keep pouring money into those roads and still struggle to keep them up… The specifics are (that) if this oil and gas development is going to continue; they’re going to have to keep going out there to repair those roads or they’d have to spend a whole bunch of money to keep those roads in good shape… Why would you invest a whole bunch of money in a road to make it solid and then five years from now, it isn’t being used or not being used for what it was designed?" Our ruling The PAC said that thanks to "Perry's bad budgeting, the (Texas) highway department has to convert some modern paved state roads back to gravel." TxDOT indeed cited financial pressures as a reason for not repaving 83 miles of rural roads that it wants to convert to gravel. But we saw no sign of Perry playing more than his role of signing budgets into law. Those actions don’t strike us as sufficient to blame Perry for the gravel plans, which also reflect the agency’s judgment that it doesn’t make sense to repave certain roads only to have them repeatedly buckle under big trucks part and parcel of the fracking boom. Significantly, too, Perry sought billions of dollars in additional road funding from the 2013 Legislature; some funding came through and voters could approve more.

pomt-06422	GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain called Ron Paul’s followers "ignorant."	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/25/ron-paul/paul-herman-cain-called-federal-reserve-critics-ig/	The New Hampshire Republican presidential primary debate gave voters a glimpse into a bitter feud between what some might consider unlikely political foes: Texas Congressman Ron Paul and Atlanta-area businessman Herman Cain. Moderators gave each candidate one chance to pose a single question to any one of his or her opponents. Paul used his turn to attack Cain. The former Godfather’s Pizza CEO "belittled" him and his followers, who want the Federal Reserve to undergo a major audit, Paul said. "You said -- you've used pretty strong terms -- that we were ignorant and that we didn't know what we were doing, and therefore there is no need for an audit anyway because if you had one you're not going to find out everything because everybody knows everything about the Fed," Paul said during the Oct. 11 debate at Dartmouth College. "I did not call you or any of your people ‘ignorant," Cain fired back. "I don't know where that came from." Did too, Paul shot back: "I’ll get it for you." Paul’s supporters rose to the challenge. Within hours after the debate’s end, the Internet swirled with what they said was proof that Cain called them "ignorant." Cain’s denial caught our attention. Did Cain really call Paul and his followers "ignorant"? The Fed is a touchy issue among many Republicans, especially Paul supporters, who think it conducts too much business behind closed doors. Congress created the central bank of the United States to give the nation a more stable financial system, but Paul thinks the Fed brought about the current economic troubles through backroom dealings and bad policy. He wants the organization audited and abolished. Paul and Cain both consider themselves strict Constitutionalists and enemies of big government, but Cain is a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. For Paul supporters, that’s like having a giant bull’s-eye painted on your back. Even before Cain announced his run for president, Paul supporters were dogging him at campaign stops, asking him to back a full audit of the Fed. (Cain’s position on auditing the Federal Reserve is the subject of a separate PolitiFact item.) We contacted Paul’s camp so it could give us its best evidence against Cain, but it didn’t get back to us. In its absence, we sifted through news accounts, news databases, Internet videos and websites where backers posted what they called key evidence of Cain’s name-calling. We found that Cain isn’t shy about his disdain for Paul’s criticisms. He’s not above calling someone ignorant, either. Last month, he said President Barack Obama showed "ignorance of basic economics." But we found no record that Cain ever called Paul or his backers "ignorant." Bloggers and news accounts repeatedly referred to two sources as proof against Cain: his recently released book "This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House" and a 2010 clip from Neal Boortz’s radio show. Cain frequently subbed in for Boortz when he was a talk show host on radio AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB Let’s take a look at the book. Near the end of the chapter "The Cain Doctrine," Cain wrote that Paul supporters stretch the truth whenever they attend his appearances and say he does not want an audit of the Federal Reserve. Instead of calling Paul backers "ignorant," Cain wrote this: "I get the same stupid question at almost every one of these events. I know it’s a deliberate strategy. How can a person randomly show up at a hundred events and ask the same stupid question to try to nail me on the Federal Reserve? " And this: "But I’ve got news for the Paulites: It’s not going to work, because the American people are a lot smarter than they are." Cain did call some people stupid, but not Paul’s supporters: "[T]here are stupid people out there -- the people who are running this country, and I’m worried about them," Cain wrote. Now for Cain’s radio statement, which Paul backers posted online. "I think a lot of people are calling for this audit of the Federal Reserve because they don’t know enough about it," Cain said, according to their online post. "There’s no hidden secrets going on in the Federal Reserve to my knowledge." Once again, Cain did not use the word "ignorant." He did say backers of a Fed audit need to understand the bank better. How do we rule? Cain said plenty of disparaging things about Paul’s backers. He called their questions "stupid." He said Fed audit backers "don’t know enough about it." He said the American people are are "a lot smarter than they are." You could even say that Cain "belittled" Paul’s followers, as the Texan claimed during the debate. But Paul was very specific that one of the "strong terms" Cain used against his backers was the word "ignorant." Paul said he’d produce proof, but neither he nor his supporters have done so. We couldn’t find any, either. Paul earns a False.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-10-25T06:00:00	2011-10-11	['Herman_Cain', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-12394	Deals struck on his first foreign trip as president made and saved "millions of jobs."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/26/donald-trump/did-donald-trumps-trip-create-or-save-millions-job/	In a tweet from his first foreign trip as president, President Donald Trump touted his accomplishments on one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaign -- jobs. Trump traveled to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Brussels and Rome on a mix of business and diplomatic tasks from May 20 to May 27. "Just arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs," Trump tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Millions of jobs? That would be a massive shot in the arm for the economy. For a sense of scale, Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest private employer, has 2.3 million employees; the second-largest, Yum Brands, which includes Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, has about 500,000. The problem is, the White House has been cagey about exactly where this projection comes from. For starters, Trump’s use of the word "millions" represents a thousand-fold expansion from what Trump had said just days earlier, when he told the audience in a speech in Saudi Arabia: "Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia." Meanwhile, over two days of inquiries to the White House, officials were unable to provide us with full details of the $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which itself is just a portion of the $400 billion investment package Trump cited in his speech. When the Washington Post Fact Checker asked the White House for details about Trump’s tweet, a White House official responded that Trump was referring to "benefits to trade from the entire trip from Saudi Arabia to the G7" -- that is, including Trump’s meetings with the heads of other advanced industrialized nations in Europe toward the end of the trip. (It’s not clear what trade deals were discussed in the European portion of the trip.) In any case, assuming "millions" of jobs from unspecified investments is not justified, economists say. "There’s not enough information to substantiate his claims on millions of jobs," said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody’s. In the meantime, here’s what we know and don’t know. The arms deal The Defense Security Cooperation Agency issued a news release on May 20 saying that the United States and Saudi Arabia agreed to a $110 billion package on five main areas: border security and counterterrorism, maritime and coastal security, air force modernization, air and missile defense, and cybersecurity and communications upgrades. The release detailed six specific areas, with links to documents that offered a dollar amount. They were: • Munitions and support: $6.8 billion; • Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ships: $11.25 billion; • Ammunition for the Royal Saudi Land Forces: $500 million; • Saudi Abrams Main Battle Tanks and HERCULES Armored Recovery Vehicles: $1.15 billion; • Chinook cargo helicopters: $3.51 billion; • Persistent Threat Detection System Aerostats: $525 million. That totals $23.74 billion, leaving $86 billion from the package unspecified. Using other available data, John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, told PolitiFact that he can estimate perhaps $50 billion in arms sales, "most of which was initiated under Obama," he said. Bloomberg calculations Reporters at Bloomberg have written several articles about the deals signed in the Saudi portion of the trip, focusing on agreements outside the $110 billion arms deal. They include: • Agreements signed by Saudi oil company Aramco: $50 billion; • Commitments by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to an infrastructure investment fund with the Blackstone Group. (Blackstone, Bloomberg reported separately, has close ties to the family of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.) $20 billion; • General Electric memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia: $15 billion; • Honeywell International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $3.6 billion; • McDermott International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $2.8 billion; • Jacobs Engineering Group memorandum of understanding: $250 million; • Rowan Companies memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for offshore drilling rigs: $7 billion; • Rowan memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.2 billion; • Nabors Industries memorandum of understanding on well and rig services on an existing joint venture worth $9 billion; • Nabors memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.6 billion; • Weatherford International memorandum of understanding: potential value of $2 billion. That works out to about $112 billion, coming on top of the $110 billion in arms sales. Bloomberg cited a few more items without specific dollar amounts, including a jet purchase from Boeing by SaudiGulf Airlines, and a joint venture between National Oilwell Varco and Saudi Aramco for the manufacture of drilling rigs and equipment. That leaves more than half of Trump’s $400 billion figure -- just for the Saudi leg of the trip -- undisclosed, to say nothing of what deals may have been struck in the European portion of the trip. And for now, the Washington Post reported that several key CEOs of companies that signed deals have been a lot more restrained than Trump about promising specific numbers of jobs. "There is absolutely zero chance that the trip created millions of jobs," said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. Even if jobs were created -- possibly in the thousands, not the millions -- "this may or may not lead to any net job creation, since the Fed could easily offset it with higher interest rates." Our ruling Trump said that deals struck on his first foreign trip as president created and saved "millions of jobs." We can’t know for sure how many jobs will be created or saved -- nor, despite the certainty of his language, does Trump -- but the evidence at this point is so thin and so premature as to be little more than puffery or wishful thinking.

pomt-00914	"Abortions account for 94 percent of the services provided for pregnant women by Planned Parenthood."	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/02/thomas-tobin/ri-bishop-thomas-tobin-says-abortions-make-94-plan/	Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas J. Tobin is an ardent and outspoken abortion opponent. He voiced his opposition recently in the Jan. 22, 2015 edition of The Rhode Island Catholic newspaper in a column entitled "The ‘Throwaway Culture’ Has Arrived at Our Doorstep." In it, he faulted Planned Parenthood as a "destructive, immoral" organization that should not be supported by federal tax dollars. He cited figures to support his position, including that "... Abortions account for 94 percent of the services provided for pregnant women by Planned Parenthood." In the column, Bishop Tobin identified the source of the information as the Susan B. Anthony List, a Washington, D.C.-based organization whose mission is to help elect anti-abortion candidates and pursue policies that will reduce and ultimately end abortion. We reached out to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, which Bishop Tobin leads, to see whether the bishop had additional information to back up his statement. Carolyn E. Cronin, director of communications for the diocese, referred us to a fact sheet put out by the Susan B. Anthony List -- which included the 94-percent figure -- as well as statistics from another anti-abortion organization, Life Issues Institute Inc. Mallory E. Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, referred us to numbers taken from page 18 of Planned Parenthood’s 2013-2014 annual report. "There are 3 options/responses to pregnancy for Planned Parenthood," Quigley said in an email. Abortion services: 327,653 Prenatal referrals: 18,684 Adoption Services: 1,880 Quigley said the sum of those three numbers -- 348,217 -- represents "total pregnancy services." She said the total number of abortions -- 327,653 -- is 94 percent of that total. When we contacted Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, which encompasses Rhode Island, Susan Yolen, the vice president for public policy and advocacy, faulted that calculation -- and Bishop Tobin’s conclusion -- as misleading. Planned Parenthood health centers do not compile the pregnancy status of all their female patients, she said. Nor do they tally the number of pregnant women staff refers to outside obstetricians or other health-care providers, she said. In other words, the number of women receiving "pregnancy services" is not simply the sum of those getting abortions or receiving adoption or prenatal services. Other figures on page 18 of Planned Parenthood’s annual report show that the agency conducted 1.1 million pregnancy tests and another 3.7 million tests for sexually transmitted diseases (for both men and women). Presumably, there were pregnant women in each of those groups who aren’t represented in the Susan B. Anthony lists’ tally. It’s also important to note that the number cited by the Susan B. Anthony List for "total pregnancy services" does not appear in the Planned Parenthood report. Eric Ferrero, vice president for communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, also rebutted Tobin’s numbers. "This meaningless and false claim is part of a campaign to spread misinformation by a group whose sole purpose is to end access to abortion in America," Ferrero wrote in an email. Ferrero cited figures to support his position. "One in five women in America relies on Planned Parenthood at some point in her life for the full range of reproductive health care," he said. "In 2013, Planned Parenthood health centers provided more than 2 million birth control appointments, 1 million pregnancy tests, and 900,000 cancer screenings." In addition, the agency informed us that in 2013, only 9 of Planned Parenthood’s 64 affiliates provided prenatal services at 45 health centers nationwide. Additionally, 14 health centers provided childbirth classes. In other words, the 18,684 cited by the Susan B. Anthony List as receiving "prenatal referrals" reflect only the numbers from those 45 health centers. We asked the Susan B. Anthony List about Planned Parenthood’s response. "The fact that Planned Parenthood refers pregnant women to ob-gyns and other health care centers just underscores our point that they don’t actually provide care for pregnant women and their babies," Quigley said. "They could track that number if they chose, just like they track adoption referrals. Perhaps they will someday." Quigley is right that Planned Parenthood could track the number of pregnant patients it sees, if it chose. Planned Parenthood told us that its records would not indicate a patient’s pregnancy status unless it was specified as the reason for the visit. Also worth considering is that Planned Parenthood’s numbers are self-reported, as PolitiFact affiliates have noted in previous fact-checks on similar claims. (In 2011, PolitiFact Ohio ruled False on a claim that 32 of every 33 pregnant women who visit Planned Parenthood get abortions. That same year, PolitiFact Florida ruled False on a claim that abortion services are "well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does".) Without knowing how many pregnant women Planned Parenthood sees at all its clinics, it is impossible to calculate what percentage abortions make up of the overall services to expectant mothers. But that’s what exactly what the Susan B. Anthony List did, reaching a flawed conclusion. Our ruling Bishop Thomas Tobin said that "... Abortions account for 94 percent of the services provided for pregnant women by Planned Parenthood." He cited as his source the Susan B. Anthony List, which arrived at that percentage using numbers that don’t represent all services provided to pregnant women by Planned Parenthood. Because Planned Parenthood says it doesn’t track that number, we don’t know what percentage of pregnant women seen by the agency receive abortions. But neither does the Susan B. Anthony -- nor Bishop Tobin. We rate his claim False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-09176	"Barbara Boxer's worried about the weather" instead of terrorism as the biggest threat to national security.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/04/carly-fiorina/fiorina-attacks-boxer-caring-more-about-weather-te/	The latest ad from California Senate candidate Carly Fiorina -- who is running in the Republican primary to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer -- mocks Boxer for saying in 2007 that "one of the very important national security issues frankly is climate change." After playing a clip of Boxer's statement, Fiorina faces the camera and responds, "Terrorism kills, and Barbara Boxer's worried about the weather." No one doubts that Boxer made the comment. But we wanted to check the context of Boxer's remark and see if Fiorina was quoting it accurately. We examined three elements: • How well-accepted is the idea of climate change as a national security threat? Sufficiently well-established to have been been promoted by both the Pentagon and CIA. A Quadrennial Defense Review Report issued by the Department of Defense in February 2010 states that "assessments conducted by the intelligence community indicate that climate change could have significant geopolitical impacts around the world, contributing to poverty, environmental degradation, and the further weakening of fragile governments. Climate change will contribute to food and water scarcity, will increase the spread of disease, and may spur or exacerbate mass migration." It concludes that "while climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world." Meanwhile, on Sept. 25, 2009, the CIA announced the launch of a Center on Climate Change and National Security. According to a CIA press release announcing the launch, the center's charter "is not the science of climate change," but rather "the national security impact of phenomena such as desertification, rising sea levels, population shifts, and heightened competition for natural resources." So while there is certainly room for disagreement about how big a national security threat climate change will ultimately be, Boxer is hardly advocating a fringe theory. The notion that climate change will be significant is being discussed at the Pentagon and the CIA. • Is it fair to say that Boxer's concern about climate change amounts to being "worried about the weather"? This comment conflates two concepts that people often confuse, but are actually quite different. "Weather" refers to daily variations in sun, precipitation, wind, heat and cold. "Climate," by contrast, refers to typical atmospheric patterns over a much longer time scale. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines "climate" as "the average course or condition of the weather at a place usually over a period of years as exhibited by temperature, wind velocity, and precipitation." A more lighthearted explanation is "climate is what you expect; weather is what you get." We asked 10 experts -- a mix of governmental and academic climate scientists, broadcast meteorologists and climate policy specialists at think tanks -- whether there is a broad consensus among their peers that weather and climate are different concepts. They all agreed that there is. "There is no debate between scientists and meteorologists, as the terms 'weather' and 'climate' are not interchangeable," said Drew Jackson, a former meteorologist with KPTV-TV in Portland, Ore. "Scientists, meteorologists and climatologists fully understand that." The closest that one of our experts came to detecting some justification in Fiorina's conflation of the two fields came in comments by Samuel Thernstrom, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He noted that climate change does cause changes in weather, meaning that Fiorina's statement is "not necessarily inaccurate." But even he added that her phrasing in the ad "is pejorative and arguably misleading," and we agree. • By focusing on the threat of climate change, did Boxer somehow ignore the issue of terrorism? We should begin by noting that Boxer chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which gives her a key perch for discussing environmental issues. She's also on the Foreign Relations Committee, but does not sit on either Homeland Security or Armed Services, two panels that more directly address terrorism. In addition, it's not clear to us that having concern over climate change and terrorism are mutually exclusive. Still, we think it's valid to review Boxer's record on terrorism. Critics point to her 2007 vote against a supplemental funding bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as evidence she is soft on terrorism. Boxer said she voted against it for tactical reasons -- she and some of her fellow Democrats were seeking to tie further war funding to a more explicit troop withdrawal date. The critics also cite her votes against $86 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, as well as her vote against the use of military force in Iraq in 2002. At the same time, opponents accuse Boxer of being soft on the treatment of terrorism suspects. In 2006, for example, Boxer voted to preserve habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo detainees. She also voted in 2006 against extending the wiretapping provision of the PATRIOT Act. On the other hand, Boxer's campaign offers a number of initiatives she's made on terrorism, including: • Leading a bipartisan coalition in 2002 to pass an amendment allowing commercial airline pilots to carry guns in cockpits and providing flight crews self-defense training. She also wrote a law to put more air marshals on high-risk flights, such as the nonstop cross-country flights that were hijacked on Sept. 11. • Voting for President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package, which included more than $300 million to strengthen port security, public transportation security and railroad security. It also included $680 million to strengthen border security and $1 billion for airport security. • Cosponsoring of the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act, to give the president expanded authority to impose new economic penalties on foreign firms involved in the export of gasoline and other refined petroleum products to Iran. • Voting in 2009 for a war supplemental spending bill proposed by Obama to fund a troop surge in Afghanistan. "I am voting for this bill not because I want the U.S. to remain bogged down in two wars but because I want to give this administration, the Obama Administration, the resources it needs to successfully end the wars starting with the war in Iraq," Boxer said in a floor speech. "Furthermore, I do not support an open-ended commitment of American troops to Afghanistan, and if we do not see measurable progress, we must reconsider our engagement and our strategy there." • Voting in 2007 to implement the 9/11 Commission report. • Supporting a bill to establish a global strategy to defeat al-Qaida in 2008. So to recap, Fiorina is guilty of a major distortion here. Boxer brought up climate change and said it was "one of the very important national security issues," but Fiorina ignores that wording and portrays it as if Boxer cited it as the only priority. In addition, Fiorina casts climate change as something you need to pack an umbrella for, or that prompts you to curse at the TV weatherman -- which strikes us as not only a trivialization of climate change but also a failure to distinguish between two well-established scientific specialties. She also ignores Boxer's lengthy record supporting bills against terrorism. So we have to light up the meter: Pants on Fire!	None	Carly Fiorina	None	None	None	2010-06-04T17:54:16	2010-06-02	['None']

pomt-03496	"RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country."	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/09/abel-collins/sierra-clubs-abel-collins-says-rhode-island-public/	Public transportation was one of the topics when Abel Collins, program manager for the Rhode Island chapter of the Sierra Club, was a guest on the June 2 edition of "10 News Conference." Collins, an unsuccessful independent candidate for Congress in the 2nd District in 2012, said one goal of his organization is to cut pollution by getting better funding for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, which operates the state’s bus system. "They're stuck. They have declining revenues and increasing demand. And RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country," he said. "So it's really something that should get more attention and hopefully this is the year that the General Assembly sees fit to give RIPTA sustainable funding for the long term. There's a bill to do that and we've been pushing on it for years." We wondered whether RIPTA does, in fact, have some of the fullest buses around. We called Collins. He said he was told that factoid by Mark Therrien, the authority's assistant general manager for planning. We called Therrien. He said Collins was correct. When we asked for details, he referred us to the Integrated National Transit Database Analysis System (INTDAS) which has national statistics over many years for transit systems throughout the United States. The database will generate a list of comparable transit systems around the country. We did that for RIPTA and decided to focus on the 30 that were closest based on a variety of measures such as size, according to the federal ranking. We also looked at six other systems -- in Eugene, Ore.; Fort Worth, Texas; Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; Louisville, Ky.; and Des Moines, Iowa -- that Therrien said were comparable as well. But what to look at? The database, whose most recent statistics were from 2011, doesn't include a direct measurement of how full the buses are. We discovered there were a lot of indirect ways to estimate capacity that gave different rankings. Therrien said we should look at passengers per hour. By that measure, RIPTA ranked 8th out of 37 systems. We also looked at the number of passenger trips divided by the number of vehicles in operation during peak hours. RIPTA ranked 9th by that measure. Meanwhile, we received an e-mail from Albert Gan, a professor with the department of civil and environmental engineering at Florida International University, who developed the INTDAS system. He said the correct method would be to divide the number of passenger miles in a year by the number of miles driven when the buses were picking and dropping off passengers (known as revenue miles). By that measure, RIPTA ranked 13th out of 37. Then we heard back from Therrien's office, which advised us that it was best to look at the number of passenger trips divided by the number of revenue miles. In that instance, RIPTA ranked 10th. Some other systems were pretty crowded using that yardstick. Milwaukee had 24 percent more passengers per bus than Providence; Madison had 34 percent more; Eugene had 39 percent more; and Rochester, N.Y. had 46 percent more. To sum up, Abel Collins said, "RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country." "Some of the fullest" is a little vague, but it implies that Rhode Island is going to be up there in the rankings. RIPTA, asked about the claim, suggested that we look at 11 transit systems. We ultimately analyzed data on more than three times that many, using a federal rating method that listed bus services comparable to Rhode Island's. RIPTA's rankings ranged from 8th to 13th. They varied a bit because there's no standardized way to calculate who has the "fullest" buses. Because there's some uncertainty but the different methods show RIPTA ranking high, we rate Collins' statement Mostly True.

pomt-03882	Says if Oregon had limited its budget growth to the rate of population growth plus the rate of inflation, the state’s all-funds budget would be about $27 billion today, not $60 billion.	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/06/doug-whitsett/would-oregons-budget-be-dramatically-smaller-if-pe/	Fiscally conservative members of the Oregon Legislature never much like the size of the state’s budget. But once something is funded, it’s never easy to muster the political willpower to take the cash away. In a recent opinion piece for The Oregonian, Sen. Doug Whitsett, a Republican from Klamath Falls, offered a creative solution: Peg state spending to population growth and inflation. "Oregon desperately needs to establish a constitutional limit on the growth of state spending," he wrote. He maintains that the $60 billion all-funds budget is growing out of control. Whitsett noted that the state’s Legislative Fiscal Office, which keeps a close eye on the budget, had illustrated "for purpose of comparisons" what Oregon’s all-funds budget would look like today if his proposal had been implemented 20 years ago. "Oregon spent about $20 billion in all-funds budgets 20 years ago," he wrote. "With this spending limit in place, the state’s all-funds budget would be about $27 billion today." That’s a nearly $33 billion difference. A huge amount of money for a state like Oregon. So huge, in fact, that PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know whether Whitsett was right. We spoke with Whitsett, who said that he’d gotten this statistic from a presentation that the fiscal office had given at the beginning of the current legislative session. So we called Ken Rocco, the office’s director, and asked him if he remembered this. Rocco got back to us via e-mail. He offered two pieces of caution. First: There was no reason in particular that his office chose the budget from 20 years ago to use for their projection. Second: The data the senator had referred to in his opinion piece hadn’t been calculated accurately. "In looking at this chart, the data presented claimed it was inflating the 1991-93 base year by both inflation and population growth, but when I looked more closely at the data today, it was actually only for inflation." In fact, he noted, if the calculations been done right, the actual 2011-13 budget -- pegged to population growth and inflation -- would be about $36 billion. "This was not the Senator’s mistake, but LFO’s," Rocco noted. Nevertheless, the point Whitsett was trying to make -- that spending growth has happened beyond just normal population growth -- remains true, Rocco said. "There are a number of other drivers to budget growth than simply inflation and population increases, such as specific caseload growth, additional mandate programs that require funding, etc." Let us point out here that the all-funds budget is just that -- all funds. It includes not only the general fund, which lawmakers can allocate however they choose, but also federal money, bond revenue, gas taxes, fees -- in short, a whole lot of money dedicated for specific purposes. Now, allow us to offer up a slight tangent. Whitsett’s idea is not entirely new. Back in 2006, Measure 48 was put on the Oregon ballot. That measure would have limited any increase in state spending to population growth and inflation increases. It turned out, this had nothing to do with what Whitsett was writing about, but we bring it up because it illustrates an important point: Measure 48 didn’t apply to things like federal funds. That’s huge given that nearly a fourth of the state budget comes from federal funds. For instance, about $15 billion of the upcoming all-funds budget comes from federal sources -- that’s about a quarter of the total. Twenty years ago, federal funds only accounted for about 15 percent of the total. If you were to play by Measure 48’s rules and add that chunk of change to the $36 billion that the fiscal office projected, you’d get an all-funds budget closer to $42 billion. That, of course would still mean about $18 billion in less budget growth over 20 years. That is no small thing -- but it’s still a lot closer to the current all-funds budget than the initial $27 billion Whitsett mentioned. Whitsett also pointed out, during an interview, that it would be a mistake to assume the federal government will keep providing a quarter of the state’s all-funds budget. "At some point in time that has to reverse … the current sequester might be a part of that." Whitsett said that if we had curbed budget growth 20 years ago by pegging it to population growth and inflation, our budget would be about $27 billion today instead of $60 billion. He was referring to an inaccurate calculation made by a typically unimpeachable source. The figure is actually closer to $36 billion. We won’t hold their error against Whitsett, but we do think it’s important to note that, if federal funds are a concern at all, our budget wouldn’t be quite as slight as Whitsett predicted. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Doug Whitsett	None	None	None	2013-03-06T16:43:31	2013-02-18	['Oregon']

pomt-13017	Says actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson wore a T-shirt stating: "We Stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen."	/texas/statements/2016/dec/07/sid-miller/sid-miller-posts-manipulated-photo-the-rock-facebo/	Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner perhaps destined to join President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, has a prolific social media presence. The politician regularly posts memes, photos and his reactions to daily news, at times critical of reporting and often without attribution. His "Miller for Texas" Facebook fan page has more than 330,000 likes. On Nov. 27, 2016, Miller posted a fresh unattributed photo, this time of the muscled actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, shown wearing a T-shirt with a message Miller endorsed. Johnson’s shirt read: "We stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen," along with this Miller caption: "Thanks to Dewayne Johnson AKA "The Rock" for standing up and defending our flag. There are a few good guys left in Hollywood and The Rock is one of them." As of early December 2016, Miller’s Johnson post had drawn 3,500 reactions, 1,092 shares and 111 comments, all supportive, some praising Johnson for being a "stand up guy" who’s "not ashamed to admit" his love for country, or telling Johnson "he is The Rock for a reason." Is photo real? But when we saw the photo presentation, it looked to us like the unsourced photo’s shirt text had alignment problems. Also, the text on the T-shirt looked skewed and a smudge next to Johnson’s right arm looked as if there might have been additional removed text or imagery. We knew too that Miller had previously posted a photo lacking accuracy. In March 2016, we found "Pants on Fire" what turned out to be Miller’s Facebook post of a fake image of Barack Obama holding a T-shirt with Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara’s face on it. Separately, the Texas Tribune in December 2016 compiled what its story described as 10 Miller posts of "demonstrably false, misleading or unsupported information." A reverse image search We started our review of the Johnson photo posted by Miller by conducting a reverse Google image search of it. Such a search enables anyone to pull up similar images across the web, demonstrating if other versions have been posted in digital spaces. If multiple versions of a photo exist online, a reverse Google image search can show some of the different iterations. What came back from our search: The same T-shirt and Johnson pose with other slogans displayed, such as "Only elephants should wear ivory" or "Still here, still strong, Native Pride." Additional results showed Johnson standing in a blank V-neck T-shirt, without any text. And among those, one photo came from the cover of the August 2013 issue of Essence Magazine; that photo shows Johnson wearing a similarly fitting navy blue V-neck T-shirt, without any text on the shirt. Then again, Johnson holds a different pose and presents a different facial expression. Other results--on websites such as Pinterest and Mid-day.com, an Indian news and lifestyle website--showed what looked to us like a blank T-shirt version of the Miller-posted photo. Miller spokesman calls inquiry 'silly' So, what gives? We turned to a Miller campaign spokesman, Todd Smith, to find out where Miller picked up his Facebook-posted photo. Smith said he personally "had no clue" and said ours was a "silly, silly inquiry." He said the message of the T-shirt is what counts. When asked what his comment would be if the photo itself was fake, he said he hadn’t heard complaints from Johnson. Johnson representative says Miller photo 'photoshopped' Next, we endeavored to reach someone familiar with Johnson’s photo history. After calling Johnson’s public relations team, we heard from Britt Johnson with the Garcia Companies, who identifies herself as a social media spokesperson for Johnson. Britt Johnson said by email: "While I can't recall where that photo was taken, I can say with confidence that the image/shirt" shared by Miller "was photoshopped." Forensic photography expert Separately, a web search led us to a forensic photography expert at the Forensic and National Security Sciences Institute at Syracuse University. By email, Cathryn Lahm responded that what she looked at after downloading a copy of the photo we’d shared from Miller’s Facebook post and viewing the photo in her software program, "the T-shirt The Rock is wearing is most likely ‘plain’ and the graphics were placed on the photo -- made to look -- like it was actually on his shirt," referring to the pro-flag message. She said the artist likely applied the graphic design onto an existing image, so Johnson would look like he was wearing the presented T-shirt. "The original image was shot at some press event -- I think -- based on the ‘hot flash shadows’ as if he is walking the red carpet for some opening of a movie or an event," Lahm said. If she "had to go to court" about the authenticity of the Miller-posted photo, Lahm said, she would call the image a fake. Our ruling Miller posted a photo of "The Rock" wearing a T-shirt with a message calling for people to "stand for the flag and kneel for the fallen." That image, we found, was a product of photo manipulation. It looks to us like Johnson actually posed in a plain shirt without any message. We rate this photo post False.

pomt-06224	U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz "has blamed the Republicans for the creation of Hamas."	/florida/statements/2011/dec/05/karen-harrington/gop-challenger-says-debbie-wasserman-schultz-blame/	Republican Karen Harrington is making her second attempt at unseating U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston -- and she is going after one of the incumbent's bases -- the Jewish vote in a district with a significant Jewish population. Harrington, a Catholic who lost to Wasserman Schultz by about 22 percentage points in 2010 and is now running in a GOP primary, wants to define herself as the candidate who is the stronger supporter of Israel. Harrington talked up her support of Israel and her Jewish voter outreach in this Nov. 12, 2011, interview with a conservative blogger at BlogCon -- a gathering of bloggers held in Denver and hosted by FreedomWorks, a conservative organization. When the blogger talked about "the president's failed stance on Israel," and called Obama an "antagonist" to Israel, Harrington responded: "Debbie's latest thing as well as her lack of support for Israel -- is 'cause she has to stand by this president -- she also has blamed the Republicans for the creation of Hamas -- that's been her latest thing. This president asked them to stop building in the settlements, asked them to return to the '67 borders and just the other day was caught with (French President Nicolas) Sarkozy saying negative things about Israel. This is a country and a nation that needs to stand by Israel as our history has shown us to. And Debbie supports this president and his policies, and you are right -- Israel has become more endangered over there because of our approach and lack of strong support of Israel." That's a whole lot of claims about Wasserman Schultz and Obama rolled into one paragraph (read about the Sarkozy-Obama conversation about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu here). But we wanted to know: Has Wasserman Schultz blamed the Republicans for creating Hamas? What Wasserman Schultz actually said about Hamas Harrington's campaign sent us a link to the Shark Tank, a conservative blog, that posted this Oct. 31, 2011, video of Wasserman Schultz from a town hall in Pembroke Pines under the headline "Wasserman Schultz blames Bush for Hamas' rise to power." The gathering was part of a string of meetings the Jewish congresswoman and Democratic National Committee chair held in South Florida in an attempt to shore up Obama's Jewish support and portray him as a strong ally of Israel. The Shark Tank video shows just a clip, and we'll start from the relevant part where Wasserman Schultz talks about keeping tabs on the Arab Spring countries: "We are very, very watchful. We are sticking to them like glue. All of those countries that have gone through the Arab Spring to make sure that the forces that would be interested in ... changing their nations' aggression or lack of aggression toward Israel are held at bay and that we give support to allowing these nascent democracies to begin to survive. And we have to be careful. Here is the thing about democracy. You kind of never know what you are going to get. We have to be careful with be careful what you wish for scenarios. Remember when President Bush pushed for democracy in Gaza and the West Bank, and we got Hamas in charge of Gaza, and you know there was a massive rift and the rise of Hamas is thanks to 'democracy.' So making sure that we keep a close watch and close communications with those countries and help them through the development of those nascent democracies is going to be critical for us in helping to make sure Israel remains strong and isn't overwhelmed." Wasserman Schultz was making a point about the potential perils of democracy and using a Hamas victory, after President George W. Bush promoted democracy, as an example. Harrington used a sliver of that statement to claim that what Wasserman Schultz did was "blame the Republicans for the creation of Hamas." But before we pick apart Harrington's and Wasserman Schultz's words, let's review some history about Hamas. Origins of Hamas Hamas is the largest and most influential Palestinian militant movement, according to this background information about Hamas we pulled directly from The Council on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank: "Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, a religious and political organization founded in Egypt with branches throughout the Arab world. Beginning in the late 1960s, Hamas' founder and spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, preached and did charitable work in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, both of which were occupied by Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. In 1973, Yassin established al-Mujamma' al-Islami (the Islamic Center) to coordinate the Muslim Brotherhood's political activities in Gaza. Yassin founded Hamas as the Muslim Brotherhood's local political arm in December 1987, following the eruption of the first intifada, a Palestinian uprising against Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas published its official charter in 1988, moving decidedly away from the Muslim Brotherhood's ethos of nonviolence." The Council on Foreign Relations also provided this information about Hamas: "In January 2006, the group won the Palestinian Authority's (PA) general legislative elections, defeating Fatah, the party of the PA's president, Mahmoud Abbas, and setting the stage for a power struggle. Since attaining power, Hamas has continued its refusal to recognize the state of Israel, leading to crippling economic sanctions. Historically, Hamas has sponsored an extensive social service network. The group has also operated a terrorist wing, carrying out suicide bombings and attacks using mortars and short-range rockets. Hamas has launched attacks both in the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and inside the pre-1967 boundaries of Israel. In Arabic, the word 'hamas' means zeal. But it's also an Arabic acronym for 'Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya,' or Islamic Resistance Movement." Hamas under President Bush We're fact-checking Harrington here, but since she cites Wasserman Schultz's comments about Hamas under President Bush, we sent both candidates' statements to experts on the Middle East including Aaron Miller, a former adviser to six Secretaries of State on Arab-Israeli negotiations, 1978-2003, who now works at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, and Elliott Abrams, who was the deputy national security adviser handling Middle East affairs in the George W. Bush administration and now works at the Council on Foreign Relations. Bush called for the Palestinians to hold elections in a 2002 speech: "My vision is two states, living side by side, in peace and security. There is simply no way to achieve that peace until all parties fight terror. Yet at this critical moment, if all parties will break with the past and set out on a new path, we can overcome the darkness with the light of hope. Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership, so that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror." And in his second inaugural address in January 2005, Bush also spoke about supporting "the growth of Democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture." Bush was warned that Hamas could win. In January 2006, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian Parliament beating the governing Fatah, the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The Washington Post wrote that the "election results stunned U.S. and Israeli officials, who have repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas, which both countries and the European Union have designated as a terrorist organization." Bush defended his efforts to promote democracy despite the outcome. (Liz Cheney, who served in the state department under Bush and is the daughter of Bush's vice president Dick Cheney, later said that Bush made a mistake.) The election that Hamas won was in February 2006, and Hamas took over Gaza by military coup in June 2007, Abrams said in an e-mail. "So we did not 'get Hamas in charge of Gaza' due to the 2006 election," Abrams wrote. "The rise of Islamist movements is global, from Pakistan to Nigeria to Tunisia, and is not the result of 'democracy.' Palestinian politics is no exception, and Hamas had been growing in strength for many years before 2006. The most one can say is that the 2006 election allowed Hamas to demonstrate the support it had, just as elections in Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco appear to be showing that Islamist groups have considerable support there, too. The rise of Hamas can’t be explained by any one cause but certainly reflects distaste for the corruption of the rival Fatah Party, greater religiosity, and support for violence against Israel." This Vanity Fair article takes a critical look at the Bush administration's role -- including Abrams -- in pushing for elections. It's possible to argue that Bush may have misjudged the results of the election, but he isn't to blame for Hamas' victory, Miller said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida. "Whenever you have fair and free elections anywhere in the Arab and Muslim world the Islamic parties are going to do extremely well -- they are the most organized, disciplined and their messaging and control is really on the money. ... The question is do you blame the Bush administration for the rise of Hamas? The answer is no. You could criticize the Bush administration for pressing for elections when they didn't realize what the outcome would be, but you cannot blame the Bush administration for the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and Islamists in Gaza. That rise is attributed to Fatah's corruption, Hamas' discipline, the existence of the Israeli occupation. There are so many forces that would be standing in line before President Bush to take responsibility for that." Wasserman Schultz's words Words matter in every PolitiFact ruling, but especially in this one. Harrington said Wasserman Schultz "has blamed the Republicans for the creation of Hamas." But read Wasserman Schultz's comments again: "Here is the thing about democracy," she said. "You kind of never know what you are going to get. We have to be careful with be careful what you wish for scenarios. Remember when President Bush pushed for democracy in Gaza and the West Bank and we got Hamas in charge of Gaza and you know there was a massive rift, and the rise of Hamas is thanks to 'democracy.' " She's not saying Bush or Republicans created Hamas. She's saying that there can be a downside to pushing for democracy in that when you advocate for change, you can't control what that change ultimately looks like. Jonathan Beeton, Wasserman Schultz's office spokesman, explains in an interview: "That was a broader conversation about the Arab Spring and democracy. In a democratic election, in a situation like that, you can end up with electing people who might not be favorable to Israel or America. ... It was elections pushed for by the Bush administration that ultimately did bring Hamas into a more formal leadership control over Gaza." Our ruling Harrington said Wasserman Schultz "has blamed the Republicans for the creation of Hamas." Harrington didn't explain what she meant during the interview, but her campaign points to a statement Wasserman Schultz made about democracy in the Middle East. Only, Wasserman Schultz didn't blame the Republicans or President George W. Bush for the "creation" of Hamas, although she did suggest that Bush's push for democracy led to Hamas taking charge of Gaza. We are fact-checking Harrington's words here and she has misquoted Wasserman Schultz -- blaming Republicans for the creation of Hamas is different than blaming a Republican administration for promoting democracy and then charging that that led to Hamas being in charge of Gaza. When Wasserman Schultz said "the rise of Hamas thanks to 'democracy' " she isn't talking about the original birth of Hamas -- she is talking about their increased role in Gaza.

pomt-04603	"Seven times Obama could have stopped China's cheating. Seven times, he refused."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/19/mitt-romney/romney-ad-accuses-obama-refusing-seven-times-stop-/	A campaign ad for Mitt Romney accuses President Barack Obama of failing to confront China to protect American manufacturing jobs. "Under Obama, we've lost over half a million manufacturing jobs," the narrator says. "And for the first time, China is beating us. Seven times Obama could have stopped China's cheating. Seven times, he refused." We’ve looked before at claims about manufacturing job losses and gains under Obama, finding it True that the United States has created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years. (That’s right — the country’s actually gaining now, though not yet by enough to replace the drop in Obama’s early months.) But Democrats have overstepped when they claimed we’ve added " millions of jobs in manufacturing." Still, Romney’s pushed for a harder stance on Chinese trade, while portraying Obama as weak. For this fact-check, we’re examining whether "seven times Obama could have stopped China’s cheating" and "seven times, he refused." What happened ‘seven times’? The Romney campaign posted a news release Sept. 17, 2012, explaining its reasoning. It says that under Obama, the U.S. Treasury Department has refused seven times to label China as a "currency manipulator." A little background: Twice a year, the Treasury Department must report to Congress on "the currency practices of America's major trading partners." If it tells Congress that a country has engaged in manipulating its currency — say, keeping the value of its currency artificially low to boost its exports, as China’s been known to do — that triggers a process to start "expedited" negotiations with the country, perhaps drawing in the International Monetary Fund. The legal designation also prompts Congress to take action to punish the offender. Slapping China with the label has support from some think tanks, unions, businesses and members of Congress, who urged President George W. Bush and Obama to take the step. Candidate Obama, in fact, pushed for a tougher stance. The number of times his administration declined to name China a currency manipulator "is a check on whether Obama administration trade policy has succeeded by the light of his own 2008 promises. It has not," said Philip Levy, a Romney supporter who teaches global economics at the Darden School of Business at University of Virginia. (We rated an Obama promise to urge China to stop manipulation of its currency value a Compromise.) But a "currency manipulator" label isn’t the only way to take China to task for its trade practices. Nor does it automatically stop China’s cheating, as Romney put it. The last time Treasury cited China as a currency manipulator was in 1994. Negotiations afterward didn’t produce any major results. Since then, U.S. presidents have argued for a more diplomatic approach. Bush’s Treasury Department, for example, didn’t call China a currency manipulator, but encouraged the country’s membership in the World Trade Organization. It joined in 2001. As a WTO member, China must play by the rules or face trade cases filed by other member countries. The value of China’s currency, the renminbi, started to rise in 2005 as it worked to bring its policies into line with international trade rules. That rise has stalled in recent years as China grappled with international financial uncertainty. And that’s renewed calls for the "currency manipulator" label. "The administration continues to let China get away with flouting trade rules just for the sake of diplomacy," Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y, said in a statement reported by The Hill in May 2012. "Calling out China as a manipulator may be awkward, but it is time to take off the kid glove." Different measures Experts told us that while Romney’s campaign is right that Obama hasn’t labeled China a currency manipulator, that’s not the same thing as failing to pressure China over its trade practices. "The criterion the Romney campaign is using to judge Obama's China trade policy is ridiculously narrow," said Paul Blustein, a trade expert with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. "... I'm by no means a big fan of the Obama administration's trade policy toward China, but I think it's absurd to make it sound as if the administration has been somehow ignoring unfair trade practices by the Chinese." Obama’s administration has filed trade cases with the WTO over issues such as auto parts and flat-rolled electrical steel, and plans more. It also pursued remedies through the U.S. International Trade Commission and created an Interagency Trade Enforcement Center. The Bush Administration brought seven WTO cases over two terms. The Obama administration has already filed seven. (That’s prompted Obama’s campaign staff to say the administration has brought trade cases "at nearly twice the rate" as Bush did, something we’ve found just Half True because of the timing of China’s WTO membership.) Meanwhile, the Obama team has "urged China" to let its currency gain value vs. the dollar in periodic talks, said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow for the Peterson Institute for International Economics who writes about U.S.-China trade and worked in the Carter and Ford administrations. "I would characterize Obama's economic policy towards China as 'case-by-case' litigation and diplomacy," he said. "By contrast, Romney urges a broader brush, more strategic confrontation." Our ruling A Romney campaign ad claims that "seven times Obama could have stopped China's cheating. Seven times, he refused." It’s true that the Obama administration passed up seven opportunities to label China a currency manipulator, something it’s been encouraged to do by some members of Congress, unions and businesses. But that designation in 1994 and earlier didn’t stop the kind of "cheating" Romney’s talking about. Meanwhile, the ad makes it sound as though Obama "refused" to take on China over unfair trade practices. The administration hasn’t done as much as some on the right and left have demanded, but among other things it has filed seven trade cases with the WTO — with more coming — and engaged in diplomatic talks. The claim is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-09-19T17:47:09	2012-09-13	['China', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-03055	Shutdowns are "a normal part of the constitutional process," with 12 shutdowns under Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill and two during his own speakership.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/04/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-late-speaker-tip-oneill-served-/	Newt Gingrich knows a thing or two about government shutdowns. When he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1995 and 1996, the Georgia Republican was involved in two of them. In fact, they were the most recent examples of a federal government-wide closure before the one we’re experiencing right now. On a recent edition of CNN’s Crossfire, where Gingrich is now one of the hosts, he drew on this experience to put the current shutdown into historical context. "Tonight there is an amazing amount of hysteria and vitriol over what is a normal part of the constitutional process," Gingrich said during the Sept. 30, 2013, edition of the show. "The government shut down 12 times under Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill. It was only shut down twice while I was speaker." The U.S. government was shut down 12 times when O’Neill was speaker and Ronald Reagan was president? We didn’t remember that. On the other hand, we did remember shutdowns under Gingrich, and we wouldn’t classify them as a "normal part of the constitutional process." We decided to investigate. The numbers What causes a shutdown is fairly simple: It happens when appropriations bills expire, and Congress and the president can’t agree on new ones. Shutdowns have a constitutional basis, from Article I, Section 9, which says, "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." This has been reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, which stems from an 1870 law that has been revised periodically over the years. The act provides exceptions only for "emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property." We found a list of recent shutdowns, from 1976 to right before the current shutdown, in a report from the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. Gingrich was right on the numbers: O’Neill, a Massachusetts Democrat, served as speaker from January 1977 to January 1987. Twelve of the 17 shutdowns happened during his speakership. Two others came during Gingrich’s tenure. (One each occurred under Speakers Carl Albert, Jim Wright and Tom Foley.) Still, we found a lot of context that was at odds with Gingrich’s implication that all of those shutdowns were similar, or that they were a "normal" part of governance. A fair comparison? Gingrich equated the shutdowns under O’Neill with those during his own tenure. But we found the nature of shutdowns and the reasons they happened have changed significantly since the 1980s. Here’s why: • Five of the 12 cases under O’Neill didn’t result in genuine shutdowns. Five of the shutdowns that happened under O’Neill happened before 1980, when new legal opinions changed how shutdowns happened. Prior to 1980, many federal agencies continued to operate during funding gaps, assuming that money would be restored soon and that Congress didn’t intend for them to close down. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued two opinions that required agency heads to suspend operations until funding began to flow again. The only activities that could go forward, Civiletti wrote, were those where there is a connection "between the function to be performed and the safety of human life or the protection of property," or where otherwise "authorized by law." So right off the bat, it’s not really accurate to equate the first five episodes under O’Neill to either of the Gingrich-era shutdowns, or, for that matter, to the current one. The first five shutdowns under O’Neill were hardly apocalyptic events in which hundreds of thousands of federal workers were forced to stay home. By contrast, in the second and longer of the shutdowns under Gingrich, roughly 280,000 executive branch employees were furloughed, government contractors were laid off and government services were delayed, CRS noted. • The remaining seven shutdowns under O'Neill were much shorter than either of those under Gingrich. Of the seven O’Neill-era shutdowns after the Civiletti memos, the longest lasted three days, and the total duration for all of them was 13 days. That’s half the cumulative length of the two Gingrich shutdowns, which lasted 26 days. In addition, three of those happened primarily on weekends, further minimizing their impact. A one-day shutdown in October 1982, the Washington Post recently noted, stemmed from a particularly innocuous reason: Congress delayed a session because President Reagan had invited lawmakers to a White House barbecue, and Democrats were holding a $1,000-a-plate fundraising dinner. The funding question was resolved the next day. • The seven later shutdowns during the O’Neill era involved a lot of horse-trading on fairly mundane issues, not stark, ideological warfare. The Gingrich-era shutdown was led by small-government Republicans who wanted to aggressively cut back the scope of government. The current one was sparked by the imminent implementation of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. By contrast, the seven later shutdowns under O’Neill seemed to be dominated by more run-of-the-mill budgetary horse-trading. The sticking points in these shutdowns included a grab bag of comparatively parochial issues -- raises for senior civil servants; adjustments in aid to Israel, Egypt, Syria and El Salvador; a ban on oil and gas leasing in federal animal refuges; water-development projects; civil-rights standards for universities; the percentage of U.S.-made goods and labor required in offshore oil rigs; and the sale of the freight railroad Conrail. What the experts say Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, said Gingrich has a point. "It's not the duration that matters so much as the disruption, inconvenience and appearance of dysfunction from closing government doors and shooing federal workers away from their jobs," said Wolfensberger, a congressional scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Bipartisan Policy Center. Other experts we checked with found fault with Gingrich’s comparison, however. While his numbers were correct, the differences in the reach of the shutdowns and their duration make it "an apples and oranges comparison," said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, agreed that Gingrich’s "facts are correct, but his implication is not." Several of our experts also cast doubt on whether any of the shutdowns were a normal part of the constitutional process. Meyers said that "the normal situation throughout our history has been for agencies to be funded through appropriations bills, not closed because the lack of such bills. It is hard to imagine how the preamble's charge to ‘promote the general welfare’ is met by this shutdown; it was not met by the Gingrich-era shutdowns." Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed. "What we have had is 17-year hiatus from the breakdown of the constitutional process and shutdowns," he said. Now, he said, the breakdown is back. Our rating Gingrich said shutdowns are "a normal part of the constitutional process," with 12 shutdowns under Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill and two during his own speakership. He's right on the number, but the shutdowns under O'Neill were quite different in nature than either of the ones under Gingrich, or the current one. It’s also dubious to suggest that shutdowns are part of the normal constitutional process. Just because they have been relatively common doesn’t mean they are the way the founders intended government to operate. We rate Gingrich’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b23fd78-e6c8-47ed-a6b3-1ac9bdf33e60	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2013-10-04T11:26:03	2013-09-30	['None']
pomt-13506	"Under Pat McCrory, (North Carolina) has fallen to 41st in teacher pay."	/north-carolina/statements/2016/sep/02/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-falsely-says-north-carolina-teacher-pay/	In his new ad, Democratic candidate for N.C. governor Roy Cooper focuses on a teacher who says she had to leave North Carolina to find a better-paying job in another state. The ad says Gov. Pat McCrory, the Republican incumbent whom Cooper is trying to unseat, proposed a budget for this school year that would’ve had the smallest percentage of state funding going toward education in 30 years. We rated that claim Half True in a previous fact check. But another Cooper claim caught our eye: The one he used to promote the ad online. "Under Pat McCrory, our state has fallen to 41st in teacher pay," Cooper tweeted along with a video of the ad. "We must fix this." He said the same thing on Facebook, also adding in a jab accusing Republicans of "election year gimmicks." But we wondered if it was actually Cooper who was using an election year gimmick here. Who pays teachers? First, a refresher on teacher pay. It doesn’t come entirely from the state government. School boards are allowed to supplement local teachers’ salaries, and all but a handful of North Carolina’s 115 school districts choose to do so. Depending on the district in North Carolina, teachers can get a few hundred dollars a year or more than $6,000. So it’s hard to attribute all of the responsibility for teacher pay, good or bad, to only the state government or only the county and city governments. However, the state does provide most. National ranking In the 2015-16 school year, according to estimates by the National Education Association, North Carolina was ranked 41st in teacher pay – just like Cooper claimed. However, take that number with a grain of salt. The NEA typically revises its salary numbers after a year, and that revision can sometimes make a difference in the rankings. In 2014, for example, the NEA estimated the average North Carolina teacher made $45,737 in 2012-13. It tentatively ranked the state 46th in the country. The revised numbers came out a year later. Even though North Carolina’s average pay for 2012-13 didn’t change, its ranking rose from 46th to 43rd because other states did change. So when the revised numbers for 2015-16 come out, North Carolina might still be ranked 41st. Or it might be a few spots higher or lower. We won’t know until spring 2017, however, so for now we’ll just go by the estimates. The rise and fall of teacher pay But is Cooper right with the more important part of his claim, that North Carolina has "fallen" to 41st under McCrory’s leadership? No. McCrory was sworn in on Jan. 5, 2013, halfway through the 2012-13 school year. As we already mentioned, North Carolina was ranked 43rd that year. McCrory’s first budget, for the 2013-14 school year, saw teacher pay drop to 47th in the nation. But teacher pay has only risen since then, even if only slightly. In 2014-15 average pay rose to 42nd, and in 2015-16 it was estimated to have risen again to 41st. So Cooper is clearly wrong about the ranking having "fallen to 41st" under McCrory. It actually rose to 41st. Cooper’s campaign pointed out that teacher pay was much higher when Cooper was in the state legislature – especially toward the end of his tenure when Cooper was one of the top Senate leaders. In the 1990s and early 2000s under Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor in Jim Hunt, North Carolina did rank much higher in average teacher pay. While the state never paid teachers as much as the national average, its ranking did break into the top half of states. North Carolina ranked 21st in average teacher pay during Cooper’s last year in the Senate, in 2000-01, and it was 22nd the year before. But the ad doesn’t talk about any of that, nor do the posts promoting it. The posts instead make the incorrect claim that the state’s ranking has fallen under McCrory. We wondered if there was a different way the claim might have some truth to it. Maybe even though North Carolina’s ranking rose, its average pay fell compared to the national average. That’s possible. A state could rise in the rankings even while sinking further away from average, if the average is affected by outliers at the very top or bottom of the rankings. But again, that’s not the case. In 2012-13, the last pre-McCrory budget, the average North Carolina teacher made 81.6 percent of the national average. The most recent data we have is the NEA estimate for 2015-16, when the average North Carolina teacher made an estimated 82.6 percent of the national average. Like with the ranking itself, that’s not much of an increase but it is still an increase – although it’s lower than the 95.6 percent it reached during the last budget Cooper helped pass as a legislator. Our ruling Cooper said North Carolina "has fallen to 41st in teacher pay" under Gov. McCrory. In fact, the opposite is true. North Carolina has risen to 41st in teacher pay since McCrory entered office. It’s barely an increase, from 43 to 41, but it’s still an increase. Since the claim contains a snippet of truth – that North Carolina is one of the country’s lowest-paying states for teachers – but uses that to paint a misleading picture, we rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f76d6e83-3146-40e5-81c5-795f90eac033	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2016-09-02T17:32:37	2016-08-29	['Pat_McCrory', 'North_Carolina']

pomt-01824	Jeff Mann has an ethics complaint against him alleging he used county workers for campaign work, which is an indictable offense.	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/19/vernon-jones/ethics-complaint-doesnt-equal-wrongdoing/	DeKalb County has more than its share of alleged misdeeds by elected officials. Ethics complaints are pending against all six sitting DeKalb County commissioners and interim CEO Lee May. Suspended CEO Burrell Ellis is slated to go on trial in September to face felony charges he shook down county vendors for campaign contributions. Amid that backdrop, Vernon Jones, the former county CEO, is complaining that interim Sheriff Jeff Mann faces his own integrity problems. The pair traded several such attacks at a recent Atlanta Press Club debate, which airs at 10:30 a.m. Sunday on Georgia Public Broadcasting. One volley from Jones drew a direct line between ongoing conduct questions and Mann: "His senior executives, and he himself, have ethics complaints against them (that) they are using county employees to campaign during county time. That’s an indictable offense." Given the winner of the runoff race Tuesday will serve out former Sheriff Tom Brown’s term through 2016, the AJC Truth-O-Meter jumped quickly. First, know that Mann protested in the debate that he knew of no pending ethics complaints against him. He also denied any wrongdoing. So has Jones, after a special grand jury last year recommended that he be investigated on allegations of bid rigging during his eight years as CEO. The question of an ethics complaint, though, is easy to answer because DeKalb has a Board of Ethics. State law grants the board the power to examine complaints that elected officials or county workers have violated the code of ethics – and remove them from office or fire them if allegations are deemed flagrant enough. DeKalb reinvigorated the board last year, amid the ongoing scandals, but the body has yet to take such drastic action on any of 18 pending complaints. County records show two of those complaints relate to Mann. On June 25, the clerk to the County Commission forwarded both complaints from Rhonda Taylor, a former Sheriff’s Department employee, to the ethics board’s attorney. Taylor complains that Mann forced her to work on his campaign and that the department’s human resources director, Xernia Fortson, abused her during that work. Similar allegations surfaced last month, but no ethics complaints were filed in that case. At the time, Mann released an email he sent in March to the department. It reads in part that working on campaigns at work is prohibited. The ethics board attorney, and the board itself, have yet to review Taylor’s complaints, Chairman John Ernst said. That’s because the board last met June 24, the day before her complaints were filed. Procedure calls for the board attorney to review complaints for presentation to the board during meetings, to decide whether the body has jurisdiction to investigate and act. In the sheriff’s case, that jurisdiction is in doubt. The board is given authority over elected commissioners, the CEO and workers, as well as appointed county board members. But it is specifically excluded from oversight over the district attorney, solicitor and most court officials, such as judges and clerks from State and Superior Court. The question is whether the sheriff – like the DA and judges, an elected office enshrined in the state Constitution – falls in the first or second category. "The (board) attorney is expected to tell us at our meeting if we have jurisdiction," Ernst said. Only if the board has and accepts jurisdiction at that session, scheduled for Aug. 14, would the board send Mann and Fortson notice that it plans to investigate. The question of an indictment is a criminal matter that would fall to the DA’s office, not the ethics board, to pursue. District Attorney Robert James would not comment on whether his office is looking into Taylor’s allegations. It’s worth noting that James persuaded a grand jury to indict Ellis last year on similar charges, of having county employees do campaign work on taxpayer time. Far more clear is the fact that at least one ethics complaint has been lodged against Mann, as Jones claims. Anyone can file a complaint against most elected officials and county workers in DeKalb, though. There is real uncertainty about whether the county’s Board of Ethics has jurisdiction over the constitutionally elected sheriff. So while the statement contains a lot of literal truth, it lacks a good deal of context to fully understand how ethics complaints work. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13334	Says Ron Johnson "helped companies ship jobs overseas."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/05/russ-feingold/voting-free-trade-deals-ron-johnson-helped-compani/	During the 2016 election cycle, free trade agreements have drawn scorn from candidates ranging from Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders, both of whom have unloaded on Hillary Clinton for her support of NAFTA and other trade deals. But Democrats have ripped Republicans on the deals, too. In June 2016, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold released a TV ad claiming that the incumbent, Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson, "voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas." Our rating was False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a39c531-6573-489b-93c8-a5b81b4020fb Then on Sept. 26, 2016, Feingold went on the attack again with a similar but less specific claim in a TV ad that features four middle-age people. One looks at the camera and says Johnson "helped companies ship jobs overseas." The new attack falls short, too. Three trade deals To back the claim, the Feingold campaign cited three votes Johnson made in 2011. They were in favor of free trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. President Barack Obama, who touts the tariff-reducing agreements as a way to increase U.S. exports and "support" jobs in the United States, signed each of them into law in 2012. Currently, the United States has free trade agreements with 20 countries -- with the largest being the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. The South Korea deal is the second-largest. An August 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that the United States’ negative trade balance with South Korea has grown -- from $16.6 billion in 2012 to $28.3 billion in 2015 -- since that trade deal was signed. That report did not make any estimates on jobs. In May 2016, the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that trade deficits with Korea eliminated more than 95,000 U.S. jobs between 2011 and 2015. The report was written by Robert Scott, the institute’s senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research. Scott told us that the Korean trade deal led to an increased demand in the United States for products made in Korea and a decreased demand for U.S.-made products. But, importantly for this fact check, his report did not say that jobs lost in the United States were sent overseas. The report’s job-loss estimate was in the same range as a March 2015 estimate by government accountability think tank Public Citizen, which said the increased trade deficit with Korea "equates to nearly 85,000 lost U.S. jobs." But that report did not state that U.S. jobs were sent overseas, either. Moreover, there are issues with the two job-loss estimates attributed to the Korean trade deal. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker weighed in in March 2016 about claims on free trade and job losses, including one by Trump that cited the Economic Policy Institute, saying: "We urge all readers to view such claims with deep skepticism. The job-loss figures often rely on simplistic formulas that are disputed by other economists. It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic trends." Indeed, the Fact Checker gave Public Citizen four Pinocchios, its lowest rating, for its 85,000 lost-jobs claim. Public Citizen took "fishy" math the White House used to make a jobs increase estimate and then manipulated further, the Fact Checker said. (Scott, of the Economic Policy Institute, told us he has not seen estimates on job effects of the Colombia and Panama free trade deals, noting the deals are much smaller.) Other experts also see problems with the job-loss estimates attributed to free-trade deals. Susan Houseman, senior economist at the Michigan-based Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, told us: "Estimating the effects of a trade agreement on jobs is very difficult to do convincingly, because many other factors affect employment, and so parsing out the effects of one trade agreement is tough. Some jobs are lost by increased competition, but others are created by increased access to foreign markets." NAFTA, Houseman noted, has been closely studied, "and the evidence that it had significant negative effects on employment is weak." PolitiFact National also concluded in an April 2016 fact check on Sanders attacking Clinton over trade deals that that the jury is still out on the job effects of the deals. Our rating Citing Johnson’s votes for free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, Feingold says Ron Johnson "helped companies ship jobs overseas." There are estimates that the largest of the three deals, with South Korea, resulted in a loss of jobs in the United States. But those estimates are disputed, largely because of how difficult it is to isolate one cause for changes in employment. Moreover, the job-loss estimates do not state that any U.S. jobs were shipped overseas. Without evidence of the trade deals helping ship jobs overseas, we rate Feingold’s statement False.

pomt-04625	David Cicilline is "the 5th most liberal person in the House of Representatives."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/17/bernard-jackvony/republican-bernard-jackvony-says-democrat-david-ci/	One of the reasons U.S. Rep. David Cicilline gives when asking voters in the 1st Congressional District to send him back to Washington is that Rhode Islanders need a Democrat in that seat to prevent the Republican Party -- and by implication, conservatives -- from doing bad things. During a discussion on the contest during the Rhode Island PBS program "A Lively Experiment," former Republican Lt. Gov. Bernard Jackvony said Cicilline is far more liberal than most. How liberal? "Cicilline is the 5th most liberal person in the House of Representatives," he said. There's no reason to debate Cicilline's liberalism, but is he really the 5th-most left-leaner in that highly partisan institution? When we called Jackvony to ask the source of his information, he said he heard the factoid as part of a question in the WPRI-TV-Providence Journal debate on Aug. 28 between Cicilline and Anthony Gemma. WPRI's Ted Nesi told us he made a reference to Cicilline's voting record, but he was referring to a different ranking, by OpenCongress.org. On that website, Cicilline is indeed ranked 5th. But it's a list of party-line votes among Democrats, not liberal votes. Of 1,697 votes logged, the congressman voted with the majority of the House Democratic caucus 95.9 percent of the time. One could argue that Democrat votes are liberal votes, but that's a gross oversimplification. The website notes that the list makes no distinction between serious deeply divisive issues and the hundreds of votes on routine matters where ideology doesn't play a role. The Washington Post has a similar database. It has Cicilline voting with the party on 96 percent of 1,503 votes. In that ranking, where the percentages are rounded off, Cicilline is listed as third among Democrats. But 36 House members -- 11 Democrats and 25 Republicans -- also voted with the party line at least 96 percent of the time. Because Jackvony characterized Cicilline as the 5th-most liberal member of the House, we looked for other sources that actually use that metric. Many special-interest groups give legislators scores for their votes on various liberal and conservative issues, although their lists are typically not very comprehensive. However, the National Journal, a weekly magazine that covers politics, has an annual survey that ranks members of Congress on the liberal and conservative scales. In its latest report, Cicilline is the 48th most liberal member of the House, based on 949 roll call votes. That keeps him out of the National Journal's "Most Liberal" category. We also checked rankings for two conservative organizations, where the more liberal you are, the lower your score. Heritage Action for America, the activist arm of The Heritage Foundation, scores Cicilline at 12 percent, tied for 31st place (with 24 others) on the liberal scale. Club for Growth has Cicilline tied at 19th from the bottom. The liberal website Progressive Punch tags Cicilline as the 49th most liberal member of the House. In short, nobody puts him close to 5th. And to illustrate how the rankings differ depending on who does them, the National Review and Progressive Punch list Cicilline as more liberal than his Rhode Island colleague, Rep. James Langevin. Heritage Action and Club for Growth say Langevin is more liberal. Our ruling Former Lt. Gov. Bernard Jackvony said Rep. David Cicilline "is the 5th most liberal person in the House of Representatives." He was citing a statistic that ranked party-line voting, not liberal votes, although among Democrats the two often go hand in hand. There is no definitive arbiter of which congressman is more liberal than the next. Different organizations judge candidate voting records differently. The rankings we found gave Cicilline a bit more moderate score and the respected National Journal didn't even include the congressman in its tally of the 25 "most liberal" members of the House. Cicilline is clearly liberal. But because Jackvony was so specific, and he was specifically wrong, we rate his statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-01457	Leticia Van de Putte "voted to give illegal immigrants in this country free health care--not emergency health care but total free health care."	/texas/statements/2014/oct/02/dan-patrick/contrary-dan-patrick-claim-van-de-putte-didnt-vote/	In the only debate between major-party candidates for Texas lieutenant governor, Republican nominee Dan Patrick stood by his objections to a Texas law authored by his Democratic opponent that enables some children living in the state without legal authorization to qualify for in-state college tuition. Patrick, a Houston state senator, went on to say Sept. 29, 2014, that after the tuition proposal passed into law in 2001, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, the Democratic nominee, supported another questionable move. "She voted to give illegal immigrants in this country free health care -- not emergency health care but total free health care," Patrick said. "That was about seven years ago and that bill didn’t pass." We were curious about the described vote. By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said Patrick was referring to Van de Putte’s vote for a proposal that cleared the Senate in 2003, Senate Bill 309. Garcia said the legislation required "local hospitals to provide emergency care to patients regardless of immigration status. Opponents claimed the bill would drive up the costs of health care and increase taxes to provide care to illegal immigrants. Van de Putte supported this measure knowing that it would benefit illegal immigrants at a cost to taxpayers," Garcia wrote. We’d been down this path with Patrick before. In May 2014, we rated False his claim that the Senate had earlier approved free health care for illegal immigrants. Let’s unspool afresh. Senators including Van de Putte on May 5, 2003, gave voice-vote approval to the proposal, which a May 5, 2003, Senate Journal entry summarized as "providing health care services without regard to a person's immigration status." At the time, Patrick, a talk-radio host, wasn’t yet a senator. The legislation said a city, county or public hospital "may use money from local sources to provide health care services to a person without regard to the person's immigration status and shall establish a cost-share system for persons receiving health care services." At an April 2003 committee hearing, authoring Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, said it permitted hospitals to draw on local revenue to provide preventive services to residents regardless of a patient’s immigration standing. Sylvia Garcia, then a Harris County commissioner, testified the proposal would hasten outpatient services, heading off health problems early and saving money thanks to fewer emergency-room visits. Proponents described the legislation as vital after the then-Texas attorney general (and future U.S. senator), John Cornyn, issued an advisory opinion in July 2001 stating that unless lawmakers allowed the Harris County Hospital District (and others, presumably) to deliver preventive services to patients regardless of immigration status, the district couldn’t give such care without violating the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which required state legislatures to intervene if states wanted hospitals to go ahead and do so. Notably, Cornyn’s letter made it clear some health services already were provided to patients regardless of immigration status--as mandated by federal law. Cornyn’s letter said the district was required by law to provide emergency care to residents regardless of their legal status. Lance Lunsford, spokesman for the Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems statewide, told us a federal law from the 1980s, the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, made free emergency care available to illegal immigrants. According to a federal website, that act required Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical exam when a request is made for an emergency condition, including active labor, regardless of an individual's ability to pay. Cornyn’s letter also said federal law permitted public health services including immunizations and testing and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases. Still, he wrote, the 1996 law specified that any other state or local health benefit could be provided only if a state law "affirmatively provides for such eligibility." Mike Stafford, the Harris County attorney, reacted to Cornyn’s letter by advising the local hospital district to stop giving discounted preventive care because it violates federal law, according to a July 12, 2001, Associated Press news story. "It's up to the Texas Legislature to step in now and, if they want to create an exception for this, it's allowable," Stafford said. In 2003, Senate Bill 309 died in the House, though advocates including Lunsford said the permission to provide such services ended up in House Bill 2292, a major 2003 overhaul of health care agencies. Section 285.201 of the Texas Health and Safety code "affirmatively establishes" the eligibility of undocumented residents to receive non-emergency public health benefits funded locally by public hospital districts. And in the end, did the legislation expand free health care for illegal immigrants? When we inquired, King Hillier, a vice president of the Harris County Hospital District, said by phone that "basically" the district had already been providing non-emergency services when the issue reached lawmakers. Hillier stressed the permissive quality of the proposal; funding and delivery of services was left up to local governments. Finally, Hillier noted the Senate version of the law envisioned a system of patients sharing costs, which has resulted, he said. Our ruling Patrick said Van de Putte "voted to give illegal immigrants in this country free health care--not emergency health care but total free health care." The 2003 proposal in question didn’t provide immigrants free across-the-board health care. Rather, the measure permitted (and didn’t require) local governing bodies to provide (or, it appears, resume providing) non-emergency services to residents regardless of immigration status, an action that was predicted to improve outcomes and head off costly emergency care to which all residents were already entitled per federal law. Significantly, too, the proposal envisioned patients sharing costs. Diagnosis: False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.	None	Dan Patrick	None	None	None	2014-10-02T12:00:00	2014-09-29	['None']
pomt-05221	Says Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie made a late-night visit to Kinko’s to forge President Barack Obama’s birth certificate two days before Obama unveiled it to the media.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/07/chain-email/satire-obama-birthers-neil-abercrombie-fools-some-/	We never cease to be amazed that the people who routinely forward chain emails are so gullible that they will also fall victim to satire. The latest episode involves one that was far-fetched even by birther standards. "Please research this info claiming to be about the governor of Hawaii faking Obama’s birth certificate," the reader asked, explaining that it came from his brother-in-law. We also found the account posted on a few birther blogs, where it prompted comments like "the MSM will never touch this story, or investigate it. Send it to Sheriff Joe, maybe he'll do something with it." (That's a reference to Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff who has rekindled birther theories.) The publisher of the original satire also got calls from people who believed it, as you'll see below. The email says: "New evidence now points a finger at Hawaii’s Governor Neil Abercrombie as the possible source of the widely disputed document purporting to be President Obama’s long form birth certificate. Surveillance photos of the South St. & Queen St. intersection routinely monitored by the Honolulu Fire Department have been leaked to the media. One frame clearly shows Governor Abercrombie leaving the Kinko’s late at night, on April 25th, two days before Obama unveiled the 'official' document. "The night manager at Kinko’s, Mr. Marvin Ishikawa, further corroborated what was shown on the video. "‘Sure I remember them,’ said Ishikawa. ‘They hogged my best graphics machine for hours. I thought the short guy looked a lot like the governor, but he said his name was John Smith. I thought it was kind of funny that they paid with a State of Hawaii government debit card.’ Ishikawa elaborated, ‘They were on that machine for almost two days straight, and I have the computer logs right here; 12 hours of Adobe Illustrator, 23 scans, a bunch of PhotoShop and several faxes back and forth to Washington, DC.’ "Asked to identify the man in the video, Ishikawa said, ‘Yeah, that’s him, that’s "Smith." ‘ "When Abercrombie first took office, he vowed to clear this birth certificate business up, once and for all, but by January of 2011 had given up. He basically told his friends that he simply ‘couldn’t find the dam thing.’ Things changed in April, when the President sent a letter to Hawaii’s Department of Health requesting a copy of the long form birth certificate. "According to one un-named source inside the DOH, everybody, including the Governor’s Office, panicked, ‘We had to do what we had to do.’ " The text was accompanied by a green-tinted "surveillance" photo of a smiling Abercrombie holding the "fake" birth certificate outside the copy store in question. (Incidentally, Kinko’s changed its name to FedEx Office in 2008.) The photo looked fake to us, and it wasn’t hard to debunk the text as well. We found that it originated on the website of the Hawaii Reporter, a news and commentary blog that has won investigative journalism awards and is perceived as somewhat right-of-center. Whoever started this e-mail on its Internet voyage snipped off a bit of relevant information at the bottom of the story: "EDITOR'S NOTE: This report is in our satire section." Malia Zimmerman, editor and co-founder of the Reporter, told us the item was written by Keith Rollman, a Hawaii political consultant who has worked for Democrats and Republicans and whose cartoons and writing are sometimes published on the Reporter’s website. He uses the pseudonym Atomic Monkey. "We ran the piece on April Fools Day, in our comics section, and said in the story that it was satire," Zimmerman said. "We did not expect people to take this seriously. But we still had people calling and emailing us demanding more information about the piece. We are still getting calls today. Most had a good sense of humor about it when we pointed out the April Fools Day note, but not everyone took it so well. We did get some nasty notes. Other than putting the very top in all-caps, ‘THIS IS AN APRIL FOOLS DAY JOKE,’ I am not sure what else we could have done to be more clear." We've seen this phenomenon before. One of the most long-lived chain emails we’ve seen circulating claims that Obama once said, "Nobody made these guys go to war. ... Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice?" That was originally published by Arizona-based satirist John Semmens. We gave it a Pants on Fire. We have debunked other chain emails based on satires by Semmens. One claimed that that in a hearing, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., suggested to Gen. David Petraeus that the Army "put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output." Semmens’ work was also turned into chain emails claiming that Obama wants to redesign the American flag "to better offer our enemies hope and love," and that he thinks the national anthem should be "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing." Another satirist who saw his work go viral is Matthew Avitabile, who blogs his spoofs at Jumping in Pools. One satirical Avitabile post claimed that Obama wrote a thesis at Columbia University in which he criticized "plutocratic thugs" and said the Constitution gave Americans "the shackles of hypocrisy." Another was that the Obama administration "wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution." The Abercrombie spoof doesn’t appear to have gained as much traction on the Internet as some of these other satires. Maybe it was too outlandish. As one commenter to the blog "Native and Natural Born Citizenship Explored" put it, "The governor, sneaking down to Kinko’s …. LOL …. gives me flashbacks to college, when I often had to go to Kinko’s after midnight. No governors then, no governors now." Our ruling It seems silly that we have to put these claims to the Truth-O-Meter, but given that the Hawaii Reporter received serious calls about it and that the chain email continues to circulate, we'll quickly set the meter on fire to shed a little light on the silliness.

pomt-00332	Says Marsha Blackburn "at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry, co-sponsored a law that weakened DEA enforcement efforts against drug distribution companies that were supplying corrupt doctors and pharmacists who peddled narcotics to the black market."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/18/phil-bredesen/bredesen-blackburn-weakened-dea-opioid-enforcement/	Tennessee has struggled with the opioid crisis more than many states. In 2015, prescription drug deaths were twice the national rate, according to federal and state summaries. And around that time, Congress moved to trim the power of the Drug Enforcement Administration to sanction negligent drug distributors. Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen said if he wins, his first act as senator would be to attempt to reverse a 2014 bill championed by his opponent, Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn. "Blackburn, at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry, co-sponsored a law that weakened DEA enforcement efforts against drug distribution companies that were supplying corrupt doctors and pharmacists who peddled narcotics to the black market," Bredesen’s Aug. 24 campaign announcement said. The law was at the center of a Washington Post/60 Minutes October 2017 exposé. Within days, that investigation scuttled the nomination of Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., to serve as national drug czar. Marino introduced the first version of the bill in 2014. Blackburn was an original cosponsor. In this fact-check, we examine Blackburn’s position on DEA enforcement and to what extent she did what the drug distribution companies wanted. Key takeaways Blackburn played a lead role on a bill that made it harder for the DEA to hold the threat of shutdowns over drug distributors. The drug distribution industry spent over $1 million lobbying for the change, and its campaign donations to Blackburn went up after the bill became law. The precise impact of the law remains unclear, but the Justice Department recommends reversal, and Blackburn has signed on to a bill that would do that. The DEA and drug distributors The DEA enforces the Controlled Substances Act, which includes monitoring sales of prescription painkillers such as oxycodone, fentanyl and codeine. Around 2009, the agency began focusing on distributors who were shipping millions of doses into relatively small communities. The DEA holds two legal hammers over bad actors. One, called a show cause order, requires the company to prove why it shouldn’t have its permit to sell drugs taken away. The bigger hammer is an immediate suspension order, which stops all shipments on the spot. The company can argue its case under both actions, but with the first one, operations continue during the hearing process, while with the second, operations shut down right away. Jim Geldhof retired from the DEA in 2016 after nearly four decades. He told us that formal sanctions were a last resort. "I can’t think of one time that we didn't try to get a company into compliance before we issued any kind of order," Geldhof said. But Blackburn saw the DEA as trigger happy. Blackburn supported changing the rules In a 2011 House hearing on prescription drug diversion, Blackburn said certain things had to be kept in mind. "First, to what extent should duly-licensed prescription drug manufacturers be required to spend time, money and resources on trying to envision every new way that their products might be abused," Blackburn asked. By 2012, her focus was more on DEA oversight of distributors and pharmacies. "Should we be thinking of a more surgical approach to addressing the issue of prescription drug abuse rather than just looking at suspension of licenses?" she asked a DEA official at a House hearing. "Is there a more proportional approach to take rather than just going to an immediate suspension?" Blackburn was unswayed by testimony that DEA regularly met with companies before taking formal action. The bills In 2014, Blackburn firmly linked herself to legislation that added new requirements before the DEA could move against a distributor. She put her name to two versions of the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act as they were introduced, and at one point, Blackburn took the lead during debate on the House floor. In an April 2014 hearing, Blackburn said she was concerned that patients would not get the pain medications they counted on. She said suppliers needed more guidance from Washington on how to collaborate with law enforcement. "Stated simply, their obligation to prevent diversion is only achievable if the DEA and other regulators will work with them to get it done," Blackburn said. Both bills made two changes. They raised the DEA’s burden of proof before it could issue a immediate suspension order. For show cause actions, drug distributors gained the option to offer a plan to fix any problems. That effectively put the enforcement on hold while the plan played out. The Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2014 passed the House. In response, then-Attorney General Eric Holder cautioned Congress. "A recently passed House bill would severely undermine a critical component of our efforts to prevent communities and families from falling prey to dangerous drugs," a department press release said July 31, 2014. The bill stalled in the Senate. Two years later, a slightly modified version passed in both chambers and became law in April 2016. Drug distributors backed the changes The major drug distribution companies lobbied for bills Blackburn supported. Between 2014 and 2016, two distribution companies and the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, a trade group, spent just shy of $1.3 million on lobbyists to work specifically on getting Blackburn’s ideas into law. "This legislation will go a long way in encouraging meaningful dialogue and collaboration between supply chain stakeholders and federal regulators," the Healthcare Distribution Alliance wrote in 2014. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The drug distribution industry’s campaign donations to Blackburn rose over this period. In 2012, they gave her $6,000. A few years later, the total more than tripled to $22,000. (This is a conservative figure, based only on distribution firms, and omits other groups interested in these bills, such as the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.) We asked Blackburn’s office what input she received from the distribution industry as she formed her approach. Her staff declined to answer, but in October 2017, Blackburn said questions about whether donations fueled her interest in the law were "absolutely absurd." Consensus: The changes undermined the DEA Many observers have noted that the final version of the law passed with barely a ripple of dissent. The Washington Post described backroom negotiations, but when it came to a vote in 2016, it sailed through under unanimous consent. After the Post investigation, the Justice Department sent a letter to the House recommending that the law be rolled back. In October 2017, less than a week after the Washington Post article appeared, a group of seven House Democrats and one Republican introduced a bill to repeal the amendments made in 2016. Blackburn did not join that effort, saying she was waiting for a report from the DEA on the law’s impact. In mid March 2018, another two House Democrats introduced their own measure to roll back the changes. Both of them, Peter Welch, D-Vt., and Judy Chu, D-Calif., had been original cosponsors of the 2014 legislation. Blackburn submitted a bill at the same time, but while it increased penalties for drug diversion, it left the enforcement changes untouched. After Bredesen raised the issue in late August, Blackburn and fellow Republican Rep. Gus Bilrakis, R-Fla., submitted a bill to undo the changes Blackburn had championed. She was still waiting for the report from the DEA. "This solution takes another step to combat the opioid epidemic by giving law enforcement the tools they need to go after bad actors," said Blackburn chief of staff Charles Flint. At the end of the day, the legal and lawmaker consensus is that the measures first proposed in 2014 had weakened the DEA. Our ruling Bredesen said that "at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry," Blackburn was a leading force behind a law that weakened the ability of the DEA to go after drug distributors that facilitated the flow of opioids into the black market. The record shows that Blackburn was critical of the DEA and was an early leader in reining in DEA powers. It is also a matter of record that the industry spent nearly $1.3 million lobbying for those changes and increased its donations to Blackburn as the legislative process played out.

pomt-03809	Says, "The Democrats' proposed budget is also balanced by using more in new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings."	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/23/bruce-hanna/are-democrats-relying-more-new-taxes-pers-reforms-/	Earlier this month the two Democratic co-chairs in charge of legislative budgeting released their draft for state spending in 2013-15. Republicans, who are in the minority in both chambers, have criticized repeatedly what they see as the shortcomings of the $16.5 billion general fund budget. Basically, they complain that the plan relies too much on new revenue and doesn’t do enough to rein in the Public Employees Retirement System. Roseburg Republican Rep. Bruce Hanna, a former co-Speaker of the House, had his say on the floor recently. "Frustratingly, the Democrats' proposed budget is also balanced by using more in new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings," he said. "This may represent a priority for some, but certainly not one I can support. Balancing our budget requires hard decisions but it can be done through common-sense solutions." We had one question: Does the proposed budget released by Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, and Sen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, rely "more in new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings?" The statement didn’t sound quite right to one of our budget watchers, so we decided to check it out. People interested in reforming the system, including Gov. John Kitzhaber, say reforms are necessary to curb mounting costs that will eat into public services into the future. People not so interested say the proposed reforms are unfair and probably won’t pass legal muster. In any case, the legislative budget draft released by Buckley and Devlin calls for lawmakers to find $275 million in additional revenue by eliminating or reducing tax breaks. So that’s the new revenue part. PERS reforms The draft budget also calls for three ways to reduce spending on the retirement system, although the dollar amount is harder to suss out. One idea would cap the cost-of-living adjustment given to retirees for an estimated savings of $400 million in 2013-15. Another idea would end a tax break for retirees living out-of-state, saving about $55 million. The third idea is to "collar" rates -- in other words, spread the projected impact of rate changes into the future -- for an estimated $350 million. Those proposals add up to $805 million in "savings," otherwise known as money that government won’t have to spend on the pension system in 2013-15. But not all of the $805 million will help the state general fund budget. Why not? Well, the $805 million will be spread throughout the budgets of not only the state, but of schools, cities and counties, basically any system that participates in PERS. So how much money will assist the state budget? The Legislature’s chief fiscal officer Ken Rocco, a non-partisan position, calculates that amount to be closer to $281 million, and this is the number we need to compare with the $275 million figure. We’ll get back to that in the ruling. We want to clear up one more thing: What do we mean by "help"? Without the reforms, the state would have to find an additional $281 million in revenue to pay for the budget the co-chairs have proposed. Or, legislators would have to spend that much more on PERS and give up what they had hoped to buy with the $281 million. For example, the draft budget calls for K-12 schools to receive $6.55 billion in 2013-15. But off the balance sheet, school districts will receive an additional $200 million in the form of money officials will no longer have to spend on PERS, giving schools $6.75 billion for the biennium. (In a way, the $16.5 billion turns into $16.78 billion, as far as what agencies are given to spend.) This is a confusing issue and we have to share with readers that both sides, when reached by PolitiFact Oregon, were mistaken on the amount that affects the general fund. It took our queries to the Legislative Fiscal Office to get the numbers straightened out. The ruling Hanna said on the House floor that the proposed budget by Democrats is balanced "by using more in new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings." That is not accurate. The draft budget relies on $275 million in new tax revenue and $281 million in "savings" from PERS reforms. The reforms also reduce pension-related costs for numerous other budgets in Oregon. Certainly Hanna and others would like to see deeper changes to PERS rather than eliminate some of Oregonians’ tax breaks. That’s a philosophical question for legislators. All we can say is that the state budget as proposed by the Democratic co-chairs contains an approximately equal amount of new tax revenue and PERS cost reductions. We rate the statement False.

pomt-13080	Says the KKK marched in Mebane, N.C., after Trump’s victory	/north-carolina/statements/2016/nov/09/viral-image/viral-image-debunked-kkk-was-not-marching-north-ca/	It’s a grainy photo that many woke up to Wednesday morning, hours after Donald Trump won the race for president – shrouded figures carrying flags or signs on a bridge above a busy North Carolina highway. "KKK on the bridge in Mebane, NC this morning," wrote Twitter user @kelbi1lewis, along with the photo. That tweet alone has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times and has also been picked up by people ranging from football player Chad Johnson to terrorism expert Charles Lister and actress/activist Yvette Nicole Brown. But is it true? The Twitter user who started the viral rumors didn't respond to our requests for comment. After spending some of Wednesday retweeting news that her post was trending internationally, she later deleted her account. Trump was endorsed by the KKK’s official newspaper. And after his victory became official Wednesday morning, former KKK Imperial Wizard David Duke tweeted: "This is one of the most exciting nights of my life. Make no mistake about it, our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!" However, there's no proof that the Klan was on the march in North Carolina, like the viral post claimed. The photo appears to show a group of Trump supporters that local media also interviewed. And according to that news report and follow-up interviews, none of them were wearing KKK regalia, carrying Confederate flags or doing anything else that would link them to the racist group. The scene on the bridge Although the tweet claimed the marchers were on the bridge in Mebane Wednesday morning, they were actually there on Tuesday afternoon and night. Natalie Allison Janicello, a reporter for the local Burlington Times-News, was there interviewing them. She said she’s sure the group in the viral post is the same group she spoke with; she could recognize the same flags and the neon yellow shirt of someone in the photo. None of them were wearing any KKK regalia, she said, or carrying flags associated with the Confederacy or white supremacy movements. Instead, they had Trump signs, red-white-and-blue scarves and an assortment of American, Christian and "Don’t Tread On Me" flags. "There was no one claiming or professing to be part of the KKK," Janicello said. "These were just local conservatives who were out there for Trump." Janicello said they had actually come to that spot a few times a month, since February, to wave flags to passing traffic. Furthermore, neither the Mebane Police Department nor the Alamance County Sheriff’s Office received complaints of KKK activity close to the election – either at that bridge or anywhere else in the area. The sheriff’s office said in a press release Wednesday that calls only started coming in after the photo went viral, and that there’s nothing to substantiate the rumors. "Several members of law enforcement had observed these individuals over the past weeks, and never observed any paraphernalia related to the KKK nor Confederate symbols," the press release said. "No suspicious activity was observed nor reported." The newspaper’s photos from the bridge show that some of the marchers were affiliated with the group Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC). It received some notoriety this summer when it began raising money to buy and install Confederate flags along Interstate 40, which is the busiest road in a number of North Carolina counties. But there were no Confederate flags or KKK regalia visible at the Trump celebration, Janicello said. She also interviewed an Alamance County Republican Party official at the bridge, but party leaders later told us there was no formal connection. "I haven’t even heard of what you’re talking about," said Ben York, the Alamance County Republican Party chairman, several hours after the image had gone viral. The KKK in North Carolina Despite there being no proof behind the viral claim, Alamance County was one of the major early hotbeds of KKK activity in North Carolina. In an 1870 incident known as the Kirk-Holden War, a band of Klan supporters from Alamance and Caswell counties attempted to capture the town of Pittsboro in neighboring Chatham County. They were defeated by a militia formed by Gov. William Holden, who also arrested some prominent Klan supporters. That infuriated white supremacist state lawmakers, who soon made Holden the first governor in U.S. history to be impeached and removed from office. Holden was pardoned by the N.C. Senate in 2011. The contemporary KKK has also found support in the central area of the state, called the Piedmont, which includes Alamance County. "In North Carolina, one of its banner states, the modern Klan thrived among mill workers and other blue-collar laborers in the Piedmont," according to the 2006 book Encyclopedia of North Carolina. Our ruling A viral post on social media claimed to show KKK members marching in Mebane, N.C. on Wednesday morning after Trump won the election. Trump has been supported by the KKK, and that area of North Carolina does have longstanding ties to KKK activity. But thanks to a newspaper reporter who was at the scene, and whose reporting was corroborated by local law enforcement, we know that there’s no substance to the rumors. The people were not wearing KKK regalia and didn’t even have a Confederate flag amongst them. They also were never overheard saying anything about the KKK – they were simply excited for Trump. We rate this claim False. UPDATE After we wrote this, the KKK did hold a widely publicized "victory" parade in North Carolina, celebrating Donald Trump's presidential win. But that doesn't change anything about this rating, since they were separate events on different days and in different places. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a38543ff-c4c5-4840-a02d-937ad5424535	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2016-11-09T15:52:18	2016-11-09	['None']
pomt-02329	Most of the people who have signed up through the Obamacare exchanges "already had insurance."	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/26/rich-lowry/were-most-obamacare-sign-ups-people-who-had-insura/	If Obamacare was about anything, it was about getting more people insured. The law never promised to eliminate the uninsured altogether, but the Obama White House did say 32 million people would gain coverage, out of about 48 million who didn’t have it. With the sign-up window for 2014 about to close, Rich Lowry, editor in chief of the conservative news magazine National Review, gave a somber assessment of how the program is doing. "The law is not going to collapse on its own weight, which seemed a real possibility when the launch was so botched, but I think it’s still pretty grim," Lowry said on Meet the Press. "If you believe the surveys of people who have signed up through these exchanges, most of them already had insurance, which suggests what you have basically done is a churn where you’ve knocked people off their old insurance and then gotten them on the exchanges. There’s not much upside to that." When Lowry mentioned "exchanges" he was talking about the federal and state systems, from websites to hotlines, aimed at getting people covered. If most of those folks were just changing plans, that would raise a pretty fundamental problem. We are checking whether surveys show that most of the people signing up through the Obamacare exchanges, now called marketplaces, already had insurance. Lowry pointed us to a report from McKinsey and Company, a large private consulting group. In early March, McKinsey released the results of a survey that found that of all the people who bought a new insurance policy, about a quarter of them said they hadn’t been insured for at least most of last year. That sounds like Lowry had it right. Three-quarters of the sign-ups were people who already had coverage. That would qualify as "most people" in anyone’s book. But there’s more to the survey. McKinsey analysts make it clear that their study was about the individual insurance market as a whole, not specifically Obamacare marketplaces. People are free to buy directly from insurance companies or through government marketplaces. Emily Hackel, a spokesperson for McKinsey, said analysts did not break down their results for people who specifically purchased insurance through Obamacare. "If you’re looking to zero in on that, we don’t have that detail," Hackel said. It’s not like the report buries this distinction. In fact, it makes the point three times. In the first paragraph, it states that the survey "included consumers who enrolled in health care coverage for 2014 (either on or off exchange)." There is no way to know how many respondents fell into each group. So, the report Lowry cites doesn’t speak directly to his point. When we raised this problem to Lowry, he said the McKinsey numbers would hold up if relatively few people signed-up directly through insurers. Lowry referred us to a piece in Forbes that suggested that this group accounted for about 20 percent of enrollments. That wouldn’t be enough to significantly change the McKinsey findings, Lowry said. He also cited an item on the website of the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that has been critical of the Affordable Care Act. That article focused on an estimate of uninsured sign-ups from Goldman Sachs. However, that estimate was itself based on the McKinsey findings. One person Lowry referred to us to is Robert Laszewski, a health care policy consultant who has highlighted many of the failings of Obamacare. But when we spoke to Laszewski, he had a cautious take on interpreting the McKinsey data. "The McKinsey survey suggests a high percentage had insurance before," Laszewski told PunditFact. "But it is limited, and we don’t know." So what’s the real number? That’s tough to say. Laszewski has spoken to some of the largest insurance carriers who are selling through the marketplaces. From that, he guesses that about half of the people buying there were previously insured. "That’s what these carriers are telling me," Laszewski said. "But that’s just anecdotal information." That’s only an estimate, but "about half" is not "most". The federal agency charged with tracking what’s going on, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told us they don’t have this information yet. Individual states have released numbers but these also fall short. New York just reported that "more than 70 percent of those who have enrolled to date were uninsured at the time of application." But that mixes together those who signed up for Medicaid and those who bought private insurance. Kentucky’s Cabinet for Health and Family Services told PunditFact that 80 percent of the people who bought private insurance through their marketplace reported that they didn't have insurance. But spokesperson Jill Midkiff said the intake form does not ask how long they have been without coverage. It could have been as short as one day or as long as a year or more. Stephen Zuckerman is a health economist at the Urban Institute, a Washington academic center. He’s very interested in knowing if Obamacare has made a dent in the uninsured population. "This is one of the big questions where there will need to be more stats available before we can say what the law has done," Zuckerman said. For what it’s worth, a March Gallup poll found the percentage of uninsured Americans has fallen by more than 2 percentage points since October 2013. This figure, too, is limited, because it does not prove that Obamacare is responsible. That said, the decline coincides with the launch of the marketplaces, and the greatest progress took place among households making less than $38,000 a year. Lowry’s framework on Obamacare had its own limitation. When asked how it was doing, he spoke only about the fraction of uninsured buying coverage through the exchanges. That leaves out the gains made through Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that in the short-run, about half of the progress toward getting people insured comes through opening Medicaid to the working poor by raising that program’s income limit. Christine Eibner, an economist at the Rand Corporation, said Medicaid needs to be part of any assessment. "The main goal of the law was to expand insurance coverage, not necessarily to enroll people on the exchanges," Eibner said. "Medicaid and (exchange) sign-ups are both important in assessing the ACA, since the law expanded coverage using both programs." Beware of fuzzy language When you hear pundits and politicians talk about the success or failures of Obamacare, there are two factors that tend to cloud the debate. First, the expansion of Medicaid has a big impact on reducing the ranks of the uninsured. But it has proven to be very tough to tease out the people who gained Medicaid coverage thanks to the higher income limit by itself. Plenty of people who are signing up were eligible before. Second, some states that run their own exchanges, such as New York, California and Kentucky, have a "no wrong door" approach. That means, everyone enters through the same portal. As they fill in their personal information, those who are Medicaid eligible get sent down one path; people who make more money get directed toward private insurance. Those states tend to say everyone got covered through the exchange, but in terms of the Affordable Care Act, very different pieces of the law are in play. Our ruling Lowry said reports show that most of the people signing up through the Obamacare exchanges already had insurance. The McKinsey report he cited did not address his specific point. It examined the individual insurance market as a whole, regardless of how people found their insurance plans. While Lowry couched his claim with the caveat, "if you believe the surveys," it doesn’t matter if you believe the McKinsey survey. The survey did not describe the performance of Obamacare. An analyst cited by Lowry confirmed this point. There are other data from other states that Lowry could have cited that would suggest a greater impact on the number of uninsured people. But that is also flawed. The fact is, we have no clear data and to say most of the people already had insurance sidesteps an information gap. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07211	Says Wisconsin state Senate President Michael Elllis (R-Neenah) broke Senate rules during debate on a photo ID bill for voters.	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/05/fred-risser/wisconsin-state-sen-fred-risser-says-senate-presid/	Wisconsin’s state Senate has probably generated more headlines in the past four months than any time in state history. Democratic senators skipping town for weeks, warrants issued for their arrest, recall elections for up to nine senators and the disintegration of decorum for even routine business. And this is in the Legislature’s more formal, "deliberative" body. Take, for instance, the May 19, 2011 vote on a bill to require voters to present photo ID at the polls. Long-sought by Republicans, bitterly fought by Democrats, the measure was certain to stir an emotional debate. And it did. The vote ended with a shouting match about the rules of the Senate between the state’s two most veteran lawmakers: Sen. Fred Risser, D-Madison, vs. Sen. Michael Ellis, R-Neenah. Between the two of them, they have a more than 90 years experience in the Capitol. But only one of the two -- Ellis -- held the gavel. And that meant the upper hand. In the heat of the debate, Risser became angry when Ellis, the Senate president, started a roll call vote while Risser was speaking on the Senate floor. "You’re not following the rules, Mister President," Risser yelled. Ellis shouted back: "Read the book!" He hammered the gavel and the roll call vote was taken, over shouts of foul play from Democrats. The bill passed 19-5 and was signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. But what of Risser’s claim that Ellis violated the Senate rules? Let’s open up that book Ellis was talking about. Senate rules govern "such things as committee activities, bill introductions, order and conduct in debate," according the Senate chief clerk’s website. But they are not permanent. Senators meet at the beginning of the two-year legislative session and set the rules for their body. What’s more, the rules allow some things, such as terms of the debate, to be set along the way. "The rules are extremely important to preserve the decorum and the dignity of the Senate," said former Senate President Alan Lasee, R-De Pere, who retired last year after 36 years in the Legislature. "It’s the difference between anarchy and order," said former Sen. Mordecai Lee, D-Milwaukee, now a professor of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. On May 17, 2011, the Senate opened 13 hours of debate on the bill -- largely Democrats speaking against the bill. It ended in the early morning of May 18. The next day, May 19, the measure was up for a final vote. On that morning, Republicans changed the rules for that single bill, about an hour before debate began. They voted to end debate after one hour. Senators were aware of that rule change before the debate began. The Senate convened and Democrats took turns speaking against the bill, with the clock running and being carefully watched by Republicans. Shortly before the hour was up, Risser was recognized and took the floor. He was reminded by Sen. Neal Kedzie, R-Elkhorn -- who was temporarily serving in the chair -- that he had four minutes left. Risser gave a meandering talk, discussing a change of address issue with his own driver’s license and appeared to be killing time. With 15 seconds to go Ellis, back in the chair, gave the warning: Time is almost up. At the stroke of 11, Ellis ordered the roll call be taken, even though Risser was still speaking. "You’re out of order. Take your seat," Ellis told Risser. "Continue the roll call." After the vote, Risser declared in a news conference: "Never in the 55 years that I have served have I seen the type of procedure, or lack of procedure, that has been followed in this house." "In the middle of someone’s talk, they decided to shut me off," he said. So, that’s what happened. Now lets get back to the rules. Debate has been limited only two other times in recent Senate history. It last happened in 2003 on the state budget and 1995 on welfare reform, according to Senate officials. Republicans were in charge both times -- but both parties agreed to limit debate. "It’s incredibly unusual to amend the rules for one day," Lee said. He also said it’s rare that a senator is cut off when he is speaking from the floor. "He did have the floor legally," Lee said. "I think what Mike (Ellis) did was unusual and arguably wrong." But the fact something is unusual does not necessarily mean any rules were broken. "He knows the rules," said Lasee of Risser. "Everything I learned about being Senate president, I learned from Fred." In an interview, Risser backed away from his claim that Ellis violated the Senate rules. Rather, he said, Ellis violated a less-precise set of rules -- the rules of common decency. Said Risser: "I can’t remember any time when there was an arbitrary time limit to stop discussion and to stop a person from discussing." But that’s not what Risser claimed at the time -- and Emily Post was not available for a consult on manners. Indeed, if she were, there would be plenty more to look at: Risser said Ellis also broke the rules by ignoring a motion to adjourn shouted out by Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-Middleton. Under the Senate rules, that motion takes precedence over all others. There was one problem with that tactic: Ellis never "recognized" Erpenbach to give him the floor and the motion was not formally made. "You had nine guys yelling at me and no one got recognized. How do you recognize nine guys?" Ellis said. He had his own list of violations committed by the Democrats: shouting during a roll call, refusing to vote and leaving the Senate floor during a vote. For his part, Ellis said it was no accident that Risser, the longest-serving lawmaker in the nation, was speaking when the hour was up: "They wanted the 40-year veteran in the chair -- me -- versus the 50-year veteran. How dare you cut him off?" What’s the bottom line? Risser’s claim that Ellis broke the rules made for some drama after the voter ID bill passed, but the vote result itself was a foregone conclusion. When he was asked later, Risser pointed to the unwritten rules of common decency. But his claim focused on the written rules of the Senate, which allow for the parameters of debate to be set by a majority vote. It’s rare, but permissible. And that’s what happened here. We rate Risser’s claim False.	None	Fred Risser	None	None	None	2011-06-05T09:00:00	2011-05-19	['None']
pomt-12652	Says "Snoop Dogg arrested for conspiracy after talking about his ‘murder Trump’ video."	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/23/blog-posting/snoop-dogg-wasnt-arrested-over-comments-about-shoo/	A series of fake news articles saying rapper Snoop Dogg was arrested for encouraging people to shoot President Donald Trump are all fabricated, and can be traced back to one website. Snoop, born Calvin Broadus, drew fire of his own for pretending to shoot a clown resembling Trump (named Ronald Klump, for subtlety’s sake) with a toy gun that released a flag that read "BANG" in his video for the song "Lavender," released March 12. You can watch the video here if you don’t mind, um, colorful language. By March 14, the Internet was filled with versions of a post on various websites saying Snoop had suffered the consequences, most with headlines that read, "Snoop Dogg arrested for conspiracy after talking about his ‘murder Trump’ video." Several of these posts were flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, which they are. The posts, almost all of which appear to copy each other, say Snoop wasn’t arrested specifically because of the video. Rather, the articles included a fake quote in which the rapper allegedly said, "I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun." The fake reporter in the fake story then supposedly told the Secret Service what Snoop said, landing Snoop in jail. To be clear, Snoop is not a Trump fan — he called the president a "clown" in a Billboard interview — and the video for "Lavender" does not paint a flattering picture of the current chief executive. But Snoop did not say he hoped someone shot Trump. As is the case with several other claims we’ve checked before, this post originally came from a website called TheLastLineOfDefense.org. They posted the story on March 14. The site doesn’t identify the Obama story as fake, but its About Us page notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." None of the other websites flagged by Facebook indicate the story is contrived, either. But the post has been shared tens of thousands of times via various websites. Trump, who boasted as a presidential candidate, "I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters," tweeted to decry the content of the video: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Like all presidents, Obama did face death threats, although it’s tough to say just how many. At least one other official also decried the imagery of the president with a gun to his head. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told TMZ.com on March 13 that "Snoop shouldn’t have done that." "We’ve had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is really something people should be very careful about," Rubio said, adding that if the "wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you could have a real problem." The Secret Service did tell TheWrap.com on March 14 that they were "aware" of Snoop’s video. But it doesn’t appear they’re hauling him off to prison over his comments. It is a federal crime to threaten the president, but such actions have to be substantial and credible enough to meet the level of a "true threat." The First Amendment allows a lot of leeway for criticism, and Snoop Dogg is hardly the only recording artist to signal his distaste for Trump. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, for example, released a video teaser in November 2016 for his new album Say10, in which he beheads a man dressed suspiciously similar to Trump. Snoop Dogg’s reaction since has been limited to a March 15 Instagram video in which he said he’s "got nothing to say, mate." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com He hasn’t been arrested for his video or for talking about it, despite what the fake reports say. We rate this one Pants On Fire!

pomt-06218	"The only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/06/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-unemployment-only-dropped-becau/	During a Dec. 5, 2011, news conference, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich tried to take the wind out of White House celebrations about the previous week’s jobs report. The statistics for November 2011 were generally regarded as a political plus for President Barack Obama, since they showed the unemployment rate falling to 8.6 percent from 9.0 percent in October, its lowest level since March 2009, just two months after Obama took office. "I think the president has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing, he kills jobs in virtually every part of American life. I mean, notice -- the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created." We’re going to check this statement in two parts. In this item, we’ll check the claim that "the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created." In another item, we’re checking the claim that President Barack Obama "has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing." First, some background about how the unemployment rate is put together. Using a survey of Americans, the Bureau of Labor Statistics determines which respondents are working (either full or part time), which respondents are not working but are looking for work and which ones are not looking for work. The unemployment rate is determined by taking the number of people who are unemployed but are looking for work, and dividing it by the sum of two categories -- those who are employed, plus those who aren’t employed but who are looking for work. In other words, the third broad category of survey respondents -- those who are able to work but who are not actively searching for jobs -- are ignored by this statistic. These may include people who have decided to return to school, who have chosen to take care of their children, who have become dejected and stopped looking or some combination of these categories. What this means is that either of two factors could combine to push the unemployment rate lower -- either more people become employed or more people could stop looking actively for work. So in a literal sense, Gingrich is wrong that the shrinking labor force is "the only reason the unemployment rate is going down." It’s a combination of a shrinking labor force and the increase in jobs. What about the notion that the shrinkage in the labor force was twice the size of the increase in jobs? Judging by the November 2011 data that was widely reported in the media, Gingrich would seem to be right. There were two headline numbers. One was that the economy created a net 120,000 jobs, specifically an increase of 140,000 in the private sector and a decrease of 20,000 government jobs. The other was that the number of people either employed or actively looking for work declined by 315,000. Using these statistics, Gingrich actually undersold the numbers. The shrinkage in the labor force was 2.6 times the size of the increase in jobs, not merely twice the number. But while these numbers are fine to use in isolation, Gingrich runs into problems when he links them, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. That’s because the two numbers originate with different surveys that have different methodologies. As we noted, the unemployment rate is calculated using a survey of Americans that asks whether they are working, looking for work, or not actively looking. This is called the Current Population Survey, or CPS. While the CPS does calculate the number of jobs gained or lost per month, the usual measurement for jobs gained or lost comes from a survey of employer payrolls known as the Current Employment Statistics. Because the CES is almost always the source of employment figures used in government and media reports, it’s understandable why Gingrich turned to it as his benchmark. However, a comparison such as the one he made is one of the exceptions to the rule that CES employment numbers are preferred. To be statistically consistent, Burtless said, you have to use figures from the Current Population Survey. Due to some methodological quirks -- for instance, self-employed Americans are counted by CPS but not by CES -- the monthly increase or decrease in jobs tends to vary somewhat between the two surveys. For November 2011, the CES found a net increase of 120,000 jobs, but the CPS found a net increase of 278,000 jobs. That’s a whole lot closer to the 315,000 Americans who dropped out of the labor market. So, using the CPS numbers, the decline in the labor force is not twice the number of jobs created, as Gingrich said -- it’s only 1.1 times the amount. Our ruling Gingrich would have been correct if he’d simply challenged the White House’s spin by reminding voters that the big drop in the unemployment rate came not just from the jobs created in the previous month but also from workers who left the labor force. However, he overplayed his hand by arguing that "the only reason the unemployment rate is going down" is because of labor force shrinkage. It was by no means the only reason. There were thousands of jobs created too. Gingrich also erred by using the wrong survey in his numerical comparison. (We feel for him: Until Burtless straightened us out, we had thought Gingrich had reported the numbers accurately.) Using the appropriate survey data, the decline in the unemployment rate stemmed in roughly equal parts from job creation and a shrinking labor force. He can't put the blame "only" on people who stopped looking for work. So we rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/736a198d-c5ed-4d2e-80ae-5aa7ada93f14	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-06T18:13:38	2011-12-05	['None']

pomt-12341	Says Iran has "violated the terms of the (nuclear) deal."	/georgia/statements/2017/jun/14/karen-handel/iran-complying-nuclear-deal-yes-small-hiccups/	Republican Karen Handel took aim at the Iran nuclear deal in two recent televised debates ahead of Georgia’s special election, accusing Iran of failing to comply with the agreement to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions. "From the things that I have seen, they are and (have) already violated the terms of the deal," Handel said in a June 8 debate against Democrat Jon Ossoff ahead of the June 20 vote. In the campaign for Georgia’s 6th, a historically Republican congressional district, Handel has been sharply critical of the agreement, which President Donald Trump disparaged as the "worst deal ever negotiated" during his 2016 run. GOP attack ads launched in May sought to paint Ossoff as a dangerous national security naif in part by highlighting his support for the Obama-era deal. The agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was signed in 2015 by the United States and Iran, as well as China, Russia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Under the deal, Iran has agreed not to pursue nuclear weapons and to allow continuous monitoring of its compliance. The United States and other countries agreed to lift sanctions on the condition that Iran abide by its end of the bargain, lest sanctions be reimposed. The deal’s finer details get very technical very quickly, with dozens of limitations placed on Iran’s nuclear-related activities. But the major points concern Iran giving up materials it could use to quickly build a nuclear weapon. Iran agreed to relinquish nearly all of its enriched uranium stockpile (97 percent) and 70 percent of its centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium. It also agreed to stop plutonium production and to dismantle its plutonium reactor. Because Iranian compliance is a crucial national security issue, we decided to look closer at Handel’s repeated claims that the Islamic Republic had violated the terms of the deal. Iran is in compliance The prevailing view among foremost authorities is that Iran has complied with the deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has primary monitoring responsibility, and its quarterly reports are considered the authoritative view of Iran’s compliance. With a couple of minor exceptions we’ll deal with later, the agency has repeatedly found Iran to be in compliance with the terms of the agreement. The U.S. State Department, which is required to report to Congress every 90 days on Iran’s compliance, also certified in April that the Islamic Republic is living up to its end of the deal. Additionally, experts we interviewed agreed Iran is complying with nuclear pact. So case closed, right? Mostly, but with some minor qualifications. Excessive ‘heavy water’ a drop in the bucket While the IAEA has certified Iran’s compliance in its quarterly reports, Iran’s record is not without blemishes. The Handel campaign zeroed in on those. Handel’s campaign aide pointed us to news reports and congressional testimony that highlighted instances where Iran committed two small infractions of a highly technical nature. The deal says Iran can keep 130 metric tons of "heavy water," a modified liquid used in some nuclear reactors. However, Iran has twice crept over its limit, according to the IAEA, each time by a fraction of one ton. These breaches formed the core basis of Handel’s claim that Iran violated the nuclear deal. Some experts we spoke to said Iran has tried to create wiggle room by interpreting portions of the agreement to favor their own interests. But the clear consensus is that it overstates the case to say Iran has violated the deal. Daryl Kimball, the executive director Arms Control Association, downplayed the heavy water issue as a "minor infraction," and noted that Iran currently does not have a functioning heavy water reactor. In other words, from a practical standpoint, the issue is essentially moot because excessive heavy water wouldn’t move Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon. Several experts also noted Iran quickly rectified its breach to come back into compliance. Handel’s campaign pointed us to congressional testimony by David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, who warned lawmakers in February about Iran exceeding its heavy water cap. But Handel’s own source now appears to have a more sanguine view on the state of Iran’s compliance. "Iran appears to be complying more strictly with JCPOA limitations over which it was facing controversy, such as the heavy water cap," Albright wrote in a June 5 analysis of the IAEA’s latest Iran report. It is also worth noting that Albright told lawmakers on April 5 that he did not believe Iran’s excessive supply of heavy water justified reimposing sanctions. Inevitable ‘small hiccups’ Several experts said that under any technical agreement there are bound to be minor implementation issues. "A complex, technical process like this one is inevitably going to face small hiccups," said Ariane M. Tabatabai, visiting assistant professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. "Just as Iran believes there have been hiccups on the U.S. side." She added it’s important to distinguish brief slip-ups ― like Iran’s temporary, slightly excessive heavy water inventory ― from major violations. "What’s critical to watch is whether the parties settle those issues in a timely manner and whether they remain fairly minor," Tabatabai said. "So far, the IAEA, State (Department) and the (European Union) believe this was the case." Richard Nephew, senior research scholar on global energy policy at Columbia University, added that allegations of cheating are best reserved for clear-cut, consequential breaches, should they arise. "I don't agree with Ms. Handel's assertion," he said, "and think that it is overstated." Our ruling Handel said Iran has "violated the terms of the (nuclear) deal." The IAEA, the foremost authority on the matter, has repeatedly deemed Iran in compliance with the nuclear deal. The State Department has also certified the Islamic Republic is holding up its end of the bargain, and a host of experts affirmed these definitive findings. However, the IAEA did report two instances where Iran barely -- and briefly -- exceeded its supply of a nuclear reactor component known as "heavy water." But experts said this minor breach posed no practical risk of moving Iran closer to developing a nuclear weapon, and added that such infractions should not be interpreted to mean Iran has not complied with terms of the deal. We rate Handel’s statement Mostly False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Karen Handel	None	None	None	2017-06-14T15:21:00	2017-06-08	['None']

pomt-00013	"Election fraud: Democrats are voting twice in Maryland"	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/08/infowars/online-claim-double-voting-maryland-lacks-evidence/	"Election fraud: Democrats are voting twice in Maryland" is the headline for a Nov. 5 posting on Alex Jones' InfoWars website being shared on Facebook. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Readers who look below the headline will see no story and no documentation, just a nearly-10-minute video of Jones' show in which an anonymous caller, identified as "Kevin in West Virginia" who says: "I actually moved to Maryland and I had to vote in Maryland for the early election or for early voting, and one thing that I witnessed -- people had already voted and they're letting them vote again. And this was in Hagerstown, Maryland. And I don't quite understand how they can do that." Jones asks: "What were you seeing?" Kevin responds: "Well, I'm blind so I didn't see it. I could hear them saying, ‘Um, you know, Oh! You voted yesterday but you can go ahead and recast your vote again today.' I mean, it's insane, and I wish I could have pulled my phone out or recorder at the time and gotten this on audio or something." Jones then asserts, without offering evidence, that Democrats in Maryland, Texas and "all over" have been busted for doing the same type of thing, adding, "And it's always Democrats because they have no morals." Jones does not ask, and the caller does not say, if there was any indication that the person trying to vote again was a Democrat. "Somebody's making a joke, I'm guessing," Donna Duncan, assistant deputy for election policy at the Maryland State Board of Elections, told PolitiFact in a phone interview. She said that early voting is done through the electronic voter registration database and anyone who tried to vote twice would be immediately flagged. Their only other option, if they insisted that they hadn't voted yet, would be to cast a provisional ballot, which would be investigated by election officials and never counted if it was confirmed that the person had already voted. Duncan said she was unaware of any specific complaints of double voting in the Nov 6 election. In short, InfoWars is alleging voting fraud by Democrats in Maryland based on the claim of a single anonymous caller who says he overheard a comment that was casually made in public under circumstances that, even if accurately interpreted, don't implicate any particular political party. Because the claim is absent of real evidence, we rate it Pants on Fire!	None	Infowars	None	None	None	2018-11-08T14:15:30	2018-11-05	['Maryland', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-05578	Says "streetcars carry more people than buses … you attract more riders who don't ride transit now, and actually the operating costs are not any greater than the bus."	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/03/charlie-hales/do-streetcars-really-beat-out-buses-capacity-rider/	Portland mayoral candidate Charlie Hales is well known for his support of streetcar projects. He promoted them in Portland during his time as a city council member, then ended his term early to go help other cities start their own. Hales hasn’t advocated expanding the city’s system during his current campaign, but the subject keeps coming up. During an appearance on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s "Think Out Loud," Hales explained why he’s so keen on street cars. It comes down to three things, he said: Because "streetcars carry more people than buses. Because you attract more riders who don't ride transit now. And actually the operating costs are not any greater than the bus. The trick is coming up with the very large capital cost." These sorts of talking points get thrown around a lot by rail-system advocates. We thought it was high time we checked it out. Our first call was to Hales’ campaign. His spokeswoman, Jessica Moskovitz, sent us a thorough e-mail outlining the support for the various pieces of the statement. Before we get to all that, though, let’s start with TriMet when spokeswoman Mary Fetsch. On whether streetcars carry more people than buses, there is no ambiguity. Streetcars have a maximum capacity of 92 riders, according to Fetsch. That’s nearly double the 51 or so riders who can fit on a single bus. (It was clear during the interview that Hales was talking capacity here and not the actual number of riders.) The next part was about whether streetcars have a smaller operating cost. Naturally, our minds went to the huge down payment a city has to make on tracks, whereas a bus can use existing roads. But Hales was careful to take that out of the equation by acknowledging the startup costs. It’s clear he was talking about day-to-day operation. On that point, he seems to be right again. According to Fetsch, the streetcar operations cost $1.50 per boarding ride, while the bus costs $2.82. Now, there are a few important caveats here. Portland’s streetcar system is much smaller than TriMet's bus and MAX systems. That’s important because those two systems require a command center, which deals with dispatch and customer service. The streetcar also ducks security charges -- Portland police take care of the streetcar while TriMet has to budget for the Transit Police Division. You also have to consider the fact that the streetcar serves just the city core, while the MAX and bus systems operate in the low-density, outer areas and run both earlier and later. The last bit of important context here, too, is that the streetcar system requires fewer maintenance expenses: It’s younger and it runs at lower speeds, so it has less wear than the MAX and bus system. That leaves us with the last bit: Do streetcars really attract riders who don’t typically take public transit? Moskovitz, the spokeswoman for Hales, pointed us to a study by Edson Tennyson for the National Research Council on the issue of rail transit. Tennyson concluded that, all things being equal, "rail transit is likely to attract 34 percent to 43 percent more riders than will equivalent bus services." There was a catch, though: That paper was written more than two decades ago. The only other source Moskovitz had was an article touting the increase in streetcar ridership. TriMet, however, had two pieces of pertinent information. First up, between 2000 and 2003, bus stops within a sixth of a mile of the streetcar saw ridership drop by 20 percent when the rail went online. Meanwhile, the streetcar ridership grew well beyond that drop, indicating the system was attracting more people than just those who would have ridden the bus. Second, according to a June 2011 rider study, 38 percent of occasional and infrequent riders exclusively used the MAX, while only 12 percent exclusively used the bus. Of course, the MAX is not the streetcar, but this fact seems to speak to the attractiveness of rail travel over bus for some transit users. While the data are somewhat old and somewhat tangential, taken together they seem to support Hale’s claim that the streetcar attracts more infrequent riders. So that brings us to the ruling. Hales said "streetcars carry more people than buses … you attract more riders who don't ride transit now, and actually the operating costs are not any greater than the bus." Whether these arguments make a persuasive case for the necessity and usefulness of a streetcar system is, of course, up for debate. The statement itself remains factual. While, there’s some missing context, it’s nothing significant. We rate this claim True.	None	Charlie Hales	None	None	None	2012-04-03T14:18:28	2012-02-12	['None']

pomt-11720	The House tax plan "would provide permanent tax cuts for individuals who are multi-millionaires and billionaires," but "all middle-class families will eventually face a tax increase, since tax relief for them expires."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/dec/15/gwen-moore/house-tax-plan-permanent-tax-cuts-rich-eventually-/	U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore took to the House floor on Nov. 29, 2017, to criticize the House tax bill that Republicans hope will become law before the end of the year. The Milwaukee Democrat started with a sarcastic reference to a book authored by Donald Trump before he became president, saying: Mr. Speaker, I proudly present the "art of the deal." The tax deal before us would provide permanent tax cuts for individuals who are multi-millionaires and billionaires. With this deal, all middle-class families will eventually face a tax increase, since tax relief for them expires. We’ve rated as Half True a claim by the biggest backer of the House tax bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. We found that savings for some middle-class Wisconsin households would reach $2,000 in 2018 but would get smaller each year after that. So, what about Moore’s claim about the tax bill’s impact nationally? Would multimillionaires and billionaires get permanent tax cuts, while all middle-class families would initially see a tax cut, but later get a tax increase? The bill To support Moore’s claim, her office pointed us to a Washington Post Wonkblog analysis that summarized the House bill this way: Big businesses get a large, permanent tax cut, while American families receive only temporary tax relief that expires" in 2023. The tax increase would mostly hit moderate and middle-income families because a credit designed to help them expires after five years. A $300-per-parent family credit that would be created with the House bill does expire in 2023. But the credit would be available to all families, not just the middle class, though arguably it means more to middle-class families than to higher-income ones. Let’s dig a little deeper. Here’s what we know from a PolitiFact National article and our own reporting. The rich: The House bill makes changes that benefit higher-income earners more than the middle class, even if there aren’t specifically provisions for millionaires or billionaires. Those include permanent reductions to the corporate income tax rate, a lower pass-through business income tax rate and repeal of the estate tax, which is only paid by the ultra wealthy. The net tax cuts going to the richest 1 percent increases from about 34 percent in 2019 to 47 percent in 2027 under the House bill, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. That’s partly because the tax cuts titled to the wealthiest are permanent. The middle class: The Tax Foundation found that, comparing the House bill to current law, the average taxpayer in the middle class would see an increase in their after-tax income -- that is, a tax cut -- in each year from 2018 through 2027. But just because the average taxpayer would get a cut doesn’t mean that all taxpayers would. The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center says that by 2027, roughly 25 to 30 percent of middle-class households would face a tax increase relative to current law. That’s because a family tax credit created by the bill would expire after 2022 and the because law uses a slower-growing measure of inflation for things such as the standard deduction, which has the effect of raising taxes over time. Two notes: While the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center are respected for their research, there isn’t a universal definition of "middle class." It’s not clear which provisions in the tax bill approved by the House will be in the final version of the legislation to be considered by both the House and the Senate. Our rating Moore says the House tax plan "would provide permanent tax cuts for individuals who are multi-millionaires and billionaires," but "all middle-class families will eventually face a tax increase, since tax relief for them expires." The richest do benefit from tax cuts that are permanent, but most in the middle class also would see lower taxes each year from 2018 through 2027. It’s estimated that only 25 to 30 percent of middle-class households, not all of them, would see a tax increase by 2027. We rate Moore’s statement Half True.

pomt-14401	Susie Lee and her husband "own 17 homes across the country and use their private jet to take vacations," and invest in "companies like Walmart, Halliburton and GEO Group."	/nevada/statements/2016/mar/14/culinary-workers-union/susie-lees-wealth-under-fire-competitive-nevada-co/	The powerful Las Vegas Culinary Workers Union may not have officially gotten involved in the Nevada presidential caucuses, but the 57,000-member union is starting to throw its weight around in down-ballot races. The union endorsed state Sen. Ruben Kihuen in the crowded Democratic primary for Nevada’s hotly contested Fourth Congressional District, and is going on the offensive against Kihuen’s biggest challenger — education advocate and philanthropist Susie Lee. The primary election is June 14. Union secretary-treasurer Geoconda Arguello-Kline asked union members in a letter sent March 9 to endorse Kihuen at the upcoming AFL-CIO state convention, and claimed that Lee is "trying to purchase this congressional seat." "She has never run for office, never taken a tough vote, and frankly, doesn’t represent our values," Arguello-Kline wrote. "She and her husband own 17 homes across the country and use their private jet to take vacations. She is an investor whose personal wealth comes from questionable investments in companies like Walmart, Halliburton and GEO Group (a for-profit prison company)." Given the specificity of the those charges and the likelihood that Lee’s opponents will use her wealth as a negative over the next three months of campaigning, we wanted to see just how accurate the union is. A union spokeswoman forwarded a screenshot of an excel spreadsheet listing all of the properties owned by Lee and her husband Dan, a casino company CEO. We found the union to be correct: The couple listed 14 rentable properties in multiple states on their 60-page financial disclosure report, with a total net value between $2.2 million and $4.8 million. They also own a five-bedroom home in Las Vegas worth around $2.1 million, a vacation home in Wilson, Wyo., and another house in Las Vegas where Lee’s mother-in-law lives, according to county assessor records (personal and vacation homes aren’t required to be disclosed). That adds up to 17 properties. Lee does indeed list several investments in companies generally seen as liberal kryptonite, including Halliburton, for-profit prison company GEO Group and Walmart. But those investments were made through a brokerage account that Lee’s campaign says were made at the discretion of the account manager, not the candidate. Lee’s campaign manager says she dropped the investments, which made up a tiny percentage of her overall investment portfolio, after filing her financial disclosure report in September 2015. Lee’s campaign confirmed that the couple owns a plane, but they said it’s a small single-engine turboprop plane that Dan Lee uses to visit his casino properties in rural areas like Fallon, Nev., and Rising Sun, Ind. The charge of trying to "buy this primary" is harder to fact-check, but Lee has loaned her campaign $150,000, which makes up around 17 percent of her total money raised. But even subtracting those loans, Lee leads her primary opponents in the fundraising race by a significant margin. It’s worth noting that Lee, Kihuen and their two other major opponents have relatively similar stances on raising the standard of living for working class families — all four support universal health care and want to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Our ruling The Culinary Workers Union claims that Lee and her husband "own 17 homes across the country," a "private jet," and that she invests in Walmart, Haliburton and the for-profit prison company GEO Group. There’s no doubt that Lee and her husband are substantially well-off.

pomt-05424	Before the HOPE scholarship, "70 percent of the high school students who made 1400 or above on their SAT left the state of Georgia. Now, 70 percent of those stay in the state of Georgia."	/georgia/statements/2012/may/01/nathan-deal/deal-hope-aid-keeps-georgias-brightest-close-home/	Even as elected officials cut the beloved HOPE scholarship, they’re going out of their way to remind voters they think it’s good for Georgia and they want it to survive. The nearly 20-year-old program uses Georgia Lottery money to pay in-state college tuition for the state’s highest-performing students. Gov. Nathan Deal told attendees at a recent Atlanta Press Club luncheon that HOPE is keeping Georgia’s best and brightest close to home. "I am told ... and I think my statistic is correct on this, that prior to HOPE, 70 percent of the high school students who made 1400 or above on their SAT left the state of Georgia," he said April 17. "Now the figure is reversed," Deal said. "Seventy percent of those stay in the state of Georgia. And that makes a huge difference on a number of fronts." Sounds like a huge difference to us, but is this statistic true? First, some context. The scholarship has been cut in recent years because spending was growing faster than the state could afford. It used to provide full rides to state schools for those who met its requirements. HOPE now pays full tuition for only about 10 percent of recipients. The rest receive scholarships that cover 90 percent of tuition at 2010-11 academic year rates. That percentage will likely shrink over time. Do students who make 1400 or above on their SAT stay in Georgia at more than twice the rate they did before HOPE? We hunted for the source of Deal’s information and came up short. We found no studies, published or otherwise, that directly support Deal’s statement. What we did find is that a string of credible officials have used this factoid or one like it. Their statements appear in multiple news outlets, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This doesn’t mean Deal’s claim is false. Data show it has a ring of truth. Deal’s office responded to our inquiry with a peer-reviewed study published in 2006 in the Journal of Labor Economics about the effects of HOPE on college enrollment. The study did not conclude that the percentage of students who score 1400 or better has grown. Instead, a footnote refers readers to a statement in an October 2000 Athens Banner-Herald article, which in turn quoted then-Gov. Roy Barnes. "Since the HOPE program started seven years ago, [Barnes] said, the state's rate of retaining students with SAT scores between 1500 and 1600 has climbed from 23 percent to 76 percent," according to the story. Barnes told PolitiFact Georgia that he got the number from former University System of Georgia Chancellor Stephen Portch, who had the numbers calculated at the governor’s request. Portch made a similar claim in 2011 to an AJC reporter, but he used a 1400 combined reading and math score as his threshold. Atlanta Magazine and an Augusta television station have also used the number in recent years. Data we found don’t refute these claims. SAT scores of freshmen in Georgia’s state schools appear to be increasing, as is the number of students staying in-state. In fact, the Journal of Labor Economics study found that HOPE reduced the number of students leaving Georgia for college by an average of 560 per year. Furthermore, the average SAT score of freshmen in Georgia public colleges and universities rose nearly 40 points after HOPE, the study said. Average scores in Georgia and the U.S. rose only slightly during that time. Other information suggests Deal was heading in the right direction. But it also raises the possibility that he overstated the percentage of high-scoring college students who stayed. A 2003 presentation by the University System of Georgia stated that in 1992, 36 percent of Georgia’s college-bound seniors who scored 1000 or above enrolled in the system’s schools. Ten years later, that number was 57 percent. The change among higher-scoring students was not so dramatic. For students who scored between 1400 and 1490, the figure climbed 23 percentage points, from 21 percent to 44 percent. The percentage rose to 30 percent for those who scored 1500 and above, an increase of only 8 points. This information has shortcomings. It’s old, and we could not find further details on how researchers came to these conclusions. Furthermore, students can also use HOPE money to attend private schools in Georgia. The data do not show what happened to them. More recent data also suggest Deal is on the right track. According to data provided by the governor’s office, the mean SAT score of freshmen entering UGA jumped from 1,086 to 1,226 between 1993 and 2011. This bodes well for Deal’s statement, but it does not confirm it directly. The governor used very specific numbers in his HOPE claim, but his office could not back them up. There’s also a possibility the data Deal and others have used are far out of date. The newspaper article cited in the study his office sent us is more than a decade old. Deal’s statement contains a kernel of truth. Recent information backs up the larger claim that more of Georgia’s high-achieving students are staying in-state to attend college. But Deal set a high bar when he used such specific figures. The governor earns a Mostly False.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-05-01T06:00:00	2012-04-17	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']

Bernie Sanders is wearing a bad grade as a badge of honor. The Democratic presidential candidate is under fire since Sunday’s debate for his votes on gun legislation, with chief rival Hillary Clinton eagerly highlighting his flip-flops on immunity for gun dealers, among other issues. Sanders got his chance to explain himself in Underwood, Iowa, when an audience member asked him about his past positions, which she said seemed more Republican. Sanders said that impression wasn’t right. "I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA," he said. "Does that sound like a tool of the NRA? D-minus." We wanted to know if his statement earned perfect marks. A spokesman for Sanders’ campaign said Sanders’ NRA grade came during the 2012 election cycle, as shown in the lobby group’s subscriber-only database. The group awarded Republican John MacGovern, Sanders’ unsuccessful challenger, an A. The NRA corroborated Sanders’ D-minus grade. Of course, 2012 wasn’t Sanders’ first public-office rodeo. The NRA (or technically its political action committee, the NRA-Political Victory Fund) has grades for Sanders as far back as 1992, when he ran for his second term for Congress as an independent from Vermont. (The NRA did not have earlier ratings available even though Sanders first ran for Congress in 1988 before winning in 1990.) The grades the gun lobby did have on file show Sanders has never exactly been in its favor, with one sort-of exception. 1992 D 1994 F 1996 F 1998 F 2000 F 2002 F 2004 D+ 2006 C- 2012 D- Our first thought: Man, the NRA really didn’t like Sanders in the 1990s and early 2000s, awarding five straight Fs. The NRA slightly warmed to Sanders in the mid 2000s, giving him a D-plus in 2004 and a C-minus in 2006, his first bid for the Senate. That’s mediocre but passing, right? The change of heart corresponds with Sanders voting in favor of the gun liability bill, which passed in October 2005 with NRA support. The bill also contained provisions for childproof trigger locks and a ban on body armor-piercing bullets, which Sanders mentioned as he explained his vote to the audience in Underwood. However, its most controversial provision was broad immunity for gun sellers, with a few exceptions, such as if the seller was negligent or knowingly broke the law in making the sale. The Democrats opposed this section, but the bill passed 283-144 in the House. (You can read more about Sanders' votes on guns over his congressional career in this fact-check.) NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter gave us a little more insight into the group’s grading process. Ratings are compiled by lobbyists and analysts who know the issues in their specific region well, she said, and are generally not done for primaries. Each grade represents each election cycle, including all of the relevant gun issues in that politician’s state and the country at that time. "They only last through that election," Hunter said. Clinton’s most recent grade came in 2006 as she ran for re-election to the Senate in 2006. It was an F. Our ruling Sanders said he has a "D-minus grade" from the NRA. He’s accurately referring to the most recent assessment from the gun lobby group in 2012. The NRA has not issued a more recent evaluation for Sanders for the 2016 primary election. It’s worth noting that the grade is a few years old, and that his rating has been higher in previous election cycles. Still, a D-minus is far from a full-throated endorsement. His claim is partially accurate but needs more clarifying information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-01-20T18:27:37	2016-01-19	['None']

pomt-12397	"Bay Area liberals have given more to Jon Ossoff's campaign than people in Georgia."	/georgia/statements/2017/may/26/congressional-leadership-fund/gop-attack-ad-twists-ossoff-donation-sources-georg/	Both sides have launched attack ads in the race for Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. Recently, Democrats accused Republican Karen Handel of wallowing in administrative bloat. (We rated that Mostly False). Now, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, has an ad that paints Democrat Jon Ossoff as beholden more to people in California than voters in Georgia. It is running in the Atlanta area as part of the super PAC’s $6.7 million independent expenditure. Shot against iconic backdrops of San Francisco, actors, each one the most stereotypical of "left coast" stereotypes, speak cheerfully about Ossoff. A young woman with a floppy hat and a big "Cut the military now" button says, "There’s a reason Bay Area liberals have contributed more to Jon Ossoff’s campaign than people in Georgia. He’s one of us." Another young woman stands in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and says "San Francisco hearts Ossoff." With a coy toss of her ponytails, she makes a heart with her hands and presses them to her chest. Set aside the political snark and you have this factual claim: San Francisco "Bay Area liberals have given more to Jon Ossoff's campaign than people in Georgia." Is it so? The Congressional Leadership Fund said they got their information from the Mercury News, a prominent local paper. An April 12 article said, "Ossoff reported 2,628 individual donations from people living in the nine Bay Area counties, significantly more than from all of Georgia — although of a smaller total value." Here’s how the numbers shook out at the end of March when the data behind the article was collected. (The dollar total for Bay Area residents wasn’t in the article. We calculated it based on the same data.) State Number of donors Dollars (through March 31, 2017) Georgia 1,578 $600,141 California 5,822 $547,857 Bay Area 2,628 $290,229 (PolitiFact calculation) So first off, the article doesn’t back up what the ad said, that people in the Bay Area gave more to Ossoff than people in Georgia. In fact, as the original article noted, Georgians gave more money to Ossoff than people from California. As for people in the Bay Area, we found that they gave half as much compared to voters in Georgia. (More people from the Bay Area contributed than from Georgia, but that’s not what the ad claimed.) Of course, it’s also important to note that the ad relies on information that is now nearly two months old. In truth, there’s only so much more to learn. The last public report was on April 16. With help from staff at the Center for Responsive Politics, we updated the totals. Georgia remained in the lead, by about $640,000 compared to about $321,000 from the Bay area. It’s also worth noting that donations under $200 are not required to be itemized under Federal Election Commission rules, meaning we don’t know where those donors live. That accounts for about two-thirds of Ossoff’s donations through the end of March. Our ruling The Conservative Leadership Fund is running an ad that says "Bay Area liberals have given more to Jon Ossoff's campaign than people in Georgia." In fact, based on data available through mid April, people in Georgia have given Ossoff twice as much money as people in the Bay Area. The one trace of accuracy is that Bay Area donors outnumber Ossoff’s Georgia donors, but the ad failed to describe the donations in those terms. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08597	Marco Rubio tried to insert "$1.5 million for a rowing institute" into the state budget.	/florida/statements/2010/sep/24/charlie-crist/rowing-institute-earmark-center-new-charlie-crist-/	Charlie Crist's independent campaign for the U.S. Senate is reaching back into his old Republican playbook to attack GOP candidate Marco Rubio. In a new TV ad called "Vetoed," Crist says Rubio of tried to sneak millions of dollars of earmarks and pet projects into the state budget while Rubio was House speaker. It's pretty much a rehash of an attack Crist launched back in the spring, when he was still fighting for the Republican nomination. "Have you seen Marco Rubio's ads attacking me?" Crist asks in the ad, which began airing on Sept. 20, 2010. "Here's what he's hiding. Rubio tried to sneak almost $500 million in earmarks into the budget. I vetoed them. One and a half million dollars for a rowing institute. Vetoed. $800,000 for artificial turf on a Miami field where he played flag football. I vetoed that, too. "Just remember, the Washington special interests who are paying for Rubio's ads don't want an independent like me looking out for your money." Back in March, PolitiFact Florida checked Crist's claim that Rubio inserted $800,000 into the state budget for artificial turf on a field where Rubio played flag football and ruled it to be Half True. In this fact check, we wanted to check the other specific claim -- which we're hearing for the first time -- that Rubio tried to steer $1.5 million to a rowing institute. First, a little background. Rubio served as House speaker during Crist's first two years as governor in 2007 and 2008. As speaker, Rubio wielded great influence over the state budget the Legislature ultimately presented to the governor. "The House speaker has absolute power to direct the appropriations staff, subcommittee chairs or appropriations chair to put in the appropriation or take it out," said Steve Geller, a retired Senate Democratic leader. "If the speaker said 'put it in,' it's in, if he said 'take it out,' it's out. ... One of the perks of being speaker or (Senate) president is you get to put money places." And one of the perks of being governor is the ability to veto individual pieces of the budget. Florida's governor has the power of a line-item veto, meaning Crist can strike a specific program or project from the state budget without having to reject the spending plan entirely. In 2007, Crist vetoed what was said to be a record $459 million in projects from the budget. Crist vetoed more than $140 million in college construction projects. He killed a $15 million program to safeguard mobile homes from hurricanes. He axed $6 million to continue privatization of the state accounting system. "We are trying to lead by example," Crist said at the time. "Honoring the fact that the people across the state are pinching their pennies, so are we." We should note that other local projects were spared by Crist in 2007. In a parks category, he vetoed most line items but spared $500,000 to restore the fort at Fort DeSoto Park in his home county of Pinellas. And 13 projects supported by Sen. Mike Fasano, a Crist ally from Pasco County, survived the veto ax. In Rubio's second year as speaker in 2008, Crist's vetoes to a smaller budget were also much smaller. Crist cut just two projects, $300,000 for a lake restoration program in Central Florida and $840,000 for a Miami festival promoting ties with Miami's sizable Nicaraguan community. That's roughly about $460 million in budget vetoes in Rubio's two years as speaker, or as Crist says in the ad -- that's "almost $500 million" that Crist claims Rubio tried to sneak into the budget. It's a stretch in itself to try to link every project Crist vetoed in two years specifically to Rubio, as if he was personally pushing for $7.5 million for economic development initiatives in Pasco County (vetoed in 2007) or $1 million in startup costs for the Tampa Bay Regional Transportation Authority (vetoed in 2007). It's also a pretty big stretch to use the word "sneak" the way Crist does. The projects are listed in line items within the budget, and the governor's office keeps a spreadsheet that tracks what each request is for. But we'll address those stretches more in the context of the rowing center claim. The $1.5 million budget request was to build a boat house and improve a boat launch ramp on a water management district canal near Fellsmere, a tiny inland town in Indian River County. The canal, called the C-54 Canal, runs in a straight east-west line between Indian River and Brevard counties, and has high dirt and grass mounds on either side. The mounds protect the water from being exposed to the wind. As a result, the canal has become a perfect venue for competitive rowers. The state would have helped create the Tom Adams National Training Center for Rowing, a partnership between the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne and the St. Johns River Water Management District. The request for the money came to the Legislature from state Rep. Ralph Poppell, R-Vero Beach. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Poppell said the money might have helped land the U.S. Olympic Rowing Team, which was thinking of training on the Florida canal for several months out of the year. "I have been there when there would be 300-500 cars lined up on that canal bank," Poppell said. "People are coming down from Michigan and Massachusetts to do events in that spot because there is nowhere else really good to go." Crist vetoed the $1.5 million appropriation in 2007 when Rubio was speaker, and a request for $500,000 for the canal in 2010 when Rubio had left the state House. We asked Poppell -- who hadn't seen the Crist ad -- what role Rubio had in adding the $1.5 million to the budget. "I think all I did with the speaker, if I remember correctly, I made him aware of what we were trying to accomplish," Poppell said. "I don't think I went to him to ask him for any special favor. In his thought, he was supportive if we could find the money to do it. To be honest, it wasn't a hot button issue. He believed in it, but he also was very clear we were dealing with a tight budget." Poppell called us back after watching the ad online. Crist "needs to pin it on the person who did it. That's me," Poppell said. "I'm the one who sponsored it. I'm the one who believed in it. I'm the one who fought for it. I'm the one that pushed it. "Did it have to meet the muster of the leadership? Sure," Poppell said. "But I didn't spend hours beating on Marco's door. If people are going to throw any stones about this project, throw them at me." We asked the Crist and Rubio campaigns about connections between Rubio and the $1.5 million rowing appropriation. "The speaker's budget that was presented to the governor for signature or veto with the speaker's vote and support included $1.5 million for a rowing institute," Crist spokesman Danny Kanner said. Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said there is no direct connection between the rowing center and Rubio, and reiterated that it was Poppell who sought the money. In his latest television ad, "Vetoed," Crist claims that Rubio tried to sneak almost $500 million into the state budget for pet projects, including "$1.5 million for a rowing institute." We find a lot lacking in the claim. Rubio did vote for the 2007 budget with the $1.5 million included for the rowing center. And as speaker, he could have likely killed the appropriation before a floor vote. But that's the extent of the relationship between Rubio and the rowing money. We found no evidence in news accounts, for example, that Rubio lobbied or pushed for the money. We also found no direct benefit to Rubio for funding a project 150 miles north of his Miami-area House district. That's a key difference from a project for Rubio's home district, or a project where he otherwise might benefit (like adding artificial turf to fields where Rubio played flag football). The clear suggestion from Crist's ad is that Rubio tried to sneak the money into the budget. But there's no evidence of that, either. The request was formally submitted on Jan. 12, 2007 -- months before the budget was agreed to -- and the initial request made clear what the money was for: "Construction of necessary infrastructure along the C-54 Canal in Brevard County to facilitate use as a rowing training center." And that request, as we now know, wasn't made by Rubio, but Poppell. And just to be even more clear, the rowing center appropriation had its own line in the budget. (See here, page 345). To tie Rubio to the rowing center is an oversimplification of how the state budget process works -- a process Crist as a former state senator knows quite well. We rate his claim Pants On Fire!

Trump’s plan is built on four "pillars," as he called them, one of which is a wall along America’s southern border. "Our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country," Trump said, adding shortly thereafter: "These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction." The speech was roundly praised by conservative politicians and pundits, including Ann Coulter. Coulter is the author of several books and often appears on radio and television shows. While Trump’s speech didn’t linger on the relationship between opioids and Mexico, Coulter attempted to provide some context. "Good he's talking about opioid crisis -- 100% of heroin/fentanyl epidemic is because we don't have a WALL," she tweeted. There are three claims to address here. One: the insinuation that the opioid crisis is limited to or caused by a rise in heroin and fentanyl use. Two: that all heroin and fentanyl used by Americans enters the country through Mexico. And three: the suggestion that building a wall along America’s southern border would drastically reduce opioid abuse. What are opioids? The National Institute on Drug Abuse describes opioids as a class of drugs that includes heroin, fentanyl and prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone (including OxyContin), hydrocodone (including Vicodin), codeine, morphine, and many others. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid pain reliever that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. More than 64,000 people died in 2016 from drug overdoses, the majority of which were linked to opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency Oct. 26 at the White House. What caused the epidemic? According to the final report by the U.S. Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, a commission Trump created, the current epidemic is a result of "excessive prescribing of opioids since 1999" compounded by the "widespread availability of inexpensive and purer illicit heroin; the influx of highly potent fentanyl/fentanyl analogs." The commission included former Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the chairman, Republican Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Democratic North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, former Democratic Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Republican Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Bertha Madras, an opioid expert and professor of psychobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. "Examining national-level general population heroin data (including those in and not in treatment), nearly 80 percent of heroin users reported using prescription opioids prior to heroin," the Institute on Drug Abuse notes on a webpage explaining prescription opioids as a gateway drug. In 2015 alone, the Institute says, an estimated 2 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 591,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder (the stats aren’t mutually exclusive). Where do heroin and fentanyl come from? International gangs based in Mexico "remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States," and their most common method of smuggling drugs is vehicles legally coming into the U.S., according to a 2017 Drug Enforcement Administration report. And, as PolitiFact previously reported, heroin is most smuggled through Mexico. "Opium poppy cultivation and heroin production in Mexico, believed to be the primary source of heroin for the U.S. market, have continued to surge, providing traffickers a steady stream of high-purity, low-cost heroin to market throughout the United States," the report says. As for fentanyl, it mainly originates in China and comes in through the southwest border, Canada and the U.S. Postal Service. Trump’s opioid commission says many users are ordering the pill-form of fentanyl online and having it shipped discreetly. The commission’s report references a Carnegie Mellon University study which found that revenues from online illicit drug sales increased from between $15-17 million in 2012 to $150-$180 million in 2015. Furthermore, the fentanyl found at the southern border tends to be less potent than the fentanyl shipped through the mail. "Large volumes of fentanyl are seized at the [southern border], although these seizures are typically low in purity – on average approximately 7 percent," the DEA’s 2017 report says. "Conversely, the smaller volumes seized after arriving in the mail directly from China can have purities over 90 percent and be worth much more than the fentanyl seized at the SWB." Would a wall work? Probably not. Trump has said that building a wall between the United States and Mexico would curb opioid use in America, and experts told PolitiFact in October they’re skeptical a wall would have a drastic impact. Even though a lot of heroin comes from Mexico, it’s not always walked across the border. As PolitiFact pointed out in this fact check of Trump, traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles crossing the border (through legal checkpoints and illegal crossings), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast. "Traffickers hide their illicit cargo in secret, state–of–the art compartments designed for cars, or under legal goods in trailer trucks. And they have learned many techniques for fooling the border patrol," Vanda Felbab-Brown wrote in an August 2017 essay for the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, DC. As Trump once accurately noted, smugglers also attempt to get drugs into the United States using catapults, drones, boats and tunnels. At least 232 tunnels were discovered on U.S. borders from 1990 to January 2017, according to the 2017 DEA report. The report notes that the most common method employed by Mexican traffickers "involves transporting illicit drugs through U.S. ports of entry (POEs) in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers." As for fentanyl, Trump’s opioid commission seemed more concerned with shipments from China than couriers from Mexico. "We are losing this fight predominately through China," the commission wrote in its interim report. "This must become a top tier diplomatic issue with the Chinese; American lives are at stake and it threatens our national security," it says. "Our inability to reliably detect fentanyl at our land borders and at our international mail handling facilities creates untenable vulnerabilities." Josh Stein, North Carolina’s Democratic attorney general, summarized the issue in an email. "Traffickers predominately bring heroin from Mexico but usually through legal points of entry. Drug dealers import illicit fentanyl from China usually by air. To effectively combat the opioid epidemic … there are better investments than a wall." Our ruling Coulter, alluding to the opioid crisis, said the heroin and fentanyl epidemic was "100 percent" caused by America’s lack of a border wall. Heroin is mostly trafficked from Mexico, mostly hidden in cargo – not by crossing the border through the desert. Fentanyl comes from both Mexico and Canada, and can also be transported through the mail. Coulter’s "100 percent" claim is far off-base no matter how we parse it. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-04396	"Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times."	/florida/statements/2012/oct/17/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-repeatedly-bill-nelson-voted-incr/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson is a big fan of tax increases, says his Republican rival U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV of Fort Myers. "Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times, 150 times," Mack said during a debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie Oct. 17. "I voted to cut taxes … if you voted for higher taxes 150 times, it's time for you to go." Later in the debate Nelson said that Mack’s claim was "simply not true." "Outside fact-check organizations have said it's not true," Nelson said. "You haven’t talked about all the tax cuts I voted for." Mack repeated the claim again: "Senator, your propensity to vote for higher taxes is shocking, absolutely shocking. Like I said, if you voted for higher taxes 150 times, it’s time for you to go." We fact-checked this claim by Mack in August and rated it False. We will summarize what we learned from our earlier research. Double-counting votes and other tallying tricks Mack’s campaign sent us a list of what they characterized as at least 157 votes in favor of higher taxes during Nelson’s Senate career, which started in 2001. (They sent us a similar list again the night of the debate.) About half of the votes on the list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution raised, lowered or even kept taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law. Mack’s tally counts multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Mack cites nine votes Nelson took in 2008 about Congressional Resolution 70, a five-year budget plan. Mack also counted multiple votes on actual legislation. It’s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments. For example, in 2001 Mack counts 15 of Nelson’s votes against H.R. 1836 -- the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. That counts as one example of Nelson opposing tax cuts -- not 15 examples. Which brings us to another point: Is opposing a tax cut the same as "voting to raise our taxes?" Mack’s list counts several examples of Nelson opposing tax cuts. Some are minor, such as Nelson’s vote to table an amendment to get rid of the medical device tax in 2010. We sent Mack’s list to a three federal budget experts, who generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut doesn’t equal a tax increase. Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction, said Mack’s long list was "ludicrous." "Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is not voting for a tax increase," he said. "So, I would argue the methodology represents a crazy way to look at this issue." Nelson supported some tax cuts Mack’s statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Here, we will focus on the Bush tax cuts. Nelson opposed a $1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 because he said it didn’t do enough to reduce debt or help low- and middle-income taxpayers. He also said that as a congressman he had voted for President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts and that led to huge deficits. "I don't want to see Congress make that mistake again," Nelson said in 2001. In 2003 on the second round of Bush tax cuts, Nelson voted against the $350 billion package on the conference report. But in 2006 and in 2010 Nelson, supported extending the tax cuts. This year, he went along with Obama’s plan and voted in July to keep tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000, though he had said he would have preferred keeping the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $1 million. "His favored position, and one he still holds, is to let the Bush cuts expire on those making more than $1 million," said his Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin. Nelson called for other tax cuts at times. During his first Senate term he bucked his party in favor of repealing the estate tax and in 2007 he sponsored an amendment to reduce the tax on large cigars. Some of Nelson’s votes cited by Mack would only affect certain businesses -- for example he voted in favor of repealing exemptions for oil and gas companies in 2010. He took many votes in favor of eliminating corporate tax breaks to pay for projects such as port security. Mack’s spokesman told us that the largest tax increase Nelson voted for was "Obamacare." The health care law did raise taxes on the wealthy and health insurance companies. (Read about those provisions in a fact-check we did on a claim by Rush Limbaugh.) In an interview on debate night, Mack campaign consultant Gary Maloney defended including the budget resolutions and said they are important because they bind congressional committees on their spending and build in assumptions of revenue, taxes and spending. "A vote for a budget that assumes higher taxes is a vote that is designed to produce a revenue bill that will raise taxes," he said. Our ruling Mack said, "Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times." Mack arrives at that figure through some tricks: He counts non-binding resolutions and duplicative votes on the same bill. He counts a vote against a tax cut as a vote for a tax increase, even though it’s not the same thing. And Mack failed to tell debate viewers that Nelson has also voted in favor of tax cuts or extending tax cuts. In the list of votes that Mack supplied to PolitiFact after the debate, he included a note that explained it included non-binding votes and other caveats. But during the debate, Mack didn’t explain any of that -- he just repeated the claim without further explanation. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09394	The cost to implement Florida's class size amendment so far has been "$16 billion."	/florida/statements/2010/mar/24/don-gaetz/florida-don-gaetz-class-size-16-billion/	A school superintendent turned state Senator wants to relax a requirement that the state continue shrinking K-12 class sizes. State Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, says that while a 2002 constitutional amendment mandating smaller classes has produced positive results, the expensive cost in a weak economy don't justify a continued investment. Gaetz, the former superintendent in Okaloosa County, thinks voters might get sticker shock if they heard how much taxpayers already have spent implementing the state's class amendment. "The cost of class size so far: $16 billion," Gaetz said on the Senate floor March 23, 2010. That's an awful lot of money -- about a quarter of the total annual state budget. Put another way, with $16 billion the state could build new baseball stadiums in St. Petersburg and Miami ($1 billion), fund NASA's mission to put people back on the moon for two years ($2.5 billion) and give every Floridian $500 ($8.8 billion). With what's left over -- $3.7 billion -- the state could fund every Congressional campaign in 2010. Has the cost been that large? First, some background about the class-size amendment. In November 2002, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment that sets limits for how many students are allowed per class starting in the 2010-11 school year. The limits are no more than 18 students for grades K-3, no more than 22 students for grades 4-8 and no more than 25 students for grades 9-12. In 2003, the state started to slowly implement the changes. First, classroom reductions were measured at the school district average, then at the school average. This fall, districts are scheduled to meet the new limits in every classroom. But Gaetz wants to freeze the class-size reduction program. His proposed amendment to the constitution would require schools to meet class-size averages, instead of the exact numbers in every room. The proposal must be approved by three-fifths of the Legislature and 60 percent of voters in November if it is to become law. As for the costs, Gaetz is nearly right on. The House PreK-12 Appropriations Committee received a class size update from the state Department of Education in January. The report on class size, which you can see here (starts on page 36), includes a breakdown of the operating and capital costs to implement the class size amendment. The total cost listed in the report actually is slightly more than $19 billion, but that includes the money requested for the 2010-2011 school year. Counting only the money that's already been allocated, the cost so far is $15.8 billion, according to the same report. A Senate staff analysis of Gaetz's bill includes the same $15.8 billion figure. Gaetz said on the Senate floor that the cost so far implementing mandatory class size reductions has been $16 billion. The Florida Department of Education puts the bill at $15.8 billion to date, and could spend another $3.2 billion next year. We rate Gaetz's claim True.

pomt-05598	"Polls show Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare, especially the individual mandate."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/29/rick-santorum/santorum-says-americans-overwhelmingly-oppose-heal/	Rick Santorum, in an op-ed for U.S. News and World Report, wrote about his opposition to the national health care reform law, calling it "a dangerous precedent" that "should be repealed in its entirety." And he says the American public is on his side. "Polls show Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare, especially the individual mandate," Santorum wrote in the March 26, 2012, column. The op-ed ran the same week that the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments on the constitutionality of the law and the mandate. We decided to check if Santorum is right about how the law is currently polling. First, the law itself The law, commonly referred to as Obamacare, is a massive legislative package that seeks to extend health coverage to all Americans. The individual mandate is the centerpiece, requiring all Americans to have insurance, either through their employers, private plans or government programs. We contacted Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and Robert Blendon, a Harvard University professor who studies health care polling. Both pointed us toward recent polls on the issue Here are some highlights: * A March 2012 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows a virtual draw, with 41 percent of respondents reporting a favorable opinion of the law and 40 percent an unfavorable opinion. * United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll, conducted March 22-25: 43 percent favor, 46 percent oppose * The Pew Research Center’s March 2012 poll found that 47 percent approve of the legislation, and 45 percent disapprove. * CNN, conducted March 24-25, 2012: 43 percent favor, 50 percent oppose * ABC News/Washington Post poll, conducted March 10, 2012: 41 percent support, 52 percent oppose. * New York Times, conducted March 23-25, 2012: 36 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove * Ipsos Poll conducted for Reuters, March 2012: 44 percent favor the law, and 56 percent oppose. Bowman noted that "although responses differ from pollster to pollster, each pollster’s trend on the legislation has been remarkably stable for the 32 months we’ve tracked attitudes." The overall trend shows the country has remained split over the law since it passed in 2010, with negative opinion on the rise in some polls in the last few months. Next, the mandate The individual mandate consistently shows up as the most unpopular piece of the health care legislation, and recent polls are no different. A brief roundup: * Kaiser Family Foundation: 30 percent feel somewhat favorable or very favorable about the individual mandate, 67 percent feel somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable. * Pew Research Center: 32 percent had a favorable view of the provision, while 66 percent viewed it unfavorably. * National Journal: 28 percent of those surveyed said they supported the mandate, while 66 percent opposed it. * The ABC News/Washington Post poll asked a slightly different question and found 26 percent of Americans want to uphold the entire health care law, 25 percent want to throw out just the mandate, and 42 percent want to get rid of the whole thing. "In other words," Blendon told us, "the Washington Post finds that 67 percent of Americans want to get rid of the mandate." Said Bowman: "Nearly every poll I’ve seen (and there are dozens) shows the public opposed to the mandate. If Santorum was speaking about the mandate only, the polls show opposition (and much of it strong)." But both our experts were more measured about the extent of opposition to the entire law. Bowman noted that Americans like many sections of the law, such as the provision that allows children to remain on their parents’ health plan until age 26 and another that prohibits companies from denying coverage because of a pre-existing condition. "The verdict on the law is not overwhelmingly negative, though in most polls it tilts negative," she said. Blendon said, "Santorum isn’t completely wrong with his claim because some of these polls show a majority of Americans not supporting the overall health care bill or the individual mandate." Our ruling Santorum wrote that, "Polls show Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare, especially the individual mandate." We consulted several recent polls and found that, in broad terms, opinion on the health care law is more unfavorable than favorable, but not overwhelmingly. As Bowman said, it "tilts negative." But it's also worth noting that four of the most recent polls show stronger opposition than when we have ruled on similar statements in the past. Objection to the individual mandate, however, is resounding. Some polls found approval rates in the low 30s and disapproval in the high 60s. That fits Santorum’s description of "overwhelming." We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-29T12:11:47	2012-03-26	['United_States', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']
pomt-12933	Says Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s email password was "password."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/11/reince-priebus/russian-hacking-case-did-hillary-clintons-campaign/	The first question posed to Reince Priebus on the Jan. 8, 2017 edition of CBS’ "Face the Nation" was on what President-elect Donald Trump believes about Russian efforts to meddle in the presidential election. Priebus, the Wisconsinite who is chairman of the Republican National Committee and Trump’s pick for White House chief of staff, responded with a catchy claim. The reference was to the unauthorized release of thousands of emails of John Podesta, an Illinoisan who was chairman of the campaign of the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. "The reason this particular hack was so large wasn’t necessarily because the effort was so great by the Russians. It was that it was so easy," he said. "I mean, John Podesta’s password into his system -- do you know what his password was? Password." Priebus didn’t offer any evidence to host John Dickerson and we didn’t hear back from Trump’s transition team or the Republican National Committee on our requests for information to back Priebus’ claim. But there doesn’t appear to be any evidence to support what he said. The hacking Here’s how the New York Times reported on what happened to Podesta: Russian hackers sent a "phishing" email -- which aims to get the recipient to click on a deceptive link that gives hackers access to their information -- to Podesta’s personal Google mail account in March 2016. The email said Podesta needed to change his password immediately in order to protect his account. Podesta correctly perceived that the email might be a hoax and sought advice from other campaign staffers. In a response, one campaign staffer meant to tell Podesta that the email was illegitimate, but wrote legitimate -- prompting Podesta to change his password. "With another click," as the Times put it, "a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account — a total of about 60,000 — were unlocked for the Russian hackers." The trove amounted to what The Guardian called "an unprecedented window into a presidential run." Trump used the emails as fodder for attacks on Clinton -- a number of which PolitiFact National found to need context or misinterpreted what the emails actually showed. Podesta would later say that WikiLeaks began publishing his emails about an hour after the October 2016 release of an "Access Hollywood" tape that showed Trump making lewd comments about women during a 2005 interview. His claim was rated True by PolitiFact National. Now back to Priebus. Previous claim Two days before the Priebus interview, our partners at PunditFact rated as False a claim by Jesse Watters. He has a "Watters World" a segment that appears on Fox News Channel’s "The O’Reilly Factor," which is hosted by conservative talk show host Bill O’Reilly. Watters’ claim was essentially the same as Priebus'. He said Podesta’s email password was password, a claim that originated with WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange. Our colleagues found: → None of the emails published on WikiLeaks show Podesta’s email password. → Among the cyber analysts examining the phishing emails used to infiltrate Podesta’s and others’ accounts, none have made similar claims. → Podesta was using a Gmail account, and Google doesn’t allow users to make their passwords password. Our rating Repeating a claim that originated with WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange, Priebus said the email password of Podesta, Clinton’s presidential campaign chairman, was password. His claim is catchy, but we’ve seen no material evidence to back it. Our rating is False.

pomt-07059	Says states that passed anti-illegal-immigrant legislation also had few Hispanic legislators.	/texas/statements/2011/jun/29/women-wall/rebecca-forest/	Addressing a rally outside the Texas Capitol, an advocate for requiring city police departments to check the immigration status of residents critiqued the makeup of the Texas Legislature. According to a video pointed out by the Texas Democratic Party, Rebecca Forest, co-founder and past president of the Immigration Reform Coalition of Texas, said June 11: "If you really want to know why in Texas we don’t get immigration legislation passed, it’s because we have 37--36--Hispanic legislators in the Texas Legislature. All of the states that have passed legislation have a handful. And I mean literally, some of them have no Hispanic legislators, maybe 3 or 5. So that's part of our problem and we need to change those numbers. We need to do something about that." We wondered if indeed states with laws targeting illegal immigration have few Hispanic legislators. Forest, who later told us she spoke at the rally on behalf of Women on the Wall, a group of conservative women, said in a June 17 interview with KRLD-AM’s Scott Braddock that she strayed from her notes at the rally and had solely intended to single out Hispanic legislators who are liberal Democrats--traditional opponents of legislation like the sanctuary-city proposal that did not pass into law. "I wish I would have said that," she said. Braddock posted the interview online with a statement he said he fielded from Forest. The statement says she’d previously endorsed a Latino Republican, state Rep. Larry Gonzales of Round Rock. "There are many things I should have said differently that day but I’ve always hated it when politicians (in particular) try to cover their tails when they mess up by saying ‘I misspoke’ though obviously — I did," the statement says. To our inquiry about Forest’s rally statement, Maria Martinez, the coalition’s executive director, replied by email: "Our whole thrust of border security has nothing to do with racial identity. Obviously as a Hispanic myself, that statement does not reflect mine or the organization's sentiments." To check Forest’s claim, we looked for states that have lately passed immigration enforcement measures and determined how many Latino legislators serve in the states. As Forest said, the Texas House and Senate include 37 Hispanic members, comprising 20 percent of the state’s 181 legislators, according to a state-by-state count by the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures. A council spokeswoman, Meagan Dorsch, pointed us to NCSL web pages tracking legislation related to immigration; one says that as of March 31, 26 states had enacted laws this year touching in some way on immigration, down from 34 states by the same date in 2010. Since Forest was currying support for legislation requiring law officers to check the immigration status of every arrested person, we narrowed our national look to states that approved proposals permitting or directing law officers to check the legal status of residents. This year, according to the NCSL, such proposals were introduced in 42 states, though only one such proposal had been signed into law by April 1. Utah’s House Bill 497 requires an officer to verify the immigration status of anyone arrested for a felony or a Class A misdemeanor and anyone booked for class B or C misdemeanors. In 2010, Arizona’s legislature drew national attention with its new law requiring officers to attempt to determine the immigration status of any person involved in a lawful stop, detention or arrest when they reasonably suspect the person is an illegal immigrant. According to the NCSL’s breakdown of 2010 state immigration measures, Tennessee and South Carolina also passed measures intended to encourage officers to check residents’ immigration standing. The group says Tennessee’s House Bill 670 mandated the development of standardized written procedures for verifying the citizenship status of individuals arrested, booked, or confined in a county or municipal jail or detention facility--and reporting individuals in possible violation of federal immigration laws. South Carolina’s HB 4657, NCSL says, directed the launch of a 24-hour toll-free telephone number and electronic website to receive, record, collect and report allegations of violations of federal immigration laws. A search of news archives showed that Georgia’s legislature this year advanced a proposal into law, effective July 1, authorizing police to check the immigration status of suspects and to hand over to federal authorities anyone who is in the country illegally, according to a Wall Street Journal blog post. The June 28 post says a federal judge just blocked parts of the law, ruling that challengers in court were likely to prevail in their claims that federal law preempts Georgia’s right to empower police to investigate the immigration status of suspects. And how many Hispanic members serve in the legislatures of the states whose laws we sketched out above? As of this year, NCSL says, the respective counts are: Utah, five of 104 legislators (nearly 5 percent); Arizona, 13 of 90 (14 percent); Georgia, 2 of 236 (1 percent); Tennessee, 1 of 132 (1 percent); and South Carolina, 0 of 170. To our query, the National Association of Latino Elected Officials provided identical figures for the states. Among all states, the NCSL says, New Mexico has the greatest share of Hispanic lawmakers, 45 of 112 (40 percent), followed by Texas, 39 of 181 (22 percent) California, 23 of 120 (19 percent), and Arizona. In more than 40 states, Latinos comprise less than 10 percent of each state’s legislature; about 15 states have no Hispanic legislators. Five percent or less of the legislators in four of five states that recently directed law officers to check immigration status are Latino Americans; in the fifth state, none is. We rate Forest’s statement True. UPDATE, 3:37 p.m., June 29, 2011: After we published this article, the NCSL told us the numbers it initially described as up to date were outdated. We've amended our story to reflect the group's state-by-state Hispanic legislator count for 2011. These changes did not affect the Truth-O-Meter rating.

pomt-05737	"One out of four of our young people say they are victims of this (dating) violence."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/04/beatrice-lanzi/rhode-island-state-sen-beatrice-lanzi-says-1-4-you/	As part of the weekly Rhode Island Public Television show "A Lively Experiment," guests are often asked for their "outrage of the week." On the Feb. 24 program, state Sen. Beatrice Lanzi focused on attitudes toward dating violence and cited reaction to the performance of singer Chris Brown at the 2012 Grammy Awards. In 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to brutally beating his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. "After he performed, many women across the country took to social media and were making comments about dating violence in a joking way," Lanzi said. We located some of those Tweets. People were sending out messages such as "I'd let Chris Brown beat me up anytime," "Chris Brown u can punch me in the face any time u want!!!!" and "Any girl that hates on Chris Brown is stupid. Do you realize that it would be an honour if he hit you?" Said Lanzi: "One out of four of our young people say that they are victims of this violence. To me, it's outrageous." One in four is 25 percent. We decided to check to see whether that was on the mark. When we asked Lanzi for her source, she said she had actually understated the scope of the problem, and it was really one in three, which would be 33 percent. She referred us to the website of the Lindsay Ann Burke Memorial Fund, based in North Kingstown, R.I., where the Teen Dating Violence Statistics page says "1 in 3 teens experience some kind of abuse in their romantic relationships." The web page doesn't cite a specific reference, but Ann Burke, the organization's president, said it came from a 2001 study in the American Journal of Public Health by Carolyn Tucker Halpern at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It analyzed the responses of 7,267 adolescents who reported being in at least one exclusive heterosexual romantic relationship during the 1994-1995 school year. "Overall, 32% of respondents reported experiencing any violence in a heterosexual romantic relationship occurring in the 18 months before the interview," the researchers reported. "Most violent behaviors were psychological, with swearing being most common. Twelve percent reported being the victim of physical violence. Approximately 10% of respondents reported having been pushed and 3% reported that something was thrown at them. "The patterns of victimization indicate that about 1 in 5 adolescents reported only psychological violence and about 1 in 10 reported physical violence, usually accompanied by psychological violence," the report said. Males were just as likely to be victims as females, but the females were more likely to have been injured. There are a few caveats to the Halpern study. It only looked at heterosexual relationships so the findings do not apply to same-sex relationships or teens who were not dating at the time. In addition, it only asked about violence in the previous 18 months. Lanzi's comment suggest lifetime experience with dating violence. So the percentages would be higher. But on a key issue -- how many young people had reported physical violence -- the study doesn’t confirm Lanzi’s statement. She said the incidence was 25 percent. The study found it was closer to 12 percent. We consulted other, more recent, studies with their own strengths and limitations. Sample conclusions: * 9.8 percent of students nationwide reported dating violence from their boyfriend or girlfriend (being hit, slapped or physically hurt on purpose). It only covered the previous year and didn't include verbal assault. (Results from the national Youth Risk Surveillance System from 2009.) * Up to 35 percent of adolescent girls were victims of "interpersonal violence, according to a 2008 report by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency. That summary defines that as "physical, emotional or verbal abuse by one partner towards another in a dating relationship." Lanzi didn't say she was only talking about girls, but other surveys show that males experience similar levels of dating violence. * 13 percent of 638 youth age 13 to 18 who had been in a relationship said in 2005 they had been repeatedly verbally abused, 11 percent said they had been punched, kicked, pushed, slapped or choked at one time, and 5 percent said they had been physically hurt, like a bruise or a punch. (Teenage Research Unlimited for Liz Claiborne) And when the Rhode Island Department of Health surveyed high school students in 2011, it found that the incidence of dating violence -- defined as having been hit by a boyfriend or girlfriend -- had declined from 14 percent in 2007 to 8 percent in 2011. But those rates are only for the previous year, not whether they had ever been hit by a partner. Our ruling Beatrice Lanzi said "one out of four of our young people say they are victims" of dating violence, following a reference to singer Chris Brown, known for physically assaulting his once-girlfriend, Rihanna. The studies we found, however, show that the risk of such physical attacks for teens isn't close to 1 in 4; it's more like 1 in 10. As with most social science research, the numbers can vary depending, for example, on how broadly dating violence is defined and the timeframe examined. A teen who is asked whether he or she has ever experienced dating violence may answer "no," but then respond with a "yes" if asked if she has ever been pushed in anger by a boyfriend or girlfriend. What is clear is that to get to the types of numbers Lanzi is talking about, one must include all kinds of aggression, from physical attack to swearing at someone. In fact, when we talked to her, that was how she defined dating violence. No matter what the definition, all relationship abuse is reprehensible. But because Lanzi’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we rule it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-14857	The "Democratic Party is getting smaller and smaller and smaller."	/texas/statements/2015/nov/15/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-democratic-party-shrinking/	After the first Democratic presidential debate Oct. 13, 2015, Texas Republican Ted Cruz interpreted the crowd’s cheers for proposals to raise taxes as a reason for the decline of the Democratic Party. The day after the debate, Fox News’ Megyn Kelly asked Cruz how he could appeal for votes from Americans cheering on Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking the Democratic nomination, who has stressed how much more the very wealthiest Americans have than the rest of us. "Well," Cruz replied, "it's why the modern Democratic Party is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. What does it say that they're having a hard time finding anyone to run for president who isn't nearly 207 years old? You're not getting new and fresh ideas." Ahem: Sanders is 74; fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is 68. And while we’re not going to gauge how Cruz appeals for more Democratic support, we did wonder if the Democratic Party is shrinking, as Cruz said. Cruz’s campaign spokesman said Cruz based his statement on the losses the Democratic Party suffered in recent elections. "Cruz is referring to all the Senate seats, House seats, governors and state legislative seats lost during this administration," said Rick Tyler, Cruz for President’s national spokesman. Democrats losing steam under Obama? Measuring the exact membership or size of either national party is difficult. Some states, including Texas, do not require voters to register with any party. As University of Texas-Austin government professor Brian Roberts, who studies American political institutions and interest groups, told us, there’s "no easy answer." But certain measures can give a relative sense of party size, despite variations in registration rules. University of Texas-Austin government professor Sean Theriault, who studies congressional decision-making and has published books on the power of the electorate and party polarization. He suggested three measurements for evaluating the size and strength of political parties: the party in the government, the party in the electorate and party organizations. The first component we looked at was the Democrats’ total electoral seats. That is what Cruz’s campaign spokesman said Cruz was referring to in his comment. During Obama’s administration, Democrats have lost 13 U.S. Senate seats, 69 House seats, 11 governorships, and 910 state legislative seats. Another way to look at a party's health is the number of voters who claim affiliation. Based on this data, the Democratic Party’s support in the electorate fluctuates, but generally is stable. A Gallup poll measuring trends in party identification since 2004 found that 29 percent of Americans identified as Democrats in October 2015. In January 2004, when the poll data begins, 28 percent of Americans identified as Democrats. The 11-year high was 38 percent in March 2008 and March 2009. The poll asks respondents, "As of today, do you consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent?" For comparison, in October 2015, 25 percent of Americans identified as Republicans, and 42 percent identified as independents. Support for the Republican Party hit a high of 39 percent in September 2004. Each party’s voter demographics also suggest changes in size ahead. According to a 2014 Pew Research Center study, 51 percent of Millennials identified as Democrats in 2014, compared to their Republican peers’ 35 percent — the highest margin of any generation. The Democratic Party also claims more members among Generation X and Baby Boomer voters, by smaller margins. The only demographic in which Republicans have the advantage is the Silent Generation, with 47 percent identifying with the Republican Party, compared to 43 percent with the Democratic Party. That the country’s oldest voters are the only ones to lean Republican and that its youngest voters lean Democrat by a strong margin suggests growth for the Democratic Party, while the Republican Party’s strongest demographics are aging out. Party organizations, and their success in fundraising, are also a component of a political party’s health or size. In the 2010 off-year election cycle, the national Democratic Party raised $817.5 million. In the 2014 election cycle, the most recent available, the party raised $855 million, which suggests an increase of $37.5 million in the 2014 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. Factoring in funds raised through the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other party organizations, Theriault said, "the Democratic Party "is getting bigger and is bigger than the Republican Party." For comparison, the Republican Party raised $586,978,840 in 2010 and $665,608,564 in 2014. Our ruling Cruz said that the "Democratic Party is getting smaller and smaller and smaller." Democrats have lost a significant number of seats and federal and state offices throughout the Obama administration. The party as a whole, however, is stable or has grown both in terms of the electorate and its party organizations. Cruz’s claim is partly accurate, but leaves out important context about the Democratic Party beyond its elected officials. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03990	Says Texas high school "graduation rates are at an all-time high—the third-highest in the nation—which represents a significant turnaround from just a few short years ago."	/texas/statements/2013/feb/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-third-highest-high-schoo/	Gov. Rick Perry said state leaders have worked hard to improve Texas public schools over the past decade, with more students faring well. Perry told lawmakers in his Jan. 29, 2013, State-of-the-State address: "According to the U.S. Department of Education, our graduation rates are at an all-time high—the third-highest in the nation—which represents a significant turnaround from just a few short years ago." His claim rang a bell. In a Nov. 27, 2012, press release, the Texas Education Agency said that according to preliminary data from its federal counterpart, Texas tied for the nation’s third-highest high school graduation rate in the 2010-11 school year, based on tracking individual students through high school. The agency said Texas was tied with Tennessee, New Hampshire, Indiana, Nebraska and North Dakota, all with 86 percent rates. Iowa, Vermont and Wisconsin had higher graduation rates by one to two percentage points, the agency said. News accounts diverged at the time on whether Texas placed third or should be considered tied for fourth, considering three states had better graduation rates. A Nov. 27, 2012, Dallas Morning News story said Texas was "tied with five other states for the fourth-highest graduation rate in the country." The San Antonio Business Journal published a similar summary. In contrast, the Nov. 28, 2013, Associated Press news story said Texas and five other states had tied for "America’s third-best high school graduation." The education agency said Texas ranked No. 1 in graduation rates for Asian and white students and tied for No. 1 with Montana for graduation rates for African American students, and No. 2 for Hispanic students, behind Maine. Perry spokeswoman Josh Havens told us the governor based his claim on that data released in November. That 2011 graduation rate was 5 percentage points better than the 2009 rate, he said, and there were more than 26,000 additional graduates. There were 11,100 more seniors in 2011, a 4 percent difference, according to a July 2012 report by the Texas Education Agency. Two ways of counting From past fact checks, we recognize another method often used to gauge graduation successes. In this vein, we rated as True a 2010 claim by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White that Texas then ranked 43rd nationally for its 61.3 percent graduation rate in 2008-09. That conclusion was based on comparing the year’s number of graduates to the number of ninth graders four years earlier, an indicator often called "attrition." The intent is to get a snapshot of how many students graduate in four years. Applying the same kind of approach, just a week before Perry’s speech, a federal report placed Texas’ 2009-10 graduation rate in the middle of the states. An Associated Press news story said the cited rate of 78.9 percent was just above the national average of 78.2 percent, in itself the highest since 1976. The AP story also noted the difference between the sets of graduation data. The state education agency said the reason for the difference was that the January 2013 report, from the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the federal Department of Education, estimated high school attrition rates among ninth-graders over four years, while the state tracks actual cases that can be adjusted for things like students moving away before finishing high school. "We're basically counting noses, and they're doing an estimate," Debbie Ratcliffe, a Texas Education Agency spokeswoman, told the AP. "The good news is the trend lines for graduates are the same. There're a million different ways to count graduation rates" and "as long as they're showing similar trend lines, that's positive." By phone, Ratcliffe told us that at the direction of lawmakers, the state started calculating its graduation rates by the method behind its third-place ranking, starting in the 2008-09 school year, when the rate was 80.6 percent. She said the comparable Texas rate for 2009-10 was 84.3 percent. "It’s slow, steady growth," she said. An outside view For another take, we consulted Grover J. "Russ" Whitehurst, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former director of the Institute of Education Sciences in the U.S. Department of Education. Whitehurst testified on behalf of the state in the court battle launched by school districts challenging the Texas school funding system. A Travis County state district judge, John Dietz, ruled in the districts’ favor, though appeals are expected. In the trial, a lawyer questioned Whitehurst about his interpretation of the declared 86 percent Texas graduation rate. According to a Dec. 6, 2012, pool report by Will Weissert of the Associated Press, Whitehurst testified that there likely were flaws in the new system used to create the federal data. He said, for instance, that it was possible for high schools to game the system and tamp down their dropout rates. He said what commonly happens is a student drops out but is instead listed as having moved or transferred when his classmates and even school administrators know the truth. Whitehurst said, "We know schools can cheat" and the new federal data-reporting system was too new to fully control for such cheating. More recently, Whitehurst told us by telephone that Texas appeared to be among several states to enjoy big jumps in graduation rates. But he said it would be an error to compare graduation rates using the new methodology, known as Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates, to estimated graduation rates in earlier years as gauged by the national center’s methodology for Averaged Freshman Graduation Rates (or attrition). "The two numbers are not comparable," he said. Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates come from data submitted by high schools and school districts, taking into account individual students who had transferred in or out of each district as well as student deaths. In contrast, he said, Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate estimates graduation rates by taking the number of diplomas granted each year and dividing that by the average number of eighth-, ninth- and 10th-graders five years before. The National Center for Education Statistics’ methodology for Averaged Freshman Graduation Rates is spelled out in its Jan. 22, 2013, report on the 2009-10 results. By this measure, Texas has improved, the report indicates, though the measure does not suggest that Texas ranked among the best in the nation in 2009-10. Looking at this measure over time, we see that the Texas rate was 75.5 percent in 2002-03, dipped to 72 percent in 2006-07 and rose to 78.9 percent in 2009-10. Among the states, the Texas rate for 2009-10 was 25th highest. The Texas rate for 2002-03 tied with Indiana’s rate for 29th highest, according to the report. The center’s report says, too, that these rates are not the best way to pin how many students are graduating, but the methodology has been applied since the 1960s to give a sense of how schools were doing before most states collected data on the progress of individual students over time. Whitehurst said to us: "I don’t necessarily believe Texas is now third-ranked," though "I am not saying it’s untrue. It’s too soon to know exactly what these numbers mean." Federal distinctions Separately, we asked the U.S. Department of Education about Perry’s statement. Spokesman Daren Briscoe pointed us to the agency’s Nov. 26, 2012, press release announcing the state-by-state 2010-11 graduation rates. The release says: "The new, uniform rate calculation is not comparable in absolute terms to previously reported rates. Therefore, while 26 states reported lower graduation rates and 24 states reported unchanged or increased rates under the new metric, these changes should not be viewed as measures of progress but rather as a more accurate snapshot." We asked Havens of Perry’s office about the governor’s reference to a significant turnaround. Havens’ email reply singled out the three years of rates measured by the new method--stressing the five percentage point difference between the results in 2009 and 2011. Our ruling Perry said Texas has the nation’s third-highest high school graduation rate, which he called a significant turnaround from a few years ago. Texas tied with five states for the third-highest rate in 2011, of 86 percent. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked. Other nicks in Perry’s statement: These results are preliminary and might prove unreliable. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Finally, since it's not accurate to compare these rates devised in different ways, Perry’s reference to a "significant turnaround" depends on just the three years of rates measured in the newest way. But in this time window, there is no indication the rate was either stuck or plummeting before 2011, so the latest results do not indicate a turnaround. All told, Texas graduation rates are improving and the state looks strong compared to most others. We rate this statement as Mostly True.

pomt-06188	"They say teachers only make on average in New Jersey 60,000 dollars a year. They only work 180 days."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/12/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-new-jersey-teachers-only-work-/	New Jersey teachers have a pretty cushy gig, to hear Gov. Chris Christie tell it. They only work about six months a year and are paid north of $50,000 annually, according to a speech about education that Christie gave Nov. 18 at Notre Dame’s law school in South Bend, Ind. "They say teachers only make on an average in New Jersey 60,000 dollars a year. They only work 180 days," the governor said between comments about the number of hours teachers work daily and how he supports higher pay for "excellent teachers." But Christie should have checked his work before making this claim. His numbers are a bit off from the true numbers, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Let’s first discuss teacher schedules. A minimum 180-day school year is required by state statute, but a majority of school districts in New Jersey exceed that minimum, according to the New Jersey Education Association. The NJEA provided us with documents showing the average number of school days for the 2010-11 and 2011-12 school years: 185, among school districts with settled contracts. That amounts to 257 districts for the current school year, 423 for last year and 511 for the 2005-06 year. New Jersey’s number of instruction days is the same as at least 30 other states, according to the Denver, Colo.-based Education Commission of the States. NJEA spokesman Steve Baker took exception to Christie’s statement that teachers "only" work 180 days a year. "The really misleading part of the statement is that it assumes teachers don’t work any additional days beyond those stipulated in their contracts, which is wrong," Baker said in an email. "Most – indeed, nearly all -- teachers spend many additional days setting up their classrooms, preparing lesson plans, attending professional development events, taking classes and otherwise engaged in additional work outside the contracted school day and school year. You can imagine the amount of work that goes into preparing to teach 180 days of student classes. "This is a common tactic that critics of public education use to denigrate the work of teachers, to make it sound as if they really don’t work that hard," Baker continued. "It’s a bit like saying that the Governor is only working on days when he signs bills. In other words, wrong, and intentionally misleading." The governor’s office did not return a request for comment. Michael W. Smith, a professor and chair of the Department of Curriculum, Instruction, and Technology in Education at Temple University in Philadelphia, said the work of a teacher neither begins nor ends in the classroom. In addition to instructing classes, teachers often work at home or outside the classroom preparing lessons, reviewing students’ work and providing feedback, meeting with students outside class, staying abreast of educational technology, meeting continuing education requirements and much more, said Smith, who chaired the Department of Learning and Teaching at Rutgers University New Brunswick from 1992-2005. William Gaudelli, an associate professor of Social Studies and Education, and the Social Studies program coordinator at Teachers College, Columbia University, agreed that the work teachers do goes well beyond 180 work days. "It’s really a misrepresentation of the vast majority of teachers who are dedicated to their work," Gaudelli, a member of the South Orange-Maplewood Board of Education, said about Christie’s statement. As for teacher salaries, Christie underestimated those numbers. The average teacher salary in New Jersey for 2009-10 was $65,130 – the fourth highest in the country behind New York, Massachusetts and California, according to a 2011 report from the National Education Association. Our ruling In a speech last month to students at Notre Dame, the governor said New Jersey teachers on average only work 180 days a year and get $60,000 salaries. New Jersey’s school year averages 185 days and the average teacher salary in the state is $65,130. Christie was a bit off on both of his numbers, but not by much. Based strictly on numbers, we rate his statement Mostly True. To comment on this statement, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2011-12-12T07:30:00	2011-11-18	['New_Jersey']

pomt-03262	Says "nearly 29,000 Oregonians — almost 5 percent of all homeowners — are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage."	/oregon/statements/2013/aug/09/ellen-rosenblum/are-5-percent-homeowners-really-90-days-or-behind-/	Oregon’s housing market might be showing some improvement, but there’s still a ways to go. That was the general gist of an opinion piece Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum recently published in the Statesman Journal. The article was a chance for her to introduce Oregonians to a "rebooted and revamped foreclosure mediation program." "Homes are selling quicker and for more money," Rosenblum wrote. "Foreclosures, thankfully, are down." Still, she continued, "we’re not all the way back. The hangover from the housing crash lingers for thousands of Oregonians. Nearly 29,000 Oregonians — almost 5 percent of all homeowners — are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage." This caught our attention. We were curious not only whether the numbers she used were right, but whether the 5 percent figure she referenced was actually all that much higher than where we were before this whole recession began. First, we contacted Jeff Manning, Rosenblum’s spokesman. He told us their office got the numbers from Oregon Housing and Community Services, an agency that deals with state housing policy. That agency, in turn, had gotten the figures from a business called CoreLogic. CoreLogic is a company that specializes in information, data and analytics. In past news reports, The Oregonian has relied on its data regarding foreclosures and delinquency rates. We gave CoreLogic a call and got ahold of Andrea Hurst, who handles communications. She was able to send us a spreadsheet with the number of homeowners 90 days or more delinquent on their mortage for each month between January 2009 and May 2013. And, Rosenblum was right: the most recent figures put Oregon’s delinquency rate at 4.88 percent (or almost 5 percent). But, we came up short in two areas. First, there was no raw figure of how many homes that 4.88 percent figure represented. Second, we didn’t have much in the way of a baseline. See, the figure for January 2009 was a considerably lower 2.92 percent, but we wanted something from before the recession began. Generally, economists cite December 2007 as the turning point. The folks over at CoreLogic, however, couldn’t get us numbers stretching back that far. Manning, however, said that he had them and sent us over a spreadsheet that begins tracking monthly rates with January 2006. From January 2006 through November 2007, the average monthly delinquency rate was 0.73 percent, according to the data Manning sent us. In fact, in those 24 months it went over 1 percent once: In November 2007, when the rate began a fairly rapid rise. The numbers Manning sent also backed up the 29,000 figure Rosenblum used (technically the number of homes more than 90 days delinquent was 28,891 in May 2013.) Of course, we never like using data we get from the source that made the claim, so we asked Manning how he got these figures from CoreLogic when we couldn’t. He pointed us to Ben Pray with Oregon Housing and Community Services. Pray told us his department subscribes to data service from CoreLogic and he simply ran a data request for Rosenblum a week ago. We also did one last quick check to make sure that figures in the limited data set CoreLogic gave us matched with what Manning and Pray had given us. They did. There are, of course, other companies that try to discern and report delinquency rates and the figures can vary depending on which you use. However, CoreLogic’s data is the same data used by the federal reserve. If it’s good enough for them, we figure it’s good enough for us. In introducing a revised mediation program, Rosenblum wrote that the housing crash lingers and that nearly 5 percent of all homeowners are more than 90 days delinquent on their mortgage. We verified that her figures were right and that 5 percent does, indeed, represent a number well above what we’d experience before the recession. We rate this claim True.

pomt-01068	Federal officials declared that grant funds "could be used only for Milwaukee's streetcar project," meaning it "isn’t possible" to redirect the money to "other modes of public transportation or to our public schools."	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/19/gwen-moore/gwen-moore-says-local-officials-cannot-repurpose-f/	In comments favoring a downtown Milwaukee streetcar system, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore tried to counter a key argument made by opponents regarding the $55 million in federal grant money tied to the project. "As much as opponents would like these federal funds to be redirected to other modes of public transportation or to our public schools, this just isn't possible," the Milwaukee Democrat wrote in an opinion piece published Jan. 14, 2015 in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "Years ago, the Federal Transit Administration, a federal agency that provides financial and technical assistance to local public transit systems, made it abundantly clear that these funds could be used only for Milwaukee's streetcar project." Milwaukee can take the money, Moore wrote, "or we can walk away and leave millions of dollars on the table." The Milwaukee Common Council is scheduled to vote Jan. 21, 2014 on the $124 million project. Two vocal opponents of Mayor Tom Barrett’s plan, Aldermen Joe Davis Sr. and Robert Donovan, have joined others in calling for spending the $54.9 million in federal transit funds for other projects or programs. Is Moore right that it’s streetcar or bust? Can this train change tracks? When asked for backup, Moore pointed us to a June 2011 letter from the FTA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation that provides financial and technical assistance to local public transit systems. The letter responded to questions from a streetcar supporter, Ald. Robert Bauman, concerning funds the FTA described as "directed to the city of Milwaukee for the construction of a downtown streetcar line." That letter, and comments to us by FTA officials, underscore that under current law the money is for the streetcar plan only. Bauman asked a question that is right on point: "Under what circumstances, if any, can the funds appropriated to the city of Milwaukee be redirected to another transportation project in the city of Milwaukee or County of Milwaukee?" In response, the FTA administrator at the time, Peter Rogoff, said it was his view that the DOT secretary had already approved the streetcar grant and therefore could not redirect the funds. He wrote that lawyers with the Federal Highway Administration concurred with his interpretation. When we followed up with FTA communications officials about the 2011 letter, we were told it still stands. Milwaukee officials signed an agreement in 2012 with the FTA to spend the money on the downtown streetcar system. Milwaukee City Comptroller Martin Matson, an independently elected official, did not express a definitive opinion, but told us he believed the city would lose the money if the project was stopped at this point. All this backs up the guts of Moore’s claim. The money train Since the funding was granted through federal law, it does raise the question of whether federal law could be changed to shift the money to something else -- such as the north side rail project Davis advocates. Even proponents of the streetcar acknowledge that Congress, having written the law, could change it. Indeed, congressional action was how the streetcar money became untangled after a years-long dispute among Wisconsin officials over how to use federal transit funds originally allocated to the Milwaukee area in, yes, 1991. In 2009, Wisconsin Democrats in Congress inserted a provision into a massive federal spending bill that called for handing 60 percent of that money to the city for a downtown rail line and 40 percent to Milwaukee County for buses. President Barack Obama signed the $410 billion package into law. Barrett, a former congressman, told the Shepherd Express in January 2015 that the reality is federal transit officials would take back the $55 million if the streetcar project is killed, and disburse it to another city. Two FTA officials told us that if the streetcar goes unbuilt, the grant money just sits there. At that point, they said, it would be up to Congress to put it back in circulation for some other project, in Milwaukee or elsewhere. "As a matter of law, the ($55 million) cannot be redistributed to another transportation project unless Congress acts to amend the statute," Rogoff, the FTA administrator, wrote in his 2011 letter. Even powerful Wisconsin lawmakers -- including incoming Ways and Means Committee chair Paul Ryan, the Janesville Republican -- would need all of Congress to go along with picking another transit project, if they were inclined to get involved. And they would have to convince Congress that the city still deserves the money after 24 years of wrangling that has left the money unspent. It’s theoretically possible the money could be redirected for some other transit use in the area. But that is not something local officials can control, so the question before them is to use it for the street car or nothing at all. Our rating Moore said that federal officials declared that grant funds "could be used only for Milwaukee's streetcar project," meaning it "isn’t possible" to redirect the money to "other modes of public transportation or to our public schools." Current law, and grant contracts, tie the grant money specifically to the streetcar project. In theory, Congress could intervene and re-purpose the funding, but there’s far from any guarantee that would happen -- or that Milwaukee would be re-awarded the money if it did. In any case, we can only base our rating on where things stand today, not where they might stand under different scenarios. We rate Moore’s claim True.

pomt-10567	"When I was in college, we used to take a popcorn popper . . . and we would fry squirrel."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/07/mike-huckabee/it-tasted-like-chicken/	In two recent appearances on MSNBC's Morning Joe , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee boasted about frying squirrels in a popcorn popper. "When I was in college, we used to take a popcorn popper – because that was the only thing they would let us use in the dorms – and we would fry squirrel," he said on Jan. 18, 2008. When he appeared on the show three weeks later, on Feb. 6, co-host Mika Brzezinski asked him if he would come back and demonstrate his cooking techniques. "I'm really ready to do that," Huckabee said. "Because I think the country needs to be able to somehow get into those kind of culinary delights that they've been missing for a long time." Forgive us, but we were skeptical. We wondered if the former governor was truly an aficionado of cooked rodents, or if he was just making a play for the all-important squirrel-eating Republican voting bloc. So we tracked down Huckabee's roommate from Ouachita Baptist University, Rick Caldwell, to ask if the governor really had eaten squirrel. "I was there," Caldwell said, quickly adding that "I was not a co-conspirator to the actual frying of the squirrel. But I admit to partaking." Indeed, they had a popcorn popper in their room in the Daniel North dormitory in 1973 and Huckabee was quite the enterprising chef, said Caldwell, a longtime friend who is now an adviser to his presidential campaign. Huckabee devised a way to make faux doughnuts by punching holes in the middle of biscuits and then frying them in the popcorn popper. Once they were cooked, Huckabee and Caldwell would roll them in sugar. Caldwell says it was as good as a Krispy Kreme. The squirrel fry was a one-time thing, Caldwell said. A student living down the hall admired the popcorn popper and suggested it would be good for frying a squirrel. Caldwell was out of the room when they cooked it, but he got to sample the meat when he returned. "It tasted like chicken," Caldwell said. No one on the PolitiFact staff had sampled a squirrel, so we turned to "Bayou Bill" Scifres, a retired outdoors writer from the Indianapolis Star who runs All Outdoors, a Web site that offers advice on cooking wild game. Bayou Bill loves a qood squirrel. "There are so many ways to cook 'em!" he told us. "With hot biscuits and gravy and fried squirrel and corn on the cob – it's like dying and going to heaven!" He said cooking them is easy: "Fry them to a beautiful golden brown on all sides and then turn the heat down; cover the skillet and put in water or maybe good cooking wine. You just let them steam in that for 15 minutes or half an hour," he said We found recipes on other Web sites that also looked promising: squirrel cacciatore, squirrel croquettes and squirrels in cream sauce.

pomt-13991	"Our population has grown from about 1 million in the 1970s to almost 7 million today."	/georgia/statements/2016/jun/08/video/super-bowl-bid-video-overstates-atlanta-population/	There were high-fives all around last month when Atlanta was awarded the 2019 Super Bowl, a major coup for the city and its still-under-construction Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Part of the sales effort to win that bid was an upbeat five-minute video touting the city and its accomplishments over the years, from civil rights to the 1996 Olympics. "We are a booming, vital, diverse American city where the American dream is being realized each and every day." narrator and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young says at one point. But it was another claim that caught our attention. "Our population has grown from about 1 million in the 1970s to almost 7 million today," Young says. Seven million souls residing in our fair city, or metro area or the megalopolis generically referred to as the ATL? It seemed a bit inflated to PolitiFact. We decided to check it out. What should be a simple answer turned out to be a bit complicated. And the confusion centers on that age-old question: What exactly is Atlanta? Just getting the Super Bowl to show up in your town is an expensive proposition, but one that backers contend will pay huge dividends in prestige and actual dollars flowing into local coffers. Total value of the Atlanta bid is $46 million. About $20 million will come from donations that have beenpledged by two dozen Atlanta businesses. An additional $16 million from a portion of the Atlanta hotel-motel tax that is designated for major events. And $10 million is the estimated value to the National Football League of a sales-tax exemption on Super Bowl tickets that the Georgia Legislature passed this year. The video was funded by the Atlanta Sports Council, a branch of the Metro Atlanta Chamber and a major force in landing the Super Bowl. Sports Council President Dan Corso emailed PolitiFact that the 1970 Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area was about 1.8 million but had climbed to 5.7 million by 2015. It is expected to increase by about 80,000 people a year. He based those numbers on census reports. "Further, if we expand the Atlanta MSA radius to the combined statistical area (CSA), which includes Athens, we get to over 6.2 million today, and the number increases to 6.5 million if we include Columbus," Corso said. The Atlanta Regional Commission estimates the population of the city of Atlanta at about 431,000, while the Census estimate is 463,000. The ARC puts the core 10-county metro Atlanta population at 4.5 million and the 20-county metro region at about 5.7 million. The CSA, which includes 29 counties and the Athens area, comes in at about 6.4 million. We also contacted population experts who generally categorized the 7 million figure as a stretch. William Frey of the Brookings Institution said the current Atlanta CSA -- a very broad population measure -- is on the way to 7 million but not there yet. "It’s below Washington DC, Dallas, Houston and Miami in the South," Frey emailed. "But if it continues its recent growth pace it could approach 7 million soon after the 2020 census. The ARC, meanwhile, estimates the 10-county metro Atlanta population will be 5.92 million in 2040. The 20-county metro area will be 7 million by 2030 and 8 million by 2040, the ARC estimates. Our ruling A video making Atlanta’s case for the 2019 Super Bowl said: "Our population has grown from about 1 million in the 1970s to almost 7 million today." You could make that case for the broadest possible definition of Atlanta -- if you add Columbus into the equation. But who does that? The 20-county area most people consider the broad definition of Atlanta is about 5.7 million and will not reach 7 million for another 14 years. It’s true that metro Atlanta’s population has soared since the 1970s. But it’s misleading to say the area now approaches 7 million people.

pomt-03559	"This budget also reflects the smallest state government workforce per 1,000 residents in Florida in this century."	/florida/statements/2013/may/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-budget-sets-record-low-state-worke/	When Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced he approved a $74.1 billion budget, he portrayed it as having plenty of goodies for everyone, from school teacher raises to hot meals for the elderly. But he also claimed that the budget was lean. "This budget also reflects the smallest state government workforce per 1,000 residents in Florida in this century," Scott wrote in his May 20th veto and budget message. "The Florida Families First budget is one of our state's smallest budgets this century, when adjusted for population growth and inflation." PolitiFact Florida has separately tracked Scott's 2010 campaign progress to reduce the state workforce by 5 percent -- we rated that Promise Kept earlier this year. Here, we wanted to fact-check Scott's claim that the recently approved budget reflects the smallest state workforce in relation to population since 2000. Scott's data There are a few valid ways to measure the number of state workers. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles data on actual state workers while the state Department of Management Services annual workforce reports show both established positions (including vacant ones) and actual employees (some folks refer to that as ‘heartbeats'.) But here, Scott's office of policy and budget created their own chart by pulling together budget data. We did not review the full backup that shows all the details that went into the chart but we interviewed spokespersons in Scott's office who explained their methodology to PolitiFact. Here is how they arrived at their figures: They started with the state's general appropriations budget each year, which does not include the state university workers. Then they made some adjustments to provide apples to apples comparisons: Scott subtracted for vetoes -- his own and by recent past governors -- and by subtracting county health workers, who were not included in state budgets before 2009-10. Scott's office also added in positions that were included in separate bills not reflected in the general budget bill. That's how Scott's office arrived at a figure of adjusted positions. Then Scott's office examined population data from the state's Office of Economic and Democratic Research. That data includes some projections so it sometimes has slightly different figures from the Census Bureau. Let's look at Scott's figures: Year Population (in 1000s) Adjusted positions Positions per 1,000 residents 1999-2000 15,881.7 126,557 8 2000-01 16,228 124,843 7.7 2001-02 16,551.2 120,091 7.3 2002-03 16,892 117,869 7.0 2003-04 17,273.8 116,797 6.8 2004-05 17,677.3 116,317 6.6 2005-06 18,062.2 116,463 6.4 2006-07 18,378.2 113,634 6.2 2007-08 18,578.9 114,270 6.2 2008-09 18,671.4 112,867 6.0 2009-10 18,770.5 114,852 6.1 2010-11 18,879.1 113,202 6.0 2011-12 19,028.6 108,844 5.7 2012-13 19,218 105,023 5.5 2013-14 19,432 101,784 5.2 We spot-checked some of the math and the calculations were correct. The ratio declined before Scott, too Our task here is to fact-check whether Scott's claim about the declining state workers per capita was correct -- not whether or not that is the best policy or why the numbers declined. But we will briefly provide some background about the state workforce. First, we'll note that the ratio of Scott's adjusted positions compared to population has declined under not only Scott, but also his predecessors Charlie Crist (Republican turned independent while in office, and now a Democrat) and Jeb Bush (Republican). PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a claim by Alex Sink, Scott's Democratic opponent in 2010, who said at the time that "Compared to other states, Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents: 118 per 10,000 compared to the national average of 216 employees per 10,000 residents. And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident: $38 compared to the national average of $69 per resident." We rated Sink's claim True. (The National Conference of State Legislatures did not have an updated ranking to reflect Scott's tenure.) Since Scott took office, there have been about 60,000 staffers to leave because they quit, retired or for other reasons, and the state laid off 2,197 workers. (Those figures don't include state universities but do include temporary state workers who briefly work for the state.) One area Scott has targeted in the budget to save money is the state prisons. In January, his administration announced that it would outsource health care for more than 15,000 inmates including at prisons in Miami-Dade County. That has affected about 400 workers but about 97 percent were hired by the company, according to the state Department of Corrections. We sent Scott's claim to Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody's who studies Florida. (He used BLS data to examine Scott's claim.) "He's right if you look at it in terms of state government workers per capita, but this is partially because of all the retirees that have flooded into the state. If you look at the state government share of total employment, it is low, but not at an all time low. .... This number has been steadily declining since the mid 1990s, and Scott has continued it on the downward trend," Lafakis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. We also interviewed two professors of public administration at Florida International University -- chair Howard A. Frank and assistant professor Hai (David) Guo. Both said that Scott's claim may not tell the full story about the state's workforce. Frank raised a question about how to factor in privatization efforts. "Ideology aside, those employees are less burdensome in terms of direct outlays, but I suspect at least some are "quasi-governmental" if they are employed by entities that derive a significant part of their revenue from the state-local sector," he wrote. Guo said that additional indicators of government size include the budget per capita and its growth and whether the state has shifted any responsibilities to local governments. "The employee number of state government alone may not tell the whole story," Guo wrote in an email. Our ruling Scott said that the 2013-14 budget "reflects the smallest state government workforce per 1,000 residents in Florida in this century." To get there, Scott's office examined budgeted positions and made certain adjustments including subtracting for vetoes. They also projected the state's population for 2013-14. We think their assessment is largely fair, with some small caveats. First, there are other ways to measure both the state workforce -- either by using federal labor statistics, or other state data. And second, the size of the state workforce per capita has been declining for years. Minor points, though. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11994	"The bill that I carried cutting MO’s income tax for 1st time in over 100 years will start its 1st phase in jan 1 2018. #moleg @Eric_Schmitt"	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/26/andrew-koenig/first-cut-missouri-income-tax-over-100-years/	Taxes have been a hot topic in the political world lately. President Donald Trump has been calling for reduction of corporate taxes. This is something he talked about when visiting Missouri in August. However, income tax is a hot button topic in Missouri as well. State Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, boasted on Twitter that a law he helped pass would be the first cut to Missouri income tax in over a century. "The bill that I carried cutting MO’s income tax for 1st time in over 100 years will start its 1st phase in jan 1 2018," the senator tweeted on Aug. 30, 2017, with the hashtag "moleg" and tagging Missouri State Treasurer Eric Schmitt. Over a century? This seemed a little bit out there. When Koenig’s office did not answer our inquiry, we started digging for ourselves. The legislation Koenig was referring to Senate Bill 509 from 2014. Koenig was the House handler for the bill, as a state representative at the time. What does the now law actually do to income tax though? Simply put, income tax rates will decrease by a tenth of a percent every year until the top tax rate is a half of a percent lower, or 5.5 percent instead of the current 6 percent. There will also be an increase in income tax deductibles for business income until it reaches 25 percent. To trigger the start of the law, the state’s gross income had to exceed income in one of the three previous years by $150 million. That happened in the last fiscal year, so now the bill will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2018. The prospect of decreasing income tax is appealing for taxpayers, but is this really the first time it is happening in over a century? The timeline We talked to Anne Rottman, the library administrator at the Missouri Legislative Library, about the last time Missouri saw a reduction in income taxes. "I don’t think there ever has been a cut," she said. It turns out, she’s right. Missouri income tax was established in 1917. This tax was for a half of a percent annually on individuals’ income. Income tax saw revisions throughout the years. Graduated tax brackets were created in 1939 and have not been changed since 1972. The limit for deduction for federal income taxes was created in 1993. There were various other revisions and adjustments as well. However, none of these were decreases in the tax levied. For a century, tax law has been growing into what income tax looks like today. Why has there always been an increase and never a decrease? "No idea why this approach took so long," said Joseph Haslag, an economics professor at MU. Others seem to be stumped as well. The impact The half-percentage reduction of the tax rate per year gives the state legislature some time to adjust to having less revenue for the budget. Meanwhile, there’s a more immediate impact for individuals: Tax brackets will now be adjusted annually based on percent increase in inflation. However, when it comes to the economy overall, it isn’t as exciting as it sounds, Haslag said. "For a revenue-test state like Missouri, the tax cut reduction will have small, very small, positive effect on Missouri’s economic growth," Haslag said. And while Koenig is correct that the state’s income rate has never decreased, it’s important to note that the legislature has enacted many income tax deductions that have the same effect of lowering someone’s state income tax bill. Beginning in 2016, for example, 100 percent of a military pension income became exempt from Missouri state tax. The state also created a new deduction for people from Missouri who relocated a business to Missouri. Our ruling Koenig said that Senate Bill 509 would cut Missouri income tax for the first time in over 100 years. The truth of the matter is Missouri income tax has never been cut. Income tax laws were put in place in 1917. This was 100 years ago exactly. It’s not over 100 years, but Koenig was pretty close. It’s worth noting, however, that Missouri has created a long list of deductions that could reduce a person’s state income tax bill without having to decrease the overall tax rate. Koenig’s statement is accurate but needs that clarifying information. That meets our definition of Mostly True.	None	Andrew Koenig	None	None	None	2017-09-26T12:17:39	2017-08-30	['None']

pomt-04996	Unemployment among Oregon high school graduates aged 18 to 20 increased more than 200 percent from 2008 to 2011, while the U.S. average increased only 30 percent.	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/19/cascade-policy-institute/has-unemployment-among-oregon-high-school-graduate/	PolitiFact Oregon was easing into a new week, excited about the warm weather, when this tweet came over to shatter our calm: #Unemployment for #Oregon HS grads 18-20 jumps 300% compared to 30% nationally. It was a tweet from the Cascade Policy Institute, a think tank in Portland that advocates limited government. A research associate there had written a post called "Oregon’s Minimum Wage Prices Teens Out." Here’s a fuller explanation from the website: "Oregon’s unemployment among high school graduates aged 18 to 20 tops the national charts, with a rise of more than 300% from 2008 to 2011. This gigantic leap dwarfs the U.S. unemployment rate for the same demographic, which only shows an increase of around 30%." (Cascade later revised the claim to reflect a 200 percent increase.) How could we find out if this was all true? Does Oregon top the national charts? Was the increase in Oregon really that much worse than the national increase? And what about the underlying point: That Oregon’s minimum wage was to blame? The original post contained no links and -- more significantly -- no unemployment numbers, so we had little to go on. We put in a call to Cascade. A little background here for those unfamiliar with opposition to Oregon’s minimum wage. Oregon has the second highest-minimum wage among states, $8.80 this year, second only to Washington, at $9.04. What really annoys critics is that the wage automatically goes up every Jan. 1, as it is indexed to inflation. Voters approved the automatic indexing in 2002. Restaurants and small businesses hate it and argue that a high minimum wage hurts teen employment. So it makes sense that Cascade, which sides with free market principles, is among those critics. We spoke with Steve Buckstein, the group’s senior policy analyst. In doing so, Buckstein corrected the original write-up to reflect a 219 percent increase, and not a 300 percent increase, in Oregon’s 18-20 unemployment rate. He said the general argument still stands. "We have a very high minimum wage, and it makes it harder for teens and unskilled workers to get jobs," Buckstein said. Basic starting point: What are his numbers and where did he get them? Cascade turned to the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed Washington, D.C., group that also dislikes the minimum wage. The institute even runs a website called MinimumWage.com. Michael Saltsman, a research fellow there, used Current Population Survey figures (which are compiled by the U.S. Census and used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) to figure out unemployment for high school graduates 18 to 20. Here are the numbers: In 2008, unemployment in Oregon was 11.1 percent. By 2011, it was 35.4 percent. That is a 219 percent increase. The U.S average was 18.3 percent in 2008 and 24.5 percent in 2011. That is a 34 percent increase. We were struck by two things in the data: The high 35 percent rate in Oregon in 2011, but also the low 11 percent rate in 2008. We were doing better than the national average five years ago. Obviously if we go from lower-than-average to higher-than-average, we’re going to get a larger-than-usual increase. That made us see the 200 percent increase in a new light. We then checked with the Oregon Center for Public Policy, another local think tank, but on the other side of the issue. Executive director Chuck Sheketoff suggested we try the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, which, unlike the Employment Policies Institute, supports raising the minimum wage. Economic analyst David Cooper shared his unemployment rates for the same age group, also using Current Population Survey figures. And you know what we found? The unemployment figures were different -- lower, generally, all around -- but the rates of increase were about the same. In 2008, unemployment for high school graduates 18-20 years old in Oregon was 8.3 percent, compared with 13.4 percent nationally. In 2011, Oregon unemployment had grown to 25.4 percent, compared with 18.4 percent nationally. Those figures correspond with a 206 percent increase in Oregon, and 37 percent nationally. Again, Oregon was doing better than the national average, before we did worse in 2011. (Cooper also argues youth unemployment jumped dramatically "across the entire country, and particularly in the Pacific Northwest" between 2008 and 2011. The increase in Washington was 85 percent and in Idaho, 83 percent. Again, Oregon had lower unemployment than both states in 2008 but ended with slightly higher rates in 2011, which made the increase more dramatic.) We checked with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which provides the official unemployment figures, and Oregon’s Employment Department. We’ll spare you more numbers. Both agencies showed the same trend, albeit for slightly different age groups, education levels and years. Clearly, the numbers went up. Is any of this tied to Oregon’s indexed minimum wage? People disagree on this. Obviously when employers are shedding jobs, they’re not hiring. And when they do start hiring, they often hire more experienced adults. There’s no question the recession has hit teens and other young workers hard. But Nick Beleiciks, state employment economist, offers a different take on how unemployment intersects with a high minimum wage. Data show that teens in Oregon are more likely to look for work than teens across the country, he said. That’s called a participation rate. "Oregon has a higher participation rate and that could have to do with the higher minimum wage and because of that higher participation rate, we do have a higher unemployment rate among teenagers," he said. Buckstein argues that the high unemployment rate has to do with younger workers looking for jobs in a limited market, and not getting those jobs because they’re losing out to more experienced workers. Of course, neither explanation addresses why our rates were lower than the U.S. average in 2008, which was after Oregon voters approved indexing the minimum wage to inflation in 2002. We won’t rule on that argument. We’re sticking to the numbers. In case you’ve forgotten them, here’s a nifty table for easy review: Cascade 2008 Cascade 2011 percent increase Eco Policy 2008 Eco Policy 2011 percent increase Oregon 11.1 35.4 219 % 8.3 25.4 206 % U.S. 18.3 24.5 34 % 13.4 18.4 37 % The rates of increase cited by Cascade Policy are correct, as measured by its numbers and the numbers of an ideologically different institute. We will give Cascade a pass on the original increase cited because, in this context, the difference between 219 percent and 300 percent doesn’t really matter. The problem we have is we don’t think it’s fair to use the national average to highlight the apparently horrible nature of Oregon unemployment, without noting the actual unemployment figures. In every data set we checked, Oregon’s youth unemployment in 2008 was lower than the national average. Of course, the rate of increase will be higher when the starting point is lower. We think the actual unemployment rates are an important missing detail that should be considered when looking at increases. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-10051	"The average bonus [on Wall Street] is about $100,000...The bonuses on Wall Street are down 44 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/05/fred-smith/fedex-chair-delivers-perspective-bonuses/	Reports about big bonuses for Wall Street executives have struck a nerve with people who wonder how the executives can justify large payments when their firms are in shaky condition or are seeking federal help. It's drawn the ire of President Obama, who called it "the height of irresponsibility. It's shameful." On Feb. 4, 2009, he said top executives at firms receiving federal aid will have their compensation capped at $500,000 and that bonuses would have to come as stock that they can't receive until the government is reimbursed. The New York State Comptroller reported in late January that Wall Street firms in 2008 handed out $18.4 billion in cash bonuses to employees who live in New York City, the sixth-largest amount on record. Critics have said the employees don't deserve the rewards because the firms lost more than $35 billion in 2008 and the federal government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars bailing out many of them. Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx and supporter of George W. Bush, John McCain and other Republicans, tried to cool down the heated discussion with a bit of perspective on ABC's This Week on Feb. 1, 2009. Host George Stephanopoulos noted that Smith "actually took a pay cut in December. You announced a 20 percent pay cut because of the performance of FedEx over the last year, because of the tough economic times. And I wonder ... what do you think of the bonus structure now on Wall Street?" Smith replied that compensation on Wall Street is built on bonuses "much more so than in the industrial sector. As I understand it, the average bonus in that $18 billion is about $100,000 a year. The bonuses on Wall Street are down about 44 percent." Smith was not far off when it came to the average cash bonus. It was $112,000 in 2008, according to New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's Jan. 28, 2009, report. And indeed bonuses were down 44 percent in a sense: The total amount given out in bonuses, $18.4 billion, was a decline of 44 percent from the $32.9 billion handed out in 2007. But due to job losses on Wall Street, there were fewer employees to split the pie in 2008. So the average bonus was down a slightly more modest 37 percent from the previous year's average. Also, it might have been worth pointing out that while bonuses were well below the 2007 level, that average of $112,000 was still the fifth-highest since the comptroller's office started keeping records in 1985. And the total haul of $18.4 billion was the sixth highest on record. Both were around the same as 2004, a vastly better year for the securities industry and its investors. And although it's true that bonuses generally make up a substantial portion of the compensation on Wall Street, $112,000 is still more than twice the average salary in the United States. But Smith is free to use statistics selectively — and the statistics he chose were off by just $12,000 and a few percentage points. We find his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11665	"African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/08/donald-trump/how-accurate-donald-trumps-about-black-hispa/	President Donald Trump and his team found several positives to tout from the newest round of employment numbers. On Jan. 5, the day the new numbers were released, presidential daughter and White House official Ivanka Trump tweeted, "The unemployment rate for African Americans fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest ever recorded. We are working hard to bring this rate down even further." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The president himself echoed the talking point in his own tweet Jan. 8: "African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote! #NeverForget @foxandfriends." See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com How accurate is the president’s tweet? He’s right on the numbers but leaves out economic gains for those groups under Democratic control. Unemployment rates In December 2017, African-American unemployment fell to 6.8 percent. That’s a record low since the statistic was first calculated in 1972. The previous record low was 7 percent in April 2000 and September 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Hispanic unemployment also dropped by a full percentage point, from 5.9 percent in December 2016 to 4.9 percent in December 2017. As the president said, this is close to the data point’s all-time low, which was 4.8 percent in October and November 2017. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Did Democrats do "nothing" for black and Hispanic unemployment? The tweet would have been accurate if Trump had stopped after the numbers. But his dig on the Democrats marred his talking point. The unemployment rate for both groups declined dramatically on President Barack Obama’s watch. Black unemployment peaked at 16.6 percent in April 2010, when Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 percent by the time Obama left office in January 2017. Hispanic unemployment, meanwhile, peaked at 13 percent in August 2009, then fell to 5.9 percent at the end of Obama’s term in January 2017 -- also a drop of more than half. We should note that presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. The White House did not reply to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!" He’s right about the low unemployment rates for both blacks and Hispanics today. But his slam that the Democrats "did nothing" in this regard is an exaggeration. Under Obama, the unemployment rate for both groups fell by more than half. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11506	"We have roughly between 85,000 (and) 95,000 open jobs in Wisconsin."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/23/rebecca-kleefisch/lt-governors-count-wisconsin-job-openings-includes/	Discussing the administration’s 2018 agenda on a Milwaukee radio show late last year, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch said Wisconsin had an "extraordinary amount of jobs" but not enough workers with the right skills. For proof she turned to a state-run jobs database. "The best illustration of this … is called JobCenterOfWisconsin.com," Kleefisch told Steve Scaffidi on his WTMJ radio show Dec. 21, 2017. "You're going to see that on a day-to-day basis, we have roughly between 85,000 (and) 95,000 open jobs in Wisconsin, and yet, we only have about 40,000 folks who are currently on unemployment." Does Wisconsin really have between 85,000 and 95,000 available jobs? Time to dive into the data. Database a mix of sources The site — run by the state Department of Workforce Development — includes jobs posted there directly by businesses or workforce department staffers and those provided by a third-party jobs aggregator. A snapshot of the database provided by DWD from Jan. 8, 2018, shortly after Kleefisch’s statement, showed a total of 83,077 jobs. About 39,000 jobs were posted directly to the site, 43,000 came from US.jobs and 1,000 from America’s Job Exchange. US.jobs, also called the National Labor Exchange, is a national jobs clearinghouse that retrieves jobs at least once a day from numerous companies’ internal job tracking systems. The service provides about 60% of the job listings to all state job databases in the country, said Hal Cooper, vice president of product development for the DirectEmployers Association, which coordinates the database. The number of jobs in the Wisconsin database varies by season. In 2017, it hit a high of 104,000 in May. It was just under 90,000 the day before Kleefisch’s comment, according to copies of the site maintained by archive.org. Out-of-state, old jobs included in listing So the totals are in line with Kleefisch’s claim. But a closer look at the data shows the matter is not quite that simple. The jobs database includes about 14,000 positions located in Wisconsin’s four neighboring states -- Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Michigan. One of the 15 most common entries in the "employer" field in the database is Access Dubuque, a jobs clearinghouse in Iowa. John Dipko, a workforce development spokesman, said the jobs are included because job seekers "typically look for openings within a particular radius of their home," even if that crosses state lines. He said many of those jobs are "still performed" in Wisconsin through telecommuting or travel. Dan Suhr, Kleefisch’s interim chief of staff, noted the database topped 100,000 in the months preceding her comment, and removing the out-of-state jobs from that number would still leave a total near the low end of the range she cited. The database also contained some entries that appeared to be duplicates. For example, Arby’s restaurants had 16 identical postings that each sought three assistant managers to work in La Crosse County — a total of 48 jobs. Arby’s has one location in La Crosse County. There were also 12 postings for three Arby’s managers each in Brown County, more than the number of restaurants there. But such cases did not appear widespread. Several of the companies with the highest number of jobs in the database confirmed the tallies were accurate. A dozen companies in the database combined for more than 12,000 job listings as of Jan. 8. Roehl Transport had the highest number of jobs in the database at 2,174, and a spokesman said the nationwide driving shortage means there is essentially no limit to the number of drivers they would hire. Spokesmen for Ascension Health (1,080 jobs), Froedtert Health (663) and Walgreens (635) said those numbers are roughly accurate. Job listings on Kwik Trip’s website appear to show a roughly similar number of jobs to the state database. Among other large employers, a McDonald’s spokesman said they don’t maintain a jobs total for all Wisconsin franchises, and Pizza Hut and Dollar General did not respond to requests for confirmation. Dipko and Cooper said they have systems in place to keep outdated jobs out of the database. The internally posted jobs are removed after 90 days if employers don’t update them, and the outside ones from US.jobs are updated daily from the company servers, so those are also presumed up-to-date. The database provided included 3,900 listings that were first posted more than a year ago, but Dipko and Cooper attributed those to job listing IDs being reused or jobs remaining open. Our rating While making a point about the gap between Wisconsin’s job-seekers and available jobs, Kleefisch claimed in late December that Wisconsin had "roughly" 85,000 to 95,000 open jobs on a state website. The database stood at 90,000 the day before her comment and totalled 82,000 a couple weeks later in the version released to PolitiFact. But an examination of the 82,000 jobs showed only 69,000 were actually based in Wisconsin. It’s reasonable to include those out-of-state jobs in a database for Wisconsin job seekers, but those aren’t Wisconsin jobs. The in-state listings appear largely legitimate, based on checks with the largest employers and a search for repeated or out-of-date listings. But that is still short of the range Kleefisch asserted. The database changed somewhat between her statement and the data we analyzed, but not by enough to put the Wisconsin tally in line with her statement. We rate her claim Half True. (Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin, rather than Froedtert Health, which covers jus tthe Froedtert portion of the operation).

pomt-12356	"Every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing."	/florida/statements/2017/jun/09/greg-gutfeld/fox-news-show-co-host-greg-gutfeld-denies-temperat/	Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld says people who cite statistics about the hottest year ever or high temperatures are spreading "B.S." He says people who make such claims are not telling the full story about temperature statistics. "If you asked them what the increase was, they wouldn't be able to tell you that every single year that there's an increase, it is within the margin of error, meaning it isn’t increasing," Gutfeld said June 2 on the show he co-hosts, The Five. "So, those are called real truths," he continued. "The poetic truth is the chaos and the hysteria, because that plays to the media. And it makes you feel so important. And you get to punish America for being so successful by doing these stupid deals. But if you read the facts about the high temperatures, about the reality of our past, it is all B.S." Gutfeld made the statement on The Five as the panel discussed President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. We interviewed several scientists who said Gutfeld’s statement -- that temperature increases are within the margin of error and therefore not increasing -- is wrong. Rather than point to "single year" increases, experts said that long-term trends clearly show the temperature has been rising for decades. Robert Jackson, chair of the department of Earth System Science at Stanford, said Gutfeld’s statement, scientifically speaking, "is rubbish." There are two main sources of data cited to look at temperature trends: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the NASA Goddard institute for Space Studies. Both show a trend of rising temperatures. Rising temperatures should be measured over many years A Fox News spokeswoman sent us articles stating that 2016 data on rising temperatures was deceptive because of "uncertainty in the statistics" or because news reports hid information on the margin of error. Gutfeld focused on "single year" increases. Such comparisons don’t tell the full story about rising temperature, because there is natural variability year over year. It is more useful to look at long-term trends such as comparing decades, said University of Miami’s Ben Kirtman. The statement by Gutfeld "indicates a profound misunderstanding of climate science and statistics," Kirtman said. "Year over year you can’t be sure that one year is a statistically separate warming from the previous year, so you have to take a little bit longer view to remove some of the natural fluctuation," he said. But by looking at climate data over decades, it shows a clear rise in temperatures. NASA tracks the annual temperature anomaly which means a change, up or down, from a long-term average. NASA’s latest annual data released in January 2017 shows that temperatures have been rising upward since the 1960s: In January 2017, NASA reported that the Earth’s 2016 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern recordkeeping began in 1880, according to independent analyses by NASA and NOAA. Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean -- making 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures, NASA concluded. NASA stated that even taking into account the uncertainties in the interpretation of year-to-year temperature differences, NASA estimated 2016 was the warmest year with greater than 95 percent certainty. NASA attributed the rising temperatures driven largely by "increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere." Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. According to NASA, for recent years the margin of error is about ±0.05 degrees Celsius. Uncertainties can arise in the data due to different methods in dealing with missing data and weighting the two hemispheres; however, the uncertainty is quite small, said Kevin Trenberth, a Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Trenberth said that 2014 was the warmest on record at that point, but perhaps not outside uncertainty. But 2015 broke that record well outside the uncertainty, and then 2016 further broke that record, again well outside any uncertainty. So 2014-16 are the warmest three years on record, he said. Reto A. Ruedy, an expert at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said Gutfeld’s statement "lacks any logic." "It argues that anything that changes less than the margin of error within some arbitrarily selected time interval (here a year) necessarily does not change," he said. "By the same logic you can argue that babies don’t grow in size, since within a day or even a week they grow less than the margin of error in determining their size." The long-term trend which shows an overall rise in temperature since 1880, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. "Gutfeld uses flawed logic to claim that there is no trend. But there is a trend," he said. "The lesson here? Always look at the actual data." Our ruling Gutfeld said, "every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing." While some years are within the margin, others definitely aren't, so Gutfeld is wrong when he says "every single" year is within the margin of error. Also, long-term trends over decades show that temperatures are clearly rising. So Gutfeld is wrong both on the details and and the big picture. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-03122	"The CDC issued a report commissioned by President Obama just earlier this year, and it found some very inconvenient facts. Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers. Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed. Gun buybacks don't work."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/18/se-cupp/crossfires-se-cupp-cites-cdc-armed-citizen-safety-/	Did a report commissioned by the president find "some very inconvenient facts" about gun control? Conservative CNN Crossfire host S.E. Cupp broke it down in an episode last week: "The CDC issued a report commissioned by President (Barack) Obama just earlier this year, and it found some very inconvenient facts. Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers. Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed. Gun buybacks don't work. Shouldn't we be looking at irrefutable evidence, irrefutable evidence?" Her liberal co-host Van Jones quipped, "Oh, now Obama's CDC is irrefutable?" We’ve looked into the state of gun research, which has been starved of federal funding since the late 1990s. Did a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer strong evidence? The report Cupp mentioned was inspired by mass shootings during 2011 and 2012 in Tucson, Ariz.; Aurora, Colo.; Oak Creek, Wis. and Newtown, Conn. In January 2013, President Barack Obama directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research causes and prevention of gun violence. The agency turned to the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council to bring together experts to come up with a "research agenda." They released a 113-page report in June that also summarized what’s known. Rather than break new ground, it focused on the need for more work. "In the absence of this research, policymakers will be left to debate controversial policies without scientifically sound evidence about their potential effects," it said. Later, it urged: "There is a pressing need to obtain up-to-date, accurate information about how many guns are owned in the United States, their distribution and types, how people acquire them, and how they are used." Here’s what it noted about armed citizens, gun control laws and gun buybacks. ‘Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers’ The research committee summarized research on the "defensive use of guns." It did cite specific studies that showed lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims: "Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was 'used' by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies," it said. It cited four studies, three involving criminal justice professor Gary Kleck of Florida State University, who was on the committee. But it also pointed out that effectiveness of such tactics likely varies depending on the type of victim, offender and circumstance. "So further research is needed, both to explore these contingencies and to confirm or discount earlier findings," the report said. It also pointed out that "even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public — concealed or open carry — may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. "For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade homes of gun owners this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use." It cited three studies from the 1990s by Arthur Kellermann, now a policy analyst at Rand Corp., then said: "Although some early studies were published that related to this issue, they were not conclusive, and this is a sufficiently important question that it merits additional, careful exploration." ‘Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed’ "Mixed" definitely describes the state of the research, according to the report, if not the effectiveness of the laws themselves. "Whether gun restrictions reduce firearm-related violence is an unresolved issue," it said, noting that the "effectiveness of various types of control is inadequately researched." It goes on to cite studies that fall all over the map. Firearm legislation is associated with lower rates of fatal firearm violence. Except when it’s not. Even studies that show correlation have a hard time showing one thing causes the other. "A paucity of reliable and valid data, as discussed in the sections above, is a major barrier to the development of the most effective policies, strategies, and interventions for prevention of firearm violence. Nonetheless, many interventions have been developed and studied, and they point to areas requiring important additional research," the report finds. Gun buybacks don't work There’s evidence gun buybacks don’t work, the report says. "For example, in 2009, an estimated 310 million guns were available to civilians in the United States … but gun buyback programs typically recover less than 1,000 guns," it said, citing two two studies. It mentioned that on the local level, buybacks may function to raise awareness of gun violence. But it also cited a 2002 study that showed in Milwaukee, Wis., for example, "guns recovered in the buybacks were not the same guns as those most often used in homicides and suicides." Our ruling Cupp said that a CDC report this year found: "Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers. Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed. Gun buybacks don't work." The report, which summarized the state of gun research and outlined areas for new investigation, cited studies that showed crime victims who used guns had lower injury rates. But it also noted a need to explore other factors and "confirm or discount" earlier research. On gun control laws, the research itself is mixed — and there’s a "paucity of reliable and valid data" on which to base it. The report did cite evidence that gun buybacks don’t work. Cupp exaggerated the findings of the CDC report, which merely rounded up studies as it argued for more and better research. In most cases, the report was intended to spur more research, not settle controversial claims once and for all. We rate her claim Half True.	None	S.E.

pomt-12276	Minnesota imposed an Islamic anti-blasphemy law.	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/03/blog-posting/no-minnesota-did-not-pass-anti-blasphemy-law-s-isl/	You can still find parts of the world where blaspheming Islam is punishable by fines or even death. Minnesota, however, is not among these places. Nevertheless, fake news sites like Political Mayhem claim Minnesota recently passed an Islamic anti-blasphemy law dressed up to look like a municipal hate crime hotline. "It is not the way we roll in America, until now," reads one noxious fake news item. "Minnesota has just established" an anti-blasphemy law. We decided to hose off this dumpster fire. A hate crime hotline is not an anti-blasphemy law Defining blasphemy is easy enough: in legal terms it’s "any oral or written reproach maliciously cast upon God, His name, attributes, or religion." But it strains credulity beyond the breaking point to believe a hate crime hotline set up June 19 by the city of Minneapolis is actually an Islamic anti-blasphemy law. First, opening a hotline is not how you make law. Second, this hotline is not meant for suspected crimes against Muslims only. As a statement describing the new service makes clear, reports concerning "any crime against a person or property motivated by prejudice against someone’s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity" are encouraged.

mpws-00005	Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., brought his populist message to Minneapolis last Sunday. His speech, which he gave to mark the start of his campaign here, focused largely on income inequality. PoliGraph looked at two statements Sanders made and found that, while Sanders tends toward hyperbole, his claims were mostly backed by facts. “In America today, we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major industrialized country on earth.” This line is standard fare in Sanders’ speeches, and not too long ago, FactCheck.org said it was an exaggeration. Since then, Sanders has fine-tuned his rhetoric a bit, saying America has the worst income and wealth inequality of any other industrialized nation on earth. By adding that qualifier, Sanders comes closer to the truth, but a lot depends on how you define industrialized countries. A Sanders spokesman pointed to a recent CNN article that said Israel and the U.S. are at the top of the list when it comes to income inequality. Other rankings put the U.S. in a similar position. According a report by the Credit Suisse Research, the U.S. is near the top of wealth inequality, too. But using a list of “advanced” or industrialized nations from the World Factbook, which is published by the Central intelligence Agency, the U.S. is outranked by Turkey and Hong Kong. Different sources use different standards for defining industrialized nations and income inequality, but Sanders is mostly correct in his statement: The U.S. is near the top of income and wealth inequality rankings when it comes to industrialized nations. “The truth is that unemployment in America is not 5.4 percent…. If you include those people who have given up looking for work, and those people who are working part time, real unemployment in America today is close to 11 percent.” Sanders is right that national unemployment is 5.4 percent. And Sanders is correct that the national unemployment rate doesn’t tell the whole story. For instance, the official unemployment rate doesn’t include people who are discouraged from looking for work, or who are marginally attached to the work force. Those people are captured in a separate statistic that also includes people who are working part-time but say they would like to be working more. Right now, this figure is roughly 11 percent. Politicians on the left and right have often pointed to the “U-6,” the technical term used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as the “real” unemployment rate. But the BLS routinely pushes back on that description in part because it does include people who are employed part time. Sanders is clearly using a higher number to make a political point. But what he does get right is the fact that the U.S. employment outlook is more complicated than just one number. And the U-6 is a legitimate figure sometimes used by politicians and economists to paint a broader picture of economy. 	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/06/poligraph-sanders-claims-about-inequality/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Sanders claims about inequality	June 5, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['United_States', 'Bernie_Sanders', 'Hong_Kong', 'Minneapolis', 'Israel', 'FactCheck.org', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'The_World_Factbook', 'Central_Intelligence_Agency', 'CNN']
pomt-01197	Immigrants "have captured all of the nearly 9 million jobs created since 2000."	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/02/peter-morici/economist-immigrants-have-taken-all-new-jobs-creat/	President Barack Obama’s decision to defer deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants has stirred fear that a tough job market just got tougher. The concern is that if these people can now work in the country legally, it will take opportunities away from the people who were born here. In a newspaper op-ed, Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland, faulted loose immigration policies for what he called the economy’s "lackluster performance." Morici cited a number of factors, including this striking statement about immigrants. "(They) have captured all of the nearly 9 million jobs created since 2000," Morici wrote. "Illegal immigrants hold many of these positions, and now the president threatens to legalize their status by executive action if the Republican Congress won't cave to his demands." A reader wondered if Morici was right about immigrants scoring all of the new jobs. Morici’s statement that "illegal immigrants hold many of these positions" is a bit vague, so this fact-check focuses only on his claim about immigrants, both legal and illegal, capturing "all of the nearly 9 million jobs created since 2000." Morici told PunditFact he got his numbers from a recent report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration. "The total number of working-age (16 to 65) immigrants (legal and illegal) holding a job increased 5.7 million from the first quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2014, while declining 127,000 for natives," the report said. While the report didn’t spell out how many jobs the economy gained since 2000, it provided a link to a table that showed a growth of about 5.5 million jobs. These numbers largely match data provided by the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. So it might look as though Morici is on firm ground. The center’s study found that the number of jobs gained by the foreign-born was pretty much the same as the number of new jobs added to the economy. But there are a few hitches. First, that study focused on workers between 16 and 65 years old. In a footnote, the authors acknowledge that the results would look quite different if they had included older workers. Using the study’s table, we did that and saw that while foreign-born workers did better than those born in the United States, they didn’t account for all of the gains. For workers 16 years old and up, the total change in employment was about 8.8 million. Of that, the number of foreign-born workers grew about 6.2 million and for native-born, the number was 2.6 million. As this chart shows, the percentages change a lot. If you parse Morici’s statement, you can see where these numbers get him into trouble. If he wants to speak of nearly 9 million new jobs, then he has to accept that about 70 percent, not 100 percent, went to immigrants. If he wants to assert that all the new jobs went to immigrants, then he should have talked about 5.5 million new jobs in the 16-65 age range. As it stands, the two parts of his statement don’t fit together. The center’s study also noted that the time period you pick will change what the data show. The report said, "Since the jobs recovery began in 2010, 43 percent of employment growth has gone to immigrants." That, obviously, is much less than "all" of the new jobs. It is worth noting that the study lumped legal and illegal immigrants together. Morici made a passing reference to illegal immigrants taking "many" of the new jobs. That claim is difficult to verify one way or the other because within the group of foreign-born workers, the ratio of American citizens to noncitizens has changed greatly in the past 15 years. In 2000, noncitizens outnumbered citizens by about 60 percent. In 2014, the difference was just 10 percent. Furthermore, it would be a mistake to treat all of the noncitizen workers as illegal immigrants. All these data show is that they were not born in this country and have not become citizens. They could have proper work permits, so their legal status is unknown. We told Morici about the issues we found in the data and didn’t hear back. Pia Orrenius is vice president and senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Orrenius said that foreign-born workers have found work faster than people born in America for many reasons. The demand for certain jobs has changed greatly, most likely thanks to new technology, she said. "Labor markets are polarizing and middle-skill jobs are disappearing," Orrenius said. "Natives tend to be middle-skilled compared to immigrants who are concentrated mostly on the low-skill end but also on the high-skill end." Orrenius also said that native-born workers face different choices than newcomers when looking for work. They might be able to take advantage of government programs (such as Social Security disability), or they might have more savings that allow them to get by without a job longer than an immigrant. Also, immigrants tend to move to parts of the country where growth is faster, while native-born workers tend to stay put. Our ruling Morici said that all of the nearly 9 million new jobs created since 2000 went to immigrants. His numbers don’t add up. The study he cited linked to numbers that showed that immigrants accounted for about 70 percent of the net job growth. While that study’s headline was that all of the new jobs went to immigrants, that only held true for a certain age range, which Morici misapplied to all workers. Morici is correct that foreign-born workers, both citizens and noncitizens, do disproportionately well in the job market. But the actual numbers fall well short of the 100 percent that he said. "All" is an overstatement. There is an element of truth in the claim, but it ignores certain critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10782	Mitt Romney boasts that he is "proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/16/mitt-romney/depends-on-the-definition-of-major/	In a radio ad airing in New Hampshire, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney boasts that he is "proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not." But former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee signed the same "no new taxes" pledge in March. So too have Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter, Tom Tancredo and Ron Paul – all Republicans vying for president. On a base level, then, Romney's ad is incorrect. But he did say he's the "only major candidate." And among the pledge signers, Romney is certainly the top candidate. So the ad's truthfulness comes down to the definition of "major." Huckabee, who has been feeling momentum after standout debate performances and a second place finish in the Iowa straw poll, views himself as a major candidate (don't they all?) and his campaign was quick to challenge the radio spot. (A Washington Post-ABC News poll released in October 2007 showed Romney with 11 percent support nationally and Huckabee 8 percent, his best showing so far. But in state polls, Romney does far better and his fund-raising advantage is enormous.) "There was no slight intended. The context was in line with comparisons between the top tier candidates in terms of fundraising and current poll numbers," Romney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said. The Presidential Taxpayer Protection Pledge was started in 1987 by Americans For Tax Reform, a group headed by national conservative figure Grover Norquist. Every Republican candidate since 1988 has signed the pledge, according to the group. But so far in the 2008 contest, other top GOP presidential contenders have not, including Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson and John McCain. Romney has opposed a pledge in the past. In 2002, while running for governor of Massachusetts, he said he opposed all tax increases in principle but was not willing to put that in writing. His spokesman at the time called such pledges "government by gimmickry."	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2007-10-16T00:00:00	2007-10-16	['None']
pomt-10855	"At least Obama didn't marry his cousin," as Giuliani did.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/06/obama-girl/giulianis-first-wife-was-his-second-cousin/	A wildly popular YouTube video featuring a scantily clad "Obama Girl" -- with no connection to Barack Obama's campaign -- criticizes Rudy Giuliani for marrying his cousin. Barelypolitical.com produced the video "Debate 08: Obama Girl vs. Giuliani Girl," a follow up to their successful video "I got a crush on Obama," which featured Amber Lee Ettinger lip-synching a song about the Democratic presidential candidate. In the debate video, another dancer is introduced and the two argue about the merits of their respective candidates. At one point, Obama Girl raps, "Giuliani Girl, just stop your fussing, at least Obama didn't marry his cousin." We find Obama Girl's claims are accurate. In 1968, Giuliani wed his second cousin, Regina Peruggi, who was the daughter of his father's first cousin. (Think of your son/daughter marrying your cousin's daughter/son.) Giuliani at different points labeled the family connection as "second cousins once removed" and "third cousins," before he was corrected, according to news reports. In a 1993 memo for his mayoral campaign, a Giuliani strategist noted the "weirdness" factor of the marriage, according to a copy posted on the Smoking Gun Web site. But such a marriage is completely legal. In New York, even first cousins can wed. Robin Bennett, senior genetic counselor at the University of Washington, said little scientific research exists about the risk of developmental difficulties for the offspring of second cousins. But she said, "for second cousins, the risks are likely similar to the risks of couples from the same ethnic population who also may have common ancestors." Giuliani and Peruggi did not have any children, and the marriage ended after 14 years.	None	Obama Girl	None	None	None	2007-09-06T00:00:00	2007-07-19	['Barack_Obama', 'Rudy_Giuliani']

pomt-03414	Says Wendy Davis, "born into difficult circumstances," was the daughter of a single mother and a teenage mother herself.	/texas/statements/2013/jun/28/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-wendy-davis-daughter-single-mother/	Near the end of a 15-minute speech to the National Right to Life Convention in Grapevine, Texas, Gov. Rick Perry suggested the Democratic state senator who stood for more than a dozen hours toward defeating proposed abortion restrictions could draw a lesson from her own life. Perry edged toward talking about Wendy Davis, whom he did not name, by asking who "are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances can’t grow to live successful lives?" "In fact, even the woman who filibustered the Senate other day was born into difficult circumstances," Perry continued. "She was the daughter of a single mother. She was a teenaged mother herself. She eventually graduated from Harvard Law School and served in the Texas Senate. It’s just unfortunate that she hasn’t learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to recognize its full potential and that every life matters." A reader questioned whether the circumstances into which Davis was "born" included having a single mother. We also looked at if she was a teenage mother herself. Davis, who represents a Fort Worth district, has previously referred to her teenage motherhood and to her mother being single, according to web posts and news articles in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Her Senate website says Davis "began working after school at 14 to help support her single mother and three siblings. By 19, Wendy was a single mother herself, working two jobs to make ends meet in hopes of creating a better life for her young daughter." The biographical entry on her campaign website has the same sentences. Responding to our inquiry, Perry spokesman Josh Havens noted the campaign-site reference. "What the governor said is consistent with what the senator has written in her bio," Havens said by email. Davis’ Senate spokesman, Rick Svatora, said by telephone that the senator, whose June 25, 2013, filibuster drew national and international attention, was "booked up" and unavailable to immediately discuss this claim. But in 2012, Davis gave sworn testimony about her life in a lawsuit brought before a panel of federal judges in Washington, D.C. "When I was only 18 I got married," Davis said, according to a transcript of her Jan. 20, 2012, testimony. "I had a baby, I got divorced by the time I was 19 years old. And I had started working, I actually started working when I was 14. I was raised by a single mother. My mother only had a 6th grade education. My parents divorced when I was 11 years old." Davis also testified that she was born in West Warwick, R.I., before moving to Tarrant County. She testified, too, that she graduated from Texas Christian University and then Harvard Law School, with honors. Jerry Russell, Davis’ father and the founder of a Fort Worth theater, returned our telephone call about Perry’s claim and challenged the reference to Davis being "born into difficult circumstances." Russell said it was "totally incorrect" to conclude that Davis was born to a single mother. Rather, he said, he and Davis’ mother were wedded in Rhode Island in 1958, some five years before Davis, the third of their four children, was born there, he said. Russell initially told us the couple moved to Fort Worth in 1973 and separated in 1976, around when the future senator was 13. He shortly called back and said the separation probably occurred "closer to" a couple years earlier, as Davis testified. "From that point on," Russell said, "I wasn’t present in the" family "home, but I was present in Wendy’s life." Russell said that his ex-wife remarried two or three years after their split and then another time later. He declined to elaborate. According to online Tarrant County records, Davis’ mother, Virginia, whom we failed to reach, married Ira Cornstubble in May 1994. Our ruling Perry said Davis, "born into difficult circumstances," was the daughter of a single mother and a teenage mother herself. His statement, offered in the cause of a law to curb abortions, could leave the incorrect impression that Davis was born to a struggling single mother, which is not so, best we can tell. Still, the senator’s parents divorced midway through her childhood and Davis spent at least part of her adolescence in a one-parent home. Also, Perry is correct that Davis was a teenage mother herself. This partially accurate claim distorts important details. We rate it as Half True.

pomt-14605	"While our people work longer hours for lower wages, almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/03/bernie-sanders/mixed-bag-bernie-sanders-claim-about-wages-hours-i/	A Bernie Sanders campaign ad, which regularly aired in Iowa and most recently in Nevada, tries to make a point that hard-working people have been falling behind economically. "If you're doing everything right but find it harder and harder to get by, you're not alone," Sanders says. "While our people work longer hours for lower wages, almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent." We wanted to check the three claims wrapped up in that last sentence. Are Americans working longer hours, are their wages lower, and is almost all new income going to the richest? Sanders doesn't specify a time frame, which complicates matters somewhat, and his campaign wouldn't give us one, despite repeated inquiries. The background graphic, depicting skyrocketing income among the top 1 percent, comes from a 2013 blog post by Pew Research. The Pew graphic is clearly labeled to note that the data cover 1917 to 2007. That labeling is gone from the Sanders commercial, although both the Pew and Sanders version mark 1980, a reasonable starting point for a dramatic income growth among top earners. We'll start there and consider the three claims individually. Hours The work week has been steadily declining, not increasing, over the past five decades, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1980, the average work week was about 35 hours. It's now below 34 hours. There was, however, a significant decline to 33 hours in June 2009 during the Great Recession. To argue that we're working longer hours, you have to do a bit of cherry-picking and start then, not at 1980, at least according to the BLS. Workers might get the impression from their own lives that those numbers are too low. In fact, Gallup has consistently found from its surveys that full-time employees work, on average, seven hours longer than their 40-hour work week. Nonetheless, Gallup data from most of this century show no significant change in the work week of full-time employees from 2001 through 2014 and a decline in part-time hours, from 35.4 hours in 2001-02 to 25.9 hours for 2013-14. Neither measure shows hours increased, as Sanders claimed. However, it may be a different story if you look at families instead of individuals. The Sanders campaign referred us to a Washington Post article that references a 2011 Brookings Institution study. When Brookings looked at data through 2009 for the middle 10 percent of families, it concluded that income had increased by 23 percent since 1975. But that's not because wages had increased. It's because family members are working 26 percent more hours. Virtually all of that increase was seen among the mother, part of an effort to maintain the standard of living. "The numbers suggest that the typical American family is earning more, but almost entirely because parents are working more — not because they are earning more per hour," the report says. Which brings us to . . . Wages Are Americans really earning lower wages? We called up quarterly data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, specifically the annual averages for median, usual, weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers. We looked from 1980 through 2015. The numbers are adjusted for inflation in 1982-84 dollars. Over those 35 years, earnings rose from $318 per week to $342 per week, a 7.5 percent increase. If you want to create a decrease, you have to start tracking at 2009 (when weekly earnings hit about $345) or go back to early 1973, when hourly wages reached a peak. Again, timing is everything. As Pew's Drew DeSilver noted in October, "after adjusting for inflation, today’s average hourly wage has just about the same purchasing power as it did in 1979, following a long slide in the 1980s and early 1990s and bumpy, inconsistent growth since then." But it's not the same for all income groups. Since 2000, the people in the lowest-paying jobs — the bottom 25 percent — have seen their weekly wages fall by 3 percent while the people at the top have seen a 9.7 percent rise. The Congressional Budget Office has used a different measurement. A 2014 report looked at data through 2011. It shows that since 1979, average after-tax income rose 40 percent for the poorest fifth and 29 percent for the middle class (those in the 21st to 80th percentile) once inflation was taken into account. (After-tax income takes into account tax policies designed to divert income from the wealthiest Americans.) So the overall trend is up. To say wages have gone down, you have to be very selective about where you start counting. The recovery brought things back up, but not as much as it did for the rich, which brings us to . . . New income By stopping at 2007 when he shows the rise in income for wealthiest Americans, Sanders misses some significant news. The great recession brought income for the top 1 percent down by more than a third. You can see it in the CBO after-tax data (above). From 1979 to 2007, the top 1 percent saw income grow by more than 275 percent. That growth fell dramatically the following year, and by 2011 it recovered to 175 percent over 1979 levels. There's no universally accepted way to calculate what percent of new income has gone to the top 1 percent. Sanders' claim came from the work of University of California Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez whose analysis concluded that the top 1 percent accumulated 91 percent of all income gains from 2009-12. That's because the "top 1 percent incomes grew by 34.7 percent while bottom 99 percent incomes grew only by 0.8," he said. One complication is that Sanders is looking at pre-tax income minus all government payments — think Social Security, unemployment compensation, welfare, food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit. That's more likely to show that income trends are favoring the rich, said Gary Burtless, an economist at Brookings and a former economist with the U.S. Department of Labor. "If you omit income items that go disproportionately to the poor and middle class, it is easier to make the case that income trends are favoring the very well off," Burtless said in an email. Saez subsequently released updated numbers from 2009 through 2014 showing that the 91 percent estimate had dropped to 58 percent, a ratio Sanders acknowledged during a Senate speech in September. In that most-recent analysis, Saez concluded that over the much broader period of 1993 to 2014, the top 1 percent has captured 55 percent of the real income growth. Our ruling In his ad, Sanders asserts that, "While our people work longer hours for lower wages, almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent." The question of hours is a mixed bag. The individual data suggest that people work the same or fewer hours. But family data analyzed by Brookings and only showing a limited slice of the population show that mothers are working longer hours. Wages have, in general, been going up, although barely at all compared to the gains seen among the rich. And while the super-rich may have accumulated 91 percent of the new wealth from 2009 to 2013 according to the economist Sanders has been relying on, the latest analysis shows that the ratio is now 58 percent since 2009, 55 percent since 1993. That's a huge amount of new income for just 1 percent of the population, but it's a stretch to say that it's "almost all." On balance, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-06942	During his first year, President Obama said he "was going to visit Kim Jong-ll and Ahmadinejad and Assad and Chavez – the worst actors in the world."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-president-obama-was-planning-visi/	A persistent theme in Mitt Romney's campaign for president has been the complaint that President Barack Obama has been coddling U.S. enemies such as Iran, North Korea and Syria. So when Romney was asked about Iran during a town hall in Wolfeboro, N.H., on July 5, 2011, he noted that it is "the national sponsor of terror groups across the globe" and lamented that the U.S. doesn’t do a better job of promoting itself abroad. "The President, when he was running for office, said he was going to engage Iran, and engage North Korea. Remember in his first year he was going to visit Kim Jong-ll and Ahmadinejad and Assad and Chavez – the worst actors in the world. And how did that work out?" To check whether Romney was right, we explored two questions: Did Obama actually say he was going to meet in the first year of his presidency with North Korean leader Kim Jong-II, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez? And did Obama say those meetings would take place in the leaders' home countries? Romney’s campaign pointed us to the transcript of the CNN/YouTube debate in Charleston, S.C. in July 2007. QUESTION: "In 1982, Anwar Sadat traveled to Israel, a trip that resulted in a peace agreement that has lasted ever since. In the spirit of that type of bold leadership, would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?" OBAMA: "I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them — which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration — is ridiculous. Now, Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward. And I think that it is a disgrace that we have not spoken to them." Obama's remarks drew criticism from his Democratic rival, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, who called Obama’s position "irresponsible and frankly naive" and said that agreeing to meetings "without preconditions" risked that they could be used "for propaganda purposes." Republican nominee John McCain said Obama's position proved his much younger rival’s "inexperience and reckless judgment." Back in 2008, PolitiFact examined McCain’s contention that candidate Obama "said again and again" that he’d be willing to meet with the President Ahmidinejad without precondition, and rated it True. More recently, we've examined Romney’s claim that in his first year, Obama "traveled around the globe to apologize for America," which earned a rating of Pants on Fire. Here, Romney is returning to familiar turf to echo those themes. But in doing so, he exaggerated what Obama said at the debate. First, when he was in that town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, Romney didn’t say Obama said he was "willing to meet " the leaders; Romney said Obama "was going to." Those are two very different things in the precise language of diplomacy. And Romney didn’t use the word "meet," as Obama and McCain did. Instead, he substituted "visit." Diplomatic experts told us those changes significantly change the meaning of Romney's statement. "There is a big difference between visiting a capital and being willing to meet with another government, another government’s leaders -- so it would be unfair to suggest that’s what Obama said. He didn’t say that, and in international politics and diplomacy the difference is quite important," says R. Nicholas Burns, a professor of diplomacy and international politics at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Burns was Ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton and Ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush. Kurk Volker, of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said Romney's statement is "an exaggeration." Volker, also a U.S. Ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush who is backing the Presidential campaign of Tim Pawlenty, said he doesn’t see Romney’s charge as coming "completely out of thin air" but says it stretches the facts. "It's more specific and more solicitous to say he’s going to visit them. And the imagery around that would be very different, to have the president photographed on the other guy’s turf, it would be a different thing." And as things stand, 30 months into President Obama’s term, he has visited none of these U.S. antagonists, nor are there any public plans to do so. In fact, the only documented direct contact Obama’s had with any of the leaders Romney’s named was with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the multilateral Summit of the America’s in 2009. Press accounts characterize their interactions as brief. They took place on the neutral ground of Trinidad. Our ruling There is a small amount of truth in Romney's claim, but his wording exaggerates what Obama really said. When asked if he would be willing to meet with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea -- "without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else" -- Obama said he would. But in the language of diplomacy, that is significantly different than saying he "was going to visit" them, which is how Romney characterized it. We find his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15184	"Less than half of the poorest American households have a home Internet subscription."	/texas/statements/2015/aug/20/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-less-half-lowest-income-america/	This summer, Julián Castro touted actions on his watch in his first year as U.S. secretary of housing and urban development. But the former San Antonio mayor and Democratic vice presidential prospect also let it be known that work remains to be done, especially in closing the digital socio-economic divide. In an anniversary speech otherwise trumpeting anti-homelessness programs and public housing developments, Castro said: "Technology has transformed how we live, learn and work, but not everyone has been able to participate in these developments. "Less than half of the poorest American households have a home internet subscription," Castro said, which poses barriers when most college applications and job openings are handled over the web. Castro went on to describe the agency’s new ConnectHome project, which he said would accelerate broadband adoption, helping up to 200,000 children gain high-speed online access. We were curious about his "less than half" claim relating poverty and home Internet connections. Castro cites White House report Responding to our request for elaboration, Castro’s press secretary, Cameron French, emailed us a web link to a July 15, 2015, White House "fact sheet" stating that an analysis that day by the Council of Economic Advisers, which advises the president on economic policy, "illustrates that some Americans are still unable to benefit from high-speed broadband, especially America’s lower-income children." "In fact, while nearly two-thirds of households in the lowest-income quintile own a computer," the White House document said, "less than half have a home Internet subscription. While many middle-class U.S. students go home to Internet access, allowing them to do research, write papers, and communicate digitally with their teachers and other students, too many lower-income children go unplugged every afternoon when school ends. This ‘homework gap’ runs the risk of widening the achievement gap, denying hard-working students the benefit of a technology-enriched education." The council’s analysis, a 10-page report titled "Mapping the Digital Divide," said that according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey, "less than half of households headed by someone who did not graduate high school had a home Internet connection, compared to over 90 percent of households headed by a college graduate." The bureau says it annually conducts the survey to help Americans understand changes "taking place in their communities." The report also presented a chart suggesting high-income Americans widely have home Internet access: U.S. Census Bureau research Of course, Castro didn’t say he was limiting his "less than half" statement to households headed by non-high school graduates. To our follow-up email, French said the council drew on a census bureau report based on the 2013 ACS, titled "Computer and Internet Use in the United States: 2013." The bureau report cited specific questions in the survey asking if, in the household, there is access to computers, access to smartphones and a working Internet subscription. The authors then broke out the results by race, education and household income. Upshot: Slightly less than half of the lowest of five income groups — 48.4 percent of households bringing in less than $25,000 a year — reported having Internet access. Households with greater incomes reported home Internet subscription rates of 69 percent to 95 percent, the report said. Some 47.2 percent of the lowest-income households had high-speed web connections, according to the report, with higher-income households reporting high-speech connection rates of 68 percent to 95 percent. Another analysis Next, we sought other relevant research, landing a September 2013 poll of U.S. residents by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center asking adults if they used broadband Internet. Generally, Pew said, 70 percent of the surveyed residents reported broadband connections at home. But that didn’t hold across income categories. In contrast to the bureau, Pew separated annual income levels into four categories: less than $30,000, between $30,000 and $49,999, $50,000 to $74,999, and $75,000 or more. Pew said 52 percent of adults in the lowest-income group said they had broadband access at home — compared with 71 percent to 91 percent of higher-income adults. Separately, Pew said in a September 2013 web post that as of that May, 15 percent of American adults did not use the Internet or email. "Groups that are significantly more likely to rely on internet access outside the home include blacks and Hispanics, as well as adults at lower levels of income and education," Pew said. Our ruling Castro said that "less than half of the poorest American households have a home Internet subscription." About 48 percent of the nation’s poorest quintile of households--the bottom 20 percent--reported a home Internet connection in 2013. Home web access correlates with income, it appears.

pomt-07285	"The turnout on May 14th was just 7 percent -- the lowest turnout in decades."	/texas/statements/2011/may/23/randi-shade/randi-shade-says-7-percent-turnout-city-council-el/	Austin City Council Member Randi Shade discounted her second-place finish in the May 14 election, saying in a statement that she can compete with challenger Kathie Tovo, who drew 46 percent in the election. Tovo ran a few percentage points shy of outright claiming the Place 3 seat over Shade, who garnered nearly 33 percent in the four-way race. Shade’s May 17 statement continued: "The turnout on May 14 was just 7 percent -- the lowest turnout in decades." Precisely, the turnout was 7.4 percent of registered Austin voters. Nothing to brag on, but was that the lowest in decades? We checked the city’s year-by-year election summaries covering the elections since 1965. By the percentage of registered voters casting ballots--a widely accepted way to gauge participation--turnout is listed as 7 percent in May 2000 when voters acted in races for mayor and some council seats. A closer look shows 38,166 of 513,072 registered voters participated, making the actual May 2000 turnout 7.4 percent--same as this May’s turnout. We suspect the web post--7 percent--reflects a rounding down of the actual turnout percentage, which appears the case for about 20 of the election result summaries we reviewed. Shade consultant Lynda Rife said by email that the number of voters (32,869) this May was less than the number of voters in any general election since April 1965, when 21,605 voters participated, according to the campaign's figures. Fewer voters (22,094) participated in March 1975 balloting for two council seats, according to the results posted by the city. However, Austin political consultant Mark Littlefield, a Shade supporter who culled the figures relied on by Shade, told us that was a special election, which he suggested shouldn’t be compared to general elections. Rife said another gauge is comparing the number of voters to the city’s population. Some 4 percent of the population voted this time, she said, less than any other city election the campaign could find. "This number," Rife said, "seems to provide the most insight into this election." Unsaid: The general population includes many non-voters including minors and non-citizens, arguably making this metric less meaningful. So, voter turnout May 14 was about the same as in the Austin municipal general election 11 years ago. Then again, fewer voters participated in the election than in any general council election in decades. Shade’s statement rates Mostly True.

pomt-06063	Says in Newark "we’re paying 80 percent of the school budget from local property taxes."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/10/ronald-rice/ronald-rice-claims-newark-schools-are-funded-large/	It’s a slogan colonists rallied behind in the 18th century to cast off British rule: "no taxation without representation." Now, state Sen. Ronald Rice is fighting a bill known as the Urban Hope Act on the same grounds. The legislation -- which was passed the state Senate and Assembly on Monday night -- allows private entities to build and operate public schools in three cities. Camden, Jersey City and Newark were originally included in the bill, but last week Jersey City was removed and replaced with Trenton. Rice argued in a senate budget hearing on Thursday that it did not make sense to remove Jersey City -- where "school board members have the ability to make a decision, yea or nay" -- and keep Newark -- "where we have school board members that can't say nothing." The state has been in control of the Newark school district since 1995. "We've been there 16 years, but yet we have elected school board members. We're paying taxes, we're paying 80 percent of the school budget from local property taxes," said Rice, a Democrat from Essex County. "In the meanwhile, we're losing jobs, foreclosures, etcetera, and regardless of how much you minimize the risk with this private quote-unquote investor, ultimately it can come back and it will come back to haunt the local taxpayers." Are Newark taxpayers footing 80 percent of the bill for the school district? A reader asked us to check out this claim and PolitiFact New Jersey found it’s far from the truth. According to budget documents, local taxes account for 11 percent of the Newark Public Schools’ overall budget in the 2011-2012 fiscal year. State aid, grants and entitlements make up the largest portion of the district’s revenues, at nearly 80 percent. Federal aid and various other funding sources make up the rest of the budget. Rice acknowledged that the state finances the bulk of the district’s budget, saying he meant to reference the dollar amount -- "about $80 million" or more -- not the percentage, of the budget funded by local taxpayers. Of the district’s $970 million spending plan for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, local taxes account for more than $106 million. The state is funding more than $775 million through aid and grants. Still, Rice argued in an interview Monday morning that if the Urban Hope Act passed, it would effectively impose "taxation without representation, because we have no voice to say ‘yea or nay’ on the project." "If they pass the bill with Newark in it, it’s going to hurt us a long time," he said. Our ruling In a legislative hearing, Rice claimed that Newark funds "80 percent of the school budget from local property taxes." Of a $970 million budget, more than $106 million, or about 11 percent, is raised from local taxes. State aid, grants and entitlements account for most of the budget, at $775 million. That’s nearly 80 percent. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, to go NJ.com.	None	Ronald Rice	None	None	None	2012-01-10T07:30:00	2012-01-05	['Newark,_New_Jersey']
pomt-07781	Says families now pay out 40 percent of their income to taxes.	/texas/statements/2011/feb/22/phil-king/phil-king-says-40-percent-family-incomes-goes-taxe/	State Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, recently advised a newspaper in his district that the Republican-dominated Legislature won’t raise taxes to balance the 2012-13 state budget, adding that conservatives believe in "living within our means," the Jan. 13 Azle News reported. "We’re going to have to do what businesses and families do," the newspaper quoted King saying. "You don’t spend what you don’t have – and you don’t go out and borrow. We’re not the federal government." King added that families already pay out 40 percent of their income to taxes. "Taxpayers just can’t afford to pay any more," King said. Forty percent of family income goes to the tax man? Responding to our inquiry, King said: "I use the 40 percent figure because it is a safe, low estimate for the total cost of government on citizens. I believe this indisputable." King noted that according to a 2010 report by the Center for Fiscal Accountability, about 63 percent of income went to taxes that year. The center is tied to Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington group that collects pledges from officeholders not to raise taxes, King traced the higher-than-40-percent to the center’s 2010 "Cost of Government Day" report, which says the average family worked until Aug. 19 last year -- 241 days or 63 percent of the year -- to earn sufficient income to cover their share of the costs of government. In Texas, the report says, residents had to work 225 days, 62 percent of the year, to cover such expenditures. We failed to land an interview on the study methodology, but according to an online post by the center, it calculates the cost of government to include federal, state and local expenditures as well as an estimate of the cost of state and federal government regulations. The total cost of government is divided by an estimated Net National Product, the post says, to determine the percentage of national income consumed by government. The post says that a 2005 report for the U.S. Small Business Administration by W. Mark Crain, a Lafayette College economics professor, "provided the framework for determining the cost of regulations." For more expertise, we touched bases with the liberal-leaning Washington-based Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and the non-partisan Washington-based Tax Foundation. We also circled back to another study noted by King and asked a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs for her preferred approach to gauging taxes against family income. James Horney, the center’s director of federal fiscal policy, said in an interview that based on information in an appendix to President Barack Obama’s 2010 budget request, total state, local and federal government receipts accounted for 25 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product in 2009. He said, though, that families earning well above the national income median would likely have paid a greater percentage of their income in taxes. While GDP is not the same as family or personal income, Horney said, it’s a reasonable barometer of income. Horney said the share of income supporting government has been higher in the past, exceeding 30 percent in 2000 and approaching 29 percent as recently as 2007. The recent national downturn depressed tax receipts, he said. Tax Foundation spokesman Richard Morrison said by e-mail that the foundation estimates that in 2010, Americans had to work until April 9, through 27 percent of the year, to cover their state, local and federal tax burdens, though April 5 was "tax freedom day" for Texas residents. A foundation economist, Kail Padgitt, said by e-mail that the "Cost of Government Day" report stressed by King is "not an accurate measure of the taxes paid by a family because it also attempts to take into account the cost of regulation." To buttress his statement, King also pointed us to a December 2006 study by Boston University economists Laurence J. Kotlikoff and David Rapson. King singled out a table in the study estimating marginal tax rates, which Padgitt later described as the tax rates workers pay on the next dollar they earn--which are, in some cases, high enough to discourage the work from happening. In the United States’ progressive tax system, a worker’s marginal rate tends to increase with income. The BU study says: "With the exception of certain very low-earning households, we find high to very high marginal net tax rates – ranging from 24 to 45 percent." We reached Kotlikoff, who cautioned against concluding his study means that 40 percent of family income goes to taxes. "It’s another politician who doesn’t know what they’re talking about," Kotlikoff said of King’s statement. "The way he said it is wrong." Finally, we asked Shama Gamkhar, an associate professor at the LBJ School, to speak to the share of family income that goes to taxes. She said the percentage can be pegged at different levels depending on which taxes and how much of a family’s income stream is taken into account. She pointed out a March 2000 Tax Foundation report that took into account the impact on family incomes of hidden taxes such as corporate taxes, which can brake worker salaries. In 1998, the study says, taxes accounted for 39 percent of the median income in two-earner U.S. families. That was down from 41 percent in 1996, thanks to congressional adoption of tax relief, but up from 32 percent in 1975. Median income is a reasonable marker, the study says, because half of all families have incomes that exceed that of the median family and half have incomes that are less than the median family’s. "After adjusting for inflation (to 1998 dollars), the taxes paid by the two-earner family are 4.9 times greater in 1998 than in 1955," the study says. "For the one-earner family, taxes are 3.4 times greater than they were in 1955." Gamkhar also noted a table in the foundation’s 2010 "tax freedom day" report showing how the share of U.S. income that goes to taxes has escalated since 1900, when it was 6 percent, reaching 27 percent in 2010, down from 32 percent for 2001. Historical nugget: World War I more than doubled the nation’s tax burden. All told, King overstates the family income that typically goes to taxes. Even if his statement is taken as a reference solely to marginal rates--there’s no indication in the newspaper account of that--marginal rates around 2006 ran from 24 percent to 45 percent, according to the BU study. King broaches a valid point about taxes absorbing a substantial share of income. But that share approaches 30--not 40--percent. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07846	"Financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase."	/florida/statements/2011/feb/12/dick-greco/dick-greco-says-parking-expansion-didnt-raise-rate/	In his run for a fifth term as Tampa’s mayor, Dick Greco often holds up a 75-page report as proof of his track record and experience. The report, titled "Mayor Greco’s Status Report: A Report of the 1995-2002 Accomplishments and Achievements," was produced by the city in May 2002. It since has been reprinted and distributed as a paid political advertisement by Greco's campaign for mayor. In a department-by-department breakdown of projects and programs, it offers this statement on page 47 under public works: "Financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase." The expansion added capacity to the Fort Brooke garage and built three new garages, one for police headquarters and two in Ybor City. We decided to check the statement that the city managed a multimillion-dollar expansion of its parking system without increasing rates. We found that soon after Greco left office, the city had to raise rates partly to repay the debt that financed the expansion. Moreover, those debt payments are more than the parking system can repay from its own revenues, so the city is taking money from its general fund to help make bond payments. In September 1997, when Greco announced plans for a $49 million parking system expansion, the St. Petersburg Times reported that "revenue from the city's parking system would provide the money to repay the bonds, and city officials do not anticipate that the expansion would force them to raise parking rates." But the day after she was elected to replace Greco in 2003, Pam Iorio learned otherwise in a meeting with Greco and his senior staff. "That was one of the first things they said," Iorio recalled. "They said, 'You're going to have to raise parking rates.' … It was just a situation that was presented to me that it was something that had to be done." Told of the Iorio's recollection, Greco said, "I don't remember meeting with her and saying you’ve got to raise parking rates." Iorio requested a 20 percent parking rate increase in 2003, though the City Council approved less than half that. That increase was needed partly to repay the money the city borrowed in the bond market to build new garages during the Greco administration, said Bonnie Wise, the city's chief financial officer. That debt has continued to burden the city's parking fund, which is supposed to support itself, as well as the general fund, which pays for things like police, fire and parks, officials say. In 2008, the Times reported that the city said it had about $60 million in outstanding debt on parking garages, including one the city built near the Marriott Waterside Hotel in 1995. Over the years, however, the parking system has not generated enough revenue to meet its operating costs and cover its bond payments, which total about $6.5 million a year. This year, the parking division's $13.5 million in revenue would not cover its annual operating expenses of $14.2 million, let alone make the annual bond payment. The economy, of course, plays a role. Fewer workers in downtown Tampa means less revenue. To reduce expenses, Iorio has cut the number of full-time positions in the parking division from 188 to 100, and turned more to automation. The city also converted a valuable asset to cash. In 2005, it sold the parking garage on Davis Islands to Tampa General Hospital for $29 million. Of that, $6 million went into the parking division's fund balance, in essence, its reserves. The city used the other $23 million to pay down five years' worth of parking fund debt payments in advance. That decision reduced the parking debt payments from $6.5 million to $2.7 million a year from 2005 through 2010. But now that the money from the fund balance has been exhausted, and the bond payments are rising back to $6.5 million a year. To cover the parking fund's debt payments this year, the city used the money that remained in the department's fund balance, about $5.4 million, and kicked in another $1.9 million from the city's general fund, according to the city's budget. Next year, city officials expect the parking division's fund balance to be empty. That means the city will have to find an estimated $7.3 million from somewhere else, most likely the general fund, to cover the parking division's operating deficit and debt payments. The city could have decided not to sell the Davis Islands garage. On the campaign trail, Greco has noted that it was making money. But the Davis Islands garage did not make enough to cover the debt payments. In early 2005, the Times reported that its revenues exceeded expenses by $1.2 million a year, not enough to make a $6.5 million bond payment. Greco also makes a larger point that the expansion of the city's parking system was not only necessary but helped drive a broader economic expansion. Once the city bought the former SunTrust Bank building across from City Hall to serve as a police headquarters, the Police Department needed parking nearby. The expansion of the Fort Brooke garage gave the facility more revenue-generating capacity at a time when it had a long waiting list for available parking spaces. Likewise, Greco said, the Ybor City garages, one of which helped facilitate the development of the Centro Ybor retail and entertainment complex, led the way for tens of millions of dollars in other economic activity in Ybor, including the construction of the Kforce staffing company headquarters, the development of the Camden Apartments and the expansion of Hillsborough Community College's campus. One thing the Ybor City garages have not done is help the parking division's bottom line. As part of the deal to build Centro Ybor, Greco agreed to charge $1 per car for the first three hours of parking. By comparison, most other city garages charge up to $1.60 per hour. An estimated 80 percent of the cars that park in the Centro Ybor garage pay only a dollar. Meanwhile, HCC contributed land and a state grant for the garage built near its campus, and it gets to use most of the spaces in that facility for free. True, Greco said, garages cost money, but they bring the city money through economic development and increased property tax revenues. "Without parking garages, without some of the things that were done there, you could never have accomplished some of the things that were accomplished," he said. Greco makes a valid point about building parking garages to stimulate economic development. Other Tampa mayors used other garages for similar purposes. The deal to build the St. Petersburg Times Forum in downtown Tampa came together partly because the city agreed to guarantee the Tampa Bay Lightning about $1.2 million a year from the South Regional parking garage. Similarly, part of event revenues from the William F. Poe parking garage go to a capital improvement fund for the David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts. But the Greco campaign's statement that under his last administration the city "financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase" fails to mention the rate increase that took place immediately after he left office. Also, the funding problems since then can't be overlooked. They are a direct result of the expansion, so we rate this statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12198	"Russian mansions Obama seized were meant to be illegal gifts to Sasha and Malia"	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/26/blog-posting/its-fake-news-obama-seized-russian-mansions-gifts-/	Two Russian diplomats’ mansions in New York and Maryland that were seized in December as punishment for Russia’s meddling in the election made headlines again last week when Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov demanded the properties be returned. "We think that the diplomatic property must be returned without any conditions and talks," Peskov told CNN Monday. The properties have sat empty since the sanctions were imposed, but a fake news story has come up with a creative repurposing for them. A post that appeared on Newsfeedhunter.com on July 12, 2017, said that Obama seized the mansions as gifts for his daughters, Sasha and Malia. "It looks like Obummer wasn’t actually trying to punish Russia for anything after all (since there’s nothing to punish them FOR) — he was actually just trying to get a couple of free mansions for his brats while kissing up to his ignorant base of drooling libtards," the post said. The intelligence community has already confirmed that Russia meddled in the election, but even so, there’s no way Obama could have gifted the mansions to his family. The Russian properties will be held by U.S. government until the issue with Russia is resolved, according to Harley Balzer, a government and international affairs professor at Georgetown University. It would then take years to transfer ownership to anyone. "Almost 40 years after the United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran (which we have certainly not done with Russia) the Iranian embassy on Massachusetts Avenue has still not been turned over to the Obama girls for parties," said Steve Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Captions on photos of the two houses say the girls won’t be getting the mansions because President Donald Trump will return the mansions to the Russian government, but the fate of the properties hasn’t been confirmed yet, hence Peskov’s demand. "Those properties to which you refer are part of a larger dialogue with the Russian Federation," Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. "There are a whole host of issues we're discussing with the Russian Federation, but my commitment is that we will consult with you on this issue before any final implementation of an agreement that we don't have yet with the Russian Federation," Sullivan said. The source of the fake news, Newsfeedhunter.com, even admits its stories are fabrications. "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist," the disclaimer says.

pomt-04026	Says his plan to raise car registration to $56 would still leave Virginia with a fee that’s "equal to or lower than most states."	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/01/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-56-car-registration-fee-virginia-wo/	Gov. Bob McDonnell’s plan to expand revenues for transportation includes a $15 increase in the state’s car registration fee. "Right now, $41 is our average registration. This will change it to $56," McDonnell said at a Jan. 8 news conference. "This registration fee, even at an average $56, still puts us at a rate equal to or lower than most states in the country." We asked the governor’s office to back up McDonnell’s claim that, even with the 37 percent increase, Virginia’s registration fee would compare equally or favorably to most states. Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said it’s difficult to get an apples-to-apples comparison of how Virginia’s registration fee measures up to other states, because of differences among the states in how the those fees are assessed. "However, when looking at the common vehicle fees that most states use, such as vehicle license fees (registration), title fees and title taxes (sales tax), Virginia is clearly one of the lowest in our region of the country even with the proposed $15 increase," Caldwell said in an e-mail. When comparing just registration fees, Caldwell said, Virginia’s proposed new fee would still be lower than states such as Maryland, Wisconsin, Montana, Illinois, Oklahoma and Vermont. We note that McDonnell’s statement compared registration fees to "most states" in the U.S. -- not one region or group of states. The governor’s statement also specifically focused on the $41 average registration fee for a passenger car -- a standard registration cost that doesn’t include the expense of getting a title or paying the sales tax. Given the narrow focus of McDonnell’s statement, we looked at how Virginia’s basic registration fee -- assessed annually at $40.75 for vehicles up to 4,000 pounds -- would compare to other states if it were increased by $15. As Caldwell wrote, it is difficult to get an apples-to-apples comparison among all 50 states. While Virginia and 25 other states levy a uniform registration fee for cars up to a certain weight, other states use an assortment of calculations that consider factors such as a vehicle’s horsepower, selling price, weight and the year it was first registered. We examined a list of registration fees from the National Conference of State Legislatures and one compiled by the American Automobile Association. The lists show 28 other states have registration fees that are lower than the $56 annual charge McDonnell seeks for Virginia. These states either had a set rate that is lower than the proposed new fee in Virginia, or a formula that put the maximum charge for a 4,000-pound vehicles below $56. By contrast, only seven states would have higher registration fees than Virginia -- the six Caldwell mentioned in his email and Hawaii. We couldn’t come to a conclusion on how Virginia’s proposed new fee would compare to 14 other states because of variables in their formulas for computing registration costs. For example, New Jersey’s fee ranges from $35.50 to $84 based on the age and weight of the car. South Dakota’s fees range from $30 to $92, again based on how old the car is and how much it weighs while Louisiana’s registration ranges from $20 to $82 based on a vehicle’s selling price. Our ruling McDonnell said that if his proposed $56 car registration fee is approved, Virginia’s annual registration costs would still be "equal to or lower than" most states. The governor’s office, when asked, offers no proof to this claim. Information from AAA and the National Conference of State Legislatures shows the governor is wrong. Under McDonnell’s plan, Virginia’s registration would be higher than 28 states and lower than seven. The 14 other states have variables in their formulas for computing car registration fees that could result in charges that are higher or lower than the $56 McDonnell has proposed. The bottom line is that Virginia would have a higher car registration fee than most states. McDonnell’s claim has no basis and we give it our lowest rating, Pants of Fire.

pomt-12227	Shepard Smith was fired from Fox News.	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/18/blog-posting/no-fox-news-anchor-shepard-smith-did-not-punch-sea/	Fox News anchor Shepard Smith made headlines when he accused the administration of President Donald Trump of employing lies and deception to conceal the details of a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials, a Russian attorney and several others. In what the Washington Post dubbed a "Walter Cronkite moment" — a nod to the newsman of yore revered as "the most trusted man in America" for his penchant for speaking uncomfortable truths — Smith launched into a TV tirade after a week of shifting accounts about the Trump Tower meeting left the Fox News anchor exasperated. "Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean, you know?" he said to colleague Chris Wallace on July 14. "My grandmother used to say ... ‘Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.’ The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling." Now here’s where things get really weird. Several days after Smith’s on-air editorializing went viral, a website called America’s Last Line of Defense posted a story claiming Smith had been fired by Fox News for criticizing Trump. The story then takes a wild turn, claiming Smith reacted to his firing like a violent madman in the throes of a Godzilla-like meltdown during which Smith threw things across the Fox studio, kicked barrells and punched Fox News host Sean Hannity in the nose, drawing blood. There are two major problems with this story, however. First, as the screengrab below shows, the day after Smith’s supposed firing and meltdown, his hourlong Fox News show Shepard Smith Reporting aired according to its regularly scheduled time. Second, and most importantly, America’s Last Line of Defense admits it’s a satirical site with a stated mission is to draw readers, especially conservatives, into mistaking its extraordinary conspiracies for truth. "While everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway," reads the disclaimer. At least one website, American News -- which does not explicitly state its satirical intent (if it has one) -- appears to have taken the bait. As the previous work of our friends at Snopes makes clear, this is not the first time Smith has been the center of a hoax claiming he was fired from Fox News for being too controversial.

pomt-12461	"Coffee is the second-most traded commodity after oil."	/global-news/statements/2017/may/08/starbucks/no-coffee-not-second-most-traded-commodity-after-o/	Starbucks has a reputation for serving a strong cup of joe, but the ubiquitous coffee retailer’s director of public policy offered a claim on Capitol Hill that turns out to be a thin brew. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee invited Starbucks’ Kelly Goodejohn to talk about how doing well can mean doing good. A 20-year veteran of the coffee trade, Goodejohn had some key points for the senators. "Coffee is grown in challenging regions, often with war-torn pasts, but we have seen coffee as a stabilizing force that provides prosperity and economic stability," she said. Coffee, Goodejohn said, is a big economic deal. "Coffee is the second-most traded commodity after oil, and 25 million farmers around the world rely on income generated from growing coffee," she said. Holy latte! We’ve all seen coffee take off in America, but are those beans really the other black gold? We decided to check Goodejohn’s ranking of oil and coffee. The hard numbers show her statement has been provably incorrect for about as long as Goodejohn has been in the business. Comparing the goods Part 1: Market size Since oil comes in barrels and coffee beans in 60 kilogram sacks, you can’t just stack them side by side. So the most obvious comparison is the dollar value of the world market for each. The United Nations trade statistics branch estimated the oil export market at $788 billion in 2015. The estimate for aluminum was $106 billion, for copper $104 billion, and iron ore and concentrates $67 billion. Calculating the world market for coffee is a little trickier because the United Nations trade data lumps coffee in with other products that contain even just a trace of coffee, such as powdered mixes. With help from John Baffes, senior economist at the World Bank’s Development Prospects Group, we estimated the size of the coffee export market at about $19 billion. (We got the amount of coffee sold from the International Coffee Organization and the average price per kilogram from the World Bank. Baffes confirmed our math.) The Starbucks press office pointed to a report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development that estimated the total market at $23 billion. The keen observer will note that the coffee market is about one-fourth as large as the markets for aluminum and copper, and also less than the market in iron ore. But what about other agricultural products? Based on sales data from the U.S. Agriculture Department and the World Bank’s price data, the world market for wheat was $29 billion and for soybeans, $57 billion. Both beat out coffee. Baffes, who co-authored a report on global commodity markets in 2000, said the claim about coffee being second only to oil is old news. "This used to be the case back in 1970," Baffes said. "However, later grains and metals overtook coffee." In that 2000 report, coffee ranked 15th, bested by, among others, hardwood logs, bananas and gold. Over the years, there have been several efforts to correct the record. Science writer Mark Pendergrast included the errant claim in his 1999 book Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World. Ten years later, he wrote a correction (and fixed the error in the second edition). "I was wrong, and so is everyone else who keeps repeating this myth," he wrote in 2009. Voices in the coffee industry itself have also tried to rebut the claim. At one time, coffee represented the second-most valuable commodity exported by developing countries, but there’s no evidence that’s still the case. Comparing the goods Part 2: Futures trading When we asked the Starbucks organization for the source behind Goodejohn’s claim, the press office suggested we look at a webpage on commodities trading. The site is a consumer guide to investing in commodities, and it said, "Coffee is the most traded commodity after oil." This seemed to suggest that Starbucks had another yardstick in mind -- the number or value of coffee contracts bought and sold by investors. In other words, we shouldn’t measure the amount of actual coffee or costs, but the bets on coffee prices. We found several similar websites that repeat the claim, such as Investorguide.com, Economics.help and a Kenyan-based training group called Institute of Trade Development. None of these sites say how they reached this conclusion. In contrast, the Futures Industry Association, a reliable source of commodity trading data, posts annual data. In its 2016 survey of the number of contracts traded, soybeans and rapeseed meal (or canola meal) top the list of the 20 highest volume-traded agricultural contracts. Coffee contracts don’t show up in the top 20. Coffee Co-mission, a group of small coffee roasters based in Winston-Salem, N.C., went through this comparison in 2015 and found that among commodities "whether the measure is by quantity or value, coffee does not even make the top 100." Pendergrast said, "I don't think that this urban coffee myth has ever been true, regardless of how you look at it." Our ruling A Starbucks executive said coffee is the second-most traded commodity after oil. We examined it two ways, and the statement failed on both. The markets for several commodities including soybeans, wheat, aluminum, copper and iron ore are larger than the coffee market -- in some cases, four times larger. The statistic also falls short in terms of the commodity contracts traded by investors. Both the number of coffee contracts traded and the value of contracts are much lower than for many other commodities. This claim has been challenged since 2000 by economists, journalists and voices in the coffee industry. But it still found its way into a congressional hearing despite being very, very wrong.

pomt-03862	The Legislature needs to spend $500 million to "shore up" the pension fund this year and the next 28 years to keep it "afloat."	/florida/statements/2013/mar/11/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-says-floridas-pension-fund-needs-/	Florida’s retirement system is not sustainable or modern, House Speaker Will Weatherford warned on the opening day of the annual legislative session. "This session, we will spend $500 million of general revenue just to shore up our pension fund," he said on March 5, 2013. "That’s above and beyond what we contribute to state employees’ retirement. And it’s just the down payment. We’re going to have to keep writing that check of a half a billion dollars for the next 28 years to keep our so called ‘great pension system’ afloat." Weatherford is proposing an overhaul of the state’s retirement system during the 2013 legislative session. He wants the only option for new public employees to be the 401(k)-like investment plan, which is less popular than the pension plan. Doing so will keep the fund, recently valued at $132 billion, in good health for the long-term without burdening taxpayers, he says. We thought it prudent to check out his claim about how much the Legislature needs to spend to "shore up" the pension fund. Is it really about to capsize? The pension fund ain’t what it used to be Fast facts about the pension plan: It’s the fifth largest in the country, with about 1 million current and retired participants. State government workers comprise only about 20 percent of active members, trailing school district employees (48 percent) and county employees (22 percent). About 1,000 different public agencies and groups participate. The pension fund was in the black from 1998 to 2008, earning billions more in investment returns than what was needed to pay out retirement benefits to workers. Then the stock market went thud, and the fund’s surplus disappeared. For the past four years, the pension fund assets have not been enough to cover what it would owe current and future beneficiaries if all retired at once. The gap between assets and liabilities has grown to $19.3 billion as of July 2012. (Nerd alert: the $19.3 billion shortfall is called the unfunded actuarial liability, or UAL.) The pension fund is 86.9 percent funded. Advocates of public workers, such as Democrats and labor unions, have honed in on that point to counter Weatherford’s argument that the fund is in financial jeopardy. They say it’s not realistic to think all current and future beneficiaries will somehow require retirement benefits at once. They say Florida’s underfunded status is still above the national average of 75 percent and above the funding level widely considered healthy at 80 percent. Only Wisconsin’s retirement system is 100 percent funded, our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin found. Still, the Legislature’s fiscal conservatives are focused on pension reform. In 2011, they passed a sweeping law requiring employees to contribute 3 percent of their pay for retirement benefits. Fill the gap? State lawmakers expect a small budget surplus this year, but it’s not going to be nearly enough to close the pension fund’s liability gap in one fell swoop. To close the gap, actuaries and state economists have prescribed a payment plan that works kind of like a 30-year mortgage. Experts have recommended the state spend $537 million in the 2013-14 budget on the unfunded liability. Of that, $448 million would come from general revenue, according to a three-year financial outlook prepared by the Legislative Office of Economic and Demographic Research. (The House revised the general revenue estimate to $497 million in December.) This is what Weatherford is talking about when he says the state needs to pay this much to "shore up" the fund. So if the Legislature chooses to include the recommended amount to start plugging the pension hole in the budget -- and for the past three years, they did not -- it would be about $500 million this year. Weatherford mentioned this was "above and beyond" what the state pays to the retirement fund for its employees. According to the Florida House, that is expected to be $296.5 million based on current contribution rates. Universities, state colleges and school boards will add another $650 million. Preparing for the future Will the state fork over a half-billion dollars for the next 28 years, as Weatherford says? The simple answer: We don’t really know. The value of the pension fund shifts with market volatility. In 2007, it was valued at $136.3 billion. In 2009, it was $99.6 billion. At the end of 2012, it was $122.7 billion. In theory, the market could rebound and Florida could pay off its unfunded liability with extra earnings, as it did in the past. As the market changes, the liability could shrink or inflate. David Draine, a senior research analyst at the Pew Center for the States, said while it’s reasonable to tout projections for financing the unfunded liability, it’s helpful to also point out how much those projections could shift with the market. Alan Stonecipher, director of Florida Retirement Security Coalition, which is comprised of union groups, said, "To make an assumption 29 years out based on a snapshot of today doesn’t really hold water." Union representatives criticized Weatherford’s statement for leaving out a few key points about the pension’s growing unfunded liability. For one, Weatherford didn’t include how the Republican-led Legislature did little to address the unfunded liability over the last three years by not making full payments on it. He also didn’t mention that when the pension was overfunded, lawmakers spent the surplus by reducing employer contribution rates and increasing benefits for special-risk employees. The pension fund would have been in a better position to weather the economic downturn had they not made those choices, Stonecipher said. Stonecipher also took issue with Weatherford’s choice of words in describing the pension fund as needing to be kept "afloat." That makes it sound like the pension fund is on the brink of going under without this payment. Putting off full payments on the pension fund's liability gap is a bit like people who pay only the minimum due on a credit card bill. "It doesn’t immediately put you into insolvency or bankruptcy, but it does push that bill off into the future and ensures that when it does come due, the eventual payment will be even larger," Draine said. Our ruling Weatherford uses an accurate number to describe the cost of addressing the pension fund’s unfunded actuarial liability -- based on current estimates. But he loses points for holding this figure up as how much the state will affirmatively pay each year for the next 28 years. That’s based on predictions that could shift, for better or worse, depending in large part due to market performance. On that note, Weatherford’s comments on the need for big reform make no mention of the fact that the pension fund was in a surplus for the better part of the 21st century. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition of Half True.

pomt-02851	The United States "has never been richer, if you look at per capita GDP."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/18/jan-schakowsky/schakowsky-said-based-gdp-capita-united-states-has/	As congressional Democrats and Republicans sit down for high-stakes budget talks, the rhetoric has flown furiously to familiar territory. Republicans want cuts and reforms to entitlement programs, while Democrats insist that revenue must be on the table, too. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., made the case for the latter in an interview on MSNBC on Nov. 12, 2013. "This country has never been richer, if you look at per capita GDP," she said. "It doesn't feel that way when you hear about austerity and we have to cut this and we have to cut that. It's because the income inequality is greater than it has ever been." We wondered if she was correct. The numbers don’t lie Schakowsky’s office sent us figures from the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to those numbers, the GDP per capita, when adjusted for inflation, hit $45,633 this year, which surpassed the previous high of $45,360, which was set in 2007 prior to the most recent recession. It was barely higher, but higher all the same. (The government defines the GDP — gross domestic product — as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country.) We were curious how the data was calculated, so we contacted Mathew Shane, an economist with the USDA who put the figures together. He told us that the 2013 number was partially based on a projection, since the year is not yet completed. But if that projection is borne out, he said, then GDP per capita will be at its highest level ever. "It’s close," Shane said. "We hit a peak in 2007 when the crisis hit. There’s been no income growth in real terms since 2007. The difference between (2007 and 2013) is a very modest difference. We, essentially, finally regained what we were in 2007. I guess we could say we’re projected to be slightly better than we were in 2007." If "I guess" doesn’t sound definitive enough, we also sought out another source: the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the government agency that calculates the nation’s GDP. The bureau’s analysis also backs up Shane’s findings. By the second quarter of this year, GDP per capita had surpassed 2007 levels. "The third quarter of 2013 is the highest on record," said Thomas Dail, spokesman for the bureau. Finally, GDP per capita, even when adjusted for inflation, has gone up and up for more than a century. In other words, Schakowsky could have said what she said at virtually any given point during the last 150 years and had a pretty good chance of being right. Our ruling Schakowsky said, "This country has never been richer, if you look at per capita GDP." We found that GDP has trended upward throughout much of America's history and the current level is only slightly higher than pre-recession levels. But the numbers show Schakowsky is right.

pomt-02918	"On day one, six people were able to sign up" for health insurance through the federal marketplace.	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/03/jan-crawford/cbss-crawford-says-6-people-signed-obamacares-firs/	The failed launch of the Obamacare website healthcare.gov continued to draw plenty of attention Nov. 3, 2013, on the Sunday morning talk shows. Jan Crawford, CBS legal correspondent, said the website’s collapse stood out even more in light of the hype that led up to the opening day. "With great fanfare they pointed to that date," Crawford said on Face the Nation. "They had health care clinics across the country signing people up for appointments that day to get people in for this promise of affordable health care. On day one, six people were able to sign up." We wondered, was it true that just six people were able to successfully enroll in plans offered through the federal insurance marketplace created as part of the new health care law? That’s what we’ll look into. For the most part, Crawford got it right. The figure of six people comes from documents released by the House committee investigating the failed rollout of Obamacare. The documents are copies of notes taken by staff at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency in charge of the website project. At the top of the notes are the words "War room." They were written two and three days after the site opened for business on Tuesday, Oct. 1. An entry from a meeting on Wednesday morning said "six enrollments have occurred so far." By the end of the second day, the notes reported 248 people had signed up and about 40,000 applications were pending. A spokesperson for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department told reporters that these were not official numbers and that people could also enroll through other means, including filling out paper applications. Some states are also operating their own insurance marketplaces. Joanne Peters, Health and Human Services spokeswoman, told Bloomberg that by the last week of October, about 700,000 people had submitted applications, with about half coming through the federal marketplace and half coming through the states. There were ongoing issues with sending enrollment information to insurance companies, Peters said. Official numbers might be released by mid November. Our ruling Crawford said that only six people had been able to sign up on the first day of open enrollment for the federal health insurance marketplace. That fits with the internal notes released by the House committee. But those were initial numbers and there is some possibility that other people could have enrolled without using the website. Official numbers are not available. With that caveat, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Jan Crawford	None	None	None	2013-11-03T14:24:12	2013-11-03	['None']
pomt-10931	If a lawsuit backed by Josh Hawley succeeds, "nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/26/missouri-democratic-party/would-25-million-missourians-lose-health-coverage-/	In the closely watched U.S. Senate race in Missouri, Democrats have been going on offense over health care coverage. In a July 17 tweet, the Missouri Democratic Party trumpeted a lawsuit that was co-signed by Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley, who’s challenging the Democratic incumbent, Claire McCaskill. The Missouri Democratic Party tweeted, "Instead of defending vulnerable Missourians, @HawleyMO is putting them at risk. If his lawsuit succeeds, nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage—raising premiums for families across the state. #MOSen." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The lawsuit, filed in a U.S. district court in Texas on Feb. 26, 2018, was signed by 18 attorneys general and two governors, all of them Republicans. The suit challenges the Affordable Care Act, arguing that "the ACA is unlawful" and seeking to enjoin, or block, its operation. If the plaintiffs’ wishes are granted by the courts, then insurance companies would be able to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. So the tweet raises a genuine issue. However, we wondered whether the state party’s estimate of "nearly 2.5 million Missourians" was accurate. Could that many Missouri residents really "lose their health care coverage" if the lawsuit succeeds? Not really. The tweet relied on one estimate. However, it’s not the only estimate out there -- and the other ones are lower. Buckle up for a wonky ride! Where does the 2.5 million figure come from? When we checked with the Missouri Democratic Party, they pointed to a report published in April 2017 by the liberal Center for American Progress. The group found that 2,495,800 Missourians are living with a pre-existing condition. This estimate leveraged the data in a broader study released by the Department of Health and Human Services in the waning days of the Obama administration. That study found that nationally up to 51 percent of non-elderly Americans have a pre-existing condition. (Americans age 65 and over are covered by Medicare, so they were excluded from the count.) Using Census data, the Center for American Progress took the HHS numbers and devised estimates for every state and congressional district. So the tweet used a real number, and one that experts said was legitimate. However, it’s not the only estimate out there -- and the other ones are lower. For starters, the HHS study itself offered two definitions for "pre-existing condition," and of those, the Center for American Progress chose the broader estimate. HHS’s broader estimate tallied "common health conditions … that could have resulted in denial of coverage, exclusion of the condition, or higher premiums for individuals seeking individual market coverage" before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. By contrast, the narrower definition used by HHS only included conditions that would cause an applicant to be "outright rejected for coverage by private insurers." The difference between the two estimates is not trivial. Under the narrow definition, HHS found, 23 percent of non-elderly Americans nationally have a pre-existing condition, while under the broad definition, 51 percent of non-elderly Americans do. That’s more than double. Meanwhile, another independent estimate, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, mirrored HHS’ narrower definition. The Kaiser estimate produced a figure for Missouri of about 1.1 million people. Emily Gee, the Center for American Progress health economist who worked on the report, said her group chose to highlight the broad definition "because without the ACA’s protections, people with pre-existing conditions may not be able to obtain comprehensive coverage if they ever needed to turn to the individual market because they could be rejected, be offered plans that exclude essential benefits, or be priced out of the market." Why the tweet’s wording is misleading Outside experts we contacted said that the Center for American Progress estimate has value. But they added that the tweet is a bit misleading in how it describes the group’s numbers. First, while the tweet said that 2.5 million Missourians "could lose their health care coverage," it would be more accurate to say that 2.5 million Missourians could either lose their health care coverage, or be forced into an exclusion (which would eliminate coverage for that condition, but not all coverage entirely), or see a rise in premiums. Each of these is a problematic outcome for patients, but they are not all identical to losing health care entirely, as the tweet framed it. Second, a large fraction of people with pre-existing conditions are insured through an employer or through Medicaid, meaning that they could not be denied coverage immediately after the lawsuit became successful and changed the law, said Christine Eibner, a senior economist specializing in health policy with the Rand Corp. Someone who currently has employer coverage or Medicaid would have to lose their existing coverage first even to be considered at risk for losing out due to the lawsuit. If they lost their current coverage and couldn’t find other employer or government coverage, they would have to turn to the individual market. Only then could the lawsuit potentially have an impact on their insurance options. And that could play out over years, not immediately. The percentage of Missourians facing a more immediate risk to their coverage -- those who are already in the individual market for health insurance -- is about one-fifth as large as the figure cited in the tweet. According to the most recent figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 467,500 people in Missouri were insured on the non-group market -- the market that the Affordable Care Act opened access to, and, where the possibility of being denied or facing higher premiums for pre-existing conditions is the most acute. That’s only 8 percent of Missouri’s population. "It’s not right to say that the change leads to an immediate loss of coverage for 2.5 million people," said Linda Blumberg, a health policy fellow with the Urban Institute. "As with all these sound bites, they are a little loose with their wording for a wonk’s taste." Our ruling The Missouri Democratic Party said that if a lawsuit backed by Hawley succeeds, "nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage." That figure represents the larger of two credible estimates. The alternative estimate is sizable -- 1.1 million people -- but it’s less than half as large as the figure cited in the tweet. In addition, the tweet’s description is incomplete. In reality, the 2.5 million figure includes people who would face premium increases and coverage exclusions, not just those who would lose coverage outright. It also encompasses many people who currently have employer-based coverage or Medicaid -- people who would not be at immediate risk of fallout from a successful lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act.

pomt-10487	"He took on special interests and won, passing the toughest ethics law yet."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/14/barack-obama/obama-not-driving-force/	In a renewed attempt to cement his credentials as an agent of change who's not beholden to special interests, Sen. Barack Obama highlighted his role in the 2007 congressional ethics debate in one of three TV ads he aired in advance of Pennsylvania's April 22 Democratic primary. The ad, called "Toughest," first aired on March 21. It depicts Obama as the protagonist of the overhaul of lobbying and ethics rules that became law last August after Democratic leaders made it a top priority following the 2006 midterm election that returned them to power. "He took on special interests and won, passing the toughest ethics law yet," an announcer intones, over still pictures of Obama interspersed with snippets of headlines and quotes from coverage of the debate from the Chicago Tribune and Washington Post. Obama has boasted about his accomplishments on ethics reform before; we've ruled that he overstated his influence on the legislation in the past. In addition, we have examined his legislative record . This new ad both exaggerates the role Obama played in the debate and fails to put the new ethics law in context. First, a little background. The lobbying and ethics overhaul was born in the aftermath of the Jack Abramoff political corruption scandal, which triggered calls for change in the legislative process. The new legislation was designed to give the public more information about the work of lobbyists and their political fundraising efforts while slowing down the revolving door from Capitol Hill to K Street, the heart of Washington's lobbying industry. The most noteworthy provisions require more reporting about the way lobbyists bundle contributions to presidential and congressional campaigns, and double to two years the "cooling off" period between the time a lawmaker leaves office and when he or she may lobby members of Congress or their employees. (A similar prohibition was put in place on senior executive branch personnel, up to the vice president.) The new law also requires the disclosure of members' so-called earmarks or spending requests in legislation. While it's true that Obama played an important role in the debate, credit for passing the law really goes to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who devised the procedural approach to finalizing the package and, in the process, did an end-run around holdout Republicans. Reid and Pelosi informally negotiated a compromise package, then had the House call up and pass an amended version of a Senate ethics bill, which the Senate then cleared and sent to President Bush. Obama had little to do with these machinations, which, to be fair, are usually the preserve of senior party leaders and committee chairmen, who control each chamber's agenda. Obama did join with Republicans who wanted stronger rules for disclosing earmarks in spending bills. He tried to set an example for his colleagues by releasing a lengthy list of funding requests he asked to be included in annual appropriations bills. In fact, Obama's advocacy is believed to have emboldened some other Democrats to vote for the Republican provision that was approved. Obama also successfully collaborated with Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., on a provision that required senators to make full reimbursement for the market rate of corporate jet flights. Under old rules, senators flying on a corporate jet reimbursed their benefactors for the cost of a first-class commercial flight on the same route. In some cases, that meant paying $2,000 for a private jet flight that actually may have cost upwards of $20,000 per seat. The proposal was incorporated into a broader package of reforms. Obama might take credit for staring down special interests and winning on those two issues. But he failed in another effort to create an independent ethics counsel to probe allegations against senators. Under the proposal, such an investigator could not bring charges against a lawmaker but would turn over probe results to the Senate Ethics Committee for a disposition. The idea did not go over well with many veteran lawmakers and institutionalists, who bristled at the concept that an outsider would be involved in investigating a chamber that prides itself in its self-policing tradition. As for Obama's claim that the 2007 statute is the "toughest ethics law yet," it's a phrase he takes directly from an editorial that appeared in the Washington Post, though it's hard to tell if the editorial is referring to the law as historically significant or simply the best proposal to come out of Congress during that session. Many experts say the jury remains out, and that it will be up to regulatory bodies such as the Federal Election Commission to decide how stringently to enforce the new rules. While the law may have been the most all-encompassing package of ethics changes since the post-Watergate reforms, it has to be viewed in the context of the seemingly never-ending pattern of scandal and reform that pervades Washington. Each round of new rules begets new problems. Consider that the political action committees (PACs) that exert such influence today came into being after Congress limited contributions from individuals, unions and corporations in the 1970s. This latest ethics law mimicked the intent and scope of a 1978 law – enacted after President Richard Nixon was driven from office by Watergate and after Congress was rocked by a pair of ethics scandals involving defense contractors and the South Korean government – that mandated annual financial disclosure forms. And in 1989, Congress used a revamping of the congressional pay raise process to to ban public speaking fees for House members and gradually reduce them for senators. The law also prohibited lawmakers from keeping excess campaign funds when they left office and ban members of Congress from lobbying in the legislative branch for a year after leaving office. Then in the early 1990s, Republicans used public disgust over scandals involving the House bank and post office to indict the Democratic majority as the party of corruption and win a landslide in the 1994 elections. GOP leaders resisted major changes in law, however, until rank-and-file members from both parties pressed for enactment of a lobbyist registration requirement and House and Senate resolutions restricting gifts. The ad cites a Washington Post editorial that calls the 2007 law "the strongest ethics legislation to emerge from Congress yet." And the editorial credits Reid as the key player, with help from Feingold and Obama. Still, Obama exaggerates his role in the ethics debate, and his depiction of the 2007 lobbying and ethics overhaul omits significant historical context. We rule his claim to be Half-True.

pomt-12664	"USAID put $8 billion up and attracted more than $45 billion in a public-private partnership called Power Africa."	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/21/david-perdue/sen-perdue-touts-us-power-program-africa/	President Donald Trump’s budget outline is just the starting point for debate, but the cuts he’s seeking in foreign aid are among the deepest for any government activity. Under his plan, overall spending for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) would fall by about 28 percent. Congress controls the purse strings, of course, and in the Senate, David Perdue, R- Ga., likes at least one foreign assistance program. "USAID put $8 billion up and attracted more than $45 billion in a public-private partnership called Power Africa," Perdue told NBC News on March 1 (before the budget outline was released). Perdue cited Power Africa as an example of how well the public-private approach could work to finance infrastructure in America. Power Africa is the signature development project of President Barack Obama. Unveiled in 2013, the goal is to double access to power in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030. With America playing the role of cheerleader and financier, Obama hoped to leverage money from private firms and other governments to build new power plants, transmission lines and small solar power generators to reach millions of people. Perdue used the example of Power Africa to buttress the value of public-private partnerships in the context of funding infrastructure construction in America. Our focus is simply on whether Power Africa racked up the numbers that he offered. It sort of did, and it sort of didn’t. The difference lies in the gap between money promised versus money committed to specific projects. Perdue’s office pointed to the exit memo of Obama’s USAID administrator Gayle Smith. She wrote, "The United States’ initial $7 billion commitment has mobilized more than $54 billion in commitments from the public and private sectors, including more than $40 billion in commitments from private sector partners." So give or take a few billion, Perdue’s statement was in line with Smith’s summary. Both the U.S. and the private sector amounts were less than he said, but in the ballpark. The real question is, what is a "commitment?" Todd Moss, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington who specializes in Africa and energy development, told us a commitment is a fairly open-ended term. "A commitment is a pledge from the United States that they will spend money in a certain area," Moss said. "It doesn't mean the money will be appropriated, and even if it is appropriated, that will be spent." And the same holds true on the other side. "These are funds private companies say they will invest, but they might not," Moss said. "These are high-risk commercial ventures. I would be shocked if everything that gets talked about happens. The fact that they are trying to do new things in difficult places is the whole point of the program." Setting "commitments" aside, a more demanding measure looks at the actual dollars the United States has tied up in projects that are moving forward. The USAID press office provided harder numbers. The total the United States has spent, loaned or guaranteed so far is about $2.8 billion. That money helped get $14 billion worth of projects underway. How does that compare to Perdue’s figures? He said $8 billion leveraged $45 billion, or a ratio of about 1 to 5.6. The current ratio ($2.8 billion to $14 billion) is about 1 to 5. Not quite as good but fairly close. These numbers only reveal so much. The American role can vary a lot, Moss said. In some cases, a bit of technical guidance is the linch pin. In others, multi-million dollar loans and loan guarantees are key. The influence of the United States across all projects can be tough to generalize. To take just one example, construction of a $900 million 450 MW plant in Nigeria got underway in early 2016 with backing from "20 international banks and equity funders." A $58 million loan from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation was part of the package. (It’s worth noting that most loans are repaid, so over time, American taxpayers get that money back.) Moss said Power Africa can’t take full credit for every power plant but he does think it can take some. "When you look at the number of actors who have jumped in, and are now working on energy deals, that would be a heck of a coincidence," Moss said. "They (USAID) deserve credit for motivating a lot of investment in the energy sector." Our ruling Perdue said the USAID Power Africa program put $8 billion up and attracted more than $45 billion in outside money. Perdue’s figures represent commitments, not hard money spent. USAID reported $7 billion committed and $54 billion promised from all other sources, with over $40 billion of that coming from the private sector. Actual expenditures are at about the same ratio, however, and experts generally say the Power Africa program is creating investment in Africa’s energy sector. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08884	"There's nothing in the voting instructions that we've been getting in the last several elections that lets you know" about the limitations of the master lever.	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/02/catherine-taylor/taylor-says-voters-havent-been-adequately-informed/	There's a lot of confusion over the master lever in Rhode Island general elections, in part because nobody seems able to clearly explain how it works. For the uninitiated, the master lever is actually a space on the ballot that, if filled in, automatically casts votes for all candidates of a particular party. (The phrase comes from the days of voting machines when there was actually a big lever voters could pull to make a straight-party-line vote.) It's typically used by about 20 percent of voters and three times more often among Democrats than Republicans, which reflects the ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans in the state. Reform groups don't like the lever because they want people to vote for each candidate, not a party. All of the candidates for governor support eliminating it, and Robert Healey, running as an independent for lieutenant governor, has filed a federal lawsuit challenging it. In discussions of the master lever in recent weeks, we've heard some misleading statements, including from incumbent Secretary of State Ralph Mollis, about how the master lever works. Some could be interpreted to mean that if you use the master lever and then vote for a candidate of another party, all your master lever votes will be lost. Holy disenfranchisement! On WHJJ's Helen Glover Show, Republican Catherine Taylor, who is running for Mollis' job, offered one of the better explanations we've heard and argued that information about the quirks of the master lever should be listed on the ballot But then Taylor said there's a reason people don't understand the issue: "No one tells them. There's nothing in the voting instructions that we've been getting in the last several elections that lets you know." First, with some candidates giving the impression that the master lever robs you of some votes, here are the key points you need to know: 1.) If you just mark the master lever and then put your ballot in the scanner, all members of the party you choose get a vote. 2.) However, if there are nonpartisan races on the ballot, none of those candidates will receive your vote. You have to mark them separately. 3.) The same is true for any referendum questions. 4.) If you use the master lever, you can still vote for candidates outside the party. Thus, if you mark the master lever for Party A, you can still vote for members of Party B or Party C in individual races. The computer ignores your master lever selection in those races. Voting outside Party A does not negate all your master-lever votes, only the ones you want it to. 5.) There's an important exception. In some local races, voters are offered more than one choice. You may be asked to select, for example, three members for the School Committee, and there could be up to three people from each party to choose from. In that case, if there are three candidates from Party A and you use the Party A master lever, all three will get your vote. But if you chose just one candidate from Party B, none of the School Committee candidates from Party A will get your vote. After all, the computer has no way of knowing which two of the three Party A candidates you favor. Thus, you must indicate the two Party A candidates you want for that contest. Your Party A votes are unaffected for other races, according to Chris Barnett, Secretary of State Mollis' communications director, who said the system is repeatedly tested just before each election to make sure the votes in such races are divvied up correctly. How do we know this? We checked with Mollis' office and Barnett to confirm how the machines are programmed. More to the point, we got copies of voter handbooks, mailed to all registered voters by the secretary of state's office, going back to the 1998 election, the first year the electronic scanners were put in place. It turns out that the early instructions failed to emphasize all the quirks people needed to know if they used the master lever. But beginning in 2002, the handbook instructions became quite clear. We asked Taylor's campaign about her claim. It responded by acknowledging that the handbooks are useful documents, but that information "does not reach every voter . . . not every voter reads the handbook, and it is difficult to reach voters with no fixed address. They are not a reliable way of telling voters the critical point: that their votes may not count if they pull the master lever." The Taylor campaign went even further in a July 26 press release, which said that voters need to be warned that "by choosing the master lever, they will not be able to cast a vote in many nonpartisan or multi-choice local races." That's dead wrong. In fact they can vote and their votes always count, with only one exception -- when a voter goes outside the party in contests where you can make more than one choice, they have to take extra care to mark the party members they want for that particular office. Taylor makes a good point when she says the master-lever issues should be addressed on each ballot or in polling places. But her contention that the issues have not been addressed in the voting instructions of the last several elections turns out to be dead wrong as well. A candidate running for secretary of state should know that, so we give her a False.	None	Catherine Taylor	None	None	None	2010-08-02T00:01:00	2010-07-27	['None']

pomt-11850	Charles Francis "vows to slash funding for parks and open space."	/north-carolina/statements/2017/nov/06/nancy-mcfarlane/raleigh-mayor-my-opponent-vows-slash-park-funding/	Charles Francis has campaigned on the idea that Raleigh leaders aren’t paying enough attention to the city’s neediest. He’s said that Mayor Nancy McFarlane and other council members seem more enthusiastic about big projects, like building a new City Hall or planning Dix Park, than they are about providing more affordable housing or helping poor residents find jobs. This has prompted McFarlane, the three-term incumbent who’s in a runoff against Francis, to defend those projects. The city purchased the 308-acre Dix property from the state in 2014 for $52 million with the goal of transforming it into a destination park that people could walk to from downtown Raleigh. The deal is one of McFarlane’s proudest accomplishments. So perhaps it’s no surprise that she has cast Francis as someone who "opposed" the project, which she claimed in a recent debate. A campaign mailer she paid for goes a step further, saying Francis "vows to slash funding for parks and open space." Francis denies McFarlane’s claim, which implies that he has promised deep cuts. We caught up with him on the campaign trail on Nov. 4, where he called it a "flat-out lie." "I have never said that I would cut spending," Francis said. "What I’ve said is that park spending needs to be equitable." So we asked McFarlane’s campaign advisors, Perry Woods and James Sonneman, if they have evidence to support the claim on the mailer. What McFarlane says Woods pointed to Francis’ comments on Aug. 15, when both candidates attended the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum at Martin Street Baptist Church. Francis can be heard describing Dix Park as "tangential" and saying the city "can't be distracted by bike lanes and more parks." "Charles Francis has said several times that Dix Park is peripheral to the city and that money should be moved away from parks, like Dix, and into affordable housing and transit," Woods said. "That is not supporting Dix Park or the park system in general." Woods provided a link to a Sept. 14 News & Observer story about the mayoral candidates. Francis is quoted as saying the city has the wrong priorities. "That’s been the real conflict I’ve had with these pseudo-liberal Democrats," Francis said. "What’s important to them is bike lanes and parks and that kind of thing. What we have in mind is more basic." He also provided a link to an Oct. 8 N&O story, in which Francis’ position is summarized this way: The city should stop spending so much money on things like parks and downtown revitalization and focus on public transit and social services, such as mental health care. PolitiFact pointed out to Woods and McFarlane's other advisor, James Sonneman, that those examples don’t provide evidence of Francis "vowing to slash funding" for parks and open space. "Of course, no politician will spell out what their positions would do explicitly," Sonneman replied. "It is the same idea as when a politician like (U.S. House Speaker) Paul Ryan discusses entitlement reform, he doesn't explicitly state that he plans to cut medicare benefits, but taking the position that we need to stop spending so much money on a program means that cuts would be involved." It's one thing to be critical of government spending. But it's another to vow or promise to do something. We decided to review Francis’ statements in news stories, campaign materials and video footage to see what he said about Dix Park and parks funding in general. Did he make any promises? Other Francis statements Most recently, Francis was quoted on his stance on Oct. 28 in a News & Observer story. The writer describes Francis’ belief this way: that the fanfare surrounding Dix Park has distracted the city from attending to more basic services and needs, including smaller parks in Southeast Raleigh. Francis is critical of the city's decision to hire a New York-based firm to design the park instead of a local company. "Access to housing, transportation, jobs and education — the basic city services — are more important than bike lanes and parks," Francis is quoted saying. In a televised debate on Oct. 20, McFarlane accused Francis of opposing Dix Park early in his campaign. Francis responded by saying he supports Dix Park but wants to make the planning process more inclusive. "I believe in parks. But parks are not as important as good jobs with high pay and access to housing in terms of people’s quality of life." He continued: "We need to be concerned not about people who are going to be in Raleigh 50 years from now but about people who are in Raleigh right now and improving their quality of life." A story by Indyweek quoted Francis when he announced his plan to call for a runoff: He favors the development of the Dix Park, but not to the detriment of other city parks. "It's not acceptable to put all of our focus on Dix Park and neglect other parks," Francis said. A video posted on his campaign website is titled, "I support Dix Park – and equity for all of Raleigh." In it, he said he supports the Dix Park planning process but notes that other parks haven’t gotten the same attention and have only received partial funding for upgrades throughout the years. "Equity requires that we put just as much attention on our other parks as we do on Dix Park," he said. "Even more, the city has to put Dix Park in its proper priority. As nice as it’s going to be to have Dix Park as a thriving central park 50 years from now, Raleigh must right now — not two years from now — increase access to housing, preserve existing affordable housing and build new affordable housing." In an Indyweek questionnaire, Francis makes no mention of funding for Dix Park or other parks. Our ruling McFarlane’s mailer says Francis "vows to slash funding for parks and open space." Francis has certainly been critical of the city’s enthusiasm for Dix Park and bike lanes. But, as far as we can tell, he’s made no promises to cut the parks budget. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00549	The Islamic State "just built a hotel in Syria."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-isis-built-hotel-syria/	Donald Trump is facing a lot of competition these days. The Republican real estate mogul announced he’s running for president -- against at least a dozen other candidates. In his June 16 announcement speech, Trump said he also has a new competitor in the hotel biz: a group of entrepreneurial terrorists who call themselves the Islamic State. "Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East," he said. "They've become rich. I'm in competition with them. They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel." We weren’t sure if we could, in fact, believe Trump’s claim that the Islamic State built a hotel in Syria, so we decided to check it out. The grain of truth here is that the Islamic State has taken over a luxury hotel. But they didn’t build it. And it’s not in Syria. And it doesn’t really operate like a normal hotel. We couldn’t find any evidence that the Islamic State is running any sort of hotel in Syria. We tried to get in touch with a Trump spokesperson and didn’t hear back. However, this May, the Islamic State reopened a five-star hotel in Mosul that shut down when the terrorist group took over the city, one of the largest in Iraq. (Most of the information about this has come from Arabic language news sources.) So the Islamic State didn’t build the Ninawa International Hotel; they just occupied it. Also, it’s not really open for business. According to news reports, the Islamic State is using the hotel’s 262 rooms to house the group’s commanding officers, and they might use it as a wedding venue for the group’s members. You can’t book a room at Ninawa online, and the TripAdvisor page is now defunct. But pre-Islamic State reviews -- caught by Buzzfeed and others -- said the hotel had a good view of the Tigris river, a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pool and two restaurants. News reports say that, keeping with Islamic law, the Islamic State banned drinking and smoking in the hotel, and workers have removed decorations they disapprove of. Our ruling Trump claimed the Islamic State "just built a hotel in Syria." The Islamic State does occupy a luxury hotel, which they took over about a month and a half ago. However, it’s in Iraq, not Syria, and they didn’t build it. It’s an old hotel that the group refurbished and occupied. As far as we know, the hotel’s rooms are reserved for Islamic State commanders, and the event spaces are for weddings.

pomt-05326	Says George LeMieux was one of two Republicans who voted for President Barack Obama's jobs bill.	/florida/statements/2012/may/16/connie-mack/did-george-lemieux-vote-barack-obamas-jobs-bill/	A new ad from Connie Mack says his Republican rival George LeMieux is a liberal -- and "once a liberal, always a liberal." The ammunition: LeMieux’s votes during his brief time in the U.S. Senate. Former Gov. Charlie Crist appointed LeMieux to serve out the term of Mel Martinez, who resigned. LeMieux served from September 2009 to January 2011. Mack and LeMieux are competing for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to go against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. (Mack is now a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Fort Myers.) Mack’s ad shows President Barack Obama, mixing the president’s remarks with narration about LeMieux. It goes like this: Obama: "Two Republican senators, Sens. George Voinovich and George LeMieux … because of their decision, this jobs bill will finally pass.  " Narrator: "George LeMieux was one of only two liberal Republicans who voted for Barack Obama’s liberal jobs bill that failed to help our economy.  " Obama: "Sens. George Voinovich and George LeMieux .. and because of their decision, this jobs bill will finally pass, and I want to thank them.  " Narrator: "George LeMieux: once a liberal, always a liberal.  " (The ad closes with LeMieux huddling with Crist.) We’re going to take out the Mack campaign’s "liberal" adjectives and focus on the facts of the matter: Was LeMieux one of two Republicans who voted for Obama's jobs bill? The bill in question is the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010 (H.R. 5297), which Obama signed into law on Sept. 27, 2010. As the name suggests, the law was aimed at getting money to small businesses and stimulating the economy. The law made about $30 billion available to small business, primarily through the Small Business Administration and its lending program for community banks. The law also included $12 billion worth of tax breaks for small business, mostly by changing tax rules on business expenses. Opponents of the law said at the time that the lending program was similar to the Troubled Asset Relief Progam, or TARP. "It had the mini-TARP in there, with no real help to small businesses, as far as I'm concerned," Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the Washington Post in 2010. LeMieux and Voinovich were two Republican senators who voted with Democrats to move the bill through the Senate. The Mack campaign pointed us to these votes when we asked for evidence for their ad. LeMieux and Voinovich cited widespread unemployment in their respective states (Florida and Ohio) as reasons to support the bill. Back then, LeMieux answered questions about his support on MSNBC’s Morning Joe: "Well, there's not been much I could agree on with the Democrats in Congress, because most of it's been job-killing. But this bill that (Sen.) Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and I worked on together is actually going to help small businesses in Florida. You know, Joe, that we've got nearly 2 million in Florida. They're suffering, and this bill will cut taxes by $12 billion for small businesses and increase lending to your local community bank, so that they can give dollars to small businesses and put people back to work. Doesn't raise the deficit, doesn't raise the debt, doesn't raise taxes. It made a lot of sense to me." LeMieux spokesman Anna Nix responded with similar comments when we asked her on May 15, 2012, about the attack ad. Our ruling Mack’s ad puts a lot of spin on the basic facts when it says, "George LeMieux was one of only two liberal Republicans who voted for Barack Obama’s liberal jobs bill that failed to help our economy.  " Certainly that "liberal" tag is what gives the ad its bite. Here, we’re simply checking whether LeMieux was one of two Republican senators who voted for a jobs bill supported by the president. That is the case. We rate that statement True.

pomt-05154	"There is no Plan B" if the transportation referendum is not passed by voters.	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/20/terry-lawler/t-splost-supporter-says-options-are-slim-if-refere/	Next month’s monumental voter referendum to increase the sales tax rate to pay for dozens of transportation projects across metro Atlanta has brought up an interesting question. Can we do this over and come up with another list of projects if the referendum fails? PolitiFact Georgia wondered what was the answer after attending a town hall meeting last weekend where there was some disagreement about whether we could hit the reset button. "There is no Plan B," referendum supporter Terry Lawler said at the meeting organized by the Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation. Lawler, a former state lawmaker, was the lone panelist in support of the referendum. His main point: If there is another referendum, the project list wouldn’t change much. Lawler is executive director of the Regional Business Coalition of Metropolitan Atlanta, a group that consists of some of the largest chambers of commerce in the region. As Lawler spoke, a man handed out fliers with the Georgia Green Party logo that contradicted Lawler’s statement. The flier had a list of top 10 "lies" about the referendum. No. 2 on the list was "If T-SPLOST doesn’t pass, ‘there is no Plan B.’ " On July 31, voters in 10 Atlanta-area counties will decide whether they want to increase the sales tax rate in their respective counties by a penny-per-dollar to fund 157 transportation projects that planners hope will ease congestion in the region. Projects include improvements at the busy interchange at I-285 and Ga. 400 in Dunwoody, a new rail line from the Lindbergh area to Emory University and the return of local bus service in Clayton County. If approved, the tax would last 10 years. It is projected to collect as much as $8.5 billion when adjusted for inflation. Georgia Sierra Club Director Colleen Kiernan, who was at the meeting, said the plan needs more mass transit options. John Evans, president of the NAACP’s DeKalb County chapter, was also at the meeting. He asked why taxpayers there should pay more in sales taxes, particularly since the plan doesn’t include a proposal to extend MARTA service to the area near the Mall at Stonecrest. The plan’s supporters say it required great effort to persuade the Georgia Legislature to put a referendum on the ballot, and if voters reject it, there may never be this kind of opportunity to create such a large funding source for transportation in the region. Nonsense, some say. "The corrupt pols and their contributors who came up with their take-it-or-leave-it plan say it’s Atlanta’s last and only chance to invest in transit. … It ain’t so," the Green Party flier read. "The law says we can come up with a new and better list and vote again in two years." PolitiFact Georgia read the state House of Representatives bill that was passed in 2010 to allow the referendum. In the last one-third of House Bill 277, there is a sentence that confirms that point. "If more than one-half of the votes cast throughout the entire special district are in favor of levying the tax, then the tax shall be levied as provided in this article; otherwise the tax shall not be levied and the question of levying the tax shall not again be submitted to the voters of the special district until after 24 months immediately following the month in which the election was held." Lawler said the bill does allow residents to vote on the matter two years afterward if the referendum fails, but he said there is some context to his claim. First, he said state leaders have said if the referendum fails, it is unlikely that they will try this again. Gov. Nathan Deal has said residents may not have another chance to fix so many transportation issues at once if they turn it down, according to media reports. House Speaker David Ralston has said it is unlikely that the Legislature would be willing to spend political capital to bring it up again. "If it fails, then I think it is going to be difficult to have the General Assembly go back and redo something that’s failed. I don’t think there’s going to be any point in trying to dress up a crashed car," Ralston said, according to a media report. Lawler’s other argument is that the list may not change much if lawmakers and planners went in reverse and tried to create a new list. For example, he said, every project on Fayette County’s list is geared toward road improvements while the bulk of money to be spent on projects in DeKalb County is for mass transit. "With a Plan B, you are implying that there is going to be something different," he said. "I don’t see a dramatic difference. There is no Plan B." We wondered whether some of these road projects in Fayette could change in a revised plan or could DeKalb decide to change course on the Clifton rail project and spend it on extending the MARTA line to Stonecrest? Lawler said DeKalb could make some changes, but it would be more difficult for smaller counties to change some projects because of the long list of criteria required for inclusion on the project list. "In Fayette, there were 13 projects to choose from. They chose 10 of the 13, again leaving only three potential substitutes," Lawler said. "In Rockdale [County], there were five eligible projects and Rockdale leaders chose three, leaving two potential substitutes." The Atlanta Regional Commission, which offered technical guidance to lawmakers who shaped the list of 157 projects, wrote a "what if" scenario in case the referendum fails and regional leaders want to try again. The ARC projects it would be four years before another referendum could be held. ARC Director Doug Hooker told us that the project list could change in that time if new officials are elected in various counties with different transportation priorities. Hooker also noted the distaste of lawmakers for another referendum. "What I’m told is a lot of officials don’t have an appetite to do it over again," Hooker said. To sum up, there is a possibility lawmakers could decide not to try another referendum, which could mean there may not be a Plan B. But the legislative bill that created the referendum does offer the option of another referendum if this one fails July 31. The projects on a new list could change. It’s unknown at this point by how much. There is a written document that says lawmakers can try again if the July 31 referendum fails. That is a critical factor that must be considered to fully examine Lawler’s statement. Under our rating system, we give him a Mostly False.

pomt-09355	"Snitker has been virtually ignored by the major media."	/florida/statements/2010/apr/05/alexander-snitker/libertarian-senate-candidate-claims-he-ignored-mai/	Alexander Snitker's U.S. Senate campaign says the mainstream media has ignored the lone registered Libertarian candidate seeking to succeed George LeMieux on Capitol Hill, a race that has shone a bright spotlight on three more prominent contenders – Charlie Crist, Marco Rubio and Kendrick Meek. "What is most shocking about this phenomenon is that Snitker has been virtually ignored by the major media," a March 29, 2010, release on the candidate's campaign Web site said. "On an average news day, the other leading Senate candidates enjoy a 200-to-1 advantage over Snitker in media coverage." Snitker, a 34-year-old former Marine who grew up in Pasco County, entered the race on June 30, 2009, according to the Florida Division of Elections Candidate Tracking system. On April 1, 2010, the site showed 25 active candidates for the Senate elections – 11 Republicans, eight Democrats, three with No Party Affiliation, and one each for the Veterans Party of America and Constitution Party of Florida – plus Snitker as the lone Libertarian. He advocates adoption of the "FairTax," which raises federal funds not from income or payroll taxes but through a national retail sales tax and also vows to support term limits and a balanced budget amendment. "What I stand for, the tea party is all about," Snitker said at a March speech in Orlando. A video of the speech was posted on YouTube. To check Snitker's claim, we looked for media references. A recent Nexis search in the category of "Florida News Sources," an aggregator, found two mentions of Snitker in the past three months. Both were in the Orlando Sentinel's "What's happening" column, and both were bulletin-board style items letting readers know about an upcoming candidates forum. In comparison, Republican candidate Rubio got 861 and Democrat Meek 286. Crist, who's campaigning for the Senate while he serves as Florida's governor, got 2,292. We also found eight mentions of Snitker on the St. Petersburg Times political blog, "The Buzz." All were in the comments section of blog posts and all but one apparently posted by the candidate himself. Campaign media director Adrian Wyllie says the Snitker for Senate 2010 campaign periodically sends e-mail blasts to hundreds of reporters and media members across the state and "not one has gotten published in any paper, not one has gotten any follow up from any TV station." Wyllie says the only place the candidate has had success is on talk and Internet radio, an example of which was his February interview with a trio of Libertarians on KKNT in Phoenix’s weekly program, The Libertarian Solution Radio. We found a Podcast of it on iTunes. Wyllie concedes that the Snitker campaign has never scheduled a news conference. But the campaign’s claim is that the major media has ignored his campaign – not that the campaign has necessarily tried to lure it in. So, just to be sure, we rang up Justin Sayfie, Fort Lauderdale attorney and publisher of Sayfiereview.com, considered by some to be a daily must-click site for Florida political junkies. We asked if he’d ever seen an article about Snitker. Sayfie: "How do you spell his last name?" PolitiFact Florida: "S-n-i-t-k-e-r." Sayfie: "S-n-i-t-k-e-r. Snitker? Never heard of him." Sayfie boasts that his Web site reviews 10 to 15 major Florida daily newspapers "seven days a week, 365 days a year, and we do it manually, looking for news coverage about Florida politics." But when it comes to the Snitker for Senate campaign, he says, "I have not seen any news coverage at all. At all. Whatsoever." We find little reason to disagree. We have to rule Snitker's claim True.

pomt-12330	"There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/16/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-mostly-right-role-skills-gap-unfilled/	During an interview with Fox & Friends, Ivanka Trump discussed one of the challenges of the current economy -- that job vacancies exist, but many people who aren’t working aren’t qualified to fill them. Her comments came during a week that the White House had devoted to messages about the American workforce. "There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap," she said. When we took a closer look, we found that Trump was generally on target, but that the impact of the "skills gap" -- the fact that many potential workers don’t have the right qualifications to take jobs that are currently open -- is worth some explanation. Are there 6 million jobs available? On the numerical side, Trump was spot-on. Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data from a survey called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. One of the key statistics in the survey is job openings nationally. In the most recent month for which data is available -- April 2017 -- the survey found 6,044,000 job openings across the country. That represents the first time this statistic has ever crossed the 6 million line, going back to the earliest data reported in 2000. Since a measure of the raw number of job openings is affected by overall population growth over time, we’ll also note that the rate of job openings -- which is adjusted for the size of the U.S. population -- also tied a record in April, reaching a level equaled only in two previous months going back to 2000. So Trump has accurately portrayed the scale of how many jobs are available today in the United States. Is this large number of job openings 'due in part to the skills gap'? Trump used cautious wording; Economists agree that a mismatch of skills is clearly a "part" of the problem, as she put it. That said, they cautioned against making the oversimplified argument that the skills gap underlies all 6 million job openings. On the one hand, "some of the current job vacancies are unquestionably due to the skills gap," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "If job-seeking jobless workers and promotion-seeking but under-employed workers had exactly the right skills, many of the current job vacancies could be filled faster." At the same time, for many job openings, the barrier isn’t necessarily the lack of a college degree or specialized training, he said. In many cases, the "barrier" can be overcome with on-the-job training and experience. "There are many job openings with more modest skill requirements," Burtless said. "They require the new hire to learn some extra skills to become more proficient and productive in their new jobs. A large percentage of job seekers have the capacity to learn those skills on the job pretty quickly." He added that "employers who think every job opening can be filled immediately and with a perfectly trained worker are either living in a dream world or living through a Great Depression in which millions of highly trained workers are desperately seeking a job." The reality, he said, is that "for most current job vacancies, the skill set of today’s job seekers is sufficient to fill the great majority of the vacancies." Another economist, Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute, has testified that for many manufacturing jobs, a drag on hiring comes not only from a skills gap but also an "image gap." Millennials in particular, she said, may have a "tainted" image of what high-tech manufacturing jobs look like today, assuming instead that they are like such jobs decades ago -- "dirty, grimy, repetitive or dangerous." Survey data shows that "many workers are no longer interested in manufacturing jobs and there appears to be a stigma attached to manufacturing work," she wrote. "Few parents want their children to work in this industry, and manufacturing is the last career choice for people between the ages of 19 and 33." In an interview, Mathur said it’s difficult to tease out how much of a factor the skills gap is in today’s job openings. She suggested that it may be the biggest factor -- but she also cautioned that the image gap is particularly significant for younger workers and added that other issues exist as well, including an unwillingness among some Americans to relocate to areas with jobs. And of course, even in an efficiently humming economy, any survey taken at a given point in time will find many jobs that are simply open due to transition, or what economists call "churn." Many of these job openings will be due to happenstance rather than structural problems with the skills gap. Our ruling Trump said, "There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap." The number she cites is correct, and she’s right to say that the skills gap plays a role. Economists warn against overestimating the role played by the skills gap in all 6 million job openings, both because other factors play a role (such as the image gap) and because the skills barriers posed are often more modest than having to earn an academic degree or to obtain specialized training.

pomt-02174	"No other country has a constitutional right" like the Second Amendment.	/florida/statements/2014/apr/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-second-amendment-unique-speech-nr/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., went all in for gun owners in a speech to the NRA as the potential presidential candidate sought to squelch any doubts about his commitment to gun rights. Rubio was one of a few 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls who spoke at the NRA’s annual convention in Indianapolis on April 25. He described the right to own a gun as part of the American Dream, highlighted the "futility" of existing gun laws and chastised the media for stigmatizing gun owners. At one point, Rubio described the Constitution of the United States as unique. "I'm always amused that those who come up to me and say no other country has a constitutional right like this," he said. "As if to imply that there is something wrong with us. But we say no other country has a constitutional right like this not with scorn, but with pride." Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s executive vice president and CEO, made a similar statement during his own speech to the annual meeting, saying, "Our Second Amendment freedom separates us from every other country on earth." Is it correct that the United States is the only country that gives residents a constitutional right to bear arms? The Second Amendment The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." We asked several legal experts if the United States is the only such country that has a constitutional right to bear arms. Tom Ginsburg, University of Chicago international law professor and co-director of the Comparative Constitutions Project, has studied gun rights in national constitutions dating back to 1789. Only a minority of constitutions have ever included gun rights, and the number has dwindled, Ginsburg concluded in a 2013 article he wrote with Zachary Elkins, a University of Texas government professor. But Ginsburg added in an interview with PolitiFact that "the precise language in each constitution is different, and no other country has the ‘well-regulated militia’ language." Of the constitutions that do have an explicit right to bear arms "ours is the only one that does not explicitly include a restrictive condition," wrote Elkins in a New York Times op-ed. The Constitutions Project zeroed in on two countries: "We code only Mexico, Guatemala and the U.S. as having a right to bear arms," Ginsburg told PolitiFact. While the constitutions of Haiti and Iran do mention guns, "the provision was too ambiguous for us to consider it a true right to bear arms." Here is how the Comparative Constitutions Project translates the right to own arms in Guatemala and Mexico: • Guatemala Article 38: "The right to own (‘tenencia’) weapons for personal use, not prohibited by the law, in the place of inhabitation, is recognized. There will not be an obligation to hand them over, except in cases ordered by a competent judge." • Mexico Article 10: "The inhabitants of the United Mexican States have the right to possess arms in their residences for their protection and legitimate defense, except such as are expressly forbidden by law or which have been reserved for the exclusive use of the Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard. Federal law will determine the circumstances, conditions, requirements, and places in which the bearing of arms by inhabitants will be authorized." The authors of the article concluded that "the U.S. Constitution is alone in omitting any written conditions under which the government can regulate arms and munitions. In other countries, the right is typically limited to self-defense, either of the home or the state itself." Guatemala, they note, "gives its citizens the right to own weapons for personal use in the home and states that citizens can only be forced to relinquish guns by judicial order. Haiti gives citizens the right to use guns to defend the home but explicitly denies a general right to bear arms." They added that in the United States, the judicial branch has ruled that some restrictions on gun ownership are permissible -- they just aren’t outlined in the Constitution itself. "U.S. courts have allowed some exceptions to unconditional gun ownership in the form of local, state and federal statutes restricting ownership or possession of firearms," the authors wrote. "In this way, the courts have served to render constitutional law somewhat less exceptional than the text itself would suggest." Other legal experts we consulted agreed that Mexican and Guatemalan constitutions come closest to the United States’, at least up to a point. "If the question is an express right to arms in the nation’s Constitution, there's also Mexico, Haiti, and Guatemala," said David Kopel, research director at the Independence Institute and adjunct professor of Advanced Constitutional Law at Denver University. "The Mexican and Haitian governments essentially ignore the right, and get away with doing so. For example, there is only one gun store allowed in the entire nation of Mexico." (There is a long list of criteria to buy a gun at this sole legal outlet, according to the Washington Post.) The NRA didn’t respond directly to our fact-check, but Kopel told PolitiFact that he frequently writes for the NRA’s magazine. One law professor also suggested we look at Switzerland. PolitiFact explained in a fact-check in 2013 that the Swiss government requires nearly every able-bodied young male adult to serve in the citizen militia, where they are issued a military rifle. The guns are supposed to be for military use only, not for personal defense. Anyone who wants to keep the weapon after their years of service can do so if they can provide an acceptable reason; the gun is then refitted to limit its firepower. Switzerland does not have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, Kopel said. Rubio’s response We sent Rubio’s spokesman a 2010 article in Slate that stated Mexico, Haiti and Guatemala have the right to bear arms in their Constitutions though it stated that Guatemala was the only one as broad as our Second Amendment. Spokesman Alex Conant said the language in the Guatemalan Constitution isn’t as strong as the language in the U.S. Second Amendment, which includes "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Conant also suggested we take a look at the characterization of Guatemala’s gun laws on www.gunpolicy.org, a website hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health that supports global efforts to prevent gun injury. The website calls Guatemala’s gun laws "restrictive" while it labeled our gun laws "permissive." "All you seem to have established is that one country has some language similar to ours, but in practice does not treat the right in the same way," Conant said. Our ruling Rubio said during a speech to the NRA that "no other country has a constitutional right" like the Second Amendment. Mexico and Guatemala have the right to bear arms in their constitutions. However, the Second Amendment is unique because it is the only one that doesn’t include restrictive conditions within the constitutional language.

pomt-00735	$29 is what "families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week."	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/22/gwyneth-paltrow/gwyneth-paltrows-29-weekly-food-stamps-budget-flaw/	Love or loathe Gwyneth Paltrow, her experiment buying groceries on a food stamp budget stirred up a lot of awareness about the nation’s anti-hunger programs. Which, you know, was kind of the point. Paltrow, a health-conscious actress who prefers to cook with fresh ingredients, accepted a challenge from celebrity chef Mario Batali to live on food stamps for a week and draw attention to the Food Bank for New York City earlier this month. Paltrow shared a photo of her grocery haul in an April 9 tweet, writing, "This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store—what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week." The Internet quickly balked at her choices, particularly the green garnishes that do little to stave hunger — seven limes, really? But few people paid attention to whether the budget she shared is actually accurate or typical of a family that needs assistance. A reader saw the figure in a CNN story about Paltrow’s challenge, which she quit after four days, and asked us to look into it. If you want to know what Paltrow ended up cooking from her basket, check out her GOOP recipes for black bean taquitos and sweet potato saute served with kale, brown rice and a poached egg. If you want to know what’s wrong about her $29 SNAP budget, keep reading. SNAP in a snap The key to understanding SNAP starts with its full name — Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The "Supplemental" is key because SNAP is not designed to provide low-income families with all the money they need to eat every single meal. It’s supposed to supplement grocery spending, not replace it. SNAP is one of the government’s biggest welfare programs, costing about $70 billion in 2014. Demand for SNAP grew over the course of the recession, reaching a high of more than 47 million beneficiaries in 23 million households. Program costs and payouts have come down amid the economic recovery. To receive SNAP benefits, a person must: Show assets less than $2,250; Report gross monthly income at or below 130 of the federal poverty line; Report net monthly income at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty line. How much a person or household receives depends on how much income they make and how big the household is. The sliding scale, which comes with monthly maximums, emphasizes how SNAP is indeed supplemental, and how Paltrow’s claim is wanting. Say a household of four qualifies for SNAP with a $1,136 net monthly income. While the maximum SNAP benefit is $649 a month, that household would receive only $308 a month (about $19 per person, per week), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In this case, the USDA assumes the household would spend an additional $341 of their own money (30 percent of their monthly income) on food. The case of the person with no net income So the system is set up as supplemental food assistance. But what about people who have no income? They would get more SNAP money. A single person could receive $194 a month (about $48 a week). SNAP benefits for a household of four would be closer to $40 a week. Neither number is near Paltrow’s $29 a week figure. That figure is the amount of SNAP benefits for the average individual (all benefits divided by all people). The trouble is that calculation misses the point that SNAP is supposed to supplement people’s food budget, does not account for the fact that people with no net income receive more government support, and ignores other government programs that provide food aid. Many families bring in other income or benefits that complete the overall budget for food, said Greg Mills, who studies SNAP policy at the Urban Institute think tank. "Households on food stamps do typically receive some other benefits from the government, but it may be limited," he said. For low-income women who are pregnant or have infants, they may also utilize another USDA supplemental program for women, infants and children (WIC). School programs offer free and reduced breakfast and lunch to children (48.1 percent of all students were eligible for free or reduced lunch in the 2010-11 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education). D.C. public schools also offer after-school snacks and supper, Mills said. In 2013, 24 percent of SNAP households had Social Security income, 7 percent received welfare payments under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and 4 percent received unemployment assistance. Paltrow, whose "conscious uncoupling" from musician husband Chris Martin previously ignited the Internet, has two children, Moses and Apple. If we consider an alternate reality in which Paltrow applied for benefits for herself and her children, the average monthly benefit for a household with children may provide a more useful look than a per-person figure. In 2013, the average monthly benefit for a household with children was $410, or $95 a week. In reality, Paltrow abandoned the $29 a week challenge after four days. Our ruling Paltrow pointed to $29 worth of groceries as what "families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week." It’s clear Paltrow is trying to do a good thing. But her specific claim falls short. SNAP is not intended to feed families by itself. It is designed to help people with low incomes meet a government-approved budget for food by providing a benefit that helps them get there, sometimes in conjunction with other sources of meals, such as school food programs, and financial support. The government expects SNAP beneficiaries to spend 30 percent of their own income on food. That expectation is what makes the $29 a week figure look so low. A single person with no income could receive about $48 a week in SNAP benefits (65 percent more than Paltrow stated) and would not factor in other types of government support.

"Clayton County offers the lowest operating millage rate in Metro Atlanta," it said. Local governments are constantly boasting about various advantages to encourage people to move their business, or their families, into that city or county. The statement on Clayton’s website, which suggests homeowners could pay lower property taxes than any other part of metro Atlanta, intrigued us. PolitiFact Georgia called Wade Starr, a former state representative from Clayton who now manages the county’s government operations. He said the statement was probably posted on the website a long time ago, based on some outdated information. "It needs to be updated, probably," Starr said. "Right now, I think there would be some other counties that would be lower than we are." We decided to take a look. For those unfamiliar with the term millage rate, it is a formula governments use to determine how much property owners in a city or county should pay in taxes for police, firefighters and other government services. One "mill" equals $1 of property taxes for every $1,000 of assessed value. In Clayton County, the net 2012 tax year millage rate was 14.918. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed the most recent government millage rates we found in some counties that either border Clayton or have a population of similar size. In Cherokee County, which has a population slightly smaller than Clayton’s, the millage rate for operations, fire and a parks bond was lower, at 9.99 mills. Henry County, which abuts Clayton and has about the same population, raised its millage rate this year to 14.5 mills. In Cobb County, the millage rate was 11.11. DeKalb County’s millage rate was higher than Clayton’s, at 21.21. These millage rates do not include school operations, which are typically higher than the government operations. Starr said the recession, which officially began in 2008, hit the Clayton housing market worse than other counties. In 2008, Clayton had the region's largest price drop, with homes falling 43 percent in value, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Home Sales Report. The county's typical appraised value for 2010 was $90,589, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis, a decline of 25 percent from the prior year. The typical sale price, meanwhile, was $80,656. Starr talked about the decline in home values with us, saying he paid about $2,400 in property taxes in 2009. In 2011, Starr said he again paid about $2,400 in property taxes. In 2008, Clayton’s net millage rate was 8.962 mills, according to county records. That’s about 6 mills less than it is now. Around that time, the millage rate was the second-lowest among the five highest-populated counties in the region, according to a comparison done by Fulton County. Cobb had the lowest rate, the comparison showed. Starr said the information on that part of Clayton’s website was probably posted around that time. He said there was other information on that part of the website, such as the county’s population, that could be traced to that time. Starr said Friday that the claim about the millage rate would be removed from the county’s website. We checked on Monday and it was gone. In closing, the county’s website claimed it had the lowest operating millage rate in metro Atlanta. That information, the county now says, was based on outdated information and was going to be removed. Kudos to Clayton for correcting the information. The claim was False.

pomt-08476	Says Rick Scott gave a deposition in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times about his dealings as head of Columbia/HCA hospital chain	/florida/statements/2010/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-dodges-answers-invoking-fifth-amendment/	Democrat Alex Sink is airing a new ad that whacks Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott for alleged fraud at Columbia/HCA, and in particular, for refusing to answer questions about his role in any wrongdoing. The ad, which will air Oct. 13, 2010, is two minutes long and crafted to look like a TV news magazine segment. It's called "Fraud Files," and pieces together the voice of a narrator with video news clips. "Is Columbia/HCA putting profits ahead of patients?" NBC's Brian Williams asks near the beginning of the ad. "Did Columbia treat a patient for a mild disease, then bill Medicare for something more expensive?" another reporter asks. A narrator and a Palm Beach County prosecutor help fill in the details. "A whistleblower revealed that Scott's company was cooking the books. Refusing to cooperate, Rick Scott gave a deposition in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times," the narrator says. "Which means a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him," adds Michael McAuliffe, Palm Beach County's Democratic state attorney, finishing the thought. The ad then cuts quickly to another news reporter ... "The Medicare fraud that cost his former company, Columbia/HCA $1.7 billion in fines ..." And then back to the narrator. "The fine was the largest in the history of the United States. Rick Scott resigned in disgrace with a $300 million golden parachute." We're dealing with McAuliffe's claim in another item. In this fact-check, we wanted to learn more about that deposition, and Scott's use of the Fifth Amendment. Columbia/HCA background First, a little bit of back story on Scott and Columbia/HCA. Scott started what was first called Columbia in the spring of 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country's largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals. In early 1997, federal agents revealed they were investigating the Columbia/HCA chain for, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Allegations included that Columbia/HCA billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and that the hospital chain would perform one type of medical test but bill the federal government for a more expensive test or procedure. Agents seized records from Columbia facilities across the country in Tennessee, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Florida. Scott resigned in the middle of the federal investigation in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations; the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle, and did. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. The company agreed to further settlements in 2002, paying an additional $881 million in fines. Scott's deposition Scott indeed did give a deposition in 2000 in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 75 times. The amendment reads in part that no one "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." Scott's deposition, however, was not part of the criminal fraud case being pursued by the federal government. In fact, Scott was never officially questioned during the federal criminal investigation. Instead, the case in question was a civil case involving Columbia/HCA and Nevada Communications Corp. Nevada Communications alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract. Scott's lawyer interjected after an opposing lawyer began the deposition by asking if Scott was employed. "Under normal circumstances, Mr. Scott would be pleased to answer that question and other questions that you pose today," Scott's lawyer, Steven Steinbach, said. "Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself. Scott then went on to read the same answer to every question Nevada Communications lawyers asked, even when asked if Scott is a current or former employee of Columbia/HCA -- "Upon advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the questions by asserting my rights and privileges under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution." The ad never clarifies, or tries to distinguish the deposition as being part of a civil case unconnected to the criminal investigation. It simply adds the claim into the middle of a series of claims about the criminal fraud case. On the other hand, Scott's reason for invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege was because of the criminal investigations surrounding Columbia/HCA, his lawyer said. During the Univision debate on Oct. 8, 2010, Scott said he pleaded the Fifth so many times because the opposing lawyers were on a "fishing expedition." But that's not what the Fifth Amendment should be used for, legal experts say. The Fifth Amendment is a way to protect yourself from prosecution, regardless of whether you committed the crime. "The Fifth Amendment is not a shield against fishing expeditions," said Nancy Dowd, a UF Levin College of Law professor. "If you want to cloak yourself in the protection of the Fifth Amendment, it has to be for the reason that your answer could result in criminal liability." Added Bruce Jacob, a law professor at Stetson: "You should not use the Fifth Amendment privilege if you don't think there's possible criminal liability." Ruling Scott did give a deposition in 2000 where he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege not to be a witness against himself 75 times (we counted). But that alone doesn't make the claim right. We think it's fair to look at the context of how the number's used, and what an average viewer will take away upon seeing the ad. The inference here is clear -- that Scott gave a deposition in the federal criminal investigation of Columbia/HCA and pleaded the Fifth Amendment 75 times. That's not true. Scott invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times in an unrelated civil suit over a communications contract. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-12973	Because of its higher minimum wage, New York State is "already showing signs of various companies picking up and leaving."	/new-york/statements/2016/dec/23/michael-long/business-new-york-have-closed-because-minimum-wage/	New York State’s minimum wage has been climbing above the federal wage requirement since 2013. The state’s increases were supposed to stop when the minimum wage hit $9 an hour last year. But then Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo struck a deal with state lawmakers in March to raise it to $15 an hour over the next several years. The higher minimum wage is bad for businesses, which already struggle with taxes and regulations, said New York State Conservative Party Chairman Michael R. Long. The state is "already showing signs of various companies picking up and leaving," Long said. When asked about his claim, Long said he was not referring to any particular company. "All someone needs to do is look at upstate," Long said. So is Long right? Are some businesses leaving New York because of the higher minimum wage? What’s the minimum wage? The state’s hourly minimum wage has risen from $7.25 - still the federal level - to $9 since 2013. Tipped workers, like those in the restaurant and hospitality industries, also saw a minimum wage increase in the last year. They used to make around $5 an hour without tips. They are now paid $6.80 to $7.65, depending on the industry and tips earned. Starting at the end of this year, a new set of minimum wage increases will be phased in across the state. • New York City will reach $15 by the end of 2018. Small businesses in New York City have until the end of 2019. • Westchester County and Long Island will reach $15 an hour in 2021. • Upstate New York will reach $12.50 by the end of 2020. The Department of Labor will then determine the wage increase each year until the region hits $15. Wages for tipped workers will increase at a different rate. Starting in 2019, the governor can pause the increase if it appears to cause more harm than good. Companies moving out of New York When we spoke to Long about his claim, he said he did not have any particular company in mind. We also reached out to business groups, including two chambers of commerce across the state's southern border, to see if they knew of any business that had moved or plan to move because of the state's rising minimum wage. They were able to provide examples of businesses that closed, but could not point to a company that moved out of state because of the wage increase. We also could not find any reports of businesses relocating because of the wage increase. Some suggested minimum wage was a factor in Verizon's decision to relocate jobs from two call centers in New York, but a representative from Verizon said the state's wage was not a factor in the move. Impact on business We found a handful of small business owners who said that minimum wage increases – or the prospect of more increases – were a factor in the failure of their businesses. There is no way to prove that, but restaurants and other small business often operate with little margin for error. Anything that increases costs – higher rents, more expensive food or other costs, higher wages – can hurt their businesses. Bob and Ron’s Fish Fry in Albany County closed in April after the new wage increase became law. The restaurant posted on its Facebook page that rising costs sunk it. "Mainly the economy, high cost of seafood, demand," the business wrote in a post on the social media site, "And to be honest there is no way we could pay the high minimum wage that is coming and mandatory 3 months paid sick leave- this state is going in the wrong direction for small businesses- that's the main reasons." When the Del Rio Diner in Brooklyn closed in July, it also cited the higher wage. "The minimum wage, that’s what broke the camel’s back. It killed us," Larry Georgeton, the diner’s co-owner, told Brooklyn Daily. Not only restaurants complained. A family-owned Ramada Hotel in Buffalo closed in July. The owner told The Buffalo News that higher wages and stricter regulations influenced their decision. "It has been difficult to compete with all the new properties being built in Western New York, along with all the new proposed increases in wages and state regulations," Richard A. DiVita Jr., the hotel’s chief operating officer, told the newspaper. The owner of a restaurant that closed in East Aurora after 14 years of business also placed blame on the state’s rising minimum wage. The businesses also faced challenges outside of the minimum wage including the cost of resources and more competition. Our ruling Long, the state’s Conservative Party chairman, said New York State is "already showing signs of various companies picking up and leaving" because of the new minimum-wage legislation. We found a handful of businesses that cited the higher minimum wage as a factor for closing. But we couldn't find any companies that relocated out of New York State because of the wage increase.

pomt-03550	The state of Georgia lost 16 percent of its employees last year, and that percentage has risen over the past three years.	/georgia/statements/2013/may/24/nathan-deal/portrait-state-government-workers-has-gaps/	During a speech last month at the Atlanta Press Club, Gov. Nathan Deal lauded state workers for what they do and for doing it without pay increases. In fact, it’s been six years since an across-the-board merit pay bump, he said. And that’s led to some negative results. "The state of Georgia lost 16 percent of our employees last year and that percentage has risen over the last three years," Deal said. "So when people are being siphoned off out of state government into private business because the salaries are so much more favorable, then those are things the state has to be cognizant of." We wanted to know more about Deal’s 16 percent claim, so we decided to check it out. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson provided us a chart showing the turnover trend of employees leaving state government for fiscal years 2002 through 2012. The chart was produced by the state’s Department of Administrative Services, which acts as the central human resources agency for state employees. The numbers showed: Fiscal year % of state workforce state jobs 2012 16.43% 70,197 2011 15.60% 71,837 2010 13.84% 77,934 2009 13.62% 82,001 The state workforce figures for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 include part-time employees. But that amount is likely very small. For example, it accounted for 119 employees in fiscal 2012. So the governor was correct in his three years assessment. But what do those numbers mean? His statement was made in the context of employees leaving the state for better private-sector jobs. But do the turnover numbers only count those employees, or do they also include people who’ve left for other reasons? For answers, we went to Candy Sarvis, deputy commissioner of the human resources division of the Administrative Services Department. Sarvis could only provide detailed information on the fiscal 2012 data, which her department compiled. Data before then were compiled by the now-defunct State Personnel Administration. Sarvis’ division used the data prior to fiscal 2012 as it was presented and didn’t go back to verify the numbers, she said. For fiscal 2012, Sarvis said, the percentages include all full-time, benefit-eligible employees who have left their jobs voluntarily, as well as through firings, layoffs, retirements, etc. Also of note, the percentages do not account for employees of the University System of Georgia or the Board of Regents for that system. The University System employed 43,020 workers in fiscal 2012, but no information on employee turnover was available, a spokesman said. Also, based on provided jobs numbers, the decrease in state workers was about 14 percent over the past four fiscal years. And from fiscal 2011 to 2012 the drop in jobs was just 2 percent, which is likely to mean that many of the open or vacated positions were filled. For the state turnover data provided, the turnover trend was higher in the years leading up to the recession but dropped during the recession. Georgia’s trends mirror national trends, according to data compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nationally, the turnover rate for all levels of government is about 16 percent. Gary Burtless, a senior economics fellow with the Brookings Institution, has studied the data. The quit rate -- or the number of employees who quit during a month as a percentage of total employment -- remains lower in the public sector than the private sector, according to multiyear BLS data compiled by Burtless. The quit rate has edged up, he said, but for both sectors, it is still lower than it was in the decade before the recession. "If experienced workers are afraid to quit their jobs, there is less pressure on employers -- including public employers -- to grant their employees sizable wage increases," Burtless said. Deal also discussed the state’s workforce last year. He touted personnel cuts made by his administration, but he left out University System data that changed the numbers and his statement was rated Mostly False. So, do Deal’s figures add up this time around? The governor said that 16 percent of the state government’s workforce was "lost" during the past fiscal year. Deal made the comments in the context of how employees receiving no raises has affected the state’s workforce, which has decreased the past four fiscal years. A closer look at the numbers shows that Deal’s 16 percent figure also includes employees who have left their positions through layoffs, retirement, and other reasons -- including voluntary resignations. And in the case of voluntary resignations, the state doesn’t track information on these employees to determine whether they left for other jobs. Also, the figure doesn’t include data for most of the state’s colleges and Board of Regents. Deal’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context.

pomt-01759	Because of the current immigration crisis, Republicans want to "repeal" a 2008 law that President George W. Bush signed and "want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from ... sex trafficking."	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/31/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-odonnell-republicans-want-repeal-2008-bush-/	One of President George W. Bush’s last acts in office was signing the non-controversial William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which contained a provision guaranteeing formal deportation hearings for child immigrants not from Mexico and Canada and without family in the United States. This guaranteed hearing is now at the center of the crisis on our southern border, as thousands of children stream into this country from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. On the July 23 edition of Last Word, MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell pointed to discussion of the 2008 Bush law as an example of the "misinformation" Republicans are spreading on immigration. O’Donnell played a clip where Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., implies that the 2008 law -- which was intended to provide protection for victims of sex trafficking -- shouldn’t apply to the children presently crossing the border. There’s no evidence, Brooks said, that "this 60-to-90,000 illegal alien children mass that has come to America are coming here to be sex slaves or something of that nature." O’Donnell took Brooks’ statement to what he saw as a logical conclusion. "One of the positions that these Republicans are holding," O’Donnell said, "is that they want to repeal the law that President Bush signed, which is about protecting children from sex trafficking. So they want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from this kind of sex trafficking." We were skeptical that the Republican position is to repeal the 2008 law entirely, so we decided to dig deeper. What happens when a child arrives at the border When unaccompanied minors from Mexico and Canada are apprehended at the border, they’re screened by Border Patrol within 48 hours to determine whether they are victims of trafficking or have credible asylum claims. Those that do get a formal hearing, and those that don’t are bussed back, often within 12 hours of their arrival. The process for children from other countries starts the same, with an initial Border Patrol screening. But the 2008 law mandates that these children -- most of them from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- are sent to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) after their screening, regardless of whether or not they have asylum claims. The HHS subjects these children to a more thorough medical check, and then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) transports them to a HHS shelter. From there, the children are released to relatives or other sponsors to await their guaranteed hearings. These hearings often don’t occur, though, for years, and shelters are getting overcrowded -- this is what pundits are referring to the immigration crisis. Compared to the roughly 3,000 non-Mexican minors apprehended at the border in 2009, the tens of thousands of minors crossing the border now are simply too much for the DHS and HHS to process. Laws are complicated While the provision dictating border policy is getting most of the attention, there’s more to the 2008 law. It also renewed funding for a 2000 anti-trafficking bill and laid out plans for sanctions and research to combat trafficking. There’s an ongoing debate about whether the Obama administration is properly enforcing the letter of the 2008 law. Conservatives and groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter immigration enforcement, say the 2008 law guarantees hearings only for "unaccompanied alien children" who do not have parents or legal guardians in the United States. Yet, according to the center, up to 77 percent of non-Mexican children arriving at the border without family members are being released to family members within the United States. These children, they argue, shouldn’t be eligible for a hearing. It’s unclear to what extent the 2008 law is the cause of the backlog of children -- but as we’ve addressed elsewhere, it’s certainly a major factor. What Republicans have proposed O’Donnell is right insofar that Republicans have honed in on the 2008 law as a major source of the current immigration crisis. But the prevailing thought among Republicans is that the law should be amended, not repealed. House Speaker John Boehner said July 17 that Congress couldn’t "begin to mitigate the problem" at the border "if you don’t do something about the ‘08 law that’s being abused. And it is being abused." The only Republican we found saying the law should be repealed is Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. "We insist on having the 2008 law repealed as part of" any immigration bill, McCain said on July 11. Senate Democrats, he said, are "not willing to do that." But it is fairly clear McCain misspoke. Legislation proposed by McCain and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., specifically calls for amending the 2008 law, not repealing it, and McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told us on July 30 that McCain wants to amend the 2008 law. Other formal proposals from the GOP all call for revising, not repealing the 2008 law. Some Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., also support revising the law. There have been nine proposals related to the 2008 law from Republicans in the Senate and the House. And, according to Grant Newman of immigration research group NumbersUSA, all of these proposals involve amending the 2008 law, albeit in different ways. There have been no formal proposals, Newman said, for repeal. "Most of the Republican attempts, their whole goal is to try to treat children from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras and in some cases, any child, like we treat Mexican nationals, where we can expedite removal," Newman said. A proposal by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, for example, would eliminate the distinction between countries of origin. Under their proposal, called the HUMANE Act, all children -- not just those from Mexico and Canada -- would be screened by the Border Patrol within 48 hours, and those without claims to amnesty or evidence that they’ve been trafficked would be removed as soon as possible, like Mexicans are under current law. Children who pass the Border Patrol screening would be submitted to a second screening within seven days in front of a judge, with a higher burden of proof than the Border Patrol screening but a lower burden than a formal hearing. Migrants who meet that burden of proof would be sent to the HHS to await a formal hearing as in current law, and migrants who don’t would be removed. A House GOP working group formed by Boehner and led by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, has released similar recommendations. The working group recommended an amendment to the 2008 law "so all unaccompanied minors are treated the same as Mexicans for the purpose of removals." So the Republicans who want to change the 2008 law have all proposed revisions, not repeal. It’s worth noting that Congress rarely repeals laws in full -- they’re too complicated for that -- but O’Donnell still mischaracterized Republicans’ stance on the 2008 law. Protections for trafficking victims O’Donnell does, though, have something of a point that Republicans are removing protections for victims of sex trafficking. Opponents of the Republican proposals about the 2008 law break mainly into partisan camps. According to NumbersUSA, many Republicans are unconvinced that the 2008 law even applies to the surge children, the majority of whom aren’t "unaccompanied alien children" under federal law. The burden to fix the immigration crisis, they say, falls solely on the executive branch. Democratic opponents of these proposals -- including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- have pointed instead their injustice towards child migrants. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., for example, criticized the HUMANE Act, saying it "undermines the due process rights of a child that exists under existing law." And advocates from Texas immigration rights group LUPE criticized the HUMANE Act on the grounds that it doesn’t provide children enough time to open up to officials. They gave the example of Sara, a sex-trafficking victim who wasn’t identified as such until she spoke to a social worker two months into her detention. Under the Cornyn-Cuellar proposal, they said, Sara would have been sent back to her abusers. But while proposals to revise the 2008 law may get rid of some safeguards for victims of sex trafficking, they don’t get rid of all of them. Current law gives immigrants from Mexico the opportunity to make their case when screened, and Republican proposals would give Central American children at least that much protection. The GOP working group’s recommendations, for example, would give children who don’t want to be returned to their home countries a screening by child welfare professionals and an expedited removal hearing within seven days after that screening. Our ruling O’Donnell took a soundbite from Republican congressman Mo Brooks to mean that Republicans "want to repeal the law that President Bush signed" in 2008 to protect victims of sex trafficking. O’Donnell concluded that Republicans "want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from this kind of sex trafficking." Republicans want to amend, not repeal the 2008 law. But it’s an open debate what these changes would mean for victims of sex trafficking. These proposals leave Central American children with some protections, but without what human rights advocates have characterized as a major protection. We rate O’Donnell’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-04263	Says that over the past 20 years, Texas public school spending rose 142 percent and per-pupil spending more than tripled when adjusted for inflation.	/texas/statements/2012/nov/12/jason-isaac/jason-isaac-says-past-20-years-texas-school-spendi/	Texas doesn’t have a school funding problem, state Rep. Jason Isaac said in a voters guide to the Nov. 6, 2012, election. "We have a spending problem." The Dripping Springs Republican, who went on to win his second term, said: "Over the past 20 years, expenditures for education have increased 142% and Texas’ per-pupil costs have increased from $3,659 to $11,024 after adjusting for inflation." He was responding to this question in the guide produced by the Austin and Texas chapters of the League of Women Voters: "Since 2006, state educational funding has been reduced and student enrollment has increased. What measures would you propose to restore adequate funding to Texas schools?" Since the 2011 Legislature modified school finance formulas -- sending schools $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same -- PolitiFact Texas has fielded a range of related claims. Recently, lawmakers have said Texas did not cut education spending (Pants on Fire), raised education spending (Pants on Fire) and raised education’s share of the budget (Mostly True). But none of those claims stretched back to the days of Guns ’N Roses. We asked Isaac’s campaign for the backup on his statement. Spokeswoman Ellen Troxclair replied with a June 2010 report from the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation citing 1988-2008 total expenditures from the Texas Education Agency. Some perspective: Texas enrollment has grown substantially in recent decades. Agency data showed an increase of 47 percent in Isaac’s chosen time span, from 3.2 million pupils to 4.7 million. Looking at the foundation report’s data on expenditures, we first realized that Isaac’s per-pupil statement had not been adjusted for inflation, in contrast to what he said in the guide. He gave a starting point of $3,659, which is the unadjusted amount for 1987-88. In 2008 dollars, it comes out to $6,659, confirmed by the foundation report and our math using the federal Consumer Price Index online calculator. Working from 2008 dollars at both ends of the 20-year period yields a 66 percent increase, rather than the 201 percent increase Isaac’s numbers indicated. That is, per-pupil spending increased at about one third the rate he suggested. The first part of Isaac’s claim came straight from the report, Troxclair said. And it checks out, according to our math and the education agency’s data. From 1987-88 through 2007-08, using 2008 dollars to adjust for inflation, Texas’ total expenditures on education rose 142 percent. Experts suggested other flaws in Isaac’s statement. First, operating expenditures would be a better measure than total expenditures, we heard in interviews with Texas Association of School Boards spokesman Dominic Giarratani and school funding expert Lori Taylor, an associate professor at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service. That’s because total expenditures fluctuate due to big-ticket construction projects that school districts mostly pay for on their own by issuing bonds. Operating expenditures more accurately reflect state budget dollars, they said. We found that over the 20 years singled out by Isaac, inflation-adjusted operating expenditures more than doubled, rising 112 percent, or 42 percent per pupil. Troxclair acknowledged what she called the "wording error" on the per-pupil inflation adjustment, but disagreed with the idea that Isaac should have relied solely on operating expenditures. "Money spent on construction projects is still money being spent," she said. Second, Taylor noted that although Isaac said "the past 20 years," his data set ends in 2008, overlooking the three most recent school years including the two affected by the cuts lawmakers approved in 2011. That’s understandable in the case of the foundation’s report, which was written in 2010. However, Isaac made his statement more than a year after lawmakers completed the 2012-13 budget. Even so, Isaac would not have been able to compare actual spending numbers for 2011-12, because they won’t be published until spring 2013. The 2010-11 data was out, but also would not have included the 2011 legislative cuts. Troxclair told us Isaac relied on the 2010 report because it was the most comprehensive analysis available from the foundation. The state’s budgeted amounts, rather than dollars actually spent, came out March 8, 2012, so we ran those over a 20-year period to see how the cuts might change the picture. Budgeted amounts for 1992-2012 showed mostly smaller increases than actual spending in 1988-2008, particularly in operating costs: Total budgeted spending was up 72 percent compared to 1992, or 20 percent per pupil. Operating budgeted spending was up 69 percent, or 17 percent per pupil. Pencils down! Our ruling Isaac said, "Over the past 20 years, expenditures for education have increased 142% and Texas’ per-pupil costs have increased from $3,659 to $11,024 after adjusting for inflation." He’s correct that, adjusted for inflation, total spending went up 142 percent from 1988 through 2008. But that leaves out recent years, including those affected by 2011’s legislative changes. And focusing on the increase alone without taking into account growth factors, especially enrollment, can be misleading. A different measure, budgeted total spending, rose 72 percent from 1992 through 2012. Isaac indicated that per-pupil spending had tripled after adjusting for inflation. The correct amounts show it didn’t even double. So while Isaac’s comment has an element of truth -- spending did increase -- his first declared fact lacks vital context and the second is a substantial overstatement. We rate the overall statement as Mostly False.	None	Jason Isaac	None	None	None	2012-11-12T06:00:00	2012-10-22	['Texas']

pomt-09372	Charlie Crist "worked with Acorn" to give felons voting rights.	/florida/statements/2010/mar/29/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-charlie-crist-acorn-felon/	In their first U.S. Senate primary debate broadcast on FOX News Sunday, former state House speaker Marco Rubio continued to bash Gov. Charlie Crist's conservative credentials. "In 2006, governor, I voted for you because I trusted you when you said you would be a Jeb Bush Republican," Rubio said during the March 28, 2010, debate moderated by FOX's Chris Wallace. "Your record was something very different. You signed a budget that raised taxes. You tried to (propose) the cap and trade system in Florida. You appointed liberal supreme court justices to our supreme court. "In addition to that, you worked with ACORN and groups like that to give felons voting rights in Florida." We've already checked several claims from the Crist/Rubio showdown. In this item we wanted to explore Rubio's claim about felon voting rights, and Crist's alleged association with the community organizing group known as ACORN. First, on felon voter rights. Restoring voting rights for felons was a Crist campaign promise in 2006. And sure enough, in 2007 Crist and two state Cabinet members -- Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson, a Republican, and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democrat -- agreed to relax rules that kept felons from voting. Florida at the time was one of three states that required all felons to go through a cumbersome process requesting clemency, which dates back to 1868, to regain their civil rights -- which include the right to vote, serve on a jury, run for public office or apply for a professional license. Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican and the fourth member of the state clemency board, opposed the changes. The new rules automatically granted civil rights to an estimated 30,000 men and women whose clemency cases have been awaiting action, so long as they completed all terms of their sentences, including payment of restitution. "I believe in the appropriate punishment. I'm Chain Gang Charlie," Crist said, referencing a nickname he earned for proposing to restore chain gangs to Florida. "But when someone pays their debt to society, it is paid in full." The new rules didn't go as far as some wanted -- Maine and Vermont allow even incarcerated felons the right to vote -- but by June 2008 Crist said more than 115,000 ex-offenders had regained their civil rights. But what about the association with the big, bad wolf of social issue advocacy groups -- ACORN. ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in March 2010 in the wake of a video sting that showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The group, which sought more affordable housing options, a universal health care system and increased voter access, also faced questions -- mainly from conservatives -- about voter registration drives. The allegations caused an uproar across the country, and led Congress to cut off grant funding to the group. The group had three offices in Florida -- Margate in Broward County, Orlando and Miami. Crist has been tied to ACORN in the past. The Huffington Post reported that Crist partnered with ACORN in March 2008 for a "Homeownership Promotes The Economy" task force. Crist also met with ACORN leaders to discuss the foreclosure crisis, the St. Petersburg Times reported. And in October 2008, Crist downplayed concerns from the Republican National Committee that the integrity of Florida's voting system is at risk thanks to the registration efforts of ACORN. That was at least enough of a connection to prompt a letter in 2009 from then-underdog candidate Rubio. "The St. Petersburg Times also reported yesterday that your office may have partnered with ACORN in the past on several initiatives, including your 2007 effort to restore voting rights to convicted felons in Florida," Rubio wrote Crist on Sept. 17, 2009. "I believe it is now in the best interest of all Floridians for your office to provide a thorough accounting of its relationship with ACORN and what, if any, influence ACORN may have had in any actions you have taken on behalf of the people of Florida." In his letter, Rubio referenced a St. Petersburg Times report from Sept. 16, 2009. The only item discussing ACORN and Crist -- an online blog entry -- noted the Huffington Post item about Crist's choice not to attack ACORN ahead of the 2008 election. It also mentions that ACORN approved of Crist's effort to restore felon's rights, but it did not say he and the group worked together to do that. So we went to Stephanie Porta, ACORN's former Florida director. Porta said the Florida offices have been closed since December 2009. Porta laughed when she heard Rubio's claim. (She knows that ACORN is a pejorative in most Republican circles). "We've always been supportive of felon rights," Porta said. "We help people get their rights restored. But we never worked with the Crist campaign or Crist to make it happen." "We were just as shocked as everybody else that he did it," Porta said, noting that she ultimately hoped Crist would have gone further. In their first debate, Rubio tried to nick Crist's conservative credentials by claiming Crist worked with the beleaguered social advocacy group ACORN on a plan to restore felon voter rights in Florida. But we found no evidence that he did work with ACORN on felon voter rights and the Rubio campaign provided none itself. In fact, ACORN's top Florida executive said the group had nothing to do Crist's plan and was surprised he was considering it at all. We rate Rubio's claim False.

pomt-06490	Wisconsin bill "grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/14/robert-kraig/health-care-advocate-says-wisconsin-bill-would-giv/	When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called state lawmakers into special session on Sept. 28, 2011, he touted two dozen legislative initiatives he said would put Wisconsin back to work. Reiterating his campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs, the Republican governor asserted that more than anything else, "employers and workers want a sense of certainty." Health care advocate Robert Kraig, executive director of Citizen Action of Wisconsin, was certain he didn’t like what he saw in some of the bills on the table. Kraig’s Milwaukee-based group describes itself as a coalition that works to "advance progressive values and shape the public and political debate around health care, economic development and consumer protection." In a news release and in a blog post on Oct. 3, 2011, Kraig said several bills were "masquerading as job-creation measures which damage the civil justice rights of consumers who are injured by corporate malfeasance" -- in other words, curbing the rights of injured people to sue. "Shockingly," Kraig added, "one bill in the current session dangerously grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products." Immunity from lawsuits -- even in cases of injury and death? The bill Kraig criticized was proposed by Sen. Rich Zipperer, R-City of Pewaukee. As long as a drug or device is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the manufacturer or seller of that drug or medical device would be immune from liability, according to the non-partisan Legislative Reference Bureau. Zipperer spokewoman Hannah Huffman said, however, that there are exceptions. Immunity would not apply if FDA approval were gained through fraud, she said. And although manufacturers could not be sued for a defect in the design of a drug or device if the design had been approved by the FDA, the manufacturer could be sued if it failed to follow the design in the manufacturing process, she said. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families in Washington, D.C., told us she believes the immunity bill would apply to all drugs but perhaps not to all medical devices. Zuckerman, who has done research on the FDA approval processes, said it would depend on how the word approved is interpreted in the bill. Every year, only about 3 percent of new medical devices gain FDA approval, while the rest are "cleared" under a less-stringent process by the agency, she said. So, Zipperer’s bill gives broad immunity, with some exceptions, to drug makers but perhaps less immunity to device makers. We asked Kraig for evidence to back what essentially was a blanket statement that the bill "grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity." Kraig initially said his statement was "over broad and should have included the qualification that this bill covers drugs and medical devices approved by the FDA." Later he argued the statement was fair because most people, when they hear a reference to drug makers or medical device manufacturers, would understand that those companies make products that in the vast majority of cases must be approved by the FDA. Kraig also argued that the bill is dangerous because in recent years the FDA’s regulatory powers have been weakened and therefore its approval of a drug or device does not provide as much protection as it once did. As evidence, he cited a report that is critical of a Michigan law that gives immunity to drug manufacturers and that Kraig said is similar to the drug manufacturers part of the Wisconsin’s bill. And he cited a national report on problems people encountered after using drugs and medical devices that had received FDA approval. But arguing a bill is unnecessary or unwise does not get at the question we are examining: Whether the bill does what Kraig said it does in terms of immunity. Our conclusion Kraig said a bill proposed by a Wisconsin lawmaker "grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products." He acknowledged that his statement was "over broad," in that immunity applies only when FDA approval has been granted. The bill doesn’t give blanket protection to drug and device makers. But its primary intent is to give them immunity, with some exceptions. We rate Kraig’s statement Mostly True.	None	Robert Kraig	None	None	None	2011-10-14T09:00:00	2011-10-03	['None']
pomt-14213	Says Republican presidential candidate and Gov. John Kasich has spent 177 days out of state and used $350,000 in taxpayer money on his "costly campaign."	/ohio/statements/2016/apr/19/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-bashes-john-kasichs-costly-c/	In recent weeks, the national media has poked fun at John Kasich for chomping through Italian subs and pasta in the Bronx and eating pizza in Queens — with a knife and fork. Back home, Ohio Democrats talked about something else: the governor’s out-of-state travel, and what it costs taxpayers in the only state he has won. The Ohio Democratic Party posted a graphic on its Facebook page on April 8, 2016, to bolster its complaint. Kasich’s "costly campaign," the image says, entails 177 days spent out of state and a tab of $350,000 to taxpayers. How did they calculate the days and dollars? We decided to look into it. The party’s communications director, Kirstin Alvanitakis, pointed us to a March 26 Columbus Dispatch story reporting that Kasich has been out of state at least 177 days as he pursued the presidency. The Dispatch tally includes days he spent exploring the bid before his official announcement July 21, 2015. An Associated Press story contains the $350,000 figure. By law, a special unit within the state department of public safety is assigned to protect the governor, and nine state troopers guard him 24/7. So when he goes to Mike’s Deli, so do they. State funds from the public safety department’s non-highway program, which includes the governor’s security detail, is likely paying for rental cars, hotel rooms, flights, fuel, per diems and overtime while Kasich criss-crosses the country chasing delegates. But the Dispatch story describes how cagey state agencies are being with these specifics. Information that was public in the years before Kasich’s run is now shielded. On payroll records, the governor’s detail was previously listed as the "executive protection unit." Officials told the Dispatch that that designation that has been dropped to shield the troopers’ identities. "To ensure safety and security, we do not discuss any of the resources used as part of the executive security detail," is the response repeated by agency spokespersons and the governor’s campaign staff alike. The Associated Press used another tool to approximate the cost: an interactive, searchable "checkbook" of state spending hosted on the website of Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, part of his nationally recognized transparency initiative. We used the Ohio Checkbook to drill down into the data, which has been updated since the AP checked. Isolating the travel costs of the non-highway program, which is currently showing expenditures from July 1, 2015, through Feb. 2, 2016, the total now comes to $403,638. This chart shows how disproportionate the travel spending has been in 2016 so far, compared to prior years. Most of the transactions shown through the Ohio Checkbook lack details ("General Travel Expenses" is a recurring line item), but there are some expenditures that coincide with Kasich’s campaign stops. Like a batch of hotel rooms booked over a series of days in December at the Wynn Las Vegas, the Renaissance Des Moines, the Doubletree Salt Lake City, and the Hampton Inn of Waterloo, all around the time period last December when Kasich bounced from a debate in Nevada, to a town hall in Iowa, to a fundraiser in Utah, and back to Iowa. It’s not a staggering total, though some taxpayers might argue that $403,638 could be better spent on other state services. Kasich has poo-pooed any suggestions that he should drop out of the race before the Republican National Convention in July, which means the total taxpayer share from his campaign travel could continue to swell. (The average monthly spending from this fund in fiscal year 2016 is about $57,663. By comparison, $57,562 was the total spent in all of fiscal year 2014.) Other governors who ran for president have stuck taxpayers with tabs, too. Chris Christie’s security detail cost New Jersey taxpayers an estimated $614,000. Bobby Jindal racked up $400,000 in Louisiana during his considerably shorter run through November 2015. Wisconsin taxpayers paid Scott Walker’s security team $577,000 in overtime alone before he dropped out in September 2015. Walker reimbursed about $260,000 to the state for expenses his campaign incurred. So far, the Kasich campaign has refused to disclose details about his security detail or its resources, or whether he similarly intends to give taxpayers a refund. We did not hear a response from Kasich’s campaign, or spokesman Rob Nichols. Our ruling The Ohio Democratic Party said that in 177 days on the campaign trail, Kasich’s security detail cost taxpayers $350,000. Our analysis confirmed that $350,000 is most likely a conservative estimate. At the current rate, the total could be twice that by the RNC in July. Since neither state officials nor Kasich’s camp will confirm any details on the governor’s security, we have to rely on what we learned from the treasurer’s open records data. We rate this claim True. Update, April 20, 2016: After this item published, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel's checkbook tool updated to show expenditures for Feb. 2, 2016, through March 2, 2016, bringing Kasich's security travel spending to $475,976. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f55505e5-5211-4178-9fd0-7d1b2854c596	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2016-04-19T17:30:00	2016-04-08	['John_Kasich', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-05568	Says Barack Obama "is the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/04/mitt-romney/romney-obama-only-president-cut-medicare/	As Mitt Romney begins to pivot from the long Republican primary fight to a likely November duel with President Barack Obama, he is re-launching some of his most repeated -- and inaccurate -- attacks of the incumbent president. During an April 4, 2012, speech to the Newspaper Association of America -- a group Obama addressed the day prior -- Romney repeated several variants of claims that have gotten him in trouble with the Truth-O-Meter. He said that the Obama administration pledged to keep unemployment below 8 percent, a comment that we have previously rated Mostly False. He said repealing the federal health care law would save money, a comment we twice have ruled False. And Romney said Obama apologized for America abroad, a comment we first ruled False but later called Pants on Fire as Romney recycled the line. We’re not focusing on those falsehoods in this item. Rather we’ll explore a variation of something else Romney has said on the campaign trail and repeated in his speech to the newspaper editors’ group. Romney said that Obama is "the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare." This, in many ways, is a mash-up of two claims Romney has made before. Any PolitiFact regular has heard the $500 billion Medicare line before. We’ve fact-checked claims about the basic point several times from several officials. We’ve rated claims anywhere from Half True to False depending on how the attack was specifically worded. We checked Romney on a similar $500 billion claim from 2011. That reporting remains germane today. The reference point is the federal health care law, which makes several changes to Medicare. In a few cases, the law increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source that analyzes the health care system. For instance, the health care law added money to cover preventive services and to fill a gap for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. (That coverage gap is sometimes called the doughnut hole). Other provisions are designed to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage the program to operate more efficiently and to improve the delivery and quality of care in ways including reducing hospital re-admissions. The law does not take money out of the current Medicare budget but, rather, attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in anticipated spending increases over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So as we said then, and repeated several times since, the health care law reduces the amount of future spending growth in Medicare. But it doesn't cut Medicare. The rest of Romney’s statement implies that Obama is doing something no other president has done -- making cuts (which he isn’t). He made the same point in a December 2011 debate. We rated that particular claim False. John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, offered some historical perspective for us for that fact-check. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan in his first year in office signed an omnibus budget reconciliation act that raised Medicare deductibles for beneficiaries. Rother said he considers that a cut in benefits. Two years later, Reagan and Congress enacted legislation that changed the way Medicare reimbursed hospitals. The program’s costs had been growing exponentially as hospitals treated patients and then sent the federal government the bills. It was known as "retrospective cost-based reimbursement." The new law established a "prospective payment system," which categorized inpatient admission cases into what were called diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). In this system, Medicare pays hospitals a flat rate for each inpatient case. "The system was intended to motivate hospitals to change the way they deliver services. With DRGs, it did not matter what hospitals charged anymore -- Medicare capped their payments," according to a 2001 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General. The resulting savings to Medicare was $21 billion in the first three years, exceeding even Congressional Budget Office projections. It cut the program, Rother said, but did not affect benefits. In 1987, Reagan signed a law that expanded Medicare benefits, including drug and catastrophic illness coverage. But when George H.W. Bush took office, he repealed it. So Rother puts Bush in the column of presidents who cut Medicare for seniors. The Medicare program saw another major overhaul in 1997. President Bill Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act, which tightened payments to doctors, nursing homes, home health agencies and health insurance plans and expanded the types of private plans that could participate in Medicare (the part of the program now known as Medicare Advantage). Its goal was to trim $393.8 billion in spending over 10 years. But it’s a trickier question to answer whether that law cut benefits. "With Clinton, it’s an indirect effect," Rother said. "It did cut reimbursements to several providers who claimed they would not be able to serve the beneficiary population." The tally, then: Reagan cut Medicare by reducing payments to hospitals, and he cut benefits by raising deductibles. George H.W. Bush cut benefits by repealing a law that would have expanded coverage for drugs and catastrophic illness. Clinton cut Medicare by changing payments to doctors and other providers, which could be considered to have an indirect effect on beneficiaries. Obama cut future Medicare spending but expanded benefits. Our ruling Romney said Obama "is the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare." It wasn’t a cut, rather a reduction in future growth (the size of the Medicare program will increase dollar-wise). And other presidents have cut Medicare in the past, though you can debate whether specific changes to the program constitute a "cut" in some of those cases as well. That’s a historical footnote, however, that doesn’t affect our ruling. We rate Romney’s statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-04-04T16:54:16	2012-04-04	['None']
pomt-01994	"Already in Wisconsin we have seen fewer people pursuing education as a career" due to the Act 10 collective bargaining law.	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/13/mary-burke/act-10-has-cut-interest-teaching-careers-mary-burk/	Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke charges that Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees is hurting Wisconsin in the classroom. Burke, a Madison School Board member, argues the prospect of limited raises and costlier benefits under the Act 10 measure is turning people away from teaching. "Already we have seen in Wisconsin fewer people pursuing education as a career," she said April 18, 2014 in a meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters and editors. She attributed the trend to Act 10, adding: "We even see people certainly dropping out and saying, ‘I’m not sure I see a future in front of me in terms of pay and benefits where I’m going to be able to cover my student loans, be able to support myself and my family long term, and whether this is a profession that is going to be one that keeps good people.’" As a candidate, Burke says she would have sought greater pension and health insurance contributions from public employees -- but at the bargaining table with unions. When asked to back up her claim, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki offered statistics and anecdotal evidence. "During the course of the campaign Mary has had the opportunity to speak with teachers, students and experts from across Wisconsin who have shared their concerns about staying in or joining the educational field, and what the impacts of fewer educators will be on the state economy," he said. Burke also cited a December 2013 Wisconsin State Journal article. It reported two straight years of modest enrollment declines in UW-System undergraduate teacher education programs starting in 2011-12. That was the first full academic year after the enactment of Act 10 in early 2011. The total two-year enrollment drop was 2.9%, or 207 fewer students from a base of 7,166. In contrast, before 2011-12, the enrollment had risen 7% in two years.. We confirmed those figures and obtained new UW-System data showing the decline picked up steam in the most recent academic year, 2013-14. The three-year drop is 8.3 percent. Cause and effect Burke directly blamed Act 10 for the enrollment fall-off. But when we took a closer look at the numbers and interviewed leaders in teacher training, several problems emerged. First, the enrollment downturn was not just a Wisconsin phenomenon. Nationally, enrollment in teacher training programs dropped 8 percent in 2011-12 over the year before, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. (The 2012-13 figures were not available as of June 10, 2014). Among neighboring states, Minnesota and Illinois saw double-digit downturns that year. Iowa and Michigan saw little change, but had seen major declines in 2010-11. All this strongly suggests broader forces at work. Second, the downturn in the UW-System’s undergraduate education-training enrollment is a long-term trend. Between 2003 and 2013, enrollment declined in eight of the 10 years, falling a total of 14 percent, or 1,110 students. The exception to that trend came in the uptick from 2008 to 2010, right before Act 10. Setting that aside, there’s an even bigger problem for Burke’s claim. The UW-System totals Burke cited as backup do not include thousands of students enrolled in education programs at more than 25 private colleges and universities, or those in alternative training programs not connected to higher education institutions. The federal Department of Education data covers all sources, and at first glance it helps Burke. It shows that in the post-Act 10 year, 2011-12 Wisconsin enrollment dropped 7% from the year before, from 11,780 to 10,998. But the decline actually started a year earlier, in the 2010 academic year -- six months before Act 10 even was proposed. All this makes it dicey at best to draw a straight line between Act 10 and enrollment drops. Leaders debate trends Cheryl Hanley-Maxwell, associate dean of the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says applications are down there, but not enrollment. As for the recent drop-off in the broader UW-System, she told the State Journal in December and PolitiFact Wisconsin that it’s unclear what’s behind it. "We have no way of attributing changes to Act 10," she told us. "I don’t know that it’s Act 10." The drop may prove an anomaly, Hanley-Maxwell said, or reflect the economic downturn, cutbacks in teacher positions and education courses, and a "beat up on teachers" attitude in today’s polarized political circles. Other experts mention the proliferation of costly exams and assessments that would-be teachers face before getting a license. For a perspective on private and public schools, we spoke with Reid Riggle, an education professor at St. Norbert College. He’s led the Wisconsin Independent Colleges of Teacher Education and is president-elect of the Wisconsin Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, which includes public and private schools. At St. Norbert’s, enrollment has fallen significantly in his introductory education classes, and he wonders if it’s the economy, a need for more scholarships or other factors. "We are in a trough right now," Riggle said. "It doesn’t mean we won’t get out of the trough or that Act 10 was the cause." Riggle told us the reduced financial security caused by the Walker legislation makes it less desirable to be a Wisconsin teacher than it was prior to Act 10. But he added: "It is difficult to clearly provide specific numbers on the impact of Act 10." A final note about enrollment in master’s level continuing education courses taken by existing teachers. Those students were not part of our analysis because Burke’s claim and her evidence centered on undergraduates trying to get their initial license. It’s worth noting, though, that a gradual decline in master’s level enrollment in education has accelerated dramatically since Act 10. Melanie Agnew, UW-Whitewater’s education dean and president of the Wisconsin Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, joined others in attributing that dropoff to Act 10, which allowed school districts to discontinue giving salary credit for higher education courses and degrees. Our rating Burke claimed that, "Already in Wisconsin we have seen fewer people pursuing education as a career" due to the Act 10 collective bargaining law. There’s an element of truth here, in that enrollment has declined since Act 10’s adoption. But that correlation doesn’t prove that Act 10 caused the drop. In fact, the Wisconsin trend predates Act 10 and coincides with a national drop in students in teacher training. And education-school leaders offer a host of other possible explanations for the fall-off. We rate Burke’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-08894	"In renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects, Ohio now ranks first among the 50 states."	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/30/ted-strickland/ohio-gov-ted-strickland-touts-two-year-old-advance/	Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland is on a mission to prove that a traditionally blue-collar, manufacturing state can make the transition to become a leader in the futuristic green energy industry. And he is touting his leadership for bringing the state recognition. "In renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects, Ohio now ranks first among the 50 states," Strickland said during a July 6 speech at the Ohio Democratic Party headquarters in Columbus. The governor said he was convinced when he took office more than three years ago that the right energy policies, coupled with Ohio’s manufacturing history and infrastructure, could be the foundation to build the state into an energy leader. And he rattled off a list of green energy accolades for the state, including this No. 1 ranking in renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects. But is it true? Ohio got the ranking in July 2008 for bringing in more new facility projects than any other state between 2005 and 2007. Strickland took office in January 2007. The ranking was contained in The Conway New Plant Report and reported in the July 2008 issue of SITE Selection magazine, an economic development trade publication. The Ohio Business Development Coalition touted the ranking in a news release in August 2008. But the report and rankings have not been updated since 2008 and there are no plans to do so, said Adam Bruns, SITE Selection’s managing editor. The magazine has moved on to analyzing, reviewing and ranking cities and states on other advanced energy-related projects, he says. In some respects, that means Ohio could argue that it’s still No. 1 and Strickland would be correct. But we think it’s a significant omission by the governor to not mention that the ranking is two years old, particularly when he is touting it as an example of successful policy. In fact, some of the accomplishments for which the state was recognized by SITE’s report actually occurred before Strickland took office. So we rate Strickland’s statement Half True.

pomt-07240	It is estimated that Arizona "has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues since passage of the Arizona immigration laws."	/georgia/statements/2011/may/31/anti-defamation-league/adl-makes-claims-about-losses-arizonas-tourism-ind/	Critics accused Georgia’s new Arizona-style illegal immigration enforcement law of violating civil and human rights. "Inhumane," they called it, and "the civil rights issue of the 21st century." The Anti-Defamation League also accused the law of crimes against the economy. The law, they said, is "anti-business." Major cities and organizations voted to boycott or avoid travel to Arizona after that state passed its tough law last year. "Convention and tourism business will likely dip, as it did in Arizona, where it is estimated the state has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues since passage of the Arizona immigration laws," the ADL said in a news release April 15. The claim that estimates show Arizona lost $100 million in hospitality industry revenue intrigued us. Is the ADL right? Atlanta business leaders fear it is. Last month, the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau's executive committee unanimously passed a resolution opposing Georgia’s law, called House Bill 87. Arizona’s law requires police to ask a person about his immigration status if they have "reasonable suspicion" he or she is in the country illegally. One provision of Georgia’s law gives officers more authority to check a suspect’s immigration status. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a separate 2007 Arizona law requiring certain employers to use the federal database E-Verify to check whether their new employees are eligible to work in this country legally. We asked Bill Nigut, the ADL’s Southeast regional director, for evidence backing his group’s claim about economic losses. He referred us to news accounts from Foxnews.com, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Phoenix Business Journal. Two May 2010 articles from The Wall Street Journal said the city of Phoenix estimated Arizona’s immigration crackdown could cost it $90 million in convention and hotel business. The Foxnews.com article cited a report from the Center for American Progress, a progressive group that thinks Arizona’s immigration approach is bad for the economy, that put the loss at $141 million. The rest did not give specific estimates but quoted experts who said the controversy hurt Arizona’s tourism business. We took a closer look at the Phoenix and Center for American Progress estimates. Both have limitations. Hotels and convention centers are not required to report lost business to the city or the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association, which did some of the research on which estimates are based. Not all major convention sites are part of the association, and the group did not poll its members for more data. Plus, it’s hard to measure how many conventions would have booked in Arizona if there were no boycott. The city of Phoenix released its $90 million economic loss projection in May 2010. The figure was based on a list of about 20 events whose organizers either canceled or expressed concerns over the state’s illegal immigration crackdown, according to The Arizona Republic. The figure represents how much conventioneers would have spent in the region over five years. Actual boycott losses are unclear. So far, four groups have canceled their events at the city-run Phoenix Convention Center at an estimated loss of $26 million in business, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. They would have brought 18,100 delegates, who on average spend $1,451 each on hotels, restaurants, entertainment, transportation and other expenses. Phoenix’s figure does not include losses from conventions canceled at venues that are not city-run or future declines from events that never booked. It also does not account for indirect losses (the money businesses would have spent on supplies to serve conventioneers) or induced losses (household spending by people who would have been employed). Now, we look at figures from the Center for American Progress. It contracted with Elliott D. Pollack & Co., an established economic research and analysis firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., to determine the boycott’s impact on the state’s convention industry. The November 2010 report found the state had already lost $141 million in direct spending on hotels and lodging, restaurants and other areas. With indirect and induced spending, Arizona lost $253 million in economic output. Jim Rounds, an economist with Elliott D. Pollack & Co., noted that while tourism did lose money because of the cancellations, a portion of the declines were likely due to cuts in state funding for tourism advertising. Also, because few businesses would comment on the record on their losses, his estimate captures only "roughly half" of the total impact on tourism from the Arizona controversy. We asked economists Bruce Seaman of Georgia State University and Tom Smith of Emory University’s Goizueta Business School to review the Center for American Progress study. They brought up shortcomings that were similar to ones Rounds acknowledged but otherwise said the analysis made sense. Let’s sum up: The ADL’s claim that "it is estimated the state has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues" has some significant shortcomings. No group the ADL cited placed the losses at $100 million. The Center for American Progress placed the direct losses more than 40 percent higher. Phoenix’s estimate was 10 percent lower, limited to city losses and expected to take place over five years. These, however, are all just estimates and projections. The ADL’s point was that the tourism industry has and will lose millions of dollars. The overall idea that Arizona will likely lose big money because of the new immigration law is correct. The ADL statement, however, leaves out important details and context. That fits our definition of Half-True.	None	Anti-Defamation League	None	None	None	2011-05-31T06:00:00	2011-04-15	['Arizona']

He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees (women’s unemployment) the lowest it’s been in now almost 19 years."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-target-remarks-unemployment-kanye/	President Donald Trump took to the airwaves to tout his budding bromance with rapper Kanye West. The hosts of Fox & Friends asked Trump during an April 26 telephone interview about the enthusiastic tweets exchanged between the two men, such as this one. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Trump turned his sudden friendship with West into a commentary about the economic results on his watch. Trump said, "Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees (women’s unemployment) the lowest it’s been in now almost 19 years." Trump has previously made claims of this sort, but it’s been a few months, so we thought we’d take a new look at the numbers. African-American unemployment In March 2018, the African-American unemployment rate stood at 6.9 percent. That’s not a record low, but it’s close — and the record low was 6.8 percent in December 2017, also on Trump’s watch. Here’s the full data for the black unemployment rate since the statistic was first calculated in 1972: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Hispanic unemployment The Hispanic unemployment rate was 5.1 percent in March 2018. That’s not a record either, but once again, it’s close. The Hispanic unemployment rate was as low as 4.8 percent three times in 2017, in June, October and November. Those low points all occurred on Trump’s watch. Here’s the full historical data: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Women’s unemployment Currently, the unemployment rate for women is 4.0 percent. It was slightly lower during an earlier point in Trump’s presidency — 3.9 percent in October 2017. The women’s unemployment rate was lower still in December 2000, when it hit 3.8 percent. That falls within the 19-year windowTrump cited. Here’s the full run of data: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Some additional context Economists agree that presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. And to the extent that a president does deserve credit for low unemployment, Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, deserves at least as much as Trump does. As these charts show, the unemployment rate for blacks, Hispanics, and women declined dramatically on Obama’s watch as the country pulled out of the Great Recession. Black unemployment peaked at 16.6 percent in April 2010, when Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 percent by the time Obama left office in January 2017. Hispanic unemployment, meanwhile, peaked at 13 percent in August 2009, then fell to 5.9 percent at the end of Obama’s term in January 2017. And unemployment among women peaked at 9 percent in November 2010, before falling to 4.8 percent by the time he left office in January 2017, a drop of nearly half. Our ruling Trump said, "Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees (women’s unemployment) the lowest it’s been in now almost 19 years." The unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics have hit all-time lows in recent months on Trump’s watch, and the rate for women was recently the lowest it’s been in more than 18 years. But it’s worth remembering that,to the extent that presidents deserve any credit for economic conditions on their watch, the heavy lifting in getting rates that low occurred before Trump became president.

pomt-01770	Says Mark Pryor "continues to insist" that Obamacare is "an amazing success."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/29/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-says-mark-pryor-continues-insist-obamac/	Tom Cotton says Mark Pryor is out-of-touch on a lot of things, especially health care. Cotton, the representative from Arkansas running for Senate, ties the incumbent Democrat’s vote for the Affordable Care Act to an unbridled loyalty to President Barack Obama and his party, rather than to Arkansas. In numerous ads, interviews and releases, the Cotton campaign has blasted his opponent’s support of the health care legislation, frequently bringing up that Pryor said the law has been an "amazing success." "Sen. Pryor voted for Obamacare, and he continues to insist that it’s an 'amazing success,'" a recent email to supporters said. Yes, Pryor voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2009, and he doesn’t shy away from that vote. But has he been such a valiant supporter throughout his campaign? First, we looked to see if and when Pryor first said the Affordable Care Act was an "amazing success." We found that the statement comes from comments Pryor made Aug. 6, 2013, during a visit to Mercy Hospital in Rogers, Ark. This was months before the rocky rollout of healthcare.gov, the Affordable Care Act online exchange. "Well, I would say if you want a good opinion about Obamacare, go right here to Mercy Hospital and ask them how they feel about it. It’s been an amazing success story so far. Now the other side won’t ever tell you that. They won’t tell you all the good things that are working," he said to a local television reporter. We can’t be certain if he was saying the legislation was an "amazing success" overall, or if it was a success at Mercy Hospital, specifically, though his campaign says it was the latter. The same week he made those comments, he also said at a different event that Mercy Hospital added 100 new jobs because of the Affordable Care Act. A few months later, at an event with voters Dec. 4, an attendee asked Pryor whether he still believes the law was an "amazing success," according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Pryor said he had made that comment immediately after meeting with hospital administrators who believed the health care law would benefit them because so many of their patients are poor. "For a lot of hospitals, that is going to keep the doors open, and that is a success right there to try to keep the rural hospital doors open," he said at the event. Cotton’s campaign said Pryor "continues to insist" that the law has been an "amazing success." But looking through news reports, it seems that his August comments were the only time Pryor has used the phrase "amazing success" in conjunction with the Affordable Care Act. Throughout his campaign, Pryor has followed the pattern of other Senate Democrats running for re-election by saying he supports the Affordable Care Act, but there are still changes and improvements to be made. "Let me say on the front end: The Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. We need to go in and reform it and fix it," he said on Aug. 8, the same week he made the "amazing success" comment. He has publicly held that stance as early as March 2010, when he released a statement discussing potential amendments to the law, and he has maintained it through recent months. This June, he told Politico that "the law ‘isn’t perfect’ and that he would ‘work to make it better,’ but ‘something needed to be done’ to rein in the insurance industry." Here are some of his other statements on the Affordable Care Act since the "amazing success" comment: Dec. 4, 2013 -- At the Political Animals Club in Little Rock, he said the law would be beneficial to Arkansas’ rural hospitals, according to Arkansas News Bureau. He said of the vote, "I do remember that there were a lot of other things included in there. You run into this sometimes, where maybe you like one idea in something but they put a bunch of other stuff in there that makes it to where it’s something I couldn’t vote for." Feb. 8, 2014 -- Pryor gave an interview to the Pine Bluff Commercial in which he said, "With large pieces of legislation like this, if you get 80 percent of it right, then you are doing well," and that he would vote for the law again. April 14, 2014 -- KARK television asked Pryor if he would vote for the law again. "You know, I would have," he said. "Of course, I would want to see changes back then. But I think on something like this, it's big, it's complicated, it's difficult. If you get 80 percent of this right, you've really done something. We probably did get 80 percent of it right. We need to go back and really work on that other 20 percent and get it going in the right direction." June 13, 2014 -- At the Delta Grassroots Caucus Conference, he said the law is not perfect, but he is working on ways to fix it. "When I talk to my Republican friends about it I say, give me something better and I’ll vote for it," he said, according to Arkansas News Bureau. Our ruling The Cotton campaign said Pryor "continues to insist" that Obamacare is "an amazing success." We found that Pryor said the Affordable Care Act was an "amazing success," but he was likely saying it was a success for a particular hospital he was visiting at the time. That comment came a year ago, and Pryor has not repeated it since. The comment also doesn’t fit with Pryor’s usual talking point -- that the law is not perfect, but it’s a step in the right direction.

pomt-14011	Says "Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/	During her take-no-prisoners foreign policy speech on June 2, Hillary Clinton reminded listeners of controversial things that Republican presidential rival Donald Trump has said over the years. At one point, Clinton said, "Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese." Did he? Yes, though he later said it was a joke. The original source of this claim was a tweet Trump sent on Nov. 6, 2012, as we noted in a January 2016 fact-check of a similar claim by Clinton’s Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders. Trump’s tweet said, "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." So Clinton certainly has evidence to support her claim. But we should also note that Trump backed off his claim after Sanders noted them in January on NBC’s Meet the Press, calling the Chinese link a "joke." On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump’s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, "Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business." Trump may call the mention of China’s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word "hoax" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a "hoax" Pants on Fire.) On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., "Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it." That’s three times using "hoax" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since his 2012 tweet. On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, "NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?" On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: "Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!" That same day, he tweeted, "Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense." Trump also called climate change a "hoax" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN’s New Day, "I don’t believe in climate change." And on Jan. 18, 2016, Trump said that climate change "is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change." We didn’t find Trump using the word "hoax" in the months since our previous fact-check, but he hasn’t backed off his aggressive skepticism of climate change and policies designed to alleviate it. In fact, he’s enshrined opposition to climate change efforts as a key part of his platform. In a high-profile speech on energy policy in North Dakota on May 26, 2016, Trump attacked "draconian climate rules." He advocated rescinding "all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan" and said he would "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs." "President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords unilaterally and without the permission of Congress," Trump said. "This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America." Our ruling Clinton said, "Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese." Trump did tweet that view in 2012, though he made efforts earlier this year to describe that remark as a "joke." However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a "hoax" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China "invented" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change "is done for the benefit of China."

pomt-06190	More Hispanics "have been elected statewide (in Texas) on the Republican ticket than on the Democratic ticket."	/texas/statements/2011/dec/12/republican-party-texas/texas-gop-chair-says-more-hispanics-have-won-state/	Questioning how a panel of San Antonio federal judges redrew legislative districts that had been passed into law by the Republican-controlled 2011 Legislature, the Republican Party of Texas also challenged the idea that the judges protected Hispanic voting rights. Republican Chairman Steve Munisteri said in a Dec. 5, 2011, email blast that the court "seems to fail to take into account the fact that more Hispanics have been elected statewide on the Republican ticket than on the Democratic ticket." Wait a sec. We recall that Texans elected Democrat Dan Morales, a San Antonio state representative, as attorney general of Texas in 1990. He won re-election in 1994. No other Latino candidate has been elected to a statewide executive position. In the judiciary, Texans elected Democrat Raul Gonzalez to the Texas Supreme Court. He was initially appointed to the highest Texas civil court by Democratic Gov. Mark White in late 1984 before becoming the first Hispanic elected statewide in 1986. He stayed on the court through 1998. So, have Republicans elected more Hispanics to statewide office? Refresher: There are 29 statewide elected posts -- two U.S. Senate seats, six executive-like positions (governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, state comptroller, land commissioner and agriculture commissioner), three seats on the Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees the energy sector, and nine seats each on the Texas Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals. By email, Munisteri told us that he based his count of Hispanic winners on Texas state directories listing elected officials. Munisteri said he identified only two Democrats of Hispanic descent elected to statewide office -- Gonazalez and Morales, who did not seek re-election in 1998 and ultimately served prison time for financial misdeeds. Latino Republicans elected statewide have included Al Gonzales, who won a race for the Texas Supreme Court in 2000 before joining George W. Bush in Washington, and Tony Garza and Victor Carrillo, who won Texas Railroad Commission races in 1998 and 2004, respectively. Garza later resigned to serve as U.S. ambassador to Mexico. Also, Munisteri noted, Republicans David Medina and Eva Guzman were each elected to the Supreme Court. Medina and Guzman, both initially appointed by GOP Gov. Rick Perry, won election in 2006 and 2010, respectively, according to election results from 1992 through 2010 posted online by the Texas secretary of state’s office. Both are currently on the nine-person court. Carrillo attempted to win another term last year, but lost his party’s nomination to David Porter of Giddings, who went on to win the seat. After the primary, Carrillo said his Hispanic surname doomed him, writing supporters: "Early polling showed that the typical GOP primary voter has very little info about the position of Railroad Commissioner, what we do, or who my opponent or I were. Given the choice between 'Porter' and 'Carrillo' — unfortunately, the Hispanic surname was a serious setback from which I could never recover although I did all in my power to overcome this built-in bias," according to a March 3, 2010, news article in the Austin American-Statesman. That article also quoted an unidentified Republican official saying Carrillo tumbled because he didn’t energetically campaign. Notably, too, Latino candidates have occasionally been appointed to statewide offices only to lose at the polls. The late Lena Guerrero, an Austin Democrat, lost her 1992 bid to remain on the Texas Railroad Commission to Republican Barry Williamson. In 2002, Republican Xavier Rodriguez, appointed to the Supreme Court by Gov. Rick Perry, was defeated in his party’s primary by little-known Stephen Wayne Smith. Also, Texas Democrats have nominated multiple Latinos for statewide posts who went on to lose, in great part because Republicans have won every statewide contest since 1996. Defeated Democratic nominees include Senate nominees Victor Morales and Rick Noriega, gubernatorial aspirant Tony Sanchez, land commissioner nominees Richard Raymond and Hector Uribe, Supreme Court nominees Margaret Mirabal and Linda Yanez and four-time Court of Criminal Appeals nominee JR Molina. Side note: Perry named Elsa Alcala to the Court of Criminal Appeals in May 2011 to a term through 2012. She has filed her candidacy for election next year to a full six-year term. So, the tally comes out to five Republican Hispanics elected statewide and two Democrats. End of story? Not entirely. Munisteri’s omits some important context about Texas politics: No Democrat, regardless of ethnicity, has won statewide office for 15 years. Put another way, no Latino Republicans won statewide until after every statewide Republican nominee started prevailing.Conversely, Democrats weren’t electing many Hispanics when they dominated Texas politics, either. We rate Munisteri’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-14136	Says Bruce Springsteen "only had 8,000 tickets sold" for a Greensboro show and canceled after "they didn’t get the ticket sales they wanted."	/north-carolina/statements/2016/may/04/pat-mccrory/pat-mccrory-says-springsteen-canceled-north-caroli/	Gov. Pat McCrory took shots at critics of North Carolina’s controversial new law, commonly known as HB2, during a morning radio appearance May 3 on The John Boy and Billy Big Show. The law banned transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify as, banned cities from enacting their own minimum wages or LGBT-friendly discrimination laws and got rid of anyone’s ability to file a discrimination lawsuit in state court. It was widely panned by progressive politicians as well as entertainers, some of whom even canceled shows in the Tar Heel State. On the show McCrory, with encouragement from John Boy and Billy, went through a laundry list of critics he said were mistaken or hypocritical. The show’s titular hosts – two down-home comedians with a conservative bent – are based in Charlotte and are broadcast in the morning rush hour throughout the country, primarily on rock stations. So it was no surprise that Bruce Springsteen’s name was brought up – although it was McCrory, not the hosts, who broached the subject of the rocker who is arguably the biggest name to have canceled a show in North Carolina over the new law. "Some things are more important than a rock show, and this fight against prejudice and bigotry – which is happening as I write – is one of them," Springsteen wrote April 8 in announcing the decision to cancel his April 10 show. McCrory, however, implied that perhaps The Boss doesn’t command the adoration he once did – and that his cancellation was actually a ploy to avoid the embarrassing optics of a half-empty concert. "I love Bruce Springsteen," McCrory said. "I love his music. But he canceled a concert in Greensboro. By the way, they only had 8,000 tickets sold, with all respect. Hmm. But Bruce doesn’t mention that. They didn’t get the ticket sales they wanted." That got a hearty laugh from everyone on set, and McCrory later repeated that 8,000 number. Where'd he hear that? Here at PolitiFact North Carolina, we’ve seen our fair share of videos from Springsteen’s live shows (mostly to marvel at Nils Lofgren’s guitar solos). The crowds are always sizeable, if not sold out. We would be quite surprised if Springsteen had sold only half the tickets to his Greensboro show just two days before the concert. The Greensboro Coliseum, where he had been scheduled to play, can seat more than 20,000 people. Stadium officials said the capacity for the Springsteen concert was actually about 16,000 due to stage and seating logistics. So that 8,000 number, if true, would say a lot about Springsteen – especially keeping in mind that the Coliseum tracks attendance for all of its shows, and Bruuuuuuuuuuuce has two of the 20 largest crowds in stadium history. But those were years ago, in 2002 and 2009. Is McCrory right that North Carolinians in 2016 don’t care much for the Jersey rocker’s music, much less his liberal views? Was he really only using a convenient political stance to cover up embarrassing sales numbers? No, according to the Greensboro Coliseum. Andrew Brown, the arena’s PR director, told us Springsteen had sold more than 15,000 tickets. "No idea where 8,000 may have come from," Brown said, adding that there were fewer than 100 tickets left when Springsteen canceled with two days’ notice. "It’s safe to say it would have sold out," he said. Like Brown, we also have no idea where the 8,000 number came from. McCrory’s campaign hasn’t responded to our questions, but we’ll update this if we hear back. The Greensboro Coliseum previously reported that Springsteen’s cancellation cost it $100,000. Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Demi Lovato/Nick Jonas and Ani DiFranco have also canceled, while such acts as Jimmy Buffett, Beyonce and Mumford & Sons have played but spoken out against the law from on stage or in written statements. As for Springsteen, the more-than-15,000-tickets number is the same figure the coliseum reported immediately after the cancellation, which was weeks before McCrory questioned the attendance. We appreciate the consistency, which keeps us from dancing in the dark to try to figure out the truth. Our ruling McCrory was way off on the number of tickets sold, which was widely reported before his radio appearance. What's more, he used that incorrect number to suggest that was why Springsteen canceled. In fact, the arena said the show was on the verge of selling out, not half empty. That’s not just false – ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, it’s on fire. Pants on Fire! UPDATE: McCrory apologizes The night after our fact-check went up, we heard back from Pat McCrory’s office about his claim that only 8,000 tickets had been sold. Although he’s standing by another claim he made – that he loves Springsteen’s music – McCrory admitted he was wrong about the sales figure and that it was the reason for the cancellation. "The governor apologizes for using the wrong number," wrote his spokesman, Josh Ellis, in an email to PolitiFact North Carolina. "It’s too bad Bruce Springsteen actually canceled on nearly 15,000 people at the last minute. Regardless, the governor is still keeping his Springsteen albums despite their political disagreements." https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8810b36b-ac00-4caf-bcc4-42e9dba89087	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-05-04T18:31:36	2016-05-03	['Greensboro,_North_Carolina', 'Bruce_Springsteen']

pomt-05733	Pasco County schools have graduation rates "substantially higher than the state average" and dropout rates "below the state average."	/florida/statements/2012/mar/04/heather-fiorentino/pasco-county-schools-have-graduation-rates-above-s/	In seeking reelection to a third term, Pasco County schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino is touting the district’s record as proof of her successful leadership. In a press release announcing her bid, she cited statistics ranging from graduation rates to the number of new schools built as evidence that "the District School Board of Pasco County continues to shine with Fiorentino at the helm." Fiorentino’s facts and figures are generally correct, but they don’t always tell the full story. We evaluated several statements from her press release. Here, we're looking at whether the district has graduation rates "substantially higher than the state average" and dropout rates "below the state average." The press release puts it this way: The district "increased graduation rate of 88.5 percent (Florida calculation) and 85.5 percent (National Governors Association calculation), which are substantially higher than the state average." It also "secured [a] dropout rate of 1.0 percent, which has plummeted below the state average." State reports show that Fiorentino rightly states the district’s graduation rates, and that they are higher than state averages, which were 81.2 percent and 80.1 percent, according to the two different calculations. Pasco’s rates are also up significantly from 2006-07 on both the state (73.7 percent) and governors association (67.8 percent) measures. Pasco also was among a small handful of districts that did not have significant gaps in the rates among its various demographic groups. Fiorentino accurately touts the district’s improved dropout rate. State reports show the district dropout rate was 1.0 percent for 2010-11, down from 3.5 percent in 2006-07. The overall state rates were 3.3 percent in 2006-07 and 1.9 percent in 2010-11, so Pasco did show better improvement than the state. Fiorentino is on solid ground in these two numeric claims about the district’s academic performance. We rate this claim True.

pomt-03658	Says more Austinites voted in the city’s 1973 election featuring a mayor’s race than in the city’s most recent mayoral election.	/texas/statements/2013/apr/30/bee-moorhead/austin-resident-says-turnout-higher-1973-city-elec/	Austin resident Bee Moorhead, attending a "civic summit" hosted by Austin’s KLRU-TV, Channel 18, said in a Twitter message posted from the scene: "More people voted in 1973 election when Roy Butler was elected mayor than in the most recent Austin mayoral election." Did more voters turn out out for the election involving Butler, who served as mayor from 1971 to 1975, than the May 2012 election giving Mayor Lee Leffingwell another term? After all, Austin kaboomed in size and population in the intervening decades. By phone, Moorhead said her April 23, 2013, tweet echoed a remark by Ryan Robinson, the city’s demographer, during discussion at the summit of voter-adopted plans to elect Austin City Council members from separate districts rather than citywide. Moorhead told us Robinson might even have said that Butler by himself drew more votes in 1973 than Leffingwell got in 2012. Robinson confirmed his reference to total voter turnout in 1973 and 2012, but told us by phone he did not compare how many votes the mayors drew in the elections nearly four decades apart. It’s no secret that citizen interest in local elections has been on a downslide. According to a Sept. 13, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, in the spring of 1971, 57 percent of the city's 93,597 registered voters came to the polls for that year’s mayoral election. In 1981, 38 percent of registered voters turned out for the city’s mayoral election, the story said, with turnout dipping to 23 percent in the 1991 mayoral election, 15 percent in 2003 and 10 percent in the 2012 election that gave Leffingwell a second term. Given that Moorhead’s claim referred to the voters turning out in 1973 and 2012, we checked city records for precise details. According to one city web page, 63,478 of 151,368 registered voters, 42 percent, turned out for the April 7, 1973 election in which Butler won reelection as mayor. On May 12, 2012, according to another city web page, 49,336 of 461,146 registered voters, 11 percent, participated in the election including Leffingwell’s reelection bid. (Also, Butler drew 43,753 votes, Leffingwell 25,446.) The city web pages indicate the city’s population nearly tripled in the years in between, rising from 290,300 in 1973 to 824,205 in 2012. Upshot: There were 14,142 fewer voters in the 2012 city election compared to 1973. Our ruling Moorhead tweeted that more Austinites voted in the city’s 1973 election featuring a mayor’s race than in the city’s most recent mayoral election. Nearly 63,500 voters cast ballots in April 1973. Less than 49,400 participated in May 2012. We rate this claim as True.	None	Bee Moorhead	None	None	None	2013-04-30T06:00:00	2013-04-23	['None']
pomt-12850	"About three-quarters of (Syrian refugees) are women and children. A full third of them are kids under 12 years old."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/02/keith-ellison/rep-keith-ellison-correct-demographic-overview-syr/	Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., pushed back on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump to indefinitely suspend admission of Syrian refugees, calling it a Muslim ban and arguing that the order affects many women and children. "When you try to ban refugees, these folks go through an 18-to-24-month vetting as it is," Ellison said Jan. 29 on CBS’ Face the Nation. "The fact is, is that Syrian -- if you talk about banning Syrians, about three-quarters of those folks are women and children. A full third of them are kids under 12 years old." Ellison, who is vying to lead the Democratic National Committee, accurately cited data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We previously explored the demographic makeup of Syrian refugees when Trump, as a candidate, made false claims that most Syrian refugees were actually strong men. (For background on Trump’s immigration executive order, check out our explainer.) UN’s refugee agency data There are more than 4.89 million Syrian refugees according to the UN’s latest count. That total accounts for about 2 million refugees registered by the UNHCR (in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon), 2.8 million registered by the Turkish government and more than 29,000 registered in North Africa. Ellison referenced a UNHCR regional demographic breakdown based on refugees registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. To determine a figure for women and children, Ellison summed the percentage of registered Syrian males under 18 years old with the percentage of women of all ages -- it comes out to about 73 percent, according to data last updated Jan. 19. Factoring in women of all ages and boys under 12 years old, it's about 66 percent. Ellison’s other point about "a full third" of refugees being younger than 12 years old also checks out for the UNHCR group. About 17 percent relocated to Egypt, Jordan, Iraq or Lebanon are boys and about 16 percent are girls. We wanted to know if the demographics were similar for the larger pool of 2.8 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. They are. In Turkey, about 70 percent of registered Syrian refugees are women of all ages and males under 18. About 30 percent are children under 12 years old, according to data last updated Jan. 12. Women of all ages and boys under 12 years old represent about 62 percent of the population. A demographic report for the estimated 29,000 refugees in North Africa (Egypt included in other UNHCR report) was not available. Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, said there's a large Syrian community in Libya and that it's likely many Syrian refugees there have not been registered. The flow of Syrians to Libya after 2011 has been much greater than 29,000, Mock said. Syrian refugees have also gone to Tunisia, though the number there is less than 1,000 registered Syrian refugees according to a UNHCR fact sheet, he said. The United States accepted 12,587 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 (Oct. 1, 2015-Sept. 30, 2016) and fewer than 2,000 in fiscal 2015. Prior to that, the most Syrian refugees the Obama administration had accepted was 105, according to data from the State Department's Refugee Processing Center. Here's a breakdown of fiscal year 2016 admissions: - Total: 12,587 - Male: 6,571 - Female: 6,016 - Boys and girls under 14 years old: 6,118 (about 48.61 percent of admissions) Our ruling Ellison said, "About three-quarters of (Syrian refugees) are women and children. A full third of them are kids under 12 years old." With only slight rounding, Ellison is correct on average for Syrian refugees registered in Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. A demographic breakdown is not available for more than 29,000 refugees in other North African countries, which represent less than 1 percent of all registered Syrian refugees.

pomt-04612	"The Providence Economic Development Partnership . . .which you [Cicilline] chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/18/brendan-doherty/brendan-doherty-says-cicilline-campaign-worker-nev/	EDITOR's NOTE: On Sept. 16, 2012, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as Mostly False a statement by Republican congressional candidate Brendan Doherty that was directed at U.S. Rep. David Cicilline. Doherty said: "The Providence Economic Development Partnership . . which you [Cicilline] chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan." In light of additional evidence, we are changing our rating to Mostly True and providing this new analysis. Republican congressional candidate Brendan Doherty leveled a host of charges against his Democratic opponent U.S. Rep. David Cicilline one day after Cicilline’s primary win. Among what Doherty called Cicilline’s "most serious deceptions" was this claim directed at the former mayor: "The Providence Economic Development Partnership ... which you chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan." The borrower in question was Erasmo Ramirez, who worked on Cicilline’s 2002 campaign. He was thrust into the public spotlight last month when he surfaced in an undercover video talking to an aide to Anthony Gemma, Cicilline’s primary opponent. Ramirez is heard saying he manipulated absentee ballots when he worked for Cicilline’s campaign and he could do the same for Gemma if he was put on the Gemma payroll. After the release of the taped solicitation, The Providence Journal published a story showing that the city’s Economic Development Partnership program had given Ramirez a $103,000 loan in 2004 to help start a restaurant on Union Avenue. Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers told The Journal at the time that the loan "has been repaid in full." But Doherty’s campaign cited an Aug. 30 story by GoLocalProv which reported Ramirez never paid back the loan. One campaign had the story wrong, so we decided to check the records ourselves. Minutes of the partnership’s meetings show the development agency first approved loaning Ramirez $103,000 on Feb. 17, 2004. The loan was just one of several Ramirez had taken out for his proposed El Portal Family Restaurant, at 207 Union Ave. -- a project estimated to cost $706,000. To secure the loan, Ramirez offered up as his main collateral two other pieces of property he owned, but the project met immediate obstacles. On four separate occasions, between January 2005 and June 2006, Ramirez sought and received from the development agency permission to delay making loan payments. (He also requested a second, $65,000 loan, but was denied.) Ultimately the restaurant never opened. The city moved to foreclose on the restaurant property when Ramirez failed to pay his taxes. And on Sept. 8, 2006, real estate records show, the city sold the property at public auction. Westcott Development Inc. bought it for the amount owed in outstanding taxes: $10,485.22. But what about Ramirez’s defaulted $103,000 loan? In our initial story, we said that Ramirez sold one of his collateral properties to cover the loan, a house at 529 Union Ave. But further investigation shows that the travel of that transaction was anything but that simple. Paperwork describing in detail what happened with that property was missing from the public files we examined at the Providence Economic Development Partnership. The agency’s new lawyer, John Garrahy, told us Tuesday that a previous city attorney considered the documents private under attorney/client privilege and did not place them in the public file. Garrahy was reluctant to immediately turn them over to PolitiFact until he checked whether they were still considered private. But he explained over the phone that while the development agency did eventually receive a check for $96,016.74 to cover most of Ramirez’s loan debt -- as PolitiFact reported Sunday -- the check did not come from Ramirez. As it turns out, when Ramirez sold the collateral property at 529 Union Ave., the title insurance company failed to discover the lien that the development agency had placed on it. The lien didn’t come to light until the agency sought to foreclose on the property, which didn’t make its new owner, Larry King, of Warwick, happy. He sued both Ramirez and the agency, alleging that he had been duped. Ultimately, in January 2007, the title insurance company paid the $96,000 to the development agency and King’s complaint against the development agency was settled. As for King’s complaint against Ramirez? King’s lawyer Brian LaPlante told us Tuesday it wasn’t pursued because Ramirez filed for bankruptcy. The development agency also waived the remaining $16,016.74 Ramirez owed it in interest, late fees and penalties. Our ruling Republican congressional candidate Brendan Doherty said to Cicilline, "The Providence Economic Development Partnership . . . which you chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan." It’s true the worker, Ramirez, never paid back the loan. However, Doherty’s statement implies the city got nothing back when in fact it recouped most of his loan obligation. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Brendan Doherty	None	None	None	2012-09-18T18:02:18	2012-09-12	['None']
pomt-02316	"Wisconsin now ranks among the top 10 states for out-migration."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/30/mary-burke/wisconsin-losing-residents-other-states-high-rate-/	Mary Burke’s 40-page jobs plan not only lays out what she would do as governor, it critiques the policies of Gov. Scott Walker, whom she hopes to defeat in the November 2014 election. "Wisconsin needs government to work with business to train and educate tomorrow’s workers, to build the infrastructure and attract the capital necessary to grow business activity, and to make the investments in communities and quality-of-life that make businesses and workers alike want to call a place ‘home,’" Burke wrote. "We’re clearly not doing that now." The plan, released March 25, 2014, then cites three statistics, including this one: "Wisconsin now ranks among the top 10 states for out-migration." We have had some rough winters. Are that many people leaving? A moving study In making the migration claim, the jobs report refers to the 2012 version of an annual study done by United Van Lines, the national moving company. Two problems here: -- The 2012 version isn’t the latest. -- United Van Lines tracks only household moves within the 48 contiguous states that are made by its customers. So, at best, the study is an indicator of state-to-state movement, and only by those who used one particular company. Yet Burke cites it as an authoritative document. In the mover's 2012 study, Wisconsin was among 10 states labeled "high outbound" -- meaning, 55 percent or more of the moves handled by United Van Lines in Wisconsin were for people leaving Wisconsin. But in the 2013 study, released nearly three months before Burke issued her jobs report, only nine states were labeled high outbound and Wisconsin was not one of them. Wisconsin was among 31 states labeled as "balanced" -- that is, the difference between the number of United Van Lines customers moving into and out of Wisconsin was negligible. So, Burke cites outdated data from a source that is not comprehensive. But outmigration is something that is tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau. Is it possible she’s still right? Census, tax data The Census Bureau counts state-to-state migration in two ways. Estimates based on census counts, tax returns and Medicare enrollment are cited by leading demographers such as William Frey of the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research group, and Robert Scardamalia, former chief demographer for the State of New York. The latest one-year figures -- for July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2013 -- show Wisconsin ranked 12th in terms of states that suffered a net loss of residents to other states: State State-to-state net domestic migration 1. New York -104,470 2. Illinois - 67,313 3. California - 49,259 4. New Jersey - 45,035 5. Pennsylvania - 30,718 6. Michigan - 28,539 7. Ohio - 23,094 8. Connecticut -17,224 9. Kansas -12,557 10. New Mexico -10,526 11. Maryland - 8,525 12. Wisconsin - 8,158 (Expressed another way that accounts for differences in population among the states, Wisconsin ranks a little further from the top 10 -- 15th -- losing 1.4 people per 1,000 to state-to-state moves.) So, Burke’s top-10 claim is off, though not by much. Indeed, Wisconsin makes the top 10 if you consider a slightly longer period of time. Another set of the census- and tax return-based data covers April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013 -- a period that includes the 10 months before Walker took office. For the longer period, Wisconsin ranked 10th, with a net loss of more than 28,000 people to other states. Survey data Another way the Census Bureau measures migration is through a survey in which residents are asked whether they lived in the same residence one year ago. Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation, which tracks out-migration, favors the survey data. The latest survey data indicate that Wisconsin actually posted positive net migration from 2011 to 2012. The estimate is 99,192 people moved into Wisconsin and 97,724 moved out, for a net gain of 1,468. However, like other surveys, this one has a margin of error. In this case, the margin of error means that Wisconsin could have actually posted a slightly larger net gain, or even a small net loss. Regardless, the survey figures don't support Burke’s claim. Our rating Burke said: "Wisconsin now ranks among the top 10 states for out-migration." Her statement contains an element of truth. In one census estimate, Wisconsin ranked 10th in terms of a net loss of residents from state-to-state migration from roughly 2010 to 2013. But the latest one-year census estimate shows Wisconsin ranked 12th in raw numbers, 15th on a percentage basis. Also, a one-year measure based on a census survey indicates Wisconsin actually gained more residents than it lost through people moving from one state to another. Given that Burke’s claim emphasized where Wisconsin ranks now, it goes too far. We rate it Mostly False. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

pomt-07944	"Republican (small business tax cut) bill spends $80 million for better Google searches, not job creation"	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/26/cory-mason/wisconsin-state-rep-cory-mason-says-republican-bil/	Most of us would probably hate to wake up sober in the middle of a meeting of the Wisconsin Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy and Small Business. But the committee proceedings on Jan. 13, 2011 so rankled one member, state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, that he fired off a news release the same day. Compared with most news releases, the headline on this one could jolt you: "Republican bill spends $80 million for better Google searches, not job creation." As they sometimes say on the Internet: Whaaaa? The headline reminded us of one we might see in The Onion, but we knew Mason wasn’t writing satire, so we set out to see what he meant. After all, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made job creation the keystone of his administration. The Walker-requested measure in question is Assembly Bill 7, which would give tax credits to small businesses. What ticked off Mason, a four-year state lawmaker and former union organizer, were comments about the bill made during the committee meeting by freshman Rep. John Klenke, R-Green Bay, a retired businessman. Klenke, according to Mason, defended spending $80 million on the tax credits bill in an effort to improve how Wisconsin shows up in Google searches. Let’s start with the $80 million part of Mason’s claim. The measure is a Republican-sponsored bill with an estimated impact of $79.2 million over two years, but Mason is flat wrong to say it spends anything. It’s a tax reduction, not a spending increase. Now, what about the Google part, and that the bill is not about job creation? Mason has a point about job creation -- but only to a point. We rated as False a job creation claim by Walker, who had said the bill would allow businesses to create new jobs. We found the average tax credit would be $145. And some small business owners would get as little as $1. In advancing the measure, neither Walker nor GOP leaders have said anything about improving how Wisconsin shows up in Google searches being a goal. Mason told us he is basing his claim on comments Klenke, the freshman lawmaker, made in the committee meeting. But we don’t have to rely on Mason’s characterization of what Klenke said. We can go to the video. Klenke, who joined the Assembly after defeating two-term Democratic incumbent Jim Soletski in November 2010, said the bill was a way to show Wisconsin is "open for business." In referencing Google, he told the committee: "If you Google ‘business climate in the state of Wisconsin,’ you will find that the state of Wisconsin has dropped 16 spots and is now number 42 in business friendliness." (True -- five-year drop: CEO Magazine 2010 survey) Klenke went on to say that Wisconsin ranks among the 10 states with the highest overall tax burden (True as of 2008: Tax Foundation study); is one of the 10 states most likely to go bankrupt (Not quite -- Wisconsin in "fiscal peril": Pew Center 2009 report); and is one of the least attractive states for retirees (True: TopRetirements.com 2010 rankings). "What we are trying to do," Klenke said about the tax credits measure, "is change the trend." In an interview, Klenke told us the tax credits bill is one action the state could take to improve Wisconsin’s business climate. If more such steps are taken, people who use Google to learn about Wisconsin’s business climate will get more positive information, he said. So, he framed it in terms of the state’s overall business trends and what people may find when they use Google for a search -- not around getting a higher-ranking on a Google search, as the news release headline suggests. (Note: The tax credits bill was amended after it was considered by the Assembly jobs committee. The changes would make more businesses eligible for the credits, but with a smaller estimated loss -- $33.5 million per year -- in state revenue, according to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo. The amended bill, which would net businesses an estimated $92 to $316 for each new job created, was approved Jan. 20, 2011 by the Joint Finance Committee and sent it to the full Assembly.) No need to search for our conclusion. Here it is: Mason was flat wrong when he said the tax credits bill "spends $80 million." The bill would not spend any money; it would reduce state revenue by nearly $80 million. On his larger point, it does not appear the tax credits alone would create jobs. But Mason cherry picks and trivializes comments by one GOP lawmaker -- Klenke -- to suggest the aim of the tax credits is to improve Google searches. In our analysis, Mason’s claim contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06239	"(Chris Christie) has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/02/loretta-weinberg/loretta-weinberg-criticizes-chris-christie-for-not/	Sen. Loretta Weinberg isn’t shy about attacking Gov. Chris Christie, but when it comes to him not making pension payments, she could show a little patience. The Bergen County Democrat took aim in a recent column on bluejersey.com at the Republican governor’s record of making no payments to the state’s pension funds. "He has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke," Weinberg wrote in a Nov. 21 column on the left-leaning blog. PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Weinberg’s claim is technically correct, but still somewhat misleading. The Christie administration has not yet made a pension contribution, but a payment of nearly $500 million is scheduled to be made before the current fiscal year ends in June 2012. That amount represents a fraction of the nearly $3.4 billion needed to fully fund the state’s fiscal year contribution. Even though one is scheduled, Weinberg argued in a phone interview that Christie has not made any pension payments. "Whether he’ll do it in the future, we’ll see," said Weinberg, before referring to her statement. "I don’t think it’s misleading....It’s a statement of fact." Let’s review Christie’s track record with the pension system. In the fiscal year 2011 budget -- Christie’s first spending plan -- the governor did not make any pension contributions, even though a payment of about $3 billion was required to fully fund the state’s share in that fiscal year. But in March 2010, Christie signed a law passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, requiring the state to make one-seventh of the full contribution. That policy kicks off with fiscal year 2012, which began in July of this year. The state’s payment is slated to increase by at least an additional one-seventh in each succeeding fiscal year until the full amount is paid in the seventh fiscal year and afterwards. Christie approved a fiscal year 2012 budget that includes that one-seventh payment for a combined contribution of about $484 million to six pension funds. The full contribution would be nearly $3.4 billion. In fact, Weinberg also agreed to make a pension payment by way of voting for the fiscal year 2012 budget. The actual payment will be made at some point during the next seven months in order to use cash on hand, according to Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman. Making the pension payment now would likely mean borrowing money, Pratt said. Historically, pension payments are made in the final few weeks of a fiscal year, Pratt told us. Toward the end of a fiscal year, more tax revenue is coming in and most other expenses have been paid, he said. "It’s a fiscally prudent thing to do," Pratt said. "It’s always better to pay in cash." State officials also approved pension and health benefit reform last summer, requiring greater employee contributions toward the benefits. The Christie administration has said the reform would save $120 billion in pension costs over the next 30 years. Our ruling In an online column, Weinberg claimed Christie "has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system." It’s technically true that Christie has not yet made a pension contribution, but the governor has agreed to make a combined payment of about $484 million to six pension funds during fiscal year 2012.

pomt-13356	"Undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion of taxes every single year."	/punditfact/statements/2016/oct/02/maria-teresa-kumar/how-much-do-undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes/	Donald Trump may not have paid federal income taxes for 20 years, but the undocumented immigrants he rails against certainly have, according to the head of a Latino civic engagement organization. Maria Teresa Kumar, CEO and president of Voto Latino, said on NBC’s Meet the Press that "no one is surprised" by the New York Times report on Trump’s personal finances and pointed out Trump’s "hypocrisy." "He keeps talking about undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion of taxes every single year. They pay their taxes. They have skin in the game. He is not contributing to a system that he says he's going to go in and fix," Kumar said. (Editor's note, March 30, 2017: Subsequent news reports have indicated that Trump paid at least some taxes, specifically $38 million in 2005.) Kumar referred us to an Atlantic piece about undocumented immigrants paying Social Security taxes. It cites a note issued by the Social Security Administration in 2013 that contains the $12 billion figure. But the calculation is based on contributions from immigrants and their employers, not just the immigrants themselves. According to the Social Security Administration, there were nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States in January 2009. Factoring out kids, nonworking immigrants and those working in the underground economy and not paying taxes, the Social Security Administration estimated about 3.1 million unauthorized immigrants who worked and paid Social Security taxes in 2010. This group and their employers generated about $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010. The administration then subtracted about $1 billion in benefits that could’ve been received in 2010 from earnings in years when workers were unauthorized. Workers and employers contribute roughly the same amount. In a 2014 Vice News piece, the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary Stephen C. Goss affirmed the $12 billion contribution. Social Security Administration analysts said "a relatively small portion" of those who could draw benefits do so. Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, the administration said. An analysis by the conservative Heritage Foundation came up with a lower figure: $7 billion, excluding payments from employers. Though Kumar told us she meant Social Security taxes in an email interview with PolitiFact, she didn’t specify this on Meet the Press. Without the specification, her figure would have been more accurate about taxes overall. A 2016 study by the Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy, a left-leaning research organization, estimated that undocumented immigrants pay $11.64 billion in state and local taxes in 2013, equivalent to about 8 percent of their total income. This includes sales and excise taxes on goods and services ($6.9 billion), property taxes ($3.6 billion) and personal income taxes ($1.1 billion, assuming a 50 percent compliance rate). The Heritage Foundation came up with a similar result in a 2013 report. It found that the average undocumented immigrant household paid $10,334 in taxes. About half of these 3.4 million households do not pay any taxes. Using Heritage’s analysis, that would translate to about $17.6 billion paid in taxes. Heritage noted that the average undocumented immigrant household received about $24,721 in government benefits and services (i.e. public education, welfare benefits and services like police and highways), resulting in a deficit of $14,387. Our ruling Kumar said, "Undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion of taxes every single year." A left-leaning research organization estimated that undocumented immigrants paid about $12 billion in total taxes in 2010, while a conservative think tank pegged it at $17.6 billion. Kumar told us she meant Social Security taxes, but that would make her figure less accurate. According to the Social Security Administration, half of the $12 billion in payroll taxes comes from employers. (But she didn’t say it this way.) We rate Kumar’s claim True.

pomt-04926	President Ronald Reagan sent troops into conflict "only in one circumstance, which was in Grenada … We were in a peacekeeping setting in Lebanon."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/mitt-romney/romney-said-reagan-sent-troops-conflict-only-once/	Mitt Romney’s trip to Europe and Israel gave him the opportunity to talk about foreign affairs, a subject that has received relatively little attention so far in the campaign. During the trip, Romney praised the military strategies of President Ronald Reagan. "(He) was able to accomplish extraordinary purposes for our country," Romney said in an interview on Face the Nation. "Without having to put our military forces into conflict. Only in one circumstance, which was in Grenada, did our forces go in a conflict setting. We were in a peacekeeping setting in Lebanon." The implication is that Reagan did not get American forces bogged down in protracted wars. But for this fact check we will focus on whether Romney had his history right. Under Reagan, did U.S. soldiers go into a conflict setting just once and does calling Lebanon a "peacekeeping setting" mean that conflict was any less of a threat? (We asked the Romney campaign about this but didn't hear back.) For those who may have forgotten, the invasion of Grenada took place in late October 1983. About 5,000 troops subdued Grenadian and Cuban soldiers and laborers in about two days of fighting. The U.S. and six Caribbean nations were concerned about Cuba extending its reach in the region. Deaths included 19 Americans, 45 Grenadians and 59 Cubans. The U.S. Navy’s History and Heritage Command has compiled a list of the use of U.S. forces abroad from 1798 to 1993. It makes no distinction between deployments into areas where there was open conflict and those that were more tranquil. During the Reagan administration, from 1981 to 1988, American forces were active on overseas missions 16 times in a total of 12 countries. Often, they played a support role, such as the AWACs electronic surveillance aircraft that provided intelligence to Saudi Arabian fighter jets as they shot down two Iranian fighter planes in 1984. But on five or six occasions, U.S. forces took a more direct role. In 1986, the U.S. Navy and Air Force struck targets in Libya. While there was no long-term military engagement, two Air Force flyers died on that mission when their F-111 was hit over Libya. In 1987 and 1988, U.S. Navy ships escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. They were fired upon, hit mines, or encountered some other military action six times. A mine strike nearly sank the USS Samuel Roberts. "The crew heroically fought fires for five hours to save their ship," said Lance Janda, chair of the History Department at Cameron University. "A number of crew members were seriously burned and injured." "One might quibble over the use of the word ‘conflict,’ " Janda said. "As I see it, any time U.S. forces are sent into a region where fighting is taking place, then I think it's fair to say those forces are at risk." Stephen Knott, professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, agrees. "Reflagging Kuwaiti tankers was definitely inserting American forces into a ‘conflict setting’," Knott said. "That is, the war between Iran and Iraq." Several historians and foreign policy specialists took issue with Romney calling the Lebanon mission a ‘peacekeeping setting.' In 1982, the United States sent 1,200 troops as part of a U.N. effort to hold the Lebanese government together after the country was splintered by fighting among Christians and Muslims. Bruce Jentleson, professor of public policy and political science at Duke University, says the situation was anything but stable. "As the Marine barracks bombing demonstrated," Jentleson told PolitiFact, "there was plenty of danger." A suicide truck bomber detonated explosives inside a Marine compound at the Beruit airport, killing 241 soldiers. It was the largest single-day loss of life for Marines since the World War II Battle of Iwo Jima. Jentleson said that until that attack, the troop "commitment was pretty open-ended. It only ended because of the bombing." Knott interviewed then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had tried to persuade Reagan against that deployment. Weinberger told Knott he said to Reagan, "They’re in a position of extraordinary danger. They have no mission. They have no capability of carrying out a mission, and they’re terribly vulnerable." The consensus among the experts we reached is that under Reagan, the U.S. did avoid putting troops on the ground for extended periods of time. Government professor William Wohforth at Dartmouth College said Reagan "was quite chary of actual military action with U.S. troops." However, the U.S. was very much engaged in other ways. "In the cold war, the superpowers fought lots of proxy conflicts," said Michael O’Hanlon, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Leading to huge loss of life from Central America to the Horn of Africa to Central and Southern Africa to Afghanistan." Some of those conflicts, such as Afghanistan, began during the Carter administration. O’Hanlon notes that the U.S. didn’t always follow through with money and efforts to stabilize those countries after the fighting stopped. He points to Afghanistan as a place where the U.S. likely paid a price for that policy when the country became a haven for al Qaeda. Our ruling Romney said the U.S. stayed out of conflict settings under Reagan, except once in Grenada. Romney put Lebanon in a separate category of "a peacekeeping setting." The record shows multiple military engagements and a large loss of life in Lebanon. Reagan was wary of the actual use of troops, but he did not stick to that as much as Romney suggests. Romney may have been thinking of long-term deployments, but he spoke only of whether American soldiers were placed into conflict settings which did take place. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13837	"We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago in Illinois ... because of the control of (House) Speaker (Michael) Madigan and his Democrats."	/illinois/statements/2016/jul/13/bruce-rauner/gov-bruce-rauner-says-illinois-family-incomes-lowe/	If you were to boil down the guiding theme of Bruce Rauner’s governorship, it would be: "For 12 years, Illinois Democrats and the unions to whom they are beholden ran the state economy into the ground and now they refuse to help me fix it." Rauner, Illinois’ first Republican governor since 2003, has been sharply critical of Illinois’ declining business and job climate under Democratic leadership from 2003 to 2015. His insistence that he will not engage in budget negotiations until Democrats pass business and government reforms led to a historic impasse that has left the state with no budget -- and a fast-growing pile of debt -- since June 30, 2015. To back his case for business-friendly reforms, Rauner frequently cites figures intended to demonstrate the toll Democratic policies have exacted on the state economy. Such was the case June 1, when Rauner appeared with local Republican lawmakers and school officials at the administrative offices of Community Unit School District 3 in Mahomet. Rauner’s visit came a day after, for the second straight year, the Democrat-controlled General Assembly adjourned without passing either Rauner’s various reforms or a state budget. "We’ve had massive out-migration of people and jobs. We have the highest unemployment rate of any state in America," Rauner said, detailing a litany of Illinois’ problems on the business and government front. "We have the highest level of corruption and cronyism and patronage of any state in America. We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago in Illinois. We are fundamentally in decline because of the control of (House) Speaker (Michael) Madigan and his Democrats." Rauner made several claims here, but we’re going to focus on the part about family incomes. Is it true that Illinois has lower family incomes today than in 1999? According to his office, Rauner based his claim on U.S. Census Bureau data (click here and scroll to Table H-8) for median household income from 1984 to 2014. The 2015 figure won’t be out until September, so Rauner’s "last 17 years" really means from 1999 to 2014. The top chart below shows average annual household incomes for Illinois and Indiana in the period mentioned by Rauner. The lower chart shows Illinois and its neighboring states. Indeed, the 2014 median household income in Illinois was $54,916 and the 1999 median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $65,850. That’s a decline of 16.6 percent. Pretty bad, right? But look at neighboring Indiana, which saw its median household income plummet 17.2 percent -- to the current $48,060 -- in the same time period. Or Wisconsin, which had a 10.5 percent drop. Missouri went from $58,819 in 1999 to $56,630 in 2014 -- a 3.7 percent decline. Nationwide, the inflation-adjusted median income went from $57,843 in 1999 to $53,657 in 2014. That’s a drop of 7.2 percent. So there’s no disputing that Illinois’ median household income fell between 1999 and 2014, but Rauner presented the figure as if Illinois were an outlier among other states; that its political leadership had chartered a uniquely disastrous course. A look at the same time period for Indiana -- a state repeatedly cited by Rauner as a beacon of economic growth -- shows Illinois was far from alone. In fact, only four states in the nation -- Maryland, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon -- had higher median household incomes in 2014 than at some other point in the Census Bureau's 30-year survey. (Only North Dakota had a Republican governor in 2014.) And 1999 is no ordinary year for Illinois in this set of numbers. It’s the year with the highest median household income in the 30 years covered. Had Rauner gone for a 25-year comparison and used 1991’s median household income, he would have found an increase of 1.5 percent ($54,068 in 1991 and $54,916 in 2014). Pinpointing whether and to what extent state government policy influenced an economic trend like median household income is difficult, says Darren H. Lubotsky, a professor in the economics department at the University of Illinois-Chicago and a member of the university’s Institute of Government and Public Affairs. A state’s industrial base is the greatest indicator of how it will reflect or resist an economic downturn like those that hit the national economy after 9/11 and in the Great Recession, Lubotsky says. "Is it accurate to blame state government leadership? Maybe. Is it the unfunded pension liability? The quality of schools? Crime? The so-called culture of corruption? Maybe they all play a role or maybe only some do. I am not sure one could credibly point to what policies really matter," Lubotsky says. Our ruling "We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago." Rauner is stretching the time frame when he says income is lower "today" than it was 17 years ago. The Census Bureau won’t even have 2015 figures for three more months. But the bigger problem here is that by choosing the peak income year among 30 years’ worth of data and presenting Illinois as an isolated case, Rauner tacitly asserts that Illinois is unique in seeing lower income "today" than in 1999. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2016-07-13T07:00:00	2016-06-01	['Illinois', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-08573	"Florida seniors are exempt" from losing Medicare Advantage under the federal health care bill.	/florida/statements/2010/sep/27/george-pataki/george-pataki-says-florida-seniors-get-gator-aid-p/	Did Florida seniors get a deal dubbed "Gator Aid" that protected their Medicare Advantage unlike the rest of the nation? That's the case, according to former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, who is now chairman of Revere America, an organization that aims to repeal the health care bill. Pataki announced his campaign to target members of Congress who voted for the bill at a Sept. 8 press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Here is the full context of what Pataki said about Medicare Advantage and Florida around minute 9:25 on the video: "In addition, there are a lot of lawsuits out there. Attorney General McCollum in Florida has one on behalf of Florida and other states. And Revere America will be involved in a lawsuit being brought by the lieutenant governor of Missouri, which is very interesting because it's not government-versus-government; it's based on some of the corrupt deals in this bill -- in this case, the fact that if you're a senior citizen on Medicare Advantage, you will lose in the overwhelming number of cases that ability to have Medicare Advantage, unless you live in the state of Florida, because they made a corrupt deal for a Florida vote, so that Florida seniors are exempt. And we believe that is an unconstitutional denial of equal protection." For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to check: Are Florida seniors exempt from losing Medicare Advantage? First, some background on Medicare Advantage. A Dec. 23, 2009, Truth-O-Meter item about Medicare Advantage explained it this way: "Medicare Advantage is an optional program that lets Medicare recipients 65 and older receive their benefits through private health insurance plans, instead of through the traditional Medicare program. The idea behind the program was to save the government money, but it hasn't worked out that way. "Under the program, the government pays Advantage companies a set amount per enrollee, about $10,000, and they make a profit if they keep average costs below that level. The reimbursement amounts to about 14 percent more, on average, than the government spends on a traditional Medicare beneficiary. "The extra money allows companies to offer Medicare Advantage members additional services, such as prescription drug, vision and dental coverage at a much lower cost, as well as other perks like gym memberships. About 11 million people are enrolled in the program nationwide." According to a September 2010 fact-sheet about Medicare Advantage from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the health reform law "reduces federal payments to Medicare Advantage plans over time, bringing them closer to the average costs of care under the fee-for-service Medicare program." About 24 percent of the 47 million people enrolled in Medicare are on Medicare Advantage, according to Kaiser. The December 2009 PolitiFact provides us with background regarding an initial plan that would have helped Florida seniors on Medicare Advantage. But remember, that Truth-O-Meter item was written before the final version of the bill passed in March 2010. That PolitFact report examined a claim by Karl Rove that U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat of Florida, got a "$25 billion to $30 billion carve-out for Medicare Advantage patients," for Florida. Rove, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, said on Fox News: "Every Medicare Advantage policyholder in America, except those in Florida, will see a huge cut in the federal support for those policies, and as a result, a dramatic decline in their benefits and an increase in their premiums, except if you live in Florida." We ruled that comment by Rove Barely True. Nelson had initially sought to grandfather in all seniors on Medicare Advantage at the time, said Nelson spokesman Bryan Gulley. But the Senate said that was too expensive so Nelson proposed an amendment that protected Medicare Advantage for seniors who lived in areas where services cost the highest. But the bill itself didn't mention Florida -- it was based on a formula and would have benefitted a few states. The previous PolitiFact quoted a spokesman for Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., as saying that the protection would help seniors in their states, too. Nelson's amendment, part of the broader health care bill, passed the Senate in December 2009 and the House in March. But it was changed in the reconciliation bill -- the final bill President Barack Obama signed into law. Under the president's plan, Gulley said, "Florida would not benefit over anybody else ... because the cuts were more evenly spread across the whole country, meaning that seniors in states like Florida wouldn't be unfairly penalized." We asked Gulley to send us the provision in the bill that passed with Nelson's language and the final version, which cut it. Note that HR 3590, which was approved by the House and Senate and includes Section 3201 on Medicare Advantage Payment, doesn't state "Florida" but includes a series of formulas. HR 4872, the reconciliation bill, includes the following language in Section 1102: "a) Repeal- Effective as if included in the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sections 3201 and 3203 of such Act (and the amendments made by such sections) are repealed." A March 28, 2010, article in the Miami Herald stated that Nelson "successfully amended an early version of the health care bill to soften cuts to Medicare Advantage, a privatized Medicare program. But the amendment was killed after Republicans denigrated it as a backroom deal for Florida that was nicknamed 'Gator Aid.' " We contacted Pataki spokesman David Catalfamo Sept. 16. He sent us this: "Section 3201 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as 'PPACA,' or 'Obamacare' (as amended by H.R. 4872, Sec. 1102) reduces Medicare Part C ('Medicare Advantage') supplemental coverage for most Americans by eliminating the Medicare Advantage Stabilization Fund. This process begins on January 1, 2011, by freezing payments at 2010 levels. Medicare supplemental coverage reimbursements are then reduced to an unsustainable level beginning in 2012. This prohibition on Medicare Advantage supplemental coverage applies to all U.S. citizens, except individuals living in certain qualifying Florida counties described in Section 3201(c)(3)(B) of PPACA. This is the provision that it opponents labeled 'Gator Aid.' " We asked Catalfamo if he was quoting from a document or if this was his own analysis. And we summarized for him what we had learned from Nelson's office and asked him to point to a specific section in the final bill that included an exemption for Florida. On Sept. 20, he sent us this response and attached bills: "The exact 'Gator Aid' provision that was in the first bill was removed when the House reconciliation bill was passed, and replaced with a provision that did the same thing, but did not name counties outright and instead provided very narrow criteria to isolate certain counties in Florida and 2 counties in other states." Then he sent us links to the bills. We asked Catalfamo on Sept. 20 to allow us to speak directly to his policy expert providing the information on Medicare to point us to the specific provision in the final bill that would provide a unique benefit to Florida. A week later, we had not heard from anyone willing to speak on the record. We reached three experts about Medicare Advantage who disputed Pataki's claim. Our sources: Brian Biles, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University; Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy at Families USA, a nonprofit health consumer organization; and Peter Ashkenaz, a spokesperson for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Steinberg put it the most bluntly: "I really think they are 100 percent wrong,'' he said. Congress is scaling back the payments to Medicare Advantage plans to bring them more in line on average to what is paid in Medicare. But it's too soon to say what that means for the average senior in various parts of the country while the reductions are being phased in over a few years. It's possible some Medicare Advantage providers will get out of the business, cut services or increase costs, he said. The change in the payment formulas isn't flat across the country -- it takes into account geographic differences, Steinberg said. For example, the payment rates to health care companies will be scaled back more in counties that were well above the Medicare average while counties that were below the Medicare average could see the health care providers receive higher reimbursements. That means that some Florida seniors could see a reduction in benefits to their plans, Steinberg said. "I think it's really a misreading of the law,'' Steinberg said. "It doesn't seem to understand what Medicare Advantage is or how the new payment formula works and it really misinterprets the geographic adjustment." Biles, who co-wrote a paper on Medicare Advantage comparing costs in various states including Florida, said in an interview "in the final bill again some of the South Florida counties are paid among the lowest amounts relative to fee for service of any counties in the country." In fact, Biles' paper shows that in 2009, the level of Medicare Advantage payments in Florida had been 103 percent of the payments to the traditional fee-for-service costs, while the national average was higher at 113 percent. Under the new payment plan, Florida Medicare Advantage providers will be paid 94 percent of traditional Medicare, still lower than the national average of 101 percent. Biles said in an e-mail that "Florida was never a significant part of the extra payment to MA plans problem." Nonetheless, he said, some plans in South Florida under the new law will be paid a lower percentage of traditional Medicare "than any plans anywhere in the nation at any time in the 25-year history of the Medicare private plan program." That's not exactly a sweet "Gator-Aid" drink for Florida seniors. Ashkenaz, after reading Pataki's claim, responded in an email: "there is nothing in the Affordable Care Act that impacts MA (Medicare Advantage) in this way." Let's review: Does "Gator-Aid" exist in the form of a special deal for Florida seniors and Medicare Advantage? U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson's spokesman said that Nelson tried to get a break for a few high-cost areas including parts of Florida, but that provision was repealed in the final version of the law. The experts we spoke to are adamant and unanimous that Pataki's description is wrong. We rate this claim False.	None	George Pataki	None	None	None	2010-09-27T17:16:33	2010-09-08	['None']
pomt-05909	Congressman Scott DesJarlais "is spending his one year anniversary on vacation -- only working 6 days in all of January."	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/02/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-republican-freshman-scott-desjarlais-vac/	Oh, the leisurely life of a congressman. Work a few days, take off the rest of the month. Right? That’s what Democrats are saying about U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais, R-Jasper. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the U.S. House, blasted the freshman lawmaker’s work schedule in a press release on Jan. 5. The Tennessee Democratic Party posted the release on its web site. The release marked the anniversary of DesJarlais’ swearing-in as the congressman for Tennessee’s 4th Congressional District, which takes in Middle Tennessee and parts of East Tennessee. Identical press releases targeted other first-term Republicans. "With so much work to do to get the economy back on track and Americans back to work," the release said, "DesJarlais is spending his one year anniversary on vacation – only working 6 days in all of January." Really? We contacted the DCCC and asked them to back up the claim. They pointed us to the official House calendar, which shows just six official work days in January: the 17th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 25th and the 31st. We then called DesJarlais’ office to see how he was spending his time away from Washington. DesJarlais’ spokesman, Robert Jameson, said being a congressman is a lot like being a doctor. Neither is a 9-to-5 job. DesJarlais, by the way, happens to be both. In fact, Jameson said, only one day during the entire month of January was blocked off for the congressman’s personal use. The other days were spent meeting with constituents, talking with staff and taking care of other official business. "To say he was on vacation is completely ridiculous," Jameson said. "Part of being an elected member of Congress is going back and talking to your constituents. One of the things the congressman has been very good at is maintaining an open dialogue with his constituents about what goes on up here in Congress." Jameson even provided a few examples from the congressman’s work schedule for some of the days that the DCCC says he was on vacation. On Monday, Jan. 9th, for example, DesJarlais met with business leaders and local legislators in Crossville. The next day, Jan. 10th, he met with "job creators" in Warren County and with county officials in White and Warren counties. The next day, Jan. 11th, he met with business leaders and constituents in Manchester. The following Monday, Jan. 16th, was Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which is a federal holiday, but the congressman met with business leaders in the Chattanooga area to discuss upcoming legislation. "The principles of elected representation mean you need to go back and talk to constituents," Jameson said. "I really have a problem, and so does the congressman, with anybody categorizing this as vacation. They’re not sitting there hanging out all day. They are meeting with constituents, figuring out what their needs are and their priorities." Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio recently looked into an identical claim against Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio. We think some of their points merit repeating: "Travel days" and "home district periods" are facts of congressional life, whether the district time is used for constituent services, meetings or fundraising. "To be sure, few members will head to the beach," The Christian Science Monitor noted last year. "Between fundraisers, town-hall meetings, and constituent services, they tend to work at least as hard out of session as they do in it." Committees can meet and hold hearings during a recess. And congressional offices in Washington and in the district remain staffed and open, even if the House is not in session. House GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor drew criticism for setting a light, 109-day calendar for 2012. But the scheduled 123-day calendar for 2011 became 175 days in session, according to figures from the Office of the House Clerk. The 104-day calendar that a Democratic majority set for 2008 – another election year – became 119 days. House sessions have averaged 135 days since 2000. Something else to consider: The legislative calendar is set not by individual members, but by Cantor and congressional leadership and is followed by all lawmakers, including Democrats. As Jameson points out, based upon the DCCC standard, Democrats also would have been working only six days in January. Our ruling Just because Congress is on recess does not mean that lawmakers are on vacation. To make such a charge is to imply that a congressman’s work ends whenever he or she leaves Washington – a totally ridiculous claim. The DCCC is rehashing a favorite talking point that grossly distorts the congressional calendar. The DCCC offers no specifics to back this up other than the schedule. That's not just false, it's a ridiculous distortion. Pants on Fire!	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2012-02-02T16:30:19	2012-01-05	['None']
pomt-01526	"Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence."	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/18/mika-brzezinski/mika-brzezinski-repeats-myth-super-bowl-sunday-has/	Two decades ago, a group of women’s rights advocates came out with a disturbing warning about professional football’s biggest day: Super Bowl Sunday is also the biggest day of the year for violence against women. The claim at a Pasadena, Calif., press conference ahead of the 1993 Super Bowl was backed by groups such as the California Women’s Law Center and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, setting off a raft of fearful news headlines and airtime on Good Morning America. It wasn’t until a Washington Post reporter interviewed experts about the claim that the truth emerged: The claim was bogus. Even the Old Dominion University researchers whose work was cited as support for the connection said it was wrong. But by then it was too late to correct the record. The claim has found new life amid cable news coverage of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski used it to support her argument that there is a connection between violence at home and aggressive play on the football field on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "You look at Super Bowl Sunday. Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence," she said Sept. 16. "There’s something about the game!" Minutes later, she said, "This is a violent game. And domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday. We've seen the numbers. Why is that?" The truth is that Super Bowl Sunday is not a unique day for domestic violence, says Callie Rennison, a University of Colorado Denver public affairs professor who studies domestic violence. "This is not to be confused with there being no violence or a lower amount of violence on Super Bowl Sunday," Rennison said. "It happens on holidays, it happens on weekends, and it happens on weekdays." Rennison sent us a 2007 study published in Human Organization, the journal of the Society for Applied Anthropology, which concluded that the belief that domestic violence crisis calls increase during drink holidays in general, including the Super Bowl, is unsubstantiated. Press coverage of the original news conference 20 years ago said a California Women’s Law Center official cited research to bolster her comments. The lawyer, Sheila Kuehl, was reported as citing an academic study that found a 40 percent uptick in police reports of beatings and hospital admissions after Washington Redskins victories between 1988-89. But "that’s not what we found at all," Janet Katz, the Old Dominion University criminology professor who worked on the study, told the Washington Post. Katz said her "tentative findings" did not correlate an increase in ER admissions of women with football games in general or with men upset by a team loss. A spokeswoman for MSNBC did not offer comment by deadline. Our ruling Brzezinski invoked a widely debunked claim that Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence on Morning Joe. It’s no more true now than 20 years ago. Experts say this myth persists in spite of long-lasting academic rebuke. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-05583	"Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/02/american-energy-alliance/energy-group-says-obama-objects-energy-exploration/	Bearing the bold title "Nine Dollar Gas," a new ad by the American Energy Alliance attacks President Barack Obama’s energy policies and blames him for high gasoline prices. It mentions the solar technology company Solyndra and the controversial Keystone oil pipeline, two issues with a tenuous-at-best relationship to what we’re currently paying at the pump. The ad, released March 27, 2012, also says this: "Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska." That’s the claim we’ll check here. Source of the claim On the screen beneath the Alaska claim is a citation for an Associated Press story dated Feb. 17, 2012. A spokesman for the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group tied to the industry-funded Institute for Energy Research, sent us a link to the story headlined "House passes drilling-friendly energy package." The story was about a House plan to expand oil and gas drilling that was included in a $260 billion transportation bill. "The legislation, which 21 Republicans voted against and 21 Democrats voted for, would open the eastern Gulf of Mexico off Florida and areas off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to drilling, lift a ban on drilling in a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and order leases to be offered for Western oil shale," the story said. "Obama has said he would not pursue drilling off the Pacific and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and has pushed back offering leases in the Atlantic until at least 2017," it continued. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an area about the size of South Carolina managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service to preserve habitat and protect birds, plants and animals such as caribou, polar bears and gray wolves. While Obama has resisted efforts to drill for oil in the refuge, we found another Associated Press story dated the same day that clears the way for other drilling in the 49th state. Under the headline "With Obama's OK, Shell may soon start drilling for oil in arctic," the story said the White House had okayed Shell’s response plan for dealing with a spill in the Chukchi Sea, off Alaska's northwest coast, an important step before drilling can go forward. The company, which called the plan’s approval a "major milestone," said it hopes to drill up to three wells there during the summer of 2012. It also plans two wells in the Beaufort Sea, off the northern coast. Shell’s disaster response plan for that area won approval in March. The moves angered some environmentalists and native Alaskan groups, who questioned Shell’s claim in the Chukchi Sea plan that it would be able to clean up nearly all oil in the event of a spill. But Obama’s interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said any exploration in Alaska would be done "under the strongest oversight, safety requirements and emergency response plans ever established," according to the AP story. Our ruling The American Energy Alliance ad said that Obama "opposed exploring for energy in Alaska." That’s a narrow slice of reality. It’s true that the president opposes opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, but the administration has approved plans that allow for expanded drilling in other parts of Alaska, including clearing a process that could let Shell sink new rigs in two Alaskan offshore areas as soon as summer 2012. The ad leaves out that significant piece of the picture. We rate it Half True.	None	American Energy Alliance	None	None	None	2012-04-02T18:11:16	2012-03-27	['Alaska', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-15130	"It has been the law since the beginning of the country that the children of American citizens born ... abroad are American citizens by birth."	/texas/statements/2015/sep/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-its-always-been-law-babies-born-us-c/	Ted Cruz says that in a way, his bona fide citizenship traces to the birth of the United States. The Texas senator was born in the western Canada city of Calgary, Alberta, in 1970 to a Cuban father and American mother. His mother’s citizenship automatically made her son a U.S. citizen and, most legal authorities concur, eligible to run for president. (In May 2014, too, Cruz renounced his dual Canadian citizenship.) Yet in August 2015, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor bidding for president, suggested Cruz had benefited from the 14th Amendment’s birthright grant of citizenship to anyone born in the United States, Politico said in a news story. Cruz, who had said that he wanted to end the granting of "automatic birthright citizenship to the children of those who are here illegally," told reporters Bush seemed confused about legal versus illegal immigration. "With regard to legal citizens," Cruz said, "I am a United States citizen because my mother was a United States citizen, born in Wilmington, Delaware. And," Cruz said, "it has been the law since the beginning of the country that the children of American citizens born here or abroad are American citizens by birth." We were curious about his recap of legal history. For starters, the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey suggests that Cruz ranks among about 2.75 million citizens born abroad (including this reporter, ahem) to at least one U.S. citizen-parent. Cruz’s campaign did not respond to our requests for back-up information. But legal experts and, ultimately, a Supreme Court justice’s writings helped us realize that children born to citizens living abroad have been granted citizenship by law from the country’s earliest years, though the way Cruz got his citizenship — through his mother — wasn’t statutorily settled until the 1930s. A 1790 law To our inquiries, experts on U.S. citizenship advised us that an act passed into law by the very first Congress in March 1790 said children born abroad to citizens could be U.S. citizens — a form of "derivative citizenship." Christopher McKnight Nichols, an Oregon State University historian, said by email: "Since the Naturalization Law of 1790, it is clear that Congress attempted to establish a citizenship right for children born of citizens abroad." The 1790 law, less than 300 words long, initially said any "free white person" may become a citizen after satisfying residency requirements of two years (later amended to five years) and satisfying a court that "he is a person of good character, and taking the oath or affirmation prescribed by law to support the Constitution of the United States." Likewise, the law said, non-adult children of a person "so naturalized" shall be considered citizens. The law then turned to children born abroad, stating: "And the children of citizens of the United States that may be born beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born citizens," though it added that "the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States." John Trasviña, dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law, pointed out a March 2008 article in the student-edited NYU Annual Survey of American Law stating that when Congress agreed to citizenship for children born abroad, it acted much like England’s Parliament, which had earlier moved to grant citizenship to such children. Citizenship through fathers only? Then again, the student-written article and legal experts prompted us to wonder if children born abroad to mother-citizens were always granted U.S. citizenship. By various accounts, including a 2000 Supreme Court dissent, Congress didn’t settle on citizenship through mothers until 1934. The 1790 law, the article noted, "created the first distinction between citizen-fathers and citizen-mothers. Although the first clause uses the gender-neutral ‘citizens,’ the residency requirement limited the ability of citizen-mothers to pass citizenship to their foreign-born children." That is, the article says, the "foreign-born child of a citizen-father and alien-mother would definitely receive derivative citizenship, but the foreign-born child of a citizen-mother and an alien-father would receive derivative citizenship only if the alien-father had been" a U.S. resident. Additional changes may have led to more confusion. In 1802, Congress revised the born-abroad law to say: "And the children of persons who now are, or have been citizens of the United States, shall though born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, be considered as citizens of the United States." In 1855, Congress revised the law afresh to offer citizenship to children born abroad to citizen-fathers who had previously lived in the country. Citizenship at birth through a mother And what about citizenship through mothers? To get a peg on that, we turned to a 2011 article by Kristin Collins, a Boston University law professor. Collins wrote that Congress addressed this gap in 1934 after "years of persistent lobbying by women’s organizations" and "finally equalized parent-child derivative citizenship with respect to married citizen mothers and fathers, at least as a formal matter." We reached Collins, who said by email that from 1790 on, it would be fair to say that "some foreign-born children of American parents are citizens at birth. On the other hand, Sen. Cruz’s characterization of the history of American citizenship law is a tad misleading, especially with respect to individuals like him who are the foreign-born children of American mothers." Collins summed up: "Until 1934, under the federal citizenship statute that determined the citizenship of foreign-born children of American parents, foreign-born children of American mothers did not acquire citizenship at birth – only (some) foreign-born children of American fathers were citizens at birth. But in 1934, Congress liberalized the law so that citizenship passed through mothers as well as fathers." Collins said it would be more accurate to say it’s been the law since the country’s beginning that some children of American citizens born abroad are citizens by birth. We also enlisted North Carolina-based historian Candice Bredbenner, who wrote a 1998 book on women and citizenship. By email, she replied that generally, "the policies on granting citizenship at birth to children born abroad to a married citizen mother have undergone considerable change over time. So, Cruz’s assumption that, since the country’s founding, the federal government has recognized a mother’s right to transfer her U. S. citizenship to a child cannot be supported by the evidence." In fairness to Cruz, she followed up, "even the person with some modest interest in this subject could be easily confused." Justice Ginsburg's dissent Collins also emailed us a copy of a May 2000 article she wrote analyzing a 1998 U.S. Supreme Court case in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent, took note of the 1790 law establishing the pathway to citizenship through a child’s parents so long as the father had been a U.S. resident. Ginsburg further wrote: "Statutes passed in 1795 and 1802 similarly conditioned the citizenship of the child born abroad on the father’s at least one-time" (U.S.) residence. "This father’s residence requirement," Ginsburg wrote, "suggests that Congress intended a child born abroad to gain citizenship only when the father was a citizen. That, indeed, was the law of England at the time." On the other hand, she wrote, the "statutory language… was ambiguous. One could read the words ‘children of citizens’ to mean that the child of a United States citizen mother and a foreign father would qualify for citizenship if the father had at some point resided in the country." In the 1800s, Ginsburg wrote, there was an unsuccessful push to change the law to grant citizenship to children born abroad to U.S.-born citizen mothers as well as fathers. Instead, Ginsburg wrote, Congress in 1855 "clarified that citizenship would pass to children born abroad only when the father" was a U.S. citizen. The same law, she said, automatically granted citizenship to women who married U.S. citizens. In 1934, Ginsburg wrote, "Congress moved in a new direction. It terminated the discrimination against United States citizen mothers in regard to children born abroad," amending the law to say: "Any child hereafter born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, whose father or mother or both at the time of the birth of such child is a citizen of the United States, is declared to be a citizen of the United States; but the rights of citizenship shall not descend to any such child unless the citizen father or citizen mother, as the case may be, has resided in the United States previous to the birth of such child." At the time, Ginsburg wrote, Senate and House Reports on the act stated the change was made "to establish complete equality between American men and women in the matter of citizenship for themselves and for their children." The law today A 2011 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service on qualifications for president and the "natural born" citizenship hurdle noted the existing citizenship provisions for children born abroad. The law says individuals shall be a citizen at birth including "a person born outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than five years, at least two of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years." Our ruling Cruz said: "It has been the law since the beginning of the country that the children of American citizens born ... abroad are American citizens by birth." From 1790 on, federal law has held that children born abroad to American citizens become citizens, provided other conditions are met. But the law wasn’t explicit about mothers conveying citizenship (how Cruz became an American at birth) until 1934. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-11292	Says Facebook shut down a "Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day."	/texas/statements/2018/apr/23/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-correct-facebook-shut-down-chick-fil-appr/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, fresh from questioning Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at a hearing, asserted that Facebook inappropriately killed an appreciation day for Chick-Fil-A, the chicken restaurant that serves customers in more than 150 Texas places. We hadn’t heard that before. Was Facebook down with that? Cruz’s April 11, 2018, commentary on the Fox News website centered on what the Texas Republican described as Facebook’s suppression of conservative news stories and the like, making Facebook, Cruz wrote, far from a neutral public forum--a critique that Zuckerberg hadn't embraced. Cruz put Facebook’s suppression of chicken appreciation this way: "Facebook’s actions have ranged from seemingly petty things – like shutting down a ‘Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day’ to blocking posts from journalists, specific religious groups and most recently, grassroots Trump supporters Diamond and Silk," Cruz asserted. Cruz cites 2012 account Asked the basis of Cruz’s Chick-Fil-A claim, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier provided a web link to a July 2012 Huffington Post news story that said that for some time over perhaps two days, a Facebook "events" page urging people to patronize Chick-Fil-A had been taken offline. According to the story, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee created the page -- urging Aug. 1, 2012, visits to the chain -- because he was upset that Chick-Fil-A was the target of criticism in the wake of Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy’s saying that "his company supports ‘the biblical definition of the family unit.’" We saw that the HuffPo story mentioning Huckabee’s Facebook events page touting the intended appreciation day debuted at 10:09 a.m. July 24, 2012. Nearly eight hours later, a 5:55 p.m. update of the story quoted Huckabee saying the page had been yanked down that morning. "The Facebook event is no longer available," HuffPo reported, "and Gov. Huckabee has written the following on his Facebook page: ‘A number of you are asking questions about the Chick Fil-A event. The event disappeared from my page this morning and we have asked Facebook to look into this. I will update you as soon as I know more. The event is still on and the info should be back up soon.’" The next day, at an unspecified time, the HuffPo story was updated to say: "The Facebook event is back and more than 125,000 people have signed up to participate." Huckabee said on the restored Facebook events page, which was live when we started to fact-check Cruz’s claim: "I ask you to join me in speaking out on Wednesday, August 1 ‘Chick Fil-A Appreciation Day.’ No one is being asked to make signs, speeches, or openly demonstrate. The goal is simple: Let's affirm a business that operates on Christian principles and whose executives are willing to take a stand for the Godly values we espouse by simply showing up and eating at Chick Fil-A on Wednesday, August 1. Too often, those on the left make corporate statements to show support for same sex marriage, abortion, or profanity, but if Christians affirm traditional values, we’re considered homophobic, fundamentalists, hate-mongers, and intolerant. This effort is not being launched by the Chick Fil-A company and no one from the company or family is involved in proposing or promoting it. "There's no need for anyone to be angry or engage in a verbal battle. Simply affirm appreciation for a company run by Christian principles by showing up on Wednesday, August 1 or by participating online – tweeting your support or sending a message on Facebook." After Cruz made his claim, we reached out to Huckabee and didn’t hear back. But Huckabee specified in a July 25, 2012, Facebook post pointed out to us by Frazier that the Facebook page he’d created to talk up Chick-Fil-A had been taken down for 12 hours. It seems, Huckabee wrote then, "we caught a 12 hour bug… We still aren’t sure why it happened, we have been told by Facebook ‘it was a mistake,’ clearly we think it was a mistake too but aren’t so convinced it was an accident. "Could it be," Huckabee went on, that "we were were attacked because of our beliefs? Could it be that Facebook has a glitch in their system with a VERY NARROW target? Who knows if we will ever know for sure, but one thing we do know for sure is that we are back up and running…" Huckabee’s post closed: "So we got knocked down, but hey! WE ARE BACK UP!" The page’s temporary vanishment evidently didn’t stop the appreciation day. According to the Facebook events page launched by Huckabee, some 653,000 people participated that day. Facebook responds We also asked Facebook and Chick-Fil-A about the accuracy of Cruz’s claim. By email, Facebook spokeswoman Sarah Pollack responded that the events page devoted to celebrating Chick-Fil-A was "mistakenly removed by our automated systems after we received a report that content on the page violated our policies." Pollack went on: "The event did not violate our policies and we worked to restore it as soon as we were aware. The event page was restored within ten hours and is still live today." Asked which policies were at issue, Pollack replied that she didn’t have more detail because the event page "didn’t violate any of our policies." See Facebook’s "community standards" policies here. We also heard back from Jackie Jags, a Chick-Fil-A spokeswoman. Jags advised by email that the one-time appreciation day "was not initiated by the company." We told Frazier, of Cruz’s campaign, that we’d learned that Facebook restored Huckabee’s pro-Chick-Fil-A page within 12 hours and that it looked like the declared appreciation day occurred after all. By email, Frazier reiterated that the page was initially yanked off-line by Facebook. Cruz’s claims about Facebook, she wrote, "are based in fact." Our ruling Cruz wrote that Facebook shut down a "Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day." This claim delivers only half the bird--we mean, story. In 2012, Facebook says, it responded to an objection by removing an events page encouraging turnout at Chick-Fil-A restaurants. But the appreciation day page didn’t violate Facebook’s community standards, the company says, and it was put back online within 12 hours; the celebration occurred after all. On balance, we rate Cruz’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-06934	"Since 2000, nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-12-million-have-slipped-middle/	In a tweet sent on July 18, 2011, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said that "since 2000, nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty." Sanders ended the tweet with his signature hashtag, #SharedSacrifice. A reader asked us to check his claim, so we did. First we contacted Sanders' office, but we didn't hear back from them. We then turned to Census Bureau data on poverty. In 2000, almost 31.6 million Americans were officially classified as having incomes below the poverty line. By 2009, that number had risen to 43.6 million. The difference? Exactly 12 million. So while the data for 2010 is unavailable, the most recent figures confirm that Sanders used a verifiable statistic. However, we see a number of issues that undercut Sanders’ interpretation and framing of the data. • Both the number of people in poverty and the poverty rate have increased from 2000 to 2009, but the increase in the poverty rate hasn't been in a straight line. The poverty rate -- the percentage of Americans officially counted as in poverty -- started at 11.3 percent in 2000, then climbed every year until 2004, when it hit 12.7 percent. Then it fell for two years in a row, to 12.3 percent in 2006, before climbing for the next three years to 14.3 percent in 2009. However, it’s worth keeping in mind that the poverty rate in 2009 -- the year Sanders used as his benchmark -- is still lower than some of the rates in the 1990s. In fact, the poverty rate was higher in 1992, 1993 and 1994, and it barely missed being higher in 1991. The highest rate was 15.1 percent in 1993. • Some people started out in poverty, rather than slipping into it. Every year, some American babies are born into poverty, and some newly arrived immigrants end up in poverty when they arrive on these shores. This complicates Sanders’ claim that "nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty." Obviously, neither the impoverished infants nor the new immigrants in poverty "slipped out of the middle class." These cases probably represent a small minority of all Americans in poverty, but they can’t be ignored, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "There is no reason to think that all the people newly classified as poor were members of middle class U.S. families in the previous year," Burtless said. • Some people who slip into poverty may not have been living in the "middle class." Sanders has a point if you break down the U.S. population into three classes -- impoverished, middle class and rich. And if Sanders defines the middle class as stretching all the way down to the poverty line, he’d be right that, on a net basis, "nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty" between 2000 and 2009. Defining the American middle class a fuzzy question -- and one that’s likely impossible to settle -- but we’re skeptical about the idea of extending "the middle class" all the way down to the poverty line. Both common English and public policy studies have long referred to "the working poor." It seems a lot more plausible that many of the people falling into poverty are members of the working poor than they are the middle class. If we’re right, this would make Sanders’ formulation an exaggeration. • Sanders’ tweet misses that people move in and out of poverty America. The incomes of many Americans are volatile. Someone may lose a job, or get hit by an expensive illness, or lose a spouse. Then, a year later, the same person may get a new job, enjoy improved health or remarry -- and those life changes may well spell the difference between poverty and improved economic fortunes. "A proper understanding of poverty would show that many Americans do not stay poor for very long," Burtless said. "They become poor temporarily, and then their incomes recover and they become non-poor." Burtless said the number of Americans who go from poverty to riches essentially overnight is small (think lottery winners, pro sports draftees and the like). Much more common is to travel from below the poverty line to a level not too far above the poverty line. A different data set -- a Census Bureau study known as the Survey of Income and Program Participation -- provides a window into how many Americans fall into, and climb out of, poverty every year. This study is useful because it’s "longitudinal" -- that is, it tracks what happens to people and families across time. The study found that there were nearly 243 million Americans who were not poor in 2004. Of these, 8.8 million, or 3.5 percent, became poor in 2005, and 10.1 million, or 4.2 percent of, were poor in 2006. At the same time, the study found 28.1 million poor Americans in 2004, and of those, 8.8 million, or 31.4 percent, exited poverty in 2005. By 2006, 11.7 million of them, or 41.6 percent, were no longer in poverty. So, not only did nearly one-third of poor Americans exit poverty between 2004 and 2005, but the numbers of people leaving and entering poverty (not counting babies and immigrants) were exactly in balance -- 8.8 million out, 8.8 million in. (Because the SIPP data set is different than the official poverty statistics, the numbers don’t square exactly, but the official numbers do show that the poverty rate was pretty static in 2004 and 2005, falling only slightly, from 12.7 percent to 12.6 percent.) So on the one hand, fewer than the 12 million Americans he cited fell into poverty and stayed there. There was simply too much flux for 12 million Americans to have stayed in poverty year after year. On the other hand, many more than 12 million Americans experienced a taste of poverty between 2000 and 2009. But in most cases, that taste of poverty was temporary. So where does this leave us? On Sanders’ side, he used a solid number, and he’s clearly right about the underlying trend -- despite some ups and downs, there are more impoverished Americans today than there were in 2000, both measured by raw numbers and as a percentage of the population. But we think he goes too far when he suggests these 12 million Americans simply fell from the middle class into poverty. And he ignores the fact that as those 12 million Americans were slipping into poverty, many, many Americans were simultaneously climbing out of poverty. On balance, we rate Sanders’ statement Half True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2011-07-20T15:01:47	2011-07-18	['None']
pomt-10058	"The House Democrats' so-called 'stimulus' has been stuffed with an astonishing $335 million to fund prevention programs of sexually transmitted diseases."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/29/national-republican-congressional-committee/std-spending-economic-stimulus-plan/	Republicans have large philosophical differences with the $819 billion economic stimulus package that passed the House on Jan. 28, 2009, and they have tried to discredit the plan by singling out relatively small spending proposals they see as inappropriate. One of the most widely cited claims from Republican leaders has been that the stimulus plan includes millions for sexually transmitted disease education. On the day of the the House vote, the National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release in the districts of 29 freshman House Democrats, chastising them for supporting a massive spending plan that the NRCC said includes $335 million for sexually transmitted disease prevention programs. A version of the news release circulating in Florida, for example, begins, "Rep. Alan Grayson (FL-08) and Rep. Suzanne Kosmas (FL-24) are set to cast their vote today on a so-called 'stimulus' package, which has shattered the trillion dollar mark. The question is: Will Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas still support the massive spending bill now that it has become public that the House Democrats' so-called 'stimulus' has been stuffed with an astonishing $335 million to fund prevention programs of sexually transmitted diseases?" Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip, had been making the same point for days, including in an interview with Fox News on Jan. 23. But the STD spending issue gained considerable momentum as a Republican attack after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it at the top of its popular political Web page on Jan. 28. So is there really STD prevention spending in the stimulus bill passed by House Democrats on Jan. 28? Yes, there is. In a section of the plan that includes funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the bill states that "not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs, as jointly determined by the Secretary and the Director." In an interview on CBS's Early Show on Jan. 29, the day after the House passed the stimulus package, anchor Maggie Rodriguez asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi how $335 million in STD prevention would stimulate the economy. Said Pelosi: "I'll tell you how. ... I'm a big believer in prevention. And we have — there's a part of the bill, on the health side of it, that is about prevention. It's about it being less expensive to the states to do these prevention measures." We note that while the NRCC news release specifically calls out House Democrats for the STD spending, the Senate version of the bill also includes it — in fact, slightly more. A portion of the stimulus plan approved by the Senate Appropriations committee on Jan. 27 states that "not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV." A committee report on the bill backs up the HIV and STD prevention spending with this analysis: "CDC estimates that approximately 19 million new STD infections occur annually in the United States, with 1 in 4 teenage girls currently infected. This epidemic is estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system $15,000,000,000 annually, all of which is preventable. The Committee has included $400,000,000 for testing and prevention of these conditions. The Committee intends that funds be used for grants to States for testing activities, and the prevention of STD infections like chlamydia that have been increasing dramatically in recent years." We're not going to wade into the debate over whether the spending is appropriate for an economic stimulus bill. We're only ruling on whether there is $335 million in the House version of the bill for STD prevention programs. We note that while the proposed $335 million in the House bill includes prevention programs for STDs, it also includes prevention programs HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis prevention programs, which are not always transmitted sexually. So we find the claim Mostly True.	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2009-01-29T16:20:37	2009-01-28	['None']
pomt-09720	"For the last decade the climate has been cooling."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/27/mary-matalin/matalin-claims-earth-cooling/	Skeptics of climate change often say the world has been cooling in the past decade. Conservative pundit Mary Matalin made that claim on CNN's Situation Room on Oct. 22, 2009. Matalin warned that the Obama administration is pushing too many big legislative initiatives such as a cap-and-trade plan to slow global warming when the administration should be focusing on the deficit. "If they care about reducing the deficit, which should be their No. 1 priority ... they're not going to be able to do this — all this other nonsense, cap and trade and all the rest of it. Too much, too fast," Matalin said. "Climate change is a fake issue anyway. ... There is not consensus science on what is causing global climate change. There is climate change, but for the last decade the climate has been cooling. There is the science. There is the data on that. They want to do this because they like to have all these programs being controlled by the government." So, Matalin acknowledges that the Earth's temperature is changing, but she's not so sure that those changes are man-made. We'll save the debate over whether climate change is caused by human activity for another day. For now, we're going to check Matalin's claim that the Earth has been cooling in recent years. Last spring, we checked a similar claim made by the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank. The group claimed that there has been no net global warming for over a decade; we found that False because the climate scientists we spoke with said that, while temperatures have remained relatively static over the last decade, very little can be learned about climate change in a 10-year window. Matalin's office sent us a few articles pertaining to the issue, two about a new book by Christopher Booker, a British author and climate change skeptic, who wrote in the Oct. 25 issue of the British newspaper the Telegraph that, "as the world has already been through two of its coldest winters for decades, with all the signs that we may now be entering a third, the scientific case for (carbon dioxide) threatening the world with warming has been crumbling away on an astonishing scale." Another study , published by Bob Carter, a professor of geology at Australia's James Cook University, in the Jan. 20 issue of the Australian newspaper argued that "global atmospheric temperature reached a peak in 1998, has not warmed since 1995 and, has been cooling since 2002." Carter is correct that global temperatures hit a high point in 1998. Several entities — including NASA, the Climate Research Unit in the United Kingdom and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States — track temperature changes. Generally speaking, their records show that 1998, a year when a warming pattern called El Nino ruled the weather, is the hottest we've had since scientists started collecting temperature information in the mid 1800s. NASA, on the other hand, pins 2005 as the hottest year on record. But no matter how you slice the data, temperatures have indisputably fluctuated in the last decade, contrary to Matalin's suggestion that they have cooled. This graph from NASA shows that the temperature increased slightly between 2000 and 2001, dropped in 2002, and rose once again the following year. In this case, the annual mean temperature goes up and down, and the five-year mean is on a steady rise. This graph from NOAA shows a similar trend, with temperatures dipping slightly at the beginning of the decade and peaking once again in 2005. We asked Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch, what to make of all these ups and downs. At the most, it shows a plateau, he said. But certainly not a cooling trend. "With climate change, not every year is going to be warmer," Heim said. "It's two steps up, two steps down — that's not a indication we're on a massive cooling trend." NOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt recently told the Associated Press the same thing: "The last 10 years are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record," he said. "Even if you analyze the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive, which means warming." If 1998 is the starting point, a year many climate skeptics tend to cite, everything looks cooler in comparison, said Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts. He also pointed out that, when evaluating the impact of climate change on temperature, it's misleading to look at only the last 10 years. A decade is such a small period of time that "it's like saying, 'It was cold here last week. What happened to climate change?'" Bradley said. It's a point we heard repeatedly from the climate experts we interviewed. They all agreed that, while climate temperatures may dip from year to year, it's shortsighted to say changes within a decade mean that climate change is going away. "If you just take a one-year comparison — say that it's cooler in 2008 than it was in 2007 — that's an improper use of statistics" to make judgments about climate change, said John Reilly, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It still remains much warmer than it was in the 1960s. To the extent that there has been some slight cooling, we still remain half-a-degree above what it was then." Indeed, climate records show that temperatures have been on the rise since the middle of the century, and that fluctuations between recent years are relatively small compared to overall increase. NASA estimates that global temperatures have risen a total of 2.3 degrees since 1895, and that 13 of the warmest years since 1850 have occurred in the last 14 years. Jim Hurrell, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., says these natural temperature variations are expected. "In the same way that El Nino made 1998 warm, in 2007 and 2008, La Nina made global temperatures a bit cooler than they have been running, but still much warmer than the long-term average," Hurrell said referring to El Nino's cooler counterpart. Citing just the last 10 years "is a classic case of taking the data and letting it tell a very misleading story," he said. Matalin said, "for the last decade the climate has been cooling." That suggests there has been a distinct reversal of the steady warming that scientists have documented for many years. But a review of the data shows that's not the case. The numbers show that in the past 10 years, global temperatures have not continued their sharp increase. But they have not cooled either. In fact, some years in the last decade have been hotter than the previous years. At most, they could be described as hitting a plateau. But they haven't cooled as Matalin said. We find her claim False.	None	Mary Matalin	None	None	None	2009-10-27T18:50:03	2009-10-22	['None']

pomt-00321	On investigating during the Supreme Court confirmation process, "The FBI doesn’t do that."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-fbi-limits-kavanaugh-supreme-co/	As the Senate Judiciary Committee moves to assess the allegations of sexual assault during Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s high school years, President Donald Trump dismissed a role for the FBI. When a reporter asked if he would ask the FBI to investigate the allegations, Trump said that "it would seem that the FBI really doesn’t do that." Here’s how the exchange with reporters unfolded as Trump left the White House for North Carolina: Reporter: "Why don't you have the FBI investigate Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh?" Trump: "Well it would seem that the FBI really doesn’t do that." Reporter: "They would if you asked them to." Trump: "They’ve investigated about six times before, and it seems that they don’t do that." Reporter: "Would you consider asking them to?" Trump: "Well, I would let the senators take their course. I would let the senators do it. They’re doing a very good job. They’ve given tremendous amounts of time." Here, we explore Trump’s claim that the FBI doesn’t investigate issues that emerge during the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees. Key takeaways • The FBI has participated in the confirmation process in the past. • In 1991, during confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, the FBI investigated Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual harassment against Thomas. • The FBI investigated because the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the White House to make it happen. Looking back to 1991 Today’s controversy involves allegations from California researcher Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh attempted to force himself on her sexually when she was 15 and he was 17. Senate Republicans are pressing for Ford and Kavanaugh to testify immediately. Ford and her lawyers say the FBI should first investigate. Republicans reject the idea. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, wrote in a Sept. 19 letter that "we have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligence." For any confirmation, the FBI conducts a background check. It is routine, and generally, the report it sends to the White House and the Senate requires no follow-up. We reached out to the White House and didn't hear back, but that might be what Trump had in mind when he mentioned six previous cases. However, there are examples of senators asking for more detail from the FBI. Most notably, in early September 1991, Senate Judiciary staff contacted Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill and specifically raised questions about sexual misconduct by nominee Clarence Thomas. Hill told them about sexual harassment when she and Thomas worked at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. According to Hill, in mid September, committee staff suggested an FBI investigation as a way to get the information in front of committee members. "Sen. Biden's office then arranged for the investigation," Hill said Oct. 7, 1991, referring to Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., who chaired the committee. How did Biden arrange that? NPR reporter Nina Totenberg became part of the story when the FBI material on Hill and Thomas was leaked to her. Hill agreed to talk to Totenberg, and the ensuing coverage unleashed turmoil in the hearing process. Totenberg told us how the FBI was drawn in. "A couple of senators went to Biden -- Leahy (Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy ) was one -- and said, 'You have to do something,' " Totenberg said. "So Biden requested from President George Bush — that was the elder Bush — to please have the FBI interview Hill and Thomas." Totenberg said in less prominent nominations, Senate committee members request FBI follow-ups "all the time," although not usually on such charged topics as sexual misconduct. The legal view Stephen Vladeck, law professor at the University of Texas, said Trump’s assertion that the FBI doesn’t look into things of this nature "is wrong." "The FBI is responsible for background checks of nominees, and routinely updates those checks as new, potentially relevant information comes to light," Vladeck said. Stephen Wermiel at the Washington College of Law at American University echoed that point. "The Judiciary Committee could say to the White House, the background check is now incomplete and could they please resume their work," Wermiel told us. "There is no criminal investigation. This is part of the character and fitness questions they explore." Our ruling Trump said that in investigating matters like the allegations against Kavanaugh, "it seems that they (the FBI) don’t do that." History says otherwise. The FBI was brought in to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct by Thomas during his confirmation process. The Senate Judiciary Committee lacks the power to order the FBI to investigate, but if it wanted, it could ask the administration to put the FBI on the case. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14712	"Bicycle ownership drops by half while obesity in Rhode Island rises by 154 percent"	/rhode-island/statements/2016/jan/03/my-city-bikes/advocate-links-ri-obesity-and-bike-ownership/	An organization trying to rally support for cycling sent us a news release highlighting what it said was a "shocking trend." The release from My City Bikes, a website and a mobile app that promotes cycling, was headlined: "Bicycle ownership drops by half while obesity in Rhode Island rises by 154 percent." So, Rhode Islanders’ are fatter because we own fewer bicycles? The claim caught our attention and we read on in search of the senders’ sources. The release says the data on declining bicycle ownership came from a recent Johns Hopkins study that analyzed data from 1.25 billion households around the world. And the My City Bikes press release links declining bicycle ownership with rising obesity in Rhode Island. The group even created a graph charting obesity in Rhode Island and the "global bicycle ownership rate." The authors aren’t fazed by the fact that they don’t have any Rhode Island-specific data on bike ownership. Their release, which has a Providence dateline, goes on to state: "While bicycle ownership has been on the decline, locally obesity rates in Rhode Island have more than doubled, from 10.1% in 1990 to 25.7% in 2012." Yes, obesity here has increased and the My City Bikes obesity data comes from a credible source, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which gets its information from the Rhode Island Department of Health. So, part of My City Bikes statement is correct. But, what use is the "global" bike ownership data? Is it relevant? Has My City Bikes even cited it properly? The text of the release says that Johns Hopkins researchers identified a decline in bike ownership — from 60 percent in 1989 to 32 percent in 2012. They suggest that statistic came from the analysis of data from 1.25 billion households "around the world." They got that wrong. In fact, the Johns Hopkins researchers saw no significant decline when they analyzed bike ownership in those 1.25 billion households. The decline cited by My City Bikes is for 148 countries and does not include China and India. In the United States, Olufolajimi Oke, a civil engineer and lead author of the Johns Hopkins study, said there’s been a renaissance of bicycle use in many American cities. "Ownership globally and ownership in the U.S. are two very different things," Oke said. "And one has to be very careful about assuming any correlation between ownership and other indicators of public health." And Oke had no data on Rhode Island. We did find an analysis of Census data by the League of American Bicyclists found that the percentage of Rhode Islanders commuting to work via bicycle rose from 0.23 percent in 2005 to 0.50 percent in 2014. Those are very small numbers. There is not much else out there, says Alex Krogh-Grabbe, executive director of the Rhode Island Bicycle Coalition. So, why did My City Bikes in the headline to its press release state: "Bicycle ownership drops by half while obesity in Rhode Island rises by 154 percent?" And what’s the benefit of comparing statistics on rising obesity in Rhode Island’s with statistics on bike ownership around the world? Tina Schmidt, one the authors of the news release, told us in an email: "The answer is relevance." "As a local reporter you know first hand that to have a news story published a local angle is a standard prerequisite for a community based media outlet regardless of the story's merit." Schmidt acknowledged that the ownership decline of 60 percent to 32 percent ignores China and India. But she insisted that My City Bikes’ reference to a global decline was still correct, even though the press release did not point out that the statistic excludes data from two of the world’s most populous countries. And she denied making any cause-and-effect relationship for Rhode Island. Our Ruling But she did. That’s the way the headline is cast. Sadly, obesity is on the rise, but My City Bikes has no data on bike ownership in Rhode Island and yet it names Rhode Island in its headline and datelines its release in Providence. The claim is bogus. Pants on Fire!	None	My City Bikes	None	None	None	2016-01-03T00:00:00	2015-12-07	['Rhode_Island']

pomt-10940	Says Beto O’Rourke is "the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for" impeaching President Donald Trump.	/texas/statements/2018/jul/25/ted-cruz/beto-orourke-only-senate-candidate-call-donald-tru/	There’s no sign of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas favoring the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Now Cruz says his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, stands alone nationally for tilting the other way. Cruz’s campaign said in a July 17, 2018, press release that O’Rourke "continued today his reckless and radical Senate campaign based on impeaching Pres. Donald Trump. He is the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for impeachment," the release said. We wondered: Is O’Rourke alone among Senate hopefuls in advocating the Republican president’s impeachment? Not so, we found, though it looks like he's the only Senate nominee to date to say he'd vote to launch impeachment proceedings. Refresher: The Constitution gives the House the power to impeach the president, vice president and other civil federal officials for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors while it gives the Senate the power of trying impeachments. Convictions and consequent removals from office require the concurrence of two-thirds’ of senators in attendance. In recent history, President Bill Clinton was impeached; he wasn’t convicted or removed. O’Rourke has repeatedly said he’d vote to impeach Our search of the Nexis news database showed that as early as August 2017, O’Rourke said he’d vote for Trump’s impeachment. Most recently, the Dallas Morning News quoted O’Rourke saying in July 2018 that Trump merited impeachment for his performance in the just-completed summit with Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin. O’Rourke responded to a News reporter: "Standing on stage in another country with the leader of another country who wants to and has sought to undermine this country, and to side with him over the United States — if I were asked to vote on this I would vote to impeach the president. Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed." Then again, O’Rourke in December 2017 was among 364 House members to vote for tabling a proposal by Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, to impeach Trump, records show. Before that vote, Democratic leaders released a statement referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry that said impeachment wasn’t timely. When we asked Cruz’s campaign how the senator determined that O’Rourke was alone among Senate candidates calling for impeachment, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out by email that the News story noting O’Rourke’s willingness to vote for impeachment quoted Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, leveling a more limited claim. Roe called O’Rourke "the only major-party candidate in America to call for impeachment." Another Cruz contact, Emily Miller, emailed us a web link to a November 2017 Reuters news story describing O’Rourke saying that Trump’s racially charged rhetoric and divisive governing style had led O’Rourke to support impeachment. O’Rourke was quoted saying: "I’m now convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that Donald Trump is unfit for that office." O’Rourke spokesman says he’s not ‘called’ for impeaching Trump When we reached out to O’Rourke about Cruz calling him the only Senate candidate to call for impeachment, campaign spokesman Chris Evans said by email: "Beto has never called for the impeachment of President Trump." Evans maintained that O’Rourke’s responses to reporters and voters about voting in favor of impeachment weren’t the same as the candidate calling for impeachment. Evans elaborated that O’Rourke hasn’t brought up impeachment "at town halls or rallies, has not sent fundraising or petition emails on it, has not posted social media advocating for it, and has not used his current position of public trust to do so through floor speeches, letters or resolutions." Evans also pointed out an interview we’d missed. For an episode of Showtime’s "The Circus," posted online in May 2018, O’Rourke replied that as a member of the House, he’d vote right then to impeach Trump. Asked if he’d vote as a senator to convict Trump, O’Rourke replied: "Until I'm in that position and am able to hear the case made by each side, all the facts laid out, I can't give you an answer on that--nor would you want me to." Other Senate candidates? Our search for other Senate candidates favoring impeachment turned up a couple. Responding to our inquiries, nonpartisan observers said by email that while O’Rourke appeared to be the only Democratic Senate nominee to speak out for Trump’s impeachment, he was likely not the only Senate candidate to do so. Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the Cook Political Report, pointed out a May 2018 TIME news story quoting Richard Painter, a longshot Democratic challenger to Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, saying he favors Trump’s impeachment. The story said too, though, that Painter’s "emphasis on impeachment talk sets him apart from most other Democratic candidates." Duffy called Painter a "second-tier candidate who is notable for a couple of reasons: he used to be a Republican and he is taking on an appointed incumbent. Generally, the Senate and House Democratic leadership is dissuading their candidates from talking about impeachment because they are afraid such talk will energize Trump voters and entice them to the polls in November. "O'Rourke is a break-the-mold candidate," Duffy wrote, "so it doesn't surprise me that he is talking about it." Generally, Duffy commented, the "challenge here is that literally hundreds of second- and third-tier candidates file to run for the Senate and get very little attention. I suspect that some of the Democrats in these categories have called for Trump's impeachment, but no one is paying attention." Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia expert who analyzes federal races, described O’Rourke as alone among Democratic candidates in "somewhat-to-very competitive Senate races" to call for impeachment. "However," Sabato wrote, "we do not keep up with uncompetitive Senate states. Sometimes long-shot candidates will take positions that more cautious nominees who have a real chance to win will avoid." Our Nexis search turned up another candidate backing impeachment. In June 2018, Kevin de León, a Democrat running for the Senate in California, called for Trump to be impeached immediately, the Sacramento Bee reported in a June 21, 2018, news story. De León, who faces incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein on the November ballot, was quoted saying: "What this president has done easily surpasses what Richard Nixon did back in Watergate. ... What I've seen to date easily, in my mind, qualifies for impeachment." Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke is "the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for" impeaching Trump. Since August 2017, O’Rourke has been saying that he’d vote to impeach Trump, which would start with a vote in the House, where he serves. O’Rourke might be the only Senate nominee to say as much. However, Democratic Senate contenders in Minnesota and California also have talked up Trump's impeachment. We rate this claim about O'Rourke's uniqueness False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-09223	Elena Kagan "violated the law of the United States at various points" with her opposition to military recruiters.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/16/jeff-sessions/sessions-says-kagan-violated-us-law-regarding-mili/	In a discussion of Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan on ABC's This Week on May 16, 2010, the back-and-forth between Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the committee's ranking Republican, largely focused on Kagan's position on military recruitment while she was dean at Harvard Law School from 2003-2009. We examined a claim from each of the senators, and here we're focusing on one from Sessions. "She disallowed them from the normal recruitment process on campus," said Sessions. "She went out of her way to do so. She was a national leader in that, and she violated the law of the United States at various points in the process." There's no debate that Kagan challenged the law regarding military recruiting on campuses. But is it true that Kagan "violated the law of the United States at various points in the process"? The military recruiting issue long predated Kagan's tenure at Harvard Law School. Since 1979, the law school had a policy that requires employers who want to recruit on campus through the school's Office of Career Services to sign a statement that they do not discriminate based on race, gender or sexual orientation. The 1993 "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy -- which denied entry to openly gay people -- precluded U.S. military officials from signing, and so they were prohibited from using the Office of Career Services. But that didn't mean military recruiters were barred from campus altogether. Rather, the military recruited through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a student organization (now called the Harvard Law School Armed Forces Association). "The symbolic effect of this special treatment of military recruiters was important, but the practical effect on recruiting logistics was minimal," wrote Robert C. Clark, a professor and dean at Harvard Law School from 1989 to 2003, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on May 11, 2010. However, Clark wrote, in 2002 the military officials "took a hard line with Harvard" and threatened to yank all the university's federal funding because they said Harvard was not providing equal access to military recruiters in violation of the 1996 Solomon Amendment. Here's what the Solomon Amendment says: "No [federal] funds...may be provided by contract or by grant to an institution of higher education (including any subelement of such institution) if the Secretary of Defense determines that that institution (or any subelement of that institution) has a policy or practice (regardless of when implemented) that either prohibits, or in effect prevents...the Secretary of a military department or Secretary of Homeland Security from gaining access to campuses, or access to students (who are 17 years of age or older) on campuses, for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer." In light of the threat to school funding, Harvard relented in 2002. Military recruiters were allowed to use the school's Office of Career Services, though administrators essentially put out statements saying they didn't like it and that they felt the military policy was discriminatory. That's where things stood when Kagan took over in 2003. In 2003, Kagan penned a letter to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue: "I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. The importance of the military to our society -- and the extraordinary service that members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- makes this discrimination more, not less, repugnant. The military's policy deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible. This is a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order. And it is a wrong that tears at the fabric of our own community, because some of our members cannot, while others can, devote their professional careers to their country." Nonetheless, she allowed military recruiters to use the Office of Career Services. Meanwhile, an association of law schools known as the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights was mounting a legal challenge to the Solomon Amendment. In January, 2004, Kagan and several dozen of her colleagues at Harvard Law filed an amicus brief (sometimes known as a "friend of the court" brief) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit (which has jurisdiction over district courts in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania), arguing that the federal government should not be able to withhold funding if the schools applied the same policies to all recruiters. The withholding of funds interfered with the schools' freedom of expression to oppose what they felt were discriminatory policies, they argued. In November 2004, the Third Circuit court concluded that "the Solomon Amendment cannot condition federal funding on law schools’ compliance with it" and that "FAIR has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits" of the case. Kagan immediately reinstated the ban on military recruiters’ use of Harvard Law’s Office of Career Services. She wrote in a letter to the faculty that the military could still recruit through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association (as it did prior to 2002). But with that case pending before the Supreme Court, the Pentagon threatened to withhold all federal funding to Harvard, and Kagan reversed course and allowed recruiters to again avail themselves of the Office of Career Services. So the ban lasted one semester in 2005. Kagan signed on to another amicus brief, again making its case to the Supreme Court, but on March 6, 2006, the Supreme Court rejected that circuit court ruling with a resounding 8-0 ruling. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, rejected the claims of Kagan and the other law professors that the school had the right to enforce non-discrimination policies against the military. "Under the statute, military recruiters must be given the same access as recruiters who comply with the policy," the opinion said. So did Kagan violate the law when she banned military recruiters from using the Office of Career Services for that one semester? First off, the law didn't say universities may not bar military recruiters. It said certain types of federal funds may not go to those schools if they bar the recruiters. There's a big difference. It's certainly fair to say Kagan tested the law, but it's another thing to claim she violated the law. Kagan barred military recruiters from using the Office of Career Services only after a Third Circuit court ruled the Solomon Amendment was "likely" unconstitutional. And she reversed course even before the Supreme Court ruled against the universities -- so she didn't willfully flout the law after the Supreme Court made the law unmistakably clear. Some may argue that the Third Circuit decision didn't affect Massachusetts, which is in the First Circuit, and that the Supreme Court was decisive in its reversal of that circuit court decision. So one could also argue that Kagan didn't comply with what the law required, but we think it's a stretch for Sessions to say Kagan "violated the law of the United States at various points in the process." There was at least some legal ambiguity -- for a time -- about Harvard's obligation. And, we note, no money was ever denied to Harvard. And so we rate Sessions' comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04439	"We weren't told they wanted more security " for diplomatic facilities in Libya.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-we-werent-told-Libya-security-requests/	The attack on the consulate in Libya that took the life of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans has put the Obama administration on the defensive. In the vice presidential debate, moderator Martha Raddatz pressed Vice President Joe Biden to explain why administration officials at first described the attack as something that emerged from a protest: RADDATZ: What were you first told about the attack? Why were people talking about protests? When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns, there were no protesters. Why did that go on? BIDEN: Because that was exactly what we were told by the intelligence community. The intelligence community told us that. As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment. That's why there's also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again. RADDATZ: And they wanted more security there. BIDEN: Well, we weren't told they wanted more security there. In this fact check, we'll look at whether the administration was told that that U.S. officials in Libya wanted additional security. In a House hearing on Wednesday, a State Department employee, Eric Nordstrom, said he told his superiors twice that the embassy mission needed more armed security. Nordstrom was the regional security officer for Libya in the months before the attack. In a July cable, he said he wanted 12 guards plus military trainers. Charlene Lamb, a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department who reviewed his request, confirmed at the hearing that she opposed keeping the security team in Libya. Beyond putting his assessment on paper, Nordstrom made that request verbally to a State Department officer in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. "His response to that was, 'You're asking for the sun, moon, and the stars,'" Nordstrom said. Nordstrom, who still works for the State Department, described a phone call with that officer and his frustration with the department's bureaucracy. "I said, ' It's not the hardships. It's not the gunfire. It's not the threats. It's dealing and fighting against the people, programs, and personnel who are supposed to be supporting me," Nordstrom said. State Department officials at the hearing argued that they met other security requests and that the additional personnel would have been of little use since they would have been based in Tripoli. The attack took place in Benghazi. Nordstrom was seeking more forces for the embassy mission nationally, not exclusively Benghazi. In fact, the number of guards at the Benghazi consulate when the attack occurred was at or near the number Nordstrom said were needed for that site. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said that Biden was aware of the House testimony and was answering the debate question in terms of what the White House knew, not the entire administration. "The vice president was speaking for himself and the President, Vietor said. "In over four hours of testimony the other day, no one suggested that requests for additional security were made to the president or the White House. These are issues that are appropriately handled by security professionals at the State Department." Our ruling Vice President Biden said, "We weren't told they wanted more security." That statement is accurate only if you define "we" to mean "people at the White House." A State Department officer in Libya said that he requested additional guards and was turned down by at least one other official in the State Department. The White House said Biden meant that the security requests had not been conveyed to him and others in the executive office. It's possible that Biden and Obama were unaware of that request. Still, it was made in the State Department, which is part of the Obama administration. Even if it didn't make its way up through the bureaucracy, a request was made. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2012-10-12T15:53:24	2012-10-11	['Libya']

pomt-12370	"Since the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/05/scott-pruitt/are-coal-mining-jobs-50000-last-year-not-exactly/	Just days after President Donald Trump announced that he would be pulling the United States out of the Paris international climate agreement, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator went on the Sunday shows to defend Trump’s decision. During the June 4 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd asked Scott Pruitt whether it was disingenuous for the administration to promise a rebirth of coal. On the one hand, coal is a high-carbon-emissions fuel that is at a disadvantage under the Paris agreement and could potentially benefit from the United States’ exit from the accord. On the other, some experts have said that the demise of coal as an energy source has less to do with emissions than with lost market share to a competing fossil fuel -- natural gas -- and technological improvements that have bolstered renewable energies such as wind and solar. Here’s how Pruitt answered Todd’s suggestion that the administration was making a "false promise." "Dead wrong, because the numbers show exactly the opposite," Pruitt said. "In fact, since the the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs." Is that correct? Calculating job figures for the coal industry is tricky, as we have previously noted, but we found reason to be skeptical of Pruitt’s numbers. The EPA pointed us to a separate interview Pruitt had on ABC’s This Week, when he said, "We've had over 50,000 jobs since last quarter -- coal jobs, mining jobs -- created in this country. We had almost 7,000 mining and coal jobs created in the month of May alone." This is also not firmly backed by data. The BLS numbers Let’s start with the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers. Currently, the BLS counts about 50,000 coal mining jobs in the United States -- total. That makes it all but impossible for the first half of Pruitt’s claim -- 50,000 more mining jobs since the end of last year -- to be accurate. Indeed, according to the BLS data, the actual increase in coal jobs since the end of last year was 1,300, while the monthly increase in May was 400. That’s far below the increases of 50,000 and 7,000 that Pruitt cited, respectively. Based on his comments to ABC, Pruitt appears to have been referring to the broader "mining and logging" sector in the BLS data. But even by that standard, his numbers are inflated. The mining and logging sector has grown by 38,000 jobs since the end of last year and grew by 6,000 in May. He’s close when he calls 6,000 "almost 7,000," but 38,000 is well short of 50,000. And if Pruitt meant to refer to these statistics, they include logging jobs as well -- a sector he didn’t reference on the shows. Are there other job numbers to analyze? The coal industry has long chafed at the BLS’ definition of coal-sector jobs. Terry Headley, the director of communications for the American Coal Council, said that coal employment numbers compiled independently by states are typically much larger than what BLS has found, perhaps because many states use broader definitions of who should be counted. For instance, Headley said, coal truck drivers -- probably numbering several thousand nationally -- are not broken out from the BLS data for "truck drivers." The situation is similar for electricians, surveyors, mechanics, and equipment service technicians, he said. In West Virginia alone, he said, state data for 2015 show 48,327 in the category of miners, mine support, and onsite processing staff. "If you look purely at the federal numbers you will only get about 12,000 for the state," he said. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, doesn’t dispute that this can have an effect on the numbers. "It’s possible that the added employment connected with moving the coal once it is removed from the ground, such as transportation and warehousing, and the use of the coal in downstream industries, such as in electric power generation and integrated steel plants, would produce a somewhat bigger employment effect," Burtless said. Official BLS data for the coal mining industry "does omit many workers who work in the industry," said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the jobs site Indeed.com. "Related industries, like support activities for mining, presumably include some who work in the coal mining industry, though related industries might combine coal with oil and gas and therefore make it hard to come up with a broader total of coal-mining employees." Still, Burtless said that getting from 1,300 official coal-mining jobs to 50,000 additional jobs that can be credited to the sector would likely require an even more generous definition -- one that estimates how many additional jobs in the overall economy stem from the added purchasing by newly flush coal companies and miners. Headley said that such calculations for the coal sector have historically ranged from a multiplier of three to a multiplier of 11 -- that is, from three times to 11 times as many jobs created in the broader economy for every job created in coal mining. Such a wide range of estimates should serve as a yellow light, economists say, since they are subject to advocates’ rosy estimates. Is there an upswing in coal production? Pruitt is at least able to point to data showing a recent increase in coal production. Data calculated by the federal Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration shows that year-to-date coal production has been 17.6 percent higher than the comparable figure for 2016. And data from the Association of American Railroads shows that, the amount of coal loaded onto rail cars has been significantly higher so far this year than it was during first few months of 2016. Such data indicates that more coal has been mined and shipped in the first part of this year, even if actual job gains aren’t showing up in the data yet. Still, this begs the question of whether this increase had anything to do with the Trump administration’s policies. The increase in coal jobs began before Trump was elected. The job gains in the coal sector during the final five months of the Barack Obama administration -- an administration that Trump’s camp blamed for waging a "war on coal" -- were actually slightly larger than the equivalent number for the first five months of the Trump administration, namely 1,400 versus 1,300. Moreover, good and bad times in the coal sector tend to stem more from industry-specific developments and international factors than domestic policy changes, experts said. "Coal mining is a highly cyclical industry, making it hard to attribute ups and down to policy or political factors," Kolko said. A recent report in NPR put its finger on one possible factor that has boosted the coal sector in recent months -- unusually high demand for "metallurgical" coal, which is used for making steel, rather than for electricity generation. Metallurgical coal accounts for about about one-sixth of coal production worldwide. Art Sullivan, a mining consultant and former coal miner in Washington, Pa., told NPR that Australia, the world’s leader in metallurgical coal, has faced supply-chain troubles in recent months due to rail and weather problems. This, plus higher Chinese steel production, has caused the price for Australian metallurgical steel to spike, making U.S. firms more competitive recently than they would ordinarily have been, Sullivan told NPR. Our ruling Pruitt said, "Since the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs." The official Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows strikingly smaller increases than what Pruitt said, even when taking into account his comments on other Sunday shows. Meanwhile, there is evidence that coal production and shipment is higher this year compared to early 2016, but the rise actually began under Obama and it’s not clear that Trump policies have been the driving factor.

pomt-03472	"More than half of last year's U.S. college graduates are unemployed or underemployed."	/florida/statements/2013/jun/14/don-gaetz/florida-leaders-say-more-half-2012-college-graduat/	Senate President Don Gaetz and House Speaker Will Weatherford say changes are needed to Florida’s education system to match the realities of Florida’s economy. In a column published June 11, 2013, in the Tampa Bay Times, the two wrote that Florida’s K-12 system should emphasize rigorous vocational training for students who want it, arguing that those are the jobs that are in demand. The stakes, Weatherford and Gaetz wrote, are critical. "While more than half of last year's U.S. college graduates are unemployed or underemployed, the ironic truth is that there are thousands of jobs in Florida unfilled because employers can't find workers whose skills meet industry specifications," the two Republican leaders wrote. We decided to focus on how last year’s college graduates are faring. (We are putting Gaetz on the Truth-O-Meter because his spokeswoman said he was the one who contributed that fact to the piece.) The statement is actually an old line that Mitt Romney used during the 2012 presidential campaign. Its genesis is based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs. The findings were published by the Associated Press on April 22, 2012, under the headline "In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed." "Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans...," the AP wrote. "About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year." While the Gaetz/Weatherford statement appears to mirror the AP’s reporting, there actually are a few distinctions. Gaetz and Weatherford did err in referring to "last year’s U.S. college graduates," when the study -- which came out in 2012 -- studied all bachelor’s degree holders under 25. Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research, said the bigger issue with the claim is how the figures may be interpreted and the difference between using "jobless," as the AP did, and "unemployed" as Gaetz and Weatherford said. To most non-labor economists they are the same thing, but they can have a different technical definition, said Gary Burtless, a labor market expert with the Brookings Institution. Unemployed means someone who wants a job but cannot find one. Jobless means anyone who doesn’t have a job -- whether they want one or not. As such, Sum says that Gaetz and Weatherford inflated their claim. "About half the jobless were not actively looking for work partly due to college attendance," Sum said. Put another way, about half of recent college graduates who are "jobless" do not want a job because they are pursuing some other degree. Sum said his staff ran the numbers again using the first four months of 2013 and essentially found the same results. As far as those underemployed, it’s important to note that it might not all be the economy -- or public education’s -- fault. "There are many perfectly respectable things a new college graduate may be doing (like getting an advanced degree or having and raising a new child) that might leave them jobless and underemployed," Burtless told us via email. Our ruling In defending changes to the state’s education system, Gaetz and Weatherford said that "more than half of last year's U.S. college graduates are unemployed or underemployed." To get there, the two relied on articles citing research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which found that of recent bachelor’s degree earners -- those under 25 -- 53.6 percent were either jobless or underemployed. There are two factors for us in issuing our rating: 1) How big of a mistake was it for Gaetz and Weatherford to say "last year’s U.S. college graduates" when the study looked at all bachelor’s degree earners under 25, a time frame that would span beyond 2012? And; 2) How big of a difference is it for Gaetz and Weatherford to use "unemployed" when "jobless" might have been better? On the first question, it’s likely that the statistics would be different by looking just at 2012 graduates compared to a longer period of time (that data isn’t available). On the second, economists we talked to said it’s commonplace for people to interchange "jobless" and "unemployed," though some experts would argue they mean different things. While we don’t quibble with Weatherford and Gaetz using the term unemployed, it’s important to note in this particular context that researchers looked beyond people unable to find work and included people who were not looking for work. That difference in approach changes the figure. After reviewing all the evidence, we think it’s safe to say that the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s exactly our definition of Half True.	None	Don Gaetz	None	None	None	2013-06-14T10:57:52	2013-06-11	['United_States']
pomt-01695	Says Mitch McConnell voted "two times against the Violence Against Women Act."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/13/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-ad-claims-mcconnell-twice-/	Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes says in a new ad that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has forgotten that "over half the voters in Kentucky are women." The proof? Grimes turns to Ilene Woods, an elderly Kentucky woman, who sums it up in a question for Mitch McConnell: "Senator, why did you vote two times against the Violence Against Women Act and against enforcing equal pay for women?" Silence. "I can never get him to answer this one either," Grimes offers. Does Grimes’ evidence hold water? Let’s take a look at McConnell’s record on the Violence Against Women Act to find out. This is a case where the literal truth is still somewhat misleading (as FactCheck.org dutifully laid out in its own review). The Violence Against Women Act was introduced in 1990 by Joe Biden, then a senator from Delaware. The bill created federal penalties for sex crimes, provided federal grants to law enforcement agencies to combat crimes against women, created the National Commission on Violent Crime Against Women, aided victims of sexual assault, funded women’s shelters and changed how courts can weigh a victim’s past sexual experience in sexual assault cases. McConnell was one of just three Republican cosponsors of the bill, along with 22 Democrats. It was sent to a committee but never came up for a vote. Biden tried again in 1991. Support was building. This time, McConnell was one of 10 Republican cosponsors and 56 overall. But again, it didn’t make it out of committee. The bill was introduced a third time by Biden in 1993. This time, there were 67 cosponsors, but McConnell wasn’t one of them. (His campaign would not say why.) While the bill once again died in committee, the language of it was adopted into the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a $30 billion omnibus crime bill that was also sponsored by Biden. The bill won widespread bipartisan support, passing the Senate in 1993 on a 95-4 vote. McConnell joined the majority of the Senate in voting for it. The House bill also contained the Violence Against Women Act, but included as well a much more controversial assault weapons ban. This was opposed by a majority of Senate Republicans, including McConnell. It passed the Senate 61 to 38, with McConnell voting against it, and Clinton signed it into law. The Violence Against Women’s Act was twice reauthorized, once in 2000 and again in 2005, passing the Senate unanimously on each occasion. The 2005 reauthorization occurred under Republican control of the Senate (McConnell was in the party leadership at the time) and included additions such as enhanced penalties for stalking and programs for American Indian victims, according to the Congressional Research Service. Grimes’ campaign, though, pointed to more recent votes against the Violence Against Women Act twice. Indeed, in 2012 and 2013, McConnell opposed the measured put forward by the Democratically controlled Senate. What were his objections in reauthorizing a bill he had supported many times throughout the previous two decades? McConnell contended that Democrats added a number of contentious provisions in the legislation that Republicans, who backed the overall legislation, could not sign off on. Republican angst was centered on three new components: including victims of discrimination for sexual orientation and gender identity among "underserved populations"; increasing the cap on U-Visas, a visa that grants nonimmigrant status to immigrant victims of domestic violence who assist police in prosecuting their attackers; allowing non-American Indian residents on tribal land to be prosecuted by tribal courts for domestic violence against Native women. In both 2012 and 2013, Republicans put forward their own legislation that reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act without these three elements. In 2012, McConnell voted for an amendment offered by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. It failed 37 to 62. Later that day, the Senate passed the Democratic bill, but it couldn’t get through the GOP-controlled House. In 2013, the Senate again passed the Democratic measure. McConnell voted against the Democrats’ bill and for an unsuccessful amendment by Sen. Chuck Grassely, R-Iowa, that did not contain the provisions for LGBT victims, American Indians and immigrants. This time, the Senate bill passed the House, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. Our ruling Grimes’ ad claims McConnell twice voted against the Violence Against Women Act. The claim paints a very incomplete picture. McConnell supported the act repeatedly when it was first introduced and when it first passed the Senate in the early 1990s, and twice voted to reauthorize it. While he voted against the Democratic versions of the bill in 2012 and 2013 that included new provisions for sexual orientation, immigration status and tribal lands (and eventually became law), he voted for Republican measures that largely maintained the status quo. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context. Therefore, we rate it Half True.	None	Alison Lundergan Grimes	None	None	None	2014-08-13T11:35:40	2014-07-30	['None']

pomt-01377	Republicans "made it easier to buy a gun" in states they won in 2010.	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/16/mark-shields/shields-gops-2010-statehouse-gains-eased-rules-gun/	If the polls are to be believed, most voters are approaching the upcoming midterm elections with less zest than in the past. Republicans hold the enthusiasm edge over Democrats, but their advantage is about half as big compared to 2010, when they made major gains at the state and federal levels. Still, Republicans are poised to do well and liberal columnist Mark Shields warned about the consequences of GOP victories. "When the Republicans swept all these statehouses and state legislatures (in 2010), they did two things," Shields said on Oct. 10 on PBS’ Newshour. "They made it easier to buy a gun and tougher to vote." The part about gun purchases caught a reader’s ear and she asked if Shields had it right, so in this fact-check, we see what happened to the laws about buying guns after 2010. To cut to the chase, relatively modest changes took place in few states. But we found no evidence that Republicans across the country made sweeping changes to make it easier to purchase a firearm. According the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states saw at least one legislative chamber or a governorship shift from Democratic to Republican control. Within that group, we found just three instances of new laws that you could say made it easier to buy a weapon. (There are examples of states relaxing rules on carrying concealed weapons and the places where guns are allowed, but Shields specifically spoke about it being easier to buy guns.) Out of 16 states, only Michigan, Ohio and Florida relaxed some rules on gun purchasing. We'll explain the changes in each state. Changes in Michigan, Ohio and Florida Michigan emerged from 2010 with Republicans in charge of everything -- the governor’s office and both the House and the Senate. With large majorities in both chambers, they did away with the state system of requiring handgun buyers to get a purchase permit. Until then, a person who wanted to buy a handgun had to correctly answer at least seven out of 10 questions on gun safety. If they managed that, they got a card that they could take to a gun dealer and buy a weapon. Steven Howard is a lawyer and firearms expert based in Lansing, Mich. Howard said doing away with the purchase permit made little difference. "The Brady background check remained in effect," Howard said. "If you didn’t pass the Brady test, they didn’t sell you the gun." But on a gun owner’s online discussion board, the end of the purchase permit was well received. A Michigan user called "Mike the Greek" was surprised to see notice of the relaxed rules in the window of his local gun store. "Not sure if this is everywhere, but it sure makes it easier for some people to buy!" he wrote. Looking around at other states, according to records kept by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Ohio passed a law in 2011 that allowed people convicted of misdemeanor drug offenses to purchase firearms. In the midterm election, Republicans had taken the governor’s office and the Ohio House. In Florida, where the governor’s office also changed hands (from an independent to a Republican), counties were barred from imposing their own waiting periods on firearm purchases. (Most of the discussion in creating the Florida law was centered around where people could carry weapons, not about purchasing firearms.) Experts on both sides agree Laura Cutilletta is senior staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Cutilletta said there was no significant easing of gun buying rules. "There were certainly some laws that affect purchase, but they are not the majority by any means," Cutilletta said. Joseph Olson, a retired professor of law at Hamline University, and former board member of the National Rifle Association, also saw little change. "A few states made it more difficult in some instances but almost all states did nothing regarding this issue," Olson said. Erich Pratt, director of communications for Gun Owners of America, told us the same thing. A couple of notes: • In 2012, Virginia repealed the restriction against the purchase of more than one handgun in a 30-day period. However, 2010 had no effect on the party balance of power in Virginia. • A review of state gun laws passed after the December 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., found that states with full Republican controll accounted for nearly three quarters of the changes that enhanced gun rights, mainly easing the rules for carrying weapons. But again, those change are distinct from the rules for buying a gun. Our ruling Shields said that when Republicans took control of state legislatures in 2010 they made it easier to buy a gun. Out of 16 states won by the GOP, three passed laws that relaxed the rules for some gun buyers. The experts we reached said the changes were modest and not as widespread as Shields implied.

pomt-05140	"My opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government."	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/22/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-government-investigation-targeted/	Attacking a political rival when one of their donors runs into trouble is a campaign tactic that’s as old as dirt. Republican Rep. Jim Renacci tossed plenty of that dirt two years ago when the incumbent Democrat he defeated, former Rep. John Boccieri of Alliance, hung onto campaign cash he got from veteran New York Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel after the House Ethics Committee chided Rangel for taking a Congressional Black Caucus trip that was improperly funded by corporations. "As if John Boccieri’s voting record isn’t troubling enough, the fact that his campaign coffers have been fueled by the fruits of Washington’s culture of corruption raises further questions about his judgement and his ethics," said a March 1, 2010 statement from Renacci’s campaign. Similar attacks have been leveled at Renacci since a May 18 article in The New Republic revealed that federal law enforcement authorities were examining donations that Renacci’s campaign got from employees of a North Canton direct marketing firm called Suarez Corporation Industries. Federal agents sought contribution records from the campaigns of Renacci and GOP U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel after the Toledo Blade published a report about large donations Suarez employees made to the two campaigns. Wealthy political donors sometimes try to skirt limits on the amount they can give campaigns by having other people write checks and reimbursing them. That practice is illegal. The company and its employees deny any wrongdoing, as do the political campaigns. Mandel subsequently returned the money. But Renacci held on to the cash, pending the investigation’s outcome, and that has prompted the same sort of attacks as this year’s election looms that Renacci directed at Boccieri two years ago. "Since news broke that over $100,000 in questionable donations to Congressman Jim Renacci’s re-election campaign are the focus of a federal investigation, Jim Renacci has yet to do the right thing and return or donate them," says a notice on the campaign website of Renacci’s Democratic election rival, Rep. Betty Sutton of Coply Township, near Akron.. Renacci was queried about the controversy at a June 14 town hall meeting in Rocky River. He responded with an attack against Sutton: "My opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government." Sutton, he said, "kept them for two years until there was a final decision made, and then she returned them." PolitiFact Ohio wasn’t aware that the federal government had investigated political contributions that Sutton received, so we asked Renacci’s campaign to explain his assertion. Campaign spokesman James Slepian said the congressman misspoke, and that he instead meant to reference a past investigation into Rangel, her campaign donor. Slepian said Renacci accidentally referred to Sutton’s campaign "contributions" rather than using the word "donor." "When he said ‘contributions’ under investigation in reference to Sutton, what he clearly meant to say was ‘donor’ under federal investigation," said an email from Slepian. "As you know, Jim has issued numerous statements to the press (including The Plain Dealer) that one of Sutton’s donors was under investigation for two years and that he is following the same course she took by waiting for the outcome of the investigation before deciding whether or not to return the donations. That is what he was trying to communicate." Slepian also blasted Sutton and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House of Representatives’ Democrats, for stating that Renacci himself is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The DCCC made that claim in a June 1 press release. PolitiFact Ohio rated that it False after the head of the FBI’s Canton office debunked the accusation. Sutton was among dozens of Democratic office holders to whom Rangel donated money. It is true that allegations about Rangel began to surface in 2008, when The New York Times ran a series of articles about Rangel that suggested irregularities. Allegations in those articles included abuse of rent-stabilized apartments and failure to report $75,000 in income, as well as his protection of a tax loophole that favored one of his donors. Within a week of the House Ethics Committee's Feb. 25, 2010, report on Rangel’s improper junket, Sutton announced that she was giving the $7,000 she got from Rangel to charity. Sutton subsequently called on Rangel to resign from the House of Representatives. Slepian says Renacci’s decision to wait until the FBI probe is complete before deciding whether to get rid of the the Suarez money parallels Sutton’s decision to wait. But does it? The Rangel conduct under investigation had nothing to do with Sutton or the donations Rangel made to her campaign. The FBI’s investigation specifically involves donations made to Renacci. Also, Rangel was being probed by the House Ethics Committee for violating House of Representative rules. The FBI is probing donations to Renacci as potential crimes. And the amounts of money involved are significantly different: $7,000 from Rangel to Sutton’s campaign; more than $100,000 from Suarez employees to Renacci’s campaign. Data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics says Suarez is Renacci’s biggest political donor. Regardless, the claim on the Truth-O-Meter is Renacci’s statement to the town hall audience that "my opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government." PolitiFact Ohio doesn’t play "gotcha" games. To their credit, the folks in the Renacci camp acknowledged he provided incorrect information to the crowd in Rocky River. But to those in attendance, the information they have to go on is what Renacci told them that night. That’s why the comment merits a check from PolitiFact Ohio. On the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci’s statement rates False.	None	Jim Renacci	None	None	None	2012-06-22T06:00:00	2012-06-14	['None']

pomt-11649	"Atlanta is on its strongest financial footing in 40 years."	/georgia/statements/2018/jan/12/keisha-lance-bottoms/atlantas-finances-best-40-years/	In her inaugural speech, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told the crowd that the city was well-positioned to move forward in the coming years. "We came back from the Great Recession and worked hard for eight years to put Atlanta’s finances in a good place," Bottoms said. "Atlanta is on its strongest financial footing in 40 years." Four decades is a long time, and we wanted to give that assertion a harder look. In large measure, the claim holds up. But there are some caveats about the exact numbers that support it. Plus, measures of financial strength are always somewhat subjective. A few key indicators give a broad picture of how well any municipality is doing. There is the bond rating, which companies such as Moody’s and Standard & Poor's use to indicate the risk of lending money to the city. The rating firms bumped up Atlanta in 2016. Standard & Poor’s raised its rating to AA+ from AA. Moody’s raised its rating to AA1 from AA2. Fitch increased its rating to AA+. As far as anyone can tell, those are the best ratings the city has ever enjoyed. Fiscal analysts also look at pension fund exposure. As the number of retirees grows, live longer, and the cost of health care continues to rise, the future costs have become much larger than the cash in the pension fund needed to cover them. One of the mavens of municipal finance data, Richard Ciccarone at Merritt Research Services, gave Atlanta a mediocre grade on its pension position. "Their funding ratio is only 65.9 percent, which is not that good," Ciccarone said. "It’s been worse. It has been low as 55.4 percent in 2006." City spokeswoman Jenna Garland said the decision in 2017 to merge three pension boards into one would tighten up fund management and increase investment returns. "Improved pension fund performance will result in a reduced need for the city to fund pension benefits, freeing those funds for use for city services," Garland said. Not so fast, said Katherine Willoughby, professor of public administration at the University of Georgia. "I would be in a wait-and-see mode," Willoughby said. "These are volatile things, and you hope the money will come in, but you don’t know until it happens." The pension fund issue was not a significant factor in the late 1970s. A big boost in the general fund Perhaps the biggest feather in the city’s cap is the hefty balance of the general fund at the end of 2017. The general fund is Atlanta’s main account to pay for everything from fixing potholes to keeping police on the beat. It went from $153 million in 2016 to $200 million in 2017. Measured against the city’s $553 million budget, the percentage — 35.8 percent — had never been higher "Never before in the city’s history have we both had a AA+ credit rating alongside record reserves and a record percentage of the budget in reserves," Garland said. "We believe the historical record would reflect that at no point from 1978 until 2016 when the city’s credit was upgraded was the City in a stronger financial position than today." The city’s fiscal team dug into the financial archives of old Consolidated Annual Financial Reports and sent us a spreadsheet. This table is an excerpt showing four key years.: 1978, 1979, 2016 and 2017. (Other financing resources include one-time dollars that flowed in or out of the general fund apart from the usual revenues or expenses. The total budgeted number is the amount city leaders approved at the start of the year. Total expenditures are the actual spending for the year.) Year Beginning Fund Balance Total Revenues Total Expenditures Other resources End Fund Balance Total Budgeted Expenditures Percent of budget 1978 31,213,421 101,955,596 95,055,812 (1,451,941) 36,661,264 141,848,805 25.85% 1979 36,661,264 113,507,631 110,880,579 (833,375) 38,454,941 162,465,755 23.67% 2016 38,454,941 530,310,000 545,822,000 17,647,000 40,589,941 543,311,000 7.47% 2017 153,149,000 572,908,000 597,180,000 71,205,000 200,082,000 558,379,000 35.83% The city’s main yardstick to make comparisons across 40 years is to look at the general fund’s ending balance as a share of the total budget at the start of the year. In those terms, 2017 is much stronger than 1978, 35 percent compared to 25 percent. Michael Pagano, dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said it’s difficult for large cities to enjoy the margin that Atlanta has. "To have 35 percent for a city the size of Atlanta is remarkable," Pagano said. On the other hand, while it’s fair to compare the fund to the original budget, Pagano said it’s equally fair to compare to the actual spending. "If you are asking how well you performed, then you want to compare to the actual expenditures," he said. Willoughby agreed, saying the budget is more theoretical, and "it’s more anchored in reality to look at the actual spending." When we did that, the results flipped and the early years looked better than the recent ones. Year Total Expenditures Fund Balance Percent of Expenditures 1978 95,055,812 36,661,264 38.57% 1979 110,880,579 38,454,941 34.68% 2016 545,822,000 153,149,000 28.06% 2017 597,180,000 200,082,000 33.50% At the same time, after correcting for inflation, the shear size of the fund is larger today than in the past 40 years. Neither Pagano nor Willoughby took anything away from the gains Atlanta has made, particularly in the way it has risen from the fiscal wreckage of the Great Recession. Their point was that there are different ways to crunch the numbers. And they also offered several cautionary thoughts about what lies beneath the data. In the mid-1980s, Pagano collected surveys from financial officers at the 100 largest cities. The numbers he got from Atlanta for those years (included in the full spreadsheet, but not in the excerpt above) didn’t match what the city sent us. Conclusion? Pinpoint accuracy is not in the cards. Numbers that are broadly correct are about the best you can expect, especially when looking across several decades. Willoughby and Pagano cautioned against reading too much into the one-time $71 million bolt of cash that came in 2017. Our research found that money came from the decision to liquidate two city funds, with tens of millions from the Underground Atlanta project accounting for the bulk of it. "It was a benefit for this year," Willoughby said. "But you can’t count on it happening again. To pin your good fiscal health on one big drop of money is probably not appropriate." All of the experts we reached told us that there’s always a subjective element in municipal finance. "This is more of an art than a science," said Tracy Gordon, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "How you combine the metrics and how you rate them involves some value judgments." Our ruling Bottoms said the city was on the strongest financial footing in 40 years. Several indicators point in that direction, though the weakest factor centers on pensions. Atlanta faces significant challenges in funding its future pension obligations. That was not a factor in 1978. However, the situation is better than a decade ago. More promising is the city’s bond rating. It is higher than ever. The relative size of the general fund also falls in the plus column. In constant dollars, the 2017 general fund is larger today than it was 40 years ago — one long-time researcher called it "remarkable." The fund did rely on some one-time cash infusions and a different, also reasonable, approach shows that the situation was a little better in 1978. There are factors that detract from the claim’s accuracy but the facts support the general thrust. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-07732	"We’ve now gained private sector jobs 12 months in a row."	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/02/tim-kaine/weve-now-gained-private-sector-jobs-12-months-row/	Amid cheers of "Run, Tim, run," former Gov. Tim Kaine was the star attraction at the Virginia Democratic Party’s annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner Feb. 19. With fellow Democrat Jim Webb’s announcement that he will not seek a second term in the U.S. Senate next year, Kaine is under intense pressure to run for the seat. He tossed the hungry crowd slabs of red meat by criticizing the Republican Party’s economic record. Kaine, now chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the economy has performed better under President Barack Obama than it had under his predecessor, George W. Bush. "Two years into a Democratic administration gross domestic product is not shrinking; it is growing again," he said. "We’ve now gained private sector jobs 12 months in a row." With the U.S. unemployment rate at 9 percent and millions still out of work from the recession, we wondered if this jobs claim is true. Private sector jobs cover workers not employed by the federal government, a state, city or county. Of the roughly 130 million Americans who currently hold jobs counted by BLS, about 83 percent of them, or 107.8 million, worked in the private sector last month. There are two sources for job data. One is the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases information on job creation and the unemployment rate each month. The second source is Automatic Data Processing, a business outsourcing company that conducts a wide-ranging, monthly employment survey of private businesses. According to BLS, private payrolls climbed by 144,000 people during March 2010 and have risen every month since then, meaning they have increased for 11 straight months. In January, the most recent month for which data are available, private payrolls added 50,000 jobs, according to preliminary estimates. It’s worth noting that total payrolls, which include government jobs as well as private ones, have been on a roller coaster during the past year. Total payrolls posted big gains in March, April and May of 2010, helped by the hiring of short-term Census Bureau workers. But as those short-term jobs ended during the summer and fall, total payrolls slumped, falling each month from June through September. State and local budget cuts also meant fewer government jobs. Since October, total payrolls have been on the climb. What about the data from ADP, which focuses solely on private-sector jobs? Data show slow job growth began in March 2010 and continued until September, when 2,000 private jobs were lost. Growth resumed in October and has lasted four straight months. In 2009, the private sector lost about 5 million jobs, and during the first quarter, the economy was shedding more than 700,000 jobs every month. Now it is gaining 700,000 jobs over the course of six to eight months. That suggests we face a long road to full recovery. William Johnson, a labor economist at the University of Virginia, said this recession and the dot-com recession in 2000 were different from past slumps. In previous downturns, he said, output declined more than payrolls ebbed. Companies, in effect, kept more employees than were strictly necessary because they wanted to retain their skills for better times ahead. That paradigm shifted in 2000 and 2008, Johnson said. Companies cut employees faster than they reduced production, asking the remaining staff to work harder and pick up the slack. "It’s a new pattern, and nobody has really been able to explain it," Johnson said. "Some people say it is the health care law introducing uncertainty about the cost of hiring new employees, but it also happened in 2000 when there was no health care bill." Top officials at the Federal Reserve have projected that the national unemployment rate will remain at or slightly below 9 percent for the rest of 2011 and stay above 7 percent into 2013. The national unemployment rate was roughly 5 percent before the recession began in 2008. Let’s review. The official government source on employment says private sector job growth has occurred in each of the last 11 months. ADP, another nationally respected source on job growth, says private payrolls grew in 10 of the last 11 months and fell by just 2,000 jobs in the one month where a decline was reported. Speaking as an advocate of the president and his party’s policies, Kaine presented private sector job growth in the best possible light. But it is important to remember that the economy has recovered just 20 percent of the private sector jobs lost in 2009. Kaine said private sector jobs have been created for "12 months in a row." He was close, but missed the bull’s eye. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2011-03-02T07:56:09	2011-02-19	['None']
pomt-12563	Says Al Jazeera, "a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. ... What is he hiding?"	/georgia/statements/2017/apr/13/congressional-leadership-fund/attack-ad-ties-jon-ossoff-al-jazeera/	No Democrat has held Georgia’s 6th Congressional District since 1979. Now, in a race to replace Republican Tom Price who joined the administration as secretary of Health and Human Services, 30-year-old Democrat Jon Ossoff stands out. In a field packed with 16 candidates from both parties, the latest poll shows Ossoff with about 40 percent. He needs to break 50 percent on Election Day, April 18, to avoid a runoff. Republican groups and their allies aim to block that. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, posted a web video that ties Ossoff to Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based news organization. The ad opens with shots of Islamic fighters followed by a grainy television snippet of Osama bin Laden talking. The voiceover says: "Al Jazeera, a media outlet that has been described as a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. But Jon refuses to tell voters exactly how much money he’s received. Just like Jon refuses to tell voters the truth about his experience. What is he hiding?" The focus of this fact-check is on the ad’s statement, combined with the imagery that accompanies the claim, that Al Jazeera, "a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars." A mouthpiece for terrorists? The ad cites an article from the American Journalism Review to back up its description of Al Jazeera. The article, entitled "The Al Jazeera Effect," centered on the news organization’s strategy of getting on-the-ground camera footage and reporting in the early days of the Arab Spring protests. The article relays a variety of opinions that have been offered about Al Jazeera. The ad chose one from this passage: "For years, critics have assailed what they see as anti-Semitic, anti-American bias in the channel's news content. In the wake of 9/11, Al Jazeera broadcast statements by Osama bin Laden and reported from within the ranks of the Taliban, earning a reputation as a mouthpiece for terrorists." But the article also quotes David Marash, a former Nightline correspondent who joined and then left Al Jazeera over concerns about anti-American bias. Despite that history, the article said Marash described "Al Jazeera as ‘the best news channel on earth.... Al Jazeera has become the model all around the world. Video reporting from the field sets them apart and makes them the best.’" Congressional Leadership Fund spokeswoman Courtney Alexander offered several other examples of criticism of Al Jazeera. A 2001 New York Times Magazine article said "day in and day out, Al Jazeera deliberately fans the flames of Muslim outrage." A 2013 USA Today article quoted an Israeli center analyst who said Al Jazeera’s Arab language broadcasts "very often promote a very radical Islamist approach." Alexander also pointed to reports that the news network is backed by the Qatari government, and Qatar has been linked to financing terrorist groups. On the other hand, in 2011, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described Al Jazeera in glowing terms for its work during the Arab Spring. "I’m very proud of the role that Al Jazeera has played," McCain said. "I congratulate you and I mourn for those who have sacrificed in the service of providing the information, which is knowledge, which is power." The point is, some people have a bad opinion of Al Jazeera and others think it’s done good work. The ad cherry-picked images and a quote that cast Al Jazeera in the most dubious light possible. That characterization was the basis for the rest of the ad. Al Jazeera payments to Ossoff The video said Al Jazeera has been paying Ossoff thousands of dollars. Its source is an article from the conservative website the Washington Free Beacon, based on Ossoff’s congressional financial disclosure form. The report covered all of 2016 and nearly three months in 2017, and in it, Ossoff includes Al Jazeera as one client out of 13 that paid his firm Insight TWI at least $5,000. Insight TWI is a British-based documentary film production company. Ossoff became its CEO in 2013. Here’s the key section from his disclosure: The Washington Free Beacon asked Ossoff to go beyond the federal requirements and say how much he received from Al Jazeera. He didn’t respond. As a technical matter, according to the experts we reached, the Al Jazeera payments went to the firm, not Ossoff as the video said. He was CEO and shared in the proceeds, but all we know is that Al Jazeera paid Insight TWI at least $5,000. In a statement, Ossoff’s campaign said his firm’s clients include broadcasters in Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. "Under Jon’s leadership, the company’s investigations have resulted in the arrest of foreign officials stealing U.S.-taxpayer-funded aid and quack doctors who mutilate women, as well as exposed atrocities committed by ISIS in Iraq, including sexual slavery," the statement said. According to the Insight TWI website, the company produced 10 film projects since Ossoff took the helm. Of those, nine were for Al Jazeera. During the time period covered by Ossoff’s financial disclosure, 2016 and 2017, there is only one film project reported for Al Jazeera. The other was for the BBC. The most recent Al Jazeera project was a six-part series on Latin America. Topics covered included child trafficking and sexual exploitation across the Argentina-Bolivia border, allegations of slave labor in Brazil’s garment industry and deaths in police custody in Mexico. Over the years, Al Jazeera paid Ossoff’s company for investigations that revealed government corruption in Africa, extra-judicial killings, corrupt doctors selling HIV/AIDS drugs on the black market, and related themes. One film dealt with terrorists. It was produced for the BBC and followed a group of Yazidi women turned soldiers who seek revenge on ISIS fighters. Alexander of the Congressional Leadership Fund noted that Ossoff mentions the BBC but not Al Jazeera on his website. Ossoff’s resume When Ossoff launched his campaign, he touted his national security background, saying he had five years under his belt as a congressional staffer. We found that was an exaggeration. By our count, he spent about three years in middle-to-senior level foreign policy posts. The ad says Ossoff "refuses to tell voters the truth about his experience." On the contrary, the campaign provided a timeline (at the bottom of this link) showing what he did and when. Alexander told us that on the stump, Ossoff doesn’t go out of his way to acknowledge his exaggeration. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund video says Al Jazeera, "a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars and asks "what is he hiding?" This is a case when a series of partial truths are strung together to promote the worst possible conclusion. Some Americans have called Al Jazeera a mouthpiece of terrorists. Others, including a U.S. senator, have praised it as a beacon of reporting in the Middle East and Africa. The ad cherry-picks its evidence to characterize Al Jazeera only as aligned with terrorists. Al Jazeera did pay Ossoff's company. During the time frame covered in his financial disclosure, Ossoff’s firm produced two film projects, one for Al Jazeera and one for the BBC. Al Jazeera has been a major client over the years, but going back to the start of 2016, it is one out of 13. In addition, the films Al Jazeera have commissioned focus on wrongdoing in Africa and Latin America and have nothing to do with the Middle East or terrorism. The ad suggests Ossoff is hiding something. Given the evidence at hand, the answer appears to be that he is unwilling to open the books of his business beyond what the law requires. The ad’s description of Al Jazeera strikes us as particularly selective and central to the suspicions the ad raises. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06910	On campaign contributions from electric utilities.	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/25/ward-armstrong/armstrong-changes-stance-taking-campaign-money-ele/	With TV cameras whirring, House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong strode to the door of his enemy on July 21 and proclaimed there is a conspiracy against him. In a news conference in front of Appalacahian Power Co.’s Roanoke headquarters, Armstrong, D-Henry, said electric utility companies have indirectly funneled $100,000 to his opponent in this fall’s election -- Del. Charles Poindexter, R-Franklin County. The electric companies, he charged, donated cash to four Republican leaders who then gave the money to the Southside Victory Fund, a political action committee that benefits Poindexter. Armstrong has been fighting electric companies for several years, saying they are taking advantage of weak regulations to gain exorbitant rate increases. He said Poindexter’s campaign contributions suggest the Republican will be friendly to the power companies. Poindexter said Armstrong has scaled "the height of hypocrisy" in condemning others for accepting money from the electric industry. So we thought we’d look into the affair and see if the minority leader’s position on the taking contributions from the utilities has changed. Armstrong has unsuccessfully introduced bills during the last two years that would give the State Corporation Commission greater regulation of electric rates. Most of Armstrong’s ire has been directed at Apco, which serves his Southside constituents and has sought 14 increases over the last four years that have raised residential rates by 42 percent. At the news conference, Armstrong promised to continue fighting Apco and portrayed Poindexter as the power company’s pet. "What it says is that Apco thinks they’re going to get favorable treatment out of my opponent, certainly more so than they’re going to get from me," Armstrong said. "You know what, they’re right." Armstrong pointed to the campaign finance records of Gov. Bob McDonnell, Speaker Bill Howell, House Majority Leader Kirk Cox, and Del. Bill Janis. The records show a correlation between sums each Republican received from electric companies and the amounts he gave to Poindexter’s PAC. But suppose we go a step further and conclude -- as Armstrong does -- that this is an open-and-shut case of money being funneled from the utilities to Poindexter. Does that prove the Republican is a reliable friend of electric companies? Well, let’s go back a few years and consider the case of another legislator who accepted money from electric companies. His name is Ward Armstrong. Between 2007 and 2010, Armstrong received $100,750 in contributions from electric companies according to the Virginia Public Access Project. The Majority Leader accepted $81,000 from Dominion Power, $5,250 from Appalachian Power, and $14,500 from other electric utilities and industry lobbyists. How does Armstrong square his past acceptance of contributions from electric companies with his condemnation of Poindexter for possibly receiving utility money? Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, said her boss stopped taking contributions from electric companies in late 2009. "Ward hasn’t accepted any money from them since he realized that they were taking advantage of state laws to get as much money as they can," she said. Armstrong did receive one last contribution -- $250 -- from Apco in January 2010. Wilker said the minority leader gave the money to a charity, Grace Network of Martinsville. Wilker said Armstrong is not turning down money from the utilities, it just doesn’t come in anymore. And if it did, Armstrong said he would take it and donate it to a charity that helps Southside residents pay their electric bills. So Armstrong, who once campaigned with money from electric companies, will no longer do so. And he criticizes an opponent who may have received indirect contributions from the utilities. Although Armstrong has his reasons, a shift has clearly occurred. Full Flop!	None	Ward Armstrong	None	None	None	2011-07-25T06:00:00	2011-07-21	['None']

pomt-12974	Says an arms control treaty supported by Barack Obama "could give the U.N. some authority to regulate guns."	/texas/statements/2016/dec/22/greg-abbott/false-greg-abbotts-claim-arms-treaty-could-give-un/	Greg Abbott warned in a December 2016 tweet that President Barack Obama seeks Senate ratification of a treaty that could empower the United Nations to regulate guns. The prospect of the U.N. mucking with American guns should sound familiar. That’s because the treaty has long sparked similar claims--many of them short on facts. Abbott's tweet, Republican concerns The Texas governor tweeted: "This Treaty by Obama could give the UN some authority to regulate guns. Tell the Senate to reject it." Abbott further pointed to a Guns.com story stating, in part, that the Arms Trade Treaty, recently urged on the Senate by the lame-duck Democratic president, seeks to regulate the world’s annual exchange of $70 billion in conventional weaponry including tanks, helicopters and missiles. That Dec. 13, 2016 story doesn’t say the U.N. deal would regulate guns within the U.S. Still, it notes opposition from Republicans including Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, who signed legislation in April 2016 prohibiting the enforcement of international laws, such as the treaty, "that could affect the Second Amendment," Guns.com says. The Democratic-led Senate signaled its concerns in 2013, voting by a 53-46 margin against the U.S. going along with any such treaty. That move occurred a month before the U.N. General Assembly approved the treaty with 154 nations in favor, 3 opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it; North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed it. The 2016 Guns.com story also recaps that when Abbott was attorney general of Texas, he "promised to slap the federal government with a lawsuit if the treaty was ratified." On Sept. 25, 2013, Guns.com then reported, AG Abbott said in a press release: "By signing this treaty, the Obama administration has attempted to subject Americans’ right to bear arms to the oversight of the United Nations." Abbott said in an April 2013 Fox News interview: "The concern is that the United States is trying to use the United Nations as a back-door mechanism to try to legislate here in the United States, in this instance trying to impose gun control." In that interview, Abbott was pressed to elaborate on the treaty’s threat to domestic gun rights. He then conceded the treaty focuses on international trade in armaments. Still, he expressed concern the U.N. would exploit the treaty to impose gun registration and other requirements. Past fact checks We’ve spotted flawed claims about the treaty before. In May 2012, we found Pants on Fire a Texas candidate’s statement that the treaty--then still under negotiation--would ban the use of firearms. In an April 2012 speech, Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, said any treaty provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced. "We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment," Countryman said. Later, we rated False a Texas claim that the U.N.-advanced treaty mandated an international guns registry. Nations that ratify the treaty must track conventional arms that move across their borders, share information about the transfers with the U.N. and other countries and then annually report the imports and exports in broad categories such as "battle tanks" to the U.N. Treaty rests on self-regulation So what does the treaty do? The treaty states its purpose is to "establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms" and to "prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion." It requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. The treaty calls on participating nations to take "appropriate measures" if they determine that a shipment has been diverted, although it does not clearly define those steps. The accord applies to tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft and helicopters, warships, missiles, missile launchers and small arms such and handguns and rifles. Participating nations would be required to send annual reports to the U.N. on their imports and exports of conventional weapons. The treaty gives no body including the U.N. any enforcement power, but supporters have expressed hope it will create common standards among countries for international trade of weapons. To go into effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. As of mid-December 2016, it had been accepted or ratified by 91 countries including France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain, Australia and Mexico. The State Department has said the treaty, if joined by the U.S., would not put additional controls on the import or export of guns in America. Instead, it would require other countries to establish "control systems that are closer to the high standard the United States already sets with its own national standards," the State Department wrote in a September 2013 fact sheet. Also, the pact’s preamble affirms "the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system." We called and emailed Abbott so he could otherwise offer backup for his regulation claim and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Abbott said the treaty advocated by Obama "could give the U.N. some authority to regulate guns." This statement, which fits with other incorrect claims about the U.N. gaining the power to preempt U.S. gun laws, doesn't hold up because the treaty doesn’t regulate gun traffic within countries and also doesn’t hand the U.N. enforcement powers. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-10278	McCain, "voted against renewable sources of energy, against biofuels, against solar power, against wind power.... "	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/22/barack-obama/mccain-has-done-a-little-for-renewable-energy/	As part of a volley of accusations over competing energy plans, Sen. Barack Obama suggested that Sen. John McCain has opposed efforts to develop alternative sources of fuel. In an Aug. 5 speech in Ohio, Obama said of McCain, "He voted against renewable sources of energy, against biofuels, against solar power, against wind power, against an energy bill that – while far from perfect – represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country." It's true that McCain has voted against measures on the Senate floor that included provisions aimed at encouraging the development and production of alternative energy. In 2005, for example, McCain voted against a series of amendments to an energy bill that set higher goals for the use of renewable energy. One proposal required refineries to use 8-billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012 and another required 10 percent of electricity sold by utilities by 2020 be produced by renewable energy. Both passed and were included in the final bill, which McCain voted against. But the Obama campaign is somewhat selective in the evidence it cites about McCain's position on alternative fuel. While McCain has long voiced his opposition to subsidizing ethanol, he recently softened his position on the biofuel. PolitiFact examined his change in position during the Republican primary. The Obama campaign also forgets to mention McCain's vote in favor of a 1992 energy law that required some government agencies to begin using vehicles that ran on alternative fuels and authorized more than $500-million in Energy Department research on renewable energy. The Obama campaign is trying to portray McCain as a friend of big oil on energy issues, and that hasn't always been the case. As we point out in another item, McCain burnished his "maverick" reputation a bit in 2002 when he and Democratic Sen. John Kerry pushed a plan to raise mileage standards for cars. The effort failed. The Obama campaign cites McCain's vote against the 2005 energy bill, which was signed into law by President Bush, as evidence of him voting against wind power. McCain did vote against the measure, in part because he thought a federal tax credit for alternative energy production was too generous and not cost-effective. But his opposition to the legislation was much broader than that. We'll note, too, that former presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton also voted against the bill. Said McCain at the time: "This bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country." For us, though, the issue is the claim made by Obama. He attacks McCain for voting against the 2005 energy bill, which carried federal subsidies for a host of renewable energy programs. And it's true that one of the things McCain said in voting against that bill was that it was too generous in those subsidies. Still, that energy bill vote doesn't reflect the whole of McCain's record on renewable energy, as Obama's statement makes it sound. There is at least one exception to McCain's record in opposing subsidies for renewable fuels, which leads us to conclude that this Obama claim is Mostly True.

pomt-13810	"The Cleveland police has issued a stand down order to officers."	/ohio/statements/2016/jul/18/mike-cernovich/no-cleveland-police-are-not-standing-down-rnc/	Attorney, author and motivational speaker Mike Cernovich announced a big "scoop" on his blog the week before the Republican National Convention. Cernovich, a California lawyer and ruckus-starter who backs Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, quoted "anonymous sources" as saying police in Cleveland were taking a hands-off approach at the huge event amid expected protests. "Although the radical left has days of protests planned and has a history of protests, the Cleveland police has issued a stand down order to officers, I can exclusively report," Cernovich wrote. The same day, he tweeted: On his blog, Cernovich elaborated that this was akin to "when thugs from the left attacked Trump supporters at his San Jose rally," referring to an accusation that the California city’s police failed to protect pro-Trump activists, for fear of their own safety, during a scrappy demonstration last month. His message reverberated across social media, reaching, for example, the Nevada Tea Party: But this was news to us, so we checked with our hometown source to learn if it was true: Cleveland police. Department spokeswoman Jennifer Ciaccia was blunt in an email: "It is totally untrue." Steve Loomis, the head of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, said, "Wildly false report! No such order exists!" As of 5 p.m. Monday, the first day of the convention, at least one image of a protester being arrested surfaced on Instagram. The protester, activist and journalist Kathy Wray Coleman, had just finished speaking when she was handcuffed by police, allegedly for an outstanding warrant from University Heights. This doesn’t look like a police "stand-down" to us. We heard from Cernovich just as we were publishing this fact-check. In an email, he suggested his story helped thwart the stand-down order from being enforced. "I stand behind my story and am proud that efforts by (Ohio Gov. John Kasich) and those friendly with him were stopped by my exclusive story regarding a stand down order," Cernovich wrote. "Local police are great and want to defend people. But many higher ups ... took the primary too personally." Our rating Cernovich claimed on his blog and Twitter that Cleveland Police have issued a "stand down" order for the RNC. Cleveland police vociferously proclaim this statement 100 percent false. The scene on the ground shows plenty of law enforcement doing their jobs.

pomt-07854	Says Ohio is one of just 17 states with an estate tax, and it has "the lowest threshold in the nation."	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/11/jay-hottinger/rep-jay-hottinger-says-ohios-threshold-taxing-esta/	The new Republican majority in the Ohio House of Representatives has made repealing the state's estate tax a priority. Opponents of the tax say it hurts Ohio's competitive position with other states, and drives away residents and business. Among its staunchest supporters are cities and towns. They received about $270 million of nearly $334 million that the tax generated in fiscal 2009, according to the Ohio Department of Taxation. The rest went to the state. PolitiFact Ohio is not looking at the debate on merits of the estate tax. But we did decide to check a couple of basic claims made by State Rep. Jay Hottinger, a leading estate tax opponent, on the "Sound of Ideas" on WCPN 90.3 FM. The Newark Republican said Ohio is one of only 17 states with an estate tax. And, he said, Ohio has "the lowest threshold in the nation" for taxable estates, making it a tax that affects the middle class as well as the wealthy. We found Hottinger's count of states is accurate, or as close as anyone is likely to get. State tax laws change frequently, if not constantly, and at least six states dropped or reinstated an estate tax -- or did both -- in the past six months alone. Ohio does have the lowest threshold among them. The state's tax is levied on estates valued above $338,333 (although there is a 100 percent exemption for surviving spouses). Data from the Ohio Department of Taxation shows that one in 14 estates (about 7 percent) in Ohio are subject to the tax, the Associated Press reported. More than 7,400 estates owed the state money in the fiscal year that ended in mid-June. Among the other states, the thresholds ranged from a low of $675,000 in New Jersey to a $5 million threshold in North Carolina. Looking at those levels made us wonder about a related claim we've heard from both opponents and supporters of the estate tax -- that Ohio's threshold is low because it is outdated, reflecting an earlier generation's measure of wealth. We checked the history and talked with an analyst at the Department of Taxation, and learned that the current rate of taxation and the $338,333 deduction were set by the General Assembly in 2000. The previous threshold was $25,000. It was set after the state's 75-year-old inheritance tax was repealed and the estate tax was adopted in 1968. Twenty-five thousand dollars meant more in 1968 than it does today, but it didn’t equal wealth, and adjusted for inflation, it wouldn’t equal $338,333. According to the consumer price calculator of the Federal Reserve Bank, its 2011 equivalent would be $158,601. Hottinger, a sponsor of pending legislation to repeal the tax, has described it as "the most unfair and most egregious tax in the state of Ohio." We’re not running that statement through the Truth-O-Meter. But we do rate his claims about the number of states that levy the tax and Ohio’s low threshold as True.

pomt-11512	Says Gov. Rick Scott "ended $20 million in funding for mental health care despite Florida already ranking at the bottom."	/florida/statements/2018/feb/21/florida-democratic-party/florida-democatic-party-says-gov-scott-ended-strea/	In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., the Florida Democratic Party issued a list of grievances against Gov. Rick Scott for what it called a "long record" of opposing gun safety and money for mental health initiatives. Scott "ended $20 million in funding for mental health care despite Florida already ranking at the bottom," the group said in a news release Feb. 19. Florida’s bottom-rung ranking for mental health funding came up a year earlier, after another Broward County shooting, this one at the Fort Lauderdale airport that killed five people. State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, said Florida ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding, which we rated Mostly True. A year later, we wanted to see if anything had changed with Florida’s ranking on mental health spending and if Scott really ended $20 million in mental health funding. Florida is consistently at the bottom of the pack for mental health funding A key source of data for ranking states on mental health spending is the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. According to the Institute, Florida ranked 51st in per capita spending in the fiscal year 2014. The institute collects annual data on expenditures by state mental health agencies from the states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The total amount of expenditures is divided by the state population to compare the amount per capita. For Florida, the group tracked money spent through Florida’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Office, managed by the Department of Children and Families. So it doesn’t include services paid from other sources, including Medicaid or local funds, on mental health programs. Still, Florida has consistently been near the bottom of the rankings for years, Ted Lutterman, senior director of the institute previously told PolitiFact. We did not hear back from the institute to see if there was a more updated ranking, but mental health experts in the state said nothing had meaningfully changed. Did Scott end $20 million in funding for mental health? The biggest thing to know about the $20 million grant is it was never intended to be permanent. The $20.4 million was part of a federal block grant for substance abuse and mental health services. It was administered by the Florida Department of Children and Families and expired when the 2017-18 budget took effect. Again, Scott didn’t set the expiration date or cut if off early — he allowed the grant to expire. The Florida Democratic Party argues that it was Scott’s responsibility to fill the funding gap, and when he had the opportunity to fill it, he did not. "It is the state’s job to manage the federal funds they receive and fill in gaps that may arise," said Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Caroline Rowland. But Scott’s press office said it’s "completely false" to say that the grant’s expiration led to budget shortfalls. News reports, such as the Naples Daily News story included in the Florida Democratic Party’s news release, noted how mental health and substance abuse providers were struggling to provide their normal services "after the Legislature and a state agency quietly allowed $20.4 million in federal money to expire without replacing it." Even though the money was nonrecurring after the 2016-17 year, advocates said they were not expecting it to expire. "No one was really aware that those funds were going away," said Linda McKinnon, Central Florida Behavioral Health Network president and CEO. McKinnon said the grant funds in questions were used for the "full gamut" of mental health treatments and substance abuse services. One area that took a hit when the grant expired, she said, was the availability of children’s crisis units across Central Florida’s network of providers. When word began to spread, several lawmakers called on Scott to do something about the issue. Former state Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, wrote a letter to Scott in August urging him to use his executive authority to fill the budget hole and extend Florida’s state of emergency over the opioid crisis. During a state of emergency, the governor can spend money appropriated for other purposes or spend unappropriated surplus funds, according to Florida statute. This way, Latvala argued, Scott could have used state reserves for the $20 million gap without the Legislature’s approval. Scott did not do this. Rep. Kathleen Peters, R-Pasadena, immediately called Scott about the funding shortfalls. But Scott pointed to a different $27 million grant that was included in the 2018-19 budget, according to a Tampa Bay Times column by John Romano. However, that grant was targetted to be spent on drugs such as methadone and Vivitrol, which are used to help wean addicts off opioids. The 2018-19 budget says it "continues the state’s investment of more than $1 billion in funding" for mental health and adds another $21.7 million to address other behavioral health needs. "Gov. Scott’s executive order allowed the state to immediately draw down $27 million in federal funds, and he has proposed significant investments for mental health and the fight against opioids in his 2018-2019 recommended budget," said Scott’s spokeswoman Kerri Wyland. Regardless of other grants and the new budget, Candice Crawford, the CEO of the Mental Health Association of Central Florida, described Scott’s proposed amount of funding for mental health as short of where it needs to be. "The governor has never really recommended a substantial amount of funding for mental health," Crawford said. What’s the relevance of this money to the Parkland shooting? We wondered how the grant money might be related to the situation of Nikolas Cruz, who authorities say admitted to shooting the students at the school he once attended. Not long before the shooting, DCF investigated Cruz after he posted "violent" social media posts, according to records obtained by the New York Times. The report mentioned that Cruz had been visited by a counselor from Henderson Behavioral Health, which provides mental health services in South Florida. Mental health advocates said it is fair to assume that a portion of the grant money would have gone to services that might have helped Cruz. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said that Scott "ended $20 million in funding for mental health care despite Florida already ranking at the bottom." There’s little doubt that Florida ranks near the bottom when it comes to mental health funding, but the first half of the Florida Democratic Party’s claim needs context. A nonrecurring funding stream for substance abuse and mental health block grants did end under Scott’s watch. Scott could have used his executive authority to fill the gap, but chose not to do so. In other words, Scott did not end the grant, he just didn’t do anything to fill the gap in funding despite having the opportunity to do so. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04349	Says, "Carl proposed a 'windfall' tax on real estate development when he was a Metro Councilor."	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/24/promote-oregon-leadership-pac-oregon-house-republi/did-carl-hosticka-propose-windfall-tax-property/	Oregon House Republicans have sent a mailer in District 37, claiming that Democrat Carl Hosticka has been trying to raise voters’ taxes for two dozen years. Hosticka is a Metro councilor from Tualatin running against freshman Rep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn. The mailer lists two ways Hosticka supposedly tried to squeeze more money out of the public, including this: "Carl proposed a ‘windfall’ tax on real estate development when he was a Metro Councilor." Hosticka requested a fact check, saying he didn’t propose the tax. We obliged, as we did when Parrish asked for one on a statement that sounded interesting. First, we need to remind readers of Measure 37, a contentious land-use and property rights ballot proposal that voters approved in 2004. Property owners had complained for years that under Oregon’s strict land-use regulations, they could do little with their land — like sell to developers — and were losing money. The passage of Measure 37 required government to compensate owners for the loss of land value, or waive the regulations. In November 2005, the Metro Council created six policy committees and divided them among the councilors. One committee, created in response to a proposal by an earlier Measure 37 task force, dealt with the possibility of levying a tax on land that appreciates in value when brought into the urban growth boundary — the "windfall" — to pay for farmland protection and infrastructure. Robert Liberty, also a Metro councilor, took the lead. Hosticka was named as a council liaison, a deputy if you will. The "Fair Growth and Farmlands Project Committee" was made up of Realtors, business people and government officials. In April 2006, the committee reported its recommendations for proceeding — if the Metro Council should choose to pursue a windfall tax. Voters should get a chance to weigh in, the report said, and the first 100 percent of profit should be exempt from tax. The Council voted unanimously to budget money to study the issue, but the tax went nowhere. As evidence for the mailer, House Republicans provide a 2006 legal article written by Liberty and an April 2006 news article from The Oregonian. In the legal article, Liberty describes how the windfall tax committee came to be, and named himself and Hosticka as project leaders. The news article describes Liberty and Hosticka as initiating the project. Hosticka "was supportive of the concept," says Nick Smith, spokesman for House Republicans’ political action committee. "In our research, it’s pretty clear that he, along with Liberty, were behind a windfall profits tax on real estate values, and just because the council didn’t move forward and actually implement it doesn’t mean that his fingerprints were not on it." Clearly, Liberty was in favor of the idea. Hosticka, however, tells PolitiFact Oregon he was more non-committal. "I remember that Robert Liberty was talking a lot about it, and that conceptually it could make sense," Hosticka says. "But that in terms of practicality, there was no real way of designing anything that would make sense, and politically there was no chance, so there was no reason to go forward." We caught up with Liberty, who proudly claimed ownership of the windfall tax. "That was my project and my proposal that we look at a windfall tax. That was something I led; that was not Carl’s," said Liberty. "I still think it’s a good idea, and I still think it’s a logical way to pay for infrastructure." We also talked with Tom Linhares, executive director of the Multnomah County Tax Supervising & Conservation Commission. He served on the tax mechanism subcommittee and admits being fuzzy on the details, but his recollection is committee members knew the tax would not get far. "It was really Robert’s show," Linhares said. "It was something he was passionate about. That was my sense, as I remember it. ‘Well, let’s put this together, but don’t hold your breath because council’s not going to adopt it.’" In the plain meaning of words, PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t think Hosticka proposed a windfall tax on real estate development. To us, proposing an idea indicates a major degree of ownership by a public official or staff. In this case, the idea of a tax came from a task force that went to a Metro committee formally led by Liberty, who championed it. If anything, it’s fair to say Liberty proposed it. That’s not to say Hosticka shouldn’t be held responsible for his actions while on the committee. He supported the idea of exploring a taxing option, and he probably would have backed a proposed tax had it gone anywhere. Hosticka was tapped to help lead a large civic committee that eventually recommended ideas for a windfall tax. That’s the element of truth. But to state that this was Hosticka’s idea, one that he or his staff proposed and pursued, ignores the critical facts of Liberty’s advocacy as well as all the other members on the committee who agreed to make the recommendation to Metro. We rate this Mostly False.	None	Promote Oregon Leadership PAC (Oregon House Republicans)	None	None	None	2012-10-24T00:00:00	2012-10-13	['None']
pomt-04348	Says Jim Renacci "opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops."	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/24/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-jim-renacci-voted-against-combat-bonuses/	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives, has released a series of localized TV ads attacking incumbent congressional Republicans as self-serving pols who opposed pay for U.S. troops. One of the targeted incumbents is Jim Renacci, who faces another incumbent, Democrat Betty Sutton, in the newly drawn 16th Congressional District. The ad aimed at him, narrated by a Northeast Ohio veteran of Operation Desert Storm, mingles black-and-white footage of combat troops with shots of Renacci. "Renacci tried to skip out on paying over a million in taxes," the narrator says, "but opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops. "And when Congressman Renacci wants to place tax cuts for himself and his rich friends, and take away veterans services for those serving in country and out of country, I think it's an atrocity." PolitiFact Ohio rated as True a claim from the Sutton camp about Renacci trying to avoid taxes. For this fact check, we’ll look at the claim that Renacci "opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops." The DCCC cites a vote in a footnote at the bottom of the screen in support of the claim, but that footnote doesn’t tell the whole story. Not even close. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin noted, that vote -- and others cited by the DCCC in other ads -- come from spring 2011, when an extended partisan tussle over spending cuts brought the federal government close to a shutdown. One of the sticky issues was how to deal with congressional pay and military pay if a shutdown occurred. There was plenty of maneuvering for partisan advantage and both parties claimed they were on the side of the troops. On May 26, 2011 -- after the funding crisis was averted with passage of a bill with military appropriations through the remainder of fiscal 2011 -- the House debated a defense authorization bill for the following year, 2012. Democrats called for a vote on a motion to boost pay for combat troops. U.S. Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, called it transparently political: "We had all kinds of time to bring an amendment that would be helpful like this, then they bring this one. There's no offset. This would just put us again above the allocation from the chairman. This is really more Democrat increasing spending." The motion failed, with Renacci in opposition. What the DCCC ad doesn’t say is that the full bill -- supported by Renacci, nearly all Republicans and 95 Democrats, including Betty Sutton -- already included a pay hike of 1.6 percent in the monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services. That covered combat troops as well. So, Renacci didn’t vote for the additional bump proposed at the very end of the process, but he voted -- the same day -- for the increased pay level in the underlying bill. Think of it this way: There is a bill to increase spending by $500,000 for a particular program. An amendment is offered to increase it to $750,000. If a person votes against the amendment but for the bill, are they "voting against an increase in spending" for the program? We also note that the Democratic amendment in question, like the others cited by the DCCC, was a "motion to recommit," a prerogative of the minority party since the first Congress. They are motions, partly procedural, that attempt to send a bill back to committee just before passage. "Both parties, when in the minority, have used these to make political statements and embarrass the majority for partisan advantage," said Donald Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules who was a key Republican staffer for the House Rules Committee in the 1990s. "It is well understood in modern times that these are designed for partisan campaign purposes and usually have little to do with better policy." Both parties, when in the minority, contend the motions can have merit and are not purely procedural. What is the merit of the Democratic TV ad charging that Renacci "opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops"? The claim is based on Renacci’s vote on a "motion to recommit" that preceded a final vote on military pay. Such motions are routinely denied by the majority party as procedural moves. That gives the minority party the chance to structure them for partisan advantage. That’s what is playing out in the ad now. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.

pomt-07087	"Vern Buchanan. His old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election."	/florida/statements/2011/jun/24/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/ad-claims-rep-vern-buchanans-old-business-illegall/	When it comes to illegal campaign cash, the wheels of justice move slowly. So when a May 2011 court filing brought fresh attention to old claims involving illegal campaign contributions to U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, Democrats jumped, airing a radio ad in his Florida district. "Congressman Vern Buchanan. His old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election," the narrator of the ad says. "Tell Buchanan to come clean." The ad ran from June 13-17 and was paid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. It relied on news articles about a lawsuit filed by the Federal Election Commission against a business Buchanan once owned, the DCCC said. The 'old business' Buchanan, 60, is a wealthy Republican from Longboat Key serving his third term in Congress representing Florida's 13th Congressional District. He built his wealth founding a chain of print shop franchises in Michigan, leaving for Florida in the 1980s as the chain struggled and investing in a range of new businesses, including Florida auto dealerships. One of those dealerships is at the heart of this claim. Buchanan had owned a majority interest in Hyundai of North Jacksonville, the FEC says, when his business partner Sam Kazran arranged for dealership employees and relatives to donate to the Vern Buchanan for Congress committee, then be reimbursed by the business. This went on during the 2006 and 2008 campaigns, the FEC says. (We should note that the date Buchanan legally parted ways with the dealership is a matter of disagreement. The FEC says Buchanan owned 51 percent of the dealership until Kazran completed his purchase of Buchanan's stake to become the sole owner in 2008 — after the suspect contributions were made. Buchanan spokeswoman Sally Tibbetts says Buchanan sold the dealership to Kazran in 2005, putting more distance between the congressman and the illegal contributions.) What's the big deal with reimbursing contributions? It violates federal election law, which says "(n)o person shall make a contribution in the name of another person." The Federal Election Campaign Act also limits how much a single contributor may give to candidates' campaign committees. Funneling cash through employees would have made it possible for the dealership to bust through that limit. The Buchanan campaign said they brought the questionable contributions to the attention of the FEC, which then launched the investigation. We can't independently confirm if that's the case, because the FEC does not comment on open cases. However, we found no evidence to the contrary. The commission combined the complaint with one filed in 2008 by a Washington group and two employees of a Venice dealership, which you can read more about here. The FEC investigated, finding probable cause to believe that the Hyundai dealership and Kazran had illegally reimbursed $67,900 in campaign contributions, but it didn't go after Buchanan. Instead, it's now seeking $67,900 in fines from Kazran. Kazran, for his part, admits reimbursing campaign contributions, but told the Bradenton Herald he did it at Buchanan's direction. "I've been caught in this political nightmare that I have nothing to do with," he told PolitiFact Florida. But he failed to reach an agreement with the Federal Election Commission — and failed to respond to the complaint on behalf of Hyundai North Jacksonville, which is no longer in business. That means facts in the case stand uncontested. So the commission voted to sue him to collect the fines, asking a judge for a default judgement. The FEC told the U.S. District Court that the dealership "illegally spent $67,900 in an attempt to influence an election for Congress, presumably believing this to be a worthwhile investment." And that's the May suit that prompted stories in a WSJ.com blog, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune and the Bradenton Herald that the DCCC cited as it released the script for its Florida radio ad. Jesse Ferguson, speaking on behalf of the committee, the official campaign arm of the Democrats in the U.S. House, used partial quotes from the lawsuit when he said, "The FEC is seeking fines from a business that Vern Buchanan owned at the time for an 'extensive and ongoing scheme' of 'secret illegal contributions' to help his campaign and we’re going to make sure his constituents know about it." Buchanan's response What does Buchanan's team say? That the FEC has cleared Buchanan himself — so the ad linking the behavior of Kazran and his dealership to the congressman is "misleading and dishonest." "It creates the false impression that Vern Buchanan has done something wrong when in fact he has been fully exonerated by the FEC," said Sally Tibbetts, his spokeswoman. A related news release that says Buchanan "has been completely exonerated" is the subject of its own fact-check, and we found the claim to be Barely True. But we'll summarize here by saying that what little information is available so far from the FEC doesn't fully clear Buchanan — though it does mean the commission won't take any further action against him in the case. Information's limited because the case isn't yet closed, so confidentiality rules apply. That means for the purposes of this fact-check, we'll rely on what's in the public record — information that the DCCC had access to when it scripted its ad. The ruling That ad starts by naming the congressman, then says his "old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election." The FEC and Buchanan's team agree that he owned a significant stake until at least 2005, when suspect campaign contributions started. The FEC says the dealership reimbursed more than $60,000 in contributions. The money went to Buchanan's main campaign committee, and the FEC says the money was spent "in an attempt to influence an election for Congress." What is contested is Buchanan's role in the scheme. The FEC has said it will take no further action against him, closing his file. But it didn't go further to declare it had no probable cause to believe he was involved — which would have better supported his team's claim that he's been cleared. Meanwhile, his former business partner still says Buchanan put him up to it, and says he plans another lawsuit to prove it. While we think the DCCC could have done a better job noting it was Buchanan who turned in the illegal contributions, we rate this ad Mostly True.

pomt-03285	Says Greg Abbott "converted over $1 million in federal grant money intended for use to prosecute online sexual predators and other cyber crimes and instead used it to harass and prosecute senior citizens who were assisting other senior citizens in applying for mail-in ballots."	/texas/statements/2013/aug/02/lone-star-project/democratic-group-says-abbott-misspent-1-million-pl/	A pro-Democratic group says Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican aspirant for governor in 2014, misspent $1 million-plus bothering elderly Texans. The Lone Star Project said in a July 14, 2013, blog post, "Just a few years ago, Abbott converted over $1 million in federal grant money intended for use to prosecute online sexual predators and other cyber crimes and instead used it to harass and prosecute senior citizens who were assisting other senior citizens in applying for mail-in ballots." That's a familiar claim; the project said in a May 18, 2006, press release that Abbott and Gov. Rick Perry had decided to divert "part of $1.4 million in federal funds." Abbott aides countered that the grant-aided voter investigations were legitimate expenditures, in response to referrals. What's what? Grant spending aired before In 2006, Abbott touted his office’s efforts to prosecute and deter voter fraud and Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland recently told us by email that the initial grant aid helped the office carry out an array of initiatives from June 2005 through September 2006. Strickland sent a spreadsheet indicating too that the grant was renewed through September 2008. Ultimately, about $3.2 million was spent on multiple initiatives, the spreadsheet indicates, while Strickland told us $93,579 in grant funds ended up being spent investigating possible violations of election law. The amount of grant money spent on election-law cases has previously been publicized. A Nov. 13, 2009, Austin American-Statesman news story quoted the attorney general’s office as saying that about $93,000 in grant funds went toward voter investigations, with the rest of some $690,000 in costs covered by state funds, though total spending was expected to grow because cases were pending. At the time, 22 voter cases had ended with guilty pleas or verdicts, Abbott’s office said, and one had been dropped. By email, Angle pointed out that Abbott earlier ballyhooed much more spending against voter fraud. A Jan. 25, 2006, Abbott press release said the agency’s new Special Investigations Unit, poised to help local authorities identify, investigate and prosecute voter fraud offenses, was established with a $1.5 million grant from Perry’s office. Similarly, a March 1, 2006, Abbott release said officials in the agency’s unit, "working through a $1.5 million grant from the governor’s office," had been visiting key counties to conduct voter fraud training for law officers. An Abbott commentary at the time had nearly identical language. Then again, the governor’s earlier grant announcement listed other priorities--not even specifying voter fraud. Perry’s Aug. 23, 2005, press release said $1,476,848 awarded under the federal Byrne Grant program would be spent on assisting local law enforcement agencies in investigations of cyber crimes, child pornography, organized crime, fugitives, criminal consumer fraud, public corruption and other criminal activities. Byrne grants noted for flexibility Amounts aside, did Abbott have permission to spend grant funds on voter investigations? By email, Angle conceded Byrne dollars could be spent investigating voter fraud, though he said the Lone Star Project is unaware of such aid being used that way in any other state. At the federal level, the National Center for Justice Planning, which teams the Bureau of Justice Assistance, U.S. Department of Justice and the National Criminal Justice Association, refers to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grant, which originated in 1968, as the nation’s "cornerstone federal justice assistance program." Byrne’s strength, the center says, lies in its flexibility with states and local communities permitted to spend the funds on areas including law enforcement, crime prevention and education. Separately, Strickland emailed us the attorney general’s June 1, 2005, grant application, which said the sought funds would enable additional staff to focus on Internet criminal investigations, fugitive apprehensions, criminal consumer fraud investigations and "fraudulent voter and public corruption investigations." The application also said: "There seems to be a generally accepted method in which groups of campaign workers have gone door-to-door for years to help elderly or disabled voters obtain a mail-in-ballot, then the workers collect the voted ballots from the voters with intent to mail them outside of the presence of the voter. These investigations take several weeks or months to complete, as there are numerous documents to collect and analyze, and multiple witnesses." Prosecutions as persecutions? Finally, did the state harass and prosecute senior citizens? Senior Texans were pursued in connection with a 2003 state law requiring individuals conducting absentee ballot campaigns to disclose certain information, including their names, if they handle a ballot or ballot application. According to an April 18, 2008, story in the liberal Texas Observer magazine, Willie Ray of Texarkana, 69, was indicted after she and her granddaughter, Jamillah Johnson, helped homebound senior citizens get absentee ballots and, once they were filled out, put them in the mail. In a Feb. 17, 2006, press release, Abbott said that Ray, a member of the Texarkana City Council, and Johnson were charged with illegally possessing and transporting ballots of several voters before the November 2004 elections. "The integrity of our election process must be protected," Abbott said. The release also mentioned largely similar voter indictments in Reeves, Hardeman, Bee and Nueces Counties. A Jan. 31, 2008, Abbott press release described indictments of several Duval County residents, aged 55 to 71, for helping voters misrepresent themselves as disabled. The release said the helpers also did not identify themselves on the outside of ballot envelopes. The Observer and Dallas Morning News each referred to an incident described in a lawsuit joined by the Texas Democratic Party against the state. The Observer story said Fort Worth's Gloria Meeks, 69, was a community activist who helped homebound seniors vote by mail. Its story said, "Meeks is in a nursing home after having a stroke, prompted in part, her friends say, by state police who investigated her--including spying on Meeks while she bathed--and then questioned her about helping" others vote. According to the lawsuit, later settled, Meeks said she had seen two investigators "peeping at her through her bathroom window" while she was taking a bath on Aug. 10, 2006 and "later learned that these two persons were investigators" with the attorney general’s office. By email, Strickland said the agency denied that the investigators intentionally peeped. The agency’s legal response said the investigators were standing on Meeks’ porch when their attention "was drawn to a nearby window because of movement from inside the window, and the investigators looked toward the window." In a May 18, 2008, Morning News story, the newspaper said it had tallied 26 cases, largely involving mail-in ballots, that had been prosecuted by Abbott, all of them against Democrats and almost all involving blacks or Hispanics, with no revelations of "large-scale" voter fraud schemes with the potential to swing elections. In 18 cases, the newspaper said, the "voters were eligible, votes were properly cast and no vote was changed -- but the people who collected the ballots for mailing were prosecuted. Eight cases, the story said, involved ineligible voters or manufactured votes: "They include a woman who voted for her dead mother, another in which a Starr County man voted twice, and three South Texas women who used false addresses to get voter registration cards for people who did not exist." By email, Strickland sent a roster showing agenc involvement from late 2005 through June 2013 in prosecuting individuals on election-law charges including alleged violations tied to carrying ballots for others. About 25 cases resolved from November 2005 through November 2008, the chart indicates, with 13 guilty pleas, three guilty jury verdicts, two "nolo contendere" pleas, five pre-trial diversions, one deferred adjudication and one dismissal. Most of the convictions related to possessing someone else’s ballot or carrier envelope. Strickland emailed another chart indicating that 23 election-law cases developed by state investigations were resolved and seven are pending. Angle said by email that the point of the claim holds. "The entire process was intended to harass and intimidate minority senior voters," he said. Our ruling The Lone Star Project said Abbott "converted over $1 million in federal grant money intended for use to prosecute online sexual predators and other cyber crimes and instead used it to harass and prosecute senior citizens who were assisting other senior citizens in applying for mail-in ballots." Actually, less than $100,000 of a grant—less than one-fifteenth of it--was spent investigating alleged violations of election law. The grant aid also wasn't restricted, or necessarily intended for, other purposes. So there was no conversion. Senior citizens were pursued, but our sense is it’s an eye-of-the-beholder question whether the investigations were harassment. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-05774	"(President Barack Obama) said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/27/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-obama-said-unemployment-woul/	When Gov. Chris Christie began his interview Sunday on CBS News’ "Face the Nation," host Bob Schieffer said he enjoys having him on the show, because the Republican governor has an unusual habit of answering questions. But with one of those answers, Christie rehashed an old -- and mostly inaccurate -- GOP talking point about President Barack Obama guaranteeing that the stimulus program would keep unemployment below 8 percent. With the next round of Republican primaries set for Tuesday in Arizona and Michigan, Christie continued on Sunday making his pitch that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney would ultimately prevail and take on Obama in the Nov. 6 general election. Obama will be a very formidable candidate, but the president still has weaknesses, according to Christie. "He said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan," Christie told Schieffer. "We went up over 10 percent." PolitiFact National and its state affiliates have debunked similar claims several times before, starting with U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) in July 2009. More recently, Romney faced the Truth-O-Meter for repeating that statement earlier this month after winning the Nevada caucuses. Each time, the claim has received a Mostly False. Here’s what the fact-checks have revealed: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus, was signed into law on Feb. 17, 2009. The stimulus was meant to dole out billions of dollars as a way to boost the economy. The nation’s unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent in February 2009 and gradually increased before peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate has since decreased to 8.3 percent as of last month. But PolitiFact has never found evidence of an administration official making a public pledge to hold unemployment below 8 percent. The source of the Republican claims is a Jan. 9, 2009 report from Christina Romer, who would soon become chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who would serve as chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden. The purpose of the study was to estimate the potential effects of a stimulus program on job creation. Romer and Bernstein estimated that the recovery package would create between 3 million and 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. On one chart, they estimated the unemployment rates both with and without the stimulus plan. Without the stimulus, the unemployment rate was projected to top 9 percent in early 2010, the report states. With the stimulus, the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009, according to the report. But throughout the report, the authors cautioned that their estimates are subject to significant "uncertainty." Check out this passage from the report: "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error. There is the obvious uncertainty that comes from modeling a hypothetical package rather than the final legislation passed by the Congress. But, there is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. "Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." So, the claim about unemployment not exceeding 8 percent was a projection subject to "uncertainty," and far from the guarantee suggested by Christie and other Republicans. The governor's office did not respond to an email seeking comment. Our ruling During his "Face the Nation" interview, Christie repeated the GOP talking point that Obama "said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan." As PolitiFact has determined numerous times before, neither Obama personally nor his administration never made such a promise. Two economic advisers offered that projection, but stressed repeatedly that their estimates were subject to considerable "uncertainty." Although Christie's statement represents a gross exaggeration, it contains an element of truth. That's why this claim is rated Mostly False.

pomt-14734	Says the Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015 would not "pause" the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States.	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/dec/18/ann-mclane-kuster/kuster-says-republican-backed-bill-she-voted-would/	U.S. Rep Annie Kuster raised eyebrows earlier this month when she claimed on NHPR’s Morning Edition that a bill putting extra restrictions on Syrian refugees wouldn't actually slow down the program. "The bill would not prohibit Syrian refugees from entering the nation. I think there's been a lot of misinformation frankly about the bill," she said. "It doesn't pause the program. It doesn't apply a religious test. It's a certification that the person does not pose a threat to the security of the United States." The bit that caught our attention was Kuster’s statement that the the bill "doesn’t pause the program." Could that be true? Or did the Democrat go overboard in defending her support of a GOP-backed proposal? We decided to check it out. The bill in question is called the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015. It passed the U.S. House with nearly unanimous Republican support and with the backing of 47 Democrats, including Kuster. According to behind-the-scenes reporting from the Huffington Post, the White House lobbied Democrats to oppose the measure, but ultimately couldn't persuade them all to oppose the bill. So, what's in the SAFE Act? What does it do, and would it actually slow down Syrian refugees coming into the country? It's useful in this case to go to the bill itself. And luckily for us, the SAFE Act is a relatively simple read. Unfortunately, its implications are murkier. Here are the two most pertinent sections of the bill. They’re worth quoting in full, as we’ll see soon enough. "In addition to the screening conducted by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall take all actions necessary to ensure that each covered alien receives a thorough background investigation prior to admission as a refugee. A covered alien may not be admitted as a refugee until the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence that each covered alien has received a background investigation that is sufficient to determine whether the covered alien is a threat to the security of the United States. ... "A covered alien may only be admitted to the United States after the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence, certifies to the appropriate Congressional Committees that the covered alien is not a threat to the security of the United States." The rest of the bill adds reporting requirements and defines the refugees in question as those coming from Iraq or Syria. It does not institute any penalties or consequences for failure to comply with its requirements. A simple distillation of that text comes from the govtrack.us website, which describes it thusly: "H.R. 4038 would expand the screening process for those refugees attempting to enter the United States by requiring the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct its own background checks in addition to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS). Any refugee would be prohibited from entry until the FBI certifies that they pose no security threat. Refugees would only be admitted with the unanimous agreement of the FBI, DHS, and Director of National Intelligence." In other words, it adds layers of certification beyond what’s already on the books requiring that refugees are safe before entering the United states. But as Kuster said, the bill does not bar Syrian refugees from the United States, nor does it impose a religious test. What would the legislation mean in practice? The White House certainly had its interpretation, which was the extra requirements would cause big delays. According to an official statement from the executive branch, the bill would "create significant delays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and national security objectives." U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey made the same arguments during a news conference after the bill passed. "To ask that we have my FBI director make personal guarantees would effectively grind the program to a halt," Lynch told reporters last month. And that seemed to be the goal of House Republicans who supported it, at least in part. According to National Public Radio’s reporting, "Supporters of the bill say it would require a ‘pause’ in admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees, as current applications would be halted while a new vetting process was established." But the House Democrats who broke ranks with their party to support the bill disagreed with both the president and Republicans. According to the Huffington Post report mentioned earlier, a Democrat told lawmakers that the bill "doesn't hurt the refugee process, so put a certification stamp at the bottom and move on." A top House Democrat cited in the article also said that the defectors had "a sense that the underlying reforms weren't severe." In other words, Kuster and 46 other House Democrats decided that if all that was needed was extra certifications, surely they could be put into place without many problems. And while the bill seems to suggest that the FBI would need to conduct an extra background check -- and the bill summary says as much -- the actual text is less clear about what that would entail. It instead reads that "the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall take all actions necessary to ensure that each covered alien receives a thorough background investigation." That’s not specifically calling for another check. We contacted Kuster’s office, which said the congresswoman’s intention was to protect the American people. Our ruling U.S. Rep Annie Kuster said the Republican-backed bill she voted for wouldn't pause the resettlement of Syrian refugees. While a number of House Democrats agree with her, the White House and Republicans believe the contrary, saying the bill would either slow down or stop the flow of refugees. Although there’s nothing in the bill that says it will specifically cause a pause, a reasonable reading of the legislation could lead to such an interpretation. Kuster’s claim ignores critical evidence that could lead to an opposite conclusion. We rate her statement Half True.

pomt-13965	The rifle used by Omar Mateen "shoots off 700 rounds in a minute."	/florida/statements/2016/jun/14/alan-grayson/orlando-democrat-alan-grayson-700-rounds-minute/	Rep. Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, made a case against assault rifles after the shooting in Orlando, arguing that the gun’s rate of fire is what made the death toll so catastrophic. If the shooter, Omar Mateen, "was not able to buy a weapon that shoots off 700 rounds in a minute, a lot of those people would still be alive," Grayson said June 12, in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. "If somebody like him had nothing worse to deal with than a glock pistol which was his other weapon today, he might have killed three or four people and not 50," Grayson said. Law enforcement officials have not released specific details regarding the nature of the rifle Mateen used in the shooting as of this fact-check. Law enforcement officials have described it as an "AR type rifle." The gun shop owner who sold Mateen the weapon told the New York Post it was a Sig Sauer MCX rifle. Grayson told PolitiFact he was referring to the AR-15 weapon more generally, which was modeled off the military style M16. All these details matter, and what makes Grayson's claim problematic. Experts told us the weapon Mateen used could not fire 700 rounds in a minute without serious alterations that require the resources of a gun manufacturer. Even if Mateen had those resources, and there is no indication from sounds recorded from the shooting or from investigators that he did, experts are not even sure if Grayson’s 700-rounds-per-minute claim is possible. Experts said that firing 700 rounds per minute is unrealistic due to the time it would take for a shooter to reload magazines and because the gun would overheat. What Grayson said later Both the AR-15 and Sig Sauer MCX rifle are sold for civilian use as a semiautomatic rifle, meaning a shooter has to pull the trigger to fire each round. This is different from an automatic weapon where the shooter can hold down the trigger and shoot multiple rounds. The AR-15 weapon was used in the 2015 San Bernadino and 2012 Sandy Hook shootings, and has since been the subject of controversy, including a lawsuit against an AR-15 manufacturer. Mateen used an "AR type rifle," according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Some people, like Grayson, took that to mean an AR-15. The Sig Sauer MCX, however, looks like an AR-15 and is considered an AR type rifle. Grayson clarified his specific claim in other interviews to say that rifle Mateen used was only capable of 700 rounds per minute when modified to become an automatic weapon, such as the M16 military version of the civilian AR-15. Grayson told PolitiFact that there are various ways of converting weapons from semi-automatic to automatic, some legal (purchasing a shoulder mount) and others illegal ("machining" the weapon). Gary Kleck, Florida State University criminologist, said that it would be possible to "convert" a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic rifle, but only "if you had the resources of a modern rifle manufacturer" and sufficient tools. Kleck’s research on guns recovered by police suggests that rarely happens. If shooters do use an automatic weapon, they probably stole it from a military armory rather than repurposing a civilian version, Kleck said. Theory vs. reality Grayson’s claim distorts what we know about the Orlando shooting and the number of rounds a standard semiautomatic rifle can fire. The 700-round-a-minute figure is only a theoretical benchmark, not something achievable in reality. Army documents list the M16 as having a "cyclic rate of fire" of 700-900 rounds per minute. However, the "cyclic" rate of fire is a theoretical measurement of speed, not how many rounds could actually be shot out of the gun in 1 minute, said Michael O’Shea, a constitutional law professor at Oklahoma City University. "That only means how rapidly the firing mechanism operates while there is ammunition in the gun," O’Shea said. "It is not the same as being able to actually discharge 700 rounds of ammunition from the gun in 60 seconds." For starters, a shooter would have to reload his magazines to achieve that volume — at least 20 times with 30 round magazines or 6 times with 100 round magazines, which are less commonly used, O’Shea said. Grayson told PolitiFact that there are videos online of people shooting at 700-900 rounds per minute. However, we searched online for such videos and found that they actually confirmed O'Shea's point. The Army document designates the "maximum effective rate of fire" — "the highest rate of fire that can be maintained and still achieve target hits" — as 150-200 rounds per minute for an automatic M16. Kleck added that, from his research on mass shootings, most shooters rarely fire more than 50 rounds per minute. Even if you could overcome the need to reload — by installing a belt of ammunition — reaching 700 rounds in one minute remains infeasible, said Steven Howard, a lawyer and gun expert who has consulted with various law enforcement agencies. "In reality, you’ll get to 500 rounds and the gun will just melt," Howard said. Our ruling Grayson said that the rifle Mateen used "shoots off 700 rounds in a minute." On CNN, he includes this claim without any clarification. In other forums, he noted that his claim is only true for the hypothetical semiautomatic rifle converted to an automatic weapon. Even then, however, experts say the 700-round-per-minute figure is not an accurate portrayal of rounds fired. This is true for many reasons, they said, including reloading time and the potential of overheating the gun. The debate over how assault weapons ought to be regulated is ongoing and contentious, but the claim Grayson uses is nonetheless misleading. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3d2e9d05-7942-4a9b-b6c1-efbf9096fc5f	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2016-06-14T17:28:08	2016-06-12	['None']
pomt-14502	"People (are) paying more in taxes than they will for food, housing and clothing combined."	/florida/statements/2016/feb/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-americans-pay-more-taxes-food-clt/	A Web ad from Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has gotten a lot of attention for a case of geographic mistaken identity: The narrator says "It’s morning again in America" -- while showing a video clip from Vancouver, Canada. The Rubio campaign told BuzzFeed it was unintentional. But there’s also a serious public policy claim in that ad. "Today, more men and women are out of work than ever before in our nation’s history," the narrator says. "People paying more in taxes than they will for food, housing and clothing combined." Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. We’ve looked how many people are out of work in other fact-checks. In January 2016, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, its lowest level since February 2008. Here, we wanted to look at the claim that people are paying more in taxes than for food, housing and clothing. Taxes versus food, housing and clothing The Rubio campaign sent us an April 2015 blog post by the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank. A bar graph showed that America will pay a total of $4.8 trillion in taxes and about $4.4 trillion in food, clothing and housing combined. Kyle Pomerleau, who wrote the blog for the Tax Foundation in April 2015, said it was based on a projection of what Americans would spend for the year based on information from the Congressional Budget Office. So let’s look at the actual numbers using the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Since the BEA doesn’t have full tax data yet for 2015, we used tax and spending data for 2014. We used the same method the foundation did and found that total receipts for the federal, state and local government taxes were about $4.8 trillion. On the spending side in 2014, Americans laid out $886 billion for food and beverages purchased for use at home, $751 billion on food services and accommodations, $369 billion on clothing and footwear and $2.1 trillion on housing and utilities. If we add that up, we get about $4.1 trillion. So by this method, Americans are spending more in taxes -- about $4.8 trillion -- than on food, clothing and housing combined of about $4.1 trillion. But this is just one method to compare taxes and spending. The foundation’s method is an aggregate of what all Americans pay combined -- the amount that any individual or family spends on taxes compared with food, clothing and shelter can vary widely. That means that Rubio’s statement is likely true for some Americans but not others. "Looking at the chart, this is an aggregated figure, and what is true of the whole is not true of all the parts," said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute of Economic Competitiveness. "Clearly there are lower income individuals who do not pay all the taxes that higher income people do. For those folks, they are spending more on food, housing and clothing." Indeed, as a general rule, poor Americans pay relatively little in taxes compared to what they spend on food, clothing and housing. This matters for judging Rubio’s statement because, for many of them, his statement is inaccurate. It’s more often true for richer Americans. Another way to look at taxes and spending is by what individuals spend on average. Americans spend an average of 39 percent of their money on food, housing, apparel and services in 2011, according to the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Taxes -- federal, state and local combined -- claim roughly 30 percent of income, said Roberton Williams, a tax expert at the Tax Policy Center. So by this measure, "taxes claim a smaller share of income than do food, housing, and clothing," Williams said. Our ruling Rubio said that "people (are) paying more in taxes than they will for food, housing and clothing combined." Rubio’s statement only measures up if we look at aggregate spending on those basics by all Americans. But whether individuals spend more on taxes than food, housing and clothing varies widely depending upon their income.

pomt-01635	Police in the United States are allowed to use tear gas even though it "has been classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict since 1993."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/26/facebook-posts/tear-gas-was-banned-warfare-1993-police-1997/	Law enforcement officers in Ferguson, Mo., have used tear gas extensively in the wake of the police-shooting death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed African-American. The conflict in Ferguson led one PolitiFact reader to ask us to check the accuracy of a social-media meme now circulating that addresses the legality of tear gas. The meme -- posted by the group OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans -- said, "Tear gas has been classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict since 1993. Why is its use allowed by U.S. police forces?" The post had garnered 143,000 likes, 42,000 shares, and 35,000 comments by late August. We wanted to know if it was accurate. First, some background on tear gas. It is a broad term for chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pepper spray and CS gas are among the most commonly used. The CDC says that "prolonged exposure, especially in an enclosed area, may lead to long-term effects such as eye problems including scarring, glaucoma, and cataracts, and may possibly cause breathing problems such as asthma." However, the agency adds that "if symptoms go away soon after a person is removed from exposure to riot control agents, long-term health effects are unlikely to occur." Has tear gas been 'banned in international conflict since 1993'? This is close to being accurate. The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons. And tear gas qualifies under the convention as a chemical weapon. Specifically, Article I (5) of the convention says, "Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare," while Article II (7) defines "riot control agent" as: "Any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure." The meme is incorrect, however, when it comes to the year the convention came into force. It was finalized in 1993 but took effect on April 29, 1997 -- 180 days after the 65th country, Hungary, ratified the treaty, as the convention set forth. The United States is covered by this provision, the Senate having ratified the convention five days before it went into force. In addition, there may be a gray area for use by the military. When President Gerald Ford signed an earlier, decades-old agreement covering chemical weapons, the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925, the United States reserved the right to use tear gas in a limited number of contexts, such as for controlling a riot at a prisoner-of-war detention area -- just not against troops engaged in battle. Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, said he believes that this limited exception would also hold water under the Chemical Weapons Convention. How relevant is that to police? This part is more murky, because the same convention being touted by the meme’s authors specifically states that law enforcement use within a country is permitted. "Law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes" is "not prohibited under this convention," says Article II (9) (d). This bifurcation between a permitted domestic use and a banned international use is unusual in such accords, said Brian Finlay, managing director of the Stimson Center, a think tank that focuses on global security issues. As for how it happened, there’s a backstory. According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international group that helps enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention, riot control agents were "the topic of long and heated debates" during negotiations of the convention. In the end, a compromise was reached, the group says, allowing the use of tear gas for riot control but prohibiting it for warfare. Indiana University law professor David P. Fidler, who has studied the issue, said that while there’s been some controversy over what this article of the convention permits in some contexts, "law enforcement use of tear gas has not been one of them." When we contacted OurTime.org, co-founder Jarrett Moreno told us that "the focus of our post was raising an ethical and moral question: If we can't use tear gas on our enemies, why is it acceptable to use on our own citizens? After Ferguson where we saw children, disabled people, and members of the press being hit with tear gas while exercising their First Amendment rights, why are they being contained with something that we don't even use on the battlefield?" Experts acknowledged that the treatment of tear gas under the convention is somewhat paradoxical, and it stems in part from horse-trading by convention negotiators. But they added that there are other, more substantive reasons as well. • The use of any type of gas on a battlefield is problematic. "Part of the thinking is that soldiers in the field don't have the ability to readily distinguish in the heat of battle if a gas being used is tear gas or something more lethal," said Richard Price, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia who has studied the issues. The negotiators, he said, thought that, "as a practical matter, it was best to ban them all" on the battlefield. • There are few immediate alternatives to tear gas for riot control. There are strategies to prevent riots, including better community relations, a less militaristic appearance, and improved training, all of which have been raised in relation to Ferguson. But once rioting is under way, police need tools to control it -- and "even though tear gas is far from perfect," said David A. Koplow, a Georgetown University law professor, "it continues to be used in that role because there’s nothing else better." Israel has deployed an organic riot-control agent dubbed "skunk water," described by a BBC journalist as the "worst, most foul thing you have ever smelled. An overpowering mix of rotting meat, old socks that haven't been washed for weeks -- topped off with the pungent waft of an open sewer." However, it is sprayed from water cannons, which in the popular imagination are associated with their use against civil rights protesters in the 1960s, making them highly unsuitable for use in a scenario like the one in Ferguson. Projectiles such as rubber bullets can be effective, but they can cause serious injury or, if poorly aimed, death. An emerging technology called the Active Denial System -- or more colloquially, the "pain ray" -- creates millimeter-wave frequencies that impart a searing sensation of heat on the skin, but amid concerns, the United States military has been slow to adopt it. Meanwhile, new forms of "incapacitating chemical agents" that use anesthetic chemicals have been proposed, but they have drawn the concern of such groups as the International Committee of the Red Cross. The problem with new-generation chemical techniques, said Fidler of Indiana University, "is that their physiological effects are stronger than tear gas, which creates the potential for more injuries and other health harms. Tear gas is well understood as a riot control agent, and it seems to function well enough for law enforcement purposes. • A lack of desire for change. There is little sign that the convention’s signatories have any desire to reconcile the tear gas paradox. "There is certainly an argument to be made that the fundamental segregation of these two issues is inherently unreasonable," said Finlay of the Stimson Center. "That said, this is very unlikely to change, as it is both a matter of treaty law as well as customary international law today. There is not much appetite among states to alter the status quo." Our ruling The meme said police in the United States use tear gas even though it "has been classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict since 1993." The Chemical Weapons Convention did outlaw the use of tear gas in warfare, though that went into effect in 1997, not 1993. However, the meme glosses over some context. It tries to leverage the Chemical Weapons Convention’s decision to ban tear gas as evidence of why the technique should be illegal for policing, yet that very same convention explicitly allows its use for domestic law enforcement purposes. The claim is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-08-26T11:08:39	2014-08-25	['United_States']

pomt-07070	"Under Barack Obama the last two years, the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased 73 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-federal-limousines-73-perc/	In an interview on CBS' Face the Nation on June 26, 2011, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann managed to turn a question about farm subsidies into an attack on President Barack Obama's administration for a "reprehensible" increase in the number of federal limousines. "What about farm subsidies?" host Bob Schieffer asked Bachmann on the eve of her formal announcement of a 2012 presidential bid. "...Do you think we ought to think about cutting those back?" "I think everything needs to be on the table right now, every part of government," Bachmann said. "I'll tell you one thing that should be on the table, under Barack Obama the last two years, the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased 73 percent, in two years. I can’t think of anything more reprehensible than seeing bureaucrats on their cell phones in the backs...73 percent increase in the number of federal limousines in the last two years, for heaven's sake." She made a similar statement during an appearance in New Hampshire on June 28: "In the last two years under the Obama administration, the number of federal limousines have increased 73 percent under President Obama. So if it isn't bad enough that we have all these czars, now they have limousines at their service and they can sit in their back seats and talk on their cell phones. This is the level of waste we've got in Washington, DC." The claim is based on a May 31, 2011, story from iWatchNews.org, a project of the Center for Public Integrity, which ran under the headline, "Limousine liberals? Number of government-owned limos has soared under Obama." The story, written by Joe Eaton, begins: "Limousines, the very symbol of wealth and excess, are usually the domain of corporate executives and the rich. But the number of limos owned by Uncle Sam increased by 73 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration, according to an analysis of records by iWatch News." The statistic is based on annual fleet reports provided by the U.S. General Services Administration. According to the Fleet Report for Fiscal Year 2010 (Table 2-5 and 2-5T), the number of federal limousines by year went from 318 in 2006; to 217 in 2007; to 238 in 2008; to 349 in 2009; and to 412 in 2010. So the data suggests there was a 73 percent increase between 2008 and 2010. But information in the iWatch News article itself casts doubt about whether this is a firm statistic and whether the increase is rightly pegged entirely to the Obama administration. For starters, the GSA itself is not standing behind the numbers. Because of a loose definition of "limousines," GSA spokeswoman Sara Merriam told iWatch News that GSA "cannot say that its report accurately reflects the number of limousines." "The categories in the Fleet Report are overly broad, and the term 'limousine' is not defined," Merriam told us via e-mail. "Vehicles represented as limousines can range from protective duty vehicles to common sedans, and many of these vehicles serve in a law enforcement or protective capacity. This is a flaw in the report that GSA will fix to ensure that the Fleet Report can serve as a useful tool to help agencies right-size their fleets to achieve cost and energy savings as directed by the Presidential Memorandum." The iWatch News report noted that according to GSA, "law enforcement" limousines means the vehicles "are equipped with sirens or lights, high-performance drivetrains or are used for surveillance or undercover operations." Indeed, the data shows that the number of "law enforcement" limousines went from 193 in 2008 to 288 in 2010. In other words, limos used for law enforcement accounted for 95 of the new limousines (more than half the entire increase). Law enforcement vehicles with sirens and used for surveillance or undercover operations, didn't jibe with our concept of limousine. So we went to our Merriam-Webster dictionary, which defines limousine as "a large luxurious often chauffeur-driven sedan that usually has a glass partition separating the driver's seat from the passenger compartment." It's also unclear how many of the new "limousines" can be tied to the Obama administration. The bulk of the limousine fleet increase occurred between the fiscal years of 2008 and 2009 (when the number jumped 47 percent -- from 238 to 349). When Obama took office in late January 2009, it was already nearly four months into the 2009 fiscal year. The GSA report doesn't note how many were ordered in the first four months as opposed to the final eight. Moreover, the GSA's fleet acquisition data notes when vehicles were delivered, not when they were ordered. A bulk of the vehicles in the FY2009 report would have been ordered in 2008 under the prior Bush administration (and a Democrat-controlled Congress). The iWatch News story also notes that much of the increase in the fleet of limousines was in the State Department. "The State Department in a statement said its limos are deployed by overseas diplomats and in the United States by Secretary of State Clinton and 'distinguished foreign visitors,'" the story states. "Many of the limos in its fleet are armored to protect against attack. The department said its Obama-era increase in armored limos is 'both in proportion to the increased threat to diplomats serving overseas and is in proportion to the increase number of diplomats we have serving in high threat environments.' Appropriations documents indicate the State Department was engaged in a longer-term effort to increase the number of armored vehicles that would have stretched back to at least 2007." In other words, some of the State Department increase has been in the works for at least two years prior to Obama taking office. Accusing the Obama administration of significantly increasing the federal limousine fleet in the midst of a recession and spiraling deficits may make for a great red meat line on a Republican campaign stop. But Bachmann's claim that "under Barack Obama the last two years the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased 73 percent," is based on squishy figures from the GSA (according to the GSA itself). And it's also impossible to tell from the numbers exactly how many of the new "limousines" were ordered by the Obama administration, and how many were ordered by his predecessor. Given those qualifiers, we rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03261	"If we don't spend money on a pier, then that money does wipe into the general funds of the city or the county, and if you send it to the county, you never see it again."	/florida/statements/2013/aug/09/bill-foster/st-pete-pier-money-lost-county-foster-says/	St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster and challenger Kathleen Ford tangled over paying for the Lens, the proposed pier replacement, at a debate last week. Foster said the money was use-it-or-lose-it, while Ford said the plan takes money from the city’s general funds. "If we don't spend money on a pier, then that money does wipe into the general funds of the city or the county, and if you send it to the county, you never see it again," Foster said. After the forum, Foster confirmed the intent of his comments to PolitiFact Florida, telling us that money needs to be spent or part of it will be lost to the county. We decided to check it out. (We looked at Ford's comments in a separate fact-check.) First, some background: In 1969, the Florida Legislature passed the Community Redevelopment Act. The intent was to allow a city and a county to target a specific geographic area -- say, a downtown -- for improvements. The law allows local officials to create a Community Redevelopment Area, so that a portion of property taxes collected in the area can be used for major development projects there. In 1981, the city of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County set up such an area with the goal of paying for projects downtown. Each time the property taxes within the area rise above the 1981 level, that additional money goes into an improvement fund, usually called TIF, which stands for tax increment financing. We should note that a pier project of some kind has long been on the drawing board. The inverted pyramid made its debut in 1973 and underwent a major renovation in 1987. Since at least 2005, city officials have been looking at either another renovation or a total replacement, paid for with TIF money. Community Redevelopment Areas usually only last 30 years, and then the districts dissolve. But in 2005, the Board of County Commissioners granted the city a 30-year extension until 2035, said Ken Welch, a Pinellas County commissioner. Right now there’s about $50 million in TIF money available for a pier project, with about $37 million of that intended for construction. If the money isn’t spent by 2035, only then could the county reclaim its 44 percent share. The city would take the remaining money. We should note that city leaders have never supported abandoning the pier without a replacement. Refurbishment money would likely come from the TIF fund. Voters will approve or reject the Lens on Aug. 27. If the Lens fails and a different pier project goes forward, the same method of financing would apply, Welch said. So Foster said that if money isn’t spent on a pier, it will go back to the city and county. He’s technically right. But that doesn’t happen for another 22 years, in 2035. The odds of the city not spending the money -- on the Lens, a different construction project or a refurbishment of the inverted pyramid -- are slim. We rated Foster’s claim Half True.

pomt-06163	"I never lobbied under any circumstance" for Freddie Mac.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-said-he-never-lobbied-freddie-mac-un/	Is Newt Gingrich a conservative firebrand who can take the fight to Obama? Or just more Washington same-old, same-old? Put Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., down for the second option. She laid into him at a Republican debate for the presidential nomination for his work with Freddie Mac, a mortgage company giant connected to the federal government. "Well, it's the fact that we know that he cashed paychecks from Freddie Mac. That's the best evidence that you can have, over $1.6 million," Bachmann said on Dec. 15, 2011, in Iowa. She added, "We can't have as our nominee for the Republican Party someone who continues to stand for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They need to be shut down, not built up." When asked for his response, Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said, "Well, the easiest answer is, that's just not true. What she just said is factually not true. I never lobbied under any circumstance. I never went in and suggested in any way that we do this." The conversation got weird after that, with Bachmann claiming that "after the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true." That’s not true, and we gave her a Pants on Fire for saying it. Gingrich, meanwhile, said his policy now is to break up both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. He also claimed that he was too well off to sell influence: "I want to state unequivocally, for every person watching tonight, I have never once changed my positions because of any kind of payment, because the truth is, I was a national figure who was doing just fine, doing a whole variety of things, including writing best-selling books, making speeches." Here, we decided to examine Gingrich’s statement, "I never lobbied under any circumstance." Our research showed that Gingrich is technically correct: If you search public records databases for registered lobbyists, you won’t find Gingrich’s name. But his statement doesn’t tell the whole story. To be clear, Gingrich acknowledges that he worked for Freddie Mac, and his campaign released a statement affirming that Nov. 6, 2011. The statement, which you can read in full, said that Gingrich’s consulting group was retained by Freddie Mac in 2006. "To be clear, Speaker Gingrich did no lobbying of any kind, nor did his firm. This was expressly written into the Gingrich Group contracts. Instead, the Gingrich Group was hired to offer strategic advice to Freddie Mac on a number of issues," the statement said. The statement said Gingrich advised Freddie that it was dangerous to buy mortgage-backed securities based on questionable home loans. He also told Freddie on how to lower prescription drug costs for its employees. Finally, Freddie Mac "was interested in advice on how to reach out to more conservatives." Because he was not a registered lobbyist, neither Freddie Mac nor Gingrich is required to disclose how much Gingrich was paid nor the exact dates of his work. Bachmann said it was $1.6 million. This number likely came from news stories from Bloomberg News, which reported last month that Gingrich received between $1.6 million and $1.8 million in fees from two separate contracts. We've seen nothing questioning the accuracy of that report, but the number also came from unnamed sources, so we can’t confirm or refute the number Bachmann mentioned. Bloomberg also reported that Gingrich worked with Mitchell Delk, Freddie's chief lobbyist. Delk told Bloomberg that Gingrich provided "counsel on public policy issues," but did not do formal lobbying work. So Gingrich was paid for "strategic advice" without having to register as a lobbyist. How does that work? To be a registered lobbyist, one has to meet a number of detailed rules laid out in federal law. One of the main rules is that a person has to register if he or she holds two or more meetings with elected officials or staff in any quarter of the year n behalf of a client. Also, the lobbying activities must constitute 20 percent or more of the lobbyist’s time during any three-month period. (Want more detail? Read 27 pages of guidance on disclosing lobbying activities via the U.S. Senate website.) Experts we spoke with and the research we reviewed showed the "strategic advice" category is a way of using influence without having to register as a lobbyist. They said strategic advisers can do quite a bit for clients like Freddie Mac without acquiring the lobbyist label. They can stay at the client’s office and give their best advice on with whom to meet and what to say. They can give instructions to someone who is a registered lobbyist, again telling the lobbyist with whom to meet and what points to address. They can take their clients to meetings with groups that aren’t part of the government, such as grassroots political groups. They can even have one big meeting with an elected official to make a case for a client. "There’s a lot of activity that ordinary people would think of as lobbying that doesn’t trigger the obligation to register as a lobbyist under federal law. Strategic advice is one of those kinds of things that doesn’t," said Joseph Sandler, an attorney with the Washington law firm Sandler Reiff Young & Lamb. Sandler was one of four co-chairs of an American Bar Association task force that recommended changes to federal lobbying laws to improve disclosure and reduce conflicts of interest. One of its recommendations was that people who give strategic advice disclose their work under a new category of "lobbying support." We should also note that both parties play this game. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., was a "policy adviser" at the lobbying firms Alston & Bird and DLA Piper. He had to answer many questions about his work when President Barack Obama selected him to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. (Daschle ended up withdrawing over tax issues connected to another client giving him the use of a car and driver.) "Newt Gingrich is certainly not alone among well-heeled political players who say they just offer consulting services or strategic advice -- without needing to register as lobbyists. But it's a stretch to claim that they aren't part of the influence game," said Michael Beckel, a spokesman with the Center for Responsive Politics, via e-mail. The nonpartisan group monitors lobbying and campaign spending. "The distinction isn't as important as Gingrich is making it out to be," he added. Our ruling Gingrich is technically correct that he was not a registered lobbyist for Freddie Mac. But it appears he took pains to avoid being subject to the rules. Giving strategic advice is widely considered a way of using political influence without having to register.

pomt-11170	Says James Clapper said "that the FBI was spying on (Trump's) campaign."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/23/donald-trump/did-ex-intelligence-chief-clapper-say-fbi-spied-tr/	President Donald Trump has hinted that the Obama administration inserted a mole in his presidential campaign to undercut his candidacy. In an early morning tweet, he offered what seemed to be proof, from none other than former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. In a tweet, Trump appeared to quote Clapper as saying, "Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign." Trump followed that with, "No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Whatever people might think amounts to spying (and we wrote that there’s no agreed-upon definition), Clapper didn’t say what Trump claimed. Clapper said the opposite. Clapper was interviewed May 22 on ABC News’ The View. Here’s the exchange with co-host Joy Behar: Behar: "I ask you, was the FBI spying on Trump's campaign?" Clapper: "No, they were not. They were spying on — a term I don't particularly like — but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage and influence which is what they do." Behar: "Well, why doesn't he like that? He should be happy." Clapper: "He should be." The White House press office confirmed that Trump was referring to Clapper’s ABC interview. But that wasn’t the only time Clapper addressed the question of spying. Clapper repeated his point the same day in an interview on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360. "The objective here was actually to protect the campaign by determining whether the Russians were infiltrating it and attempting to exert influence," Clapper said. After Trump's tweet, Clapper said May 23 on CNN it was "a distortion of what I said." The FBI’s guidelines say direct investigation of a campaign should only come after a high-level review. "It is not invariably illegal to spy on a campaign or people in it," said Robert Litt, former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence. "The question is, why are you doing it? Are you doing it for legitimate investigative purposes – for example if you have information that people in the campaign are engaged in criminal activity – or is your purpose to glean information that you would provide to the candidate’s opponents for political use?" Our ruling Trump said that Clapper had affirmed that the FBI had spied on the Trump campaign. That does not reflect Clapper’s words. In two separate interviews Clapper said that the FBI was looking for Russian interference in the election with the aim of protecting the campaign. He specifically said that the FBI had not spied on the campaign. Trump turned Clapper’s statements upside down and for that, we rate this claim False.

pomt-00609	If Milwaukee approves reducing its maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession to $50, the city would have "23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture."	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/01/robert-puente/would-milwaukees-maximum-forfeiture-marijuana-be-l/	On June 2, 2015, the Milwaukee Common Council is scheduled to decide whether to reduce the maximum city portion of the fine for possession of a sandwich-size bag of marijuana. That portion of the total fine -- known formally as a forfeiture -- would be a maximum of $50, down from the current limit of $500. When the council debated the proposed ordinance change on May 12, 2015, it was opposed by Ald. Robert Puente, who served for 27 years on the Milwaukee police force. "We have 23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture than this," said Puente, before adding: "I just think this is really disproportionate." Is that right? If the council approves reducing the maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession, would it be lower than the forfeiture for 23 bicycle violations? Marijuana When you get a ticket, think of the amount shown on the ticket as the fine. The total fine is composed of various parts. Those parts include the forfeiture, the part cited by Puente, which is paid to the city’s general fund. Added to that are various city, county and state fees and surcharges. In Milwaukee, the Common Council sets not only the range of forfeiture amounts for a given violation, but also a standard forfeiture amount that should be imposed in most cases. Those standard forfeiture amounts are reviewed regularly and can be adjusted within the range. Let’s start with marijuana as an example. The city ordinance applies to possession of 25 grams or less of marijuana. Twenty-five grams is slightly less than 1 ounce (0.88), or roughly a sandwich bag full of marijuana. Currently, the minimum forfeiture for marijuana possession is $250 and the maximum is $500. The standard forfeiture amount is $265.87. In other words, the forfeiture amount of the fine you’re given for marijuana possession typically would be $265.87. But the judge in your case could reduce the forfeiture portion to $250 -- or, in rare circumstances, increase the forfeiture. Ald. Nik Kovac has led the effort to reduce the marijuana possession forfeitures. He has said African-Americans in Milwaukee are cited for marijuana possession much more often than other people. And he has argued that the disproportionate jailing of black men is due in part to those who are ticketed for marijuana possession and end up in jail because they can’t pay the forfeiture and fees. Kovac’s initial proposal, in September 2014, was to reduce the forfeiture range dramatically. The minimum would have been $1 and the maximum $5. But his proposed range was later amended to zero to $50 -- which is what the council is being asked to approve. The Milwaukee Municipal Court, in a May 26, 2015 memo signed by the three municipal judges, opposes lowering the $500 maximum. But it suggests reducing the minimum from $250 to zero. That way, the judges would have more flexibility, being able to impose forfeitures anywhere from zero to $500. The memo also made two other points: 1. Since 2012, municipal judges have issued only 12 orders for incarceration for marijuana possession and only eight of those individuals actually served time in jail. 2. Setting a maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession that is lower than that for many other violations "that are arguably less serious" would "send the wrong message to our community." Bicycles As for the 23 bicycle violations cited by Puente, they include abandonment of a bicycle, failure to comply with a traffic signal and brakes not in good working condition. Nine of the violations carry a maximum forfeiture of $500 -- much higher than the $50 maximum for marijuana, should the marijuana ordinance be changed. But as a practical matter, the standard forfeiture for all 23 bike violations is only $20. Our rating Puente said if Milwaukee approves reducing its maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession to $50, the city would have "23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture." In practice, the actual forfeiture that is imposed for the 23 bicycle violations is only $20. However, the maximum forfeiture for nine of those violations is $500. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Puente’s claim Half True.	None	Robert Puente	None	None	None	2015-06-01T16:10:45	2015-05-12	['None']

pomt-11110	Say President Donald Trump "dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article" about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/07/president-trumps-lawyers/was-initial-trump-statement-ny-times-accurate-lawy/	The New York Times made a splash when it published a document prepared by President Donald Trump’s legal team to special counsel Robert Mueller. The letter made several bold assertions, including that the president "could, if he wished, terminate (Mueller’s) inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired," and that ordering the end to an investigation "could not constitute obstruction of justice." We’ve looked at some of those possibilities before. But one part of the letter that caught our eye is an assertion about how the White House responded to media disclosures of a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and Russian nationals. This meeting, involving Trump's eldest son and first reported by the New York Times, has attracted intense interest from Mueller’s investigators, as well as from congressional committees. The lawyers’ memo acknowledged that President Trump had indeed dictated an initial statement to the New York Times. It went on to defend the president's message as "short but accurate." "You have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump Jr.," said the Jan. 29, 2018, letter from attorneys Jay Sekulow and John Dowd. However, the original explanation for the meeting was not as accurate as the lawyers’ asserted. The statement from Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting focused "primarily" on Russian adoptions. But while the adoptions were indeed mentioned at the meeting, there is evidence that the broader topic of sanctions against well-connected Russians under the Magnitsky Act received significant attention. The statement also offered incomplete characterizations of how much Trump Jr. knew about meeting participants and what he expected to get out of it, and it ignored later efforts by the Russian side to follow up on the meeting. The White House did not respond to multiple inquiries for this article, and a separate inquiry to Sekulow was not returned. Trump Tower tick-tock An email chain to coordinate the meeting shows that Donald Trump Jr. accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father’s campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The younger Trump forwarded the email chain to the candidate’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, his campaign chair at the time. All three Trump campaign officials ended up attending the meeting on June 9, 2016. One of the participants was Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was described in an email to Trump Jr. as a "Russian government attorney." Veselnitskaya has represented Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official, according to the New York Times. Other participants included Russian-American Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet soldier with experience in military counterintelligence, and Georgian-American Ike Kaveladze, who was once the subject of a congressional inquiry into Russian money-laundering through the U.S. banking system. The meeting became public knowledge after the New York Times reported on it 13 months later. For that article, Donald Trump Jr. gave the newspaper a statement (the one that is central to this fact-check): "It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand." That statement was later supplanted by other, conflicting statements from the Trump camp, including contradictions about whether Donald Trump himself dictated the statement in the name of his son — which his lawyers now say he did. The question of adoptions The most misleading part of the statement is that the meeting "primarily" entailed "a program about the adoption of Russian children." While that topic did come up in the meeting, the statement leaves out an apparently detailed discussion of the 2012 Magnitsky Act sanctions, as well as "dirt" on Bill Browder, the businessman who had pushed for the act. Veselnitskaya came to the meeting armed with talking points that were primarily critcisms of the Magnitsky Act that placed strong sanctions on prominent Russians and which Putin and his allies have worked hard to quash. Veselnitskaya’s five pages of talking points only mentioned "adoptions" in passing at the end, saying that the law "became a basis for open confrontation between our countries, complicating relations on all key geopolitical issues and leading to the ban on Americans adopting Russian children." Under questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee — transcripts of which have been released publicly — Trump Jr., Kaveladze and Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump who helped organize the meeting and attended it, said that adoptions were discussed at the meeting. Trump Jr., for instance, testified that "it started off with that sort of tax scheme (about the Democratic National Committee) and, you know, quickly migrated to Russian adoption and ultimately the Magnitsky Act." The evidence suggests that the other topics took up a significant portion of the meeting. Kaveladze testified that Veselnitskaya offered remarks in the meeting "about Magnitsky Act and about destructive role played by Bill Browder, the initiator of that act, in ruining relationship between U.S. and Russia. … She also suggested that the repeal of that act could significantly improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S." At some point, Akhmetshin "gave a little bit more details" on this argument and segued into the act’s impact on adoptions, Kaveladze testified. Also in the meeting, Kaveladze added, Veselnitskaya talked at some length about the owners of Browder’s company being major Democratic donors and how that could be "a negative for the Democratic Party." This account is supported by a page of notes taken by Manafort and released by the committee. The document includes 11 bullet points, including "Bill Browder," "Offshore - Cyprus," "Active sponsors of RNC," and, only as the final bullet point, "Russian adoption by American families." "If it’s what you say I love it" It’s also worth mentioning that adoptions were hardly the meeting’s draw for the Trump camp, according to emails Trump Jr. released three days after the initial New York Times story. The meeting was set in motion on June 3, 2016, when Trump Jr. received an email from Goldstone. He informed the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father’s candidacy, and told of his connection to a Russian government official with incriminating evidence against Clinton. "This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump," Goldstone told Trump Jr. The younger Trump replied: "If it’s what you say I love it." Other points of context Several other elements of the statement paint an incomplete picture. One is the question of whether there was follow-up after the meeting. That may be true for actions by the Trump side. Trump Jr. has said that he "never discussed the meeting again" with Goldstone or fellow meeting organizer Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov. He also told Fox News’ Hannity that Goldstone apologized about the likely "bait and switch about what it was really supposed to be about." However, there is evidence that the other side tried to reach out to the Trump campaign on more than one occasion. For instance, congressional investigators obtained an email from Goldstone to Trump aide Dan Scavino that "encourages Scavino to get candidate Trump to create a page on the Russian social networking site VK, telling him that ‘Don and Paul’ were on board with the idea," a reference to Trump Jr. and Manafort, CNN reported in December 2017. In addition, there were attempts at outreach after the election, CNN reported in April 2018. Goldstone told congressional investigators that he proposed a second meeting with Veselnitskaya, the New York Times reported. Goldstone sent an email on Nov. 28, 2016, to Trump's assistant, Rhona Graff, that said, "Aras Agalarov has asked me to pass on this document in the hope it can be passed on to the appropriate team." The email, which had an attachment about the Magnitsky Act, was forwarded to then-Trump adviser Steve Bannon with the notation, "Not sure how to proceed, if at all," CNN reported. A meeting never took place. Another area where the statement tells only part of the story is its claim that Trump Jr. was not told a specific name in advance. While we found no evidence that he knew a name in advance, Trump Jr. possessed a fair amount of more general information, judging by the email chain with Goldstone that was made public. The first email in the chain said in part, "Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin." Later in the email chain, Goldstone wrote, "Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday." Our ruling The White House legal document said that then-candidate Trump "dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article" about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians. The accuracy of the statement was misleading, at least. The statement's most inaccurate suggestion was that the meeting was primarily about Russian adoptions. That wasn't what the Trump officials came to hear about, and adoptions weren't atop the list of topics for the Russian figures, either. There was a significant amount of discussion about the Magnitsky Act sanctions and allegations of wrongdoing by the act’s champion. Further, the initial statement obscured what we now know about Trump Jr.’s motivation for taking the meeting: the prospect of compromising material on Clinton from the Russians.

pomt-02695	Says New Jersey has "the highest unemployment rate in the region" and "stagnant job growth."	/new-jersey/statements/2014/jan/05/marie-corfield/marie-corfield-says-new-jersey-has-highest-unemplo/	Marie Corfield may no longer be a candidate for state office, but that doesn’t mean the Democrat is shying away from important Jersey topics. Take jobs, for example. Corfield, a public school teacher who ran unsuccessfully in November for the District 16 Assembly seat against incumbent Republican Donna Simon, criticized the state of jobs in New Jersey in a Dec. 30 column on the Democratic blog BlueJersey.com. Corfield framed her comments around the departure of the state's comptroller, whom Gov. Chris Christie said was leaving to better support his family. The comptroller's salary was $140,000. Corfield commended the comptroller's accomplishments, adding that the position's salary is a "comfortable" one for a family of four in the Garden State. Corfield then called out Christie -- "the governor of the state with the highest unemployment rate in the region, stagnant job growth" and a low minimum wage – as pompous, for suggesting that Boxer may have been struggling on such a salary. For this fact check, though, we’re looking only at the claims about New Jersey’s unemployment rate and job growth. First, unemployment rates. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists unemployment rates for the nation, each state, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico on its website. We looked at unemployment rates from November – the most recent data available – to see how New Jersey ranked against Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania. New Jersey’s rate was the highest among that group, at 7.8 percent. Here are the others: Connecticut, 7.6 percent; Delaware, 6.5 percent; New York, 7.4 percent; and Pennsylvania, 7.3 percent. The nation’s unemployment rate for November was 7 percent. So Corfield is correct that New Jersey’s unemployment rate is the highest in the region. It’s worth noting that eight states had unemployment rates higher than New Jersey: California, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, Rhode Island and Tennessee. Arizona’s rate was the same as New Jersey’s. Also, the states are evenly split between Democratic and Republican leadership. Now let’s turn to the claim about "stagnant" job growth. Here, Corfield is off base. New Jersey’s unemployment rate barely moved downward for the first half of Christie’s first term in office, but experts have told us that the governor doesn’t bare all the blame. The after-effects of the recession had a lot to do with it, too. The National Bureau of Economic Research has defined the recession as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009. Christie took office in January 2010. Although New Jersey’s job growth hasn’t been a race to the top of the economic growth heap, the state has gained new private-sector jobs, particularly in the past year, putting it "in the middle of the pack" among other states in terms of job growth, Rutgers University economist Joseph Seneca told us in November. Seneca’s analysis found that the state gained 60,300 private-sector jobs from August 2012 to August 2013. In addition, New Jersey’s job growth rate of 1.8 percent for that time period exceeded that of New York and Connecticut, both with 1.3 percent growth, and Pennsylvania, which had job growth rates of 0.9 percent, Seneca said. Seneca told us that much of the state’s job growth during the period he analyzed was in education, health services, leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities. It’s important to note that Seneca and the BLS have told us it’s best to measure year-over-year job data that has been seasonally adjusted in order to get the most accurate picture of job growth within a 12-month span. Using that methodology, New Jersey has increased its number of private-sector jobs by 130,700 from November 2012 to November 2013. There have been some job losses in recent months, but on the whole, the state is gaining private-sector jobs. Corfield said she used the same BLS data as us to determine New Jersey’s unemployment rate, and looked at an analysis on www.governing.com that showed the Garden State excels in giving tax incentives but lags in job growth. She also pointed us to a Wall Street Journal article that address New Jersey’s slow job growth. Further, Corfield said that while she was out campaigning for an Assembly seat, she spoke with many unhappy and unemployed constituents who "are having a tough time finding a job." Our ruling Corfield claimed in a recent column that Christie is "the governor of the state with the highest unemployment rate in the region, (and) stagnant job growth." She’s right that the unemployment rate is the highest in this region, but wrong on whether New Jersey’s job growth has been sluggish. BLS data shows clearly that while the Garden State’s unemployment rate is the highest among its neighboring states, it’s not the worst in the country. And it’s also clear from BLS data that private-sector jobs are growing in New Jersey. We rate Corfield’s claim Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14117	Says $15-an-hour proposal in Cleveland is "the most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country."	/ohio/statements/2016/may/09/joe-roman/15-minimum-wage-proposal-cleveland-most-aggressive/	Superlatives like "the most" and "the greatest" catch our fact-checking eyes. So we felt compelled to look into a statement by Joe Roman, the CEO and president of the Greater Cleveland Partnership, a regional pro-business organization, on a proposal to raise the city’s minimum wage. On April 25, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Raise Up Cleveland, a union-affiliated PAC, delivered 28,000 signatures to the city council from registered Cleveland voters who support a minimum wage of $15 per hour. The current minimum wage across Ohio is $8.10. "We have serious concerns about a Cleveland-only wage hike that could put the city in a competitive disadvantage in the region and state," Roman said, according to the Plain Dealer. "As proposed, the hike is the most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country." National awareness of the movement called Fight for $15 has been boosted by Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and $15 minimum wage increases have been enacted by cities in California, Washington and New York. So what could make the Cleveland proposal the "most aggressive?" Here’s what we found out. Judith Malone, the director of communications at the Greater Cleveland Partnership, sent us this statement, expanding upon the CEO’s definition of "most aggressive:" According to our examination, no other municipality or state has enacted a +80% increase in their minimum wage. If passed, Cleveland would have the highest broadly applied municipal minimum wage in the nation on January 1, 2017....If the current proposal is approved, Cleveland’s minimum wage would be two times higher than 24 states in the nation and by far the highest in the Midwest region. A chart created by the left-leaning National Employment Law Project backs up this claim. A $15 per hour minimum wage has been enacted by the Washington cities of Seattle, SeaTac (a suburb of Seattle that went to $15.24 in 2013) and Olympia. California cities that approved the $15 minimum include San Francisco, Emeryville, Los Angeles, Mountain View, El Cerrito and Santa Monica. As proposed, the Raise Up Cleveland increase would go into effect Jan. 1, 2017. This is a departure from the way other states and cities have imposed new minimum wage hikes, according to Allison Laffen, a policy associate with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which studies state labor and wage policies. "Often in legislation, the increases are proposed incrementally, as in New York and California, where it reaches $15 by 2018 and 2022," Laffen said. "A one-step increase to $15, effective immediately, could be described as more aggressive." Laffen also pointed out that Cleveland’s minimum wage, at $8.10, is lower than any other municipality that has passed or is considering a $15 minimum hike. Only Flagstaff, Arizona, at $8.05, is lower than Cleveland’s, and their $15 per hour proposal would phase in by 2021. Mark Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the low cost of living in Cleveland is another factor to consider. For example, the cost of living in San Francisco is 206 percent pricier than in Cleveland. "A $15 minimum wage in a city like San Francisco would only be equivalent to about a $5 minimum wage in Cleveland," Perry said. "Therefore, adjusted for the cost of living, it would be hard to justify a $15-an-hour minimum wage in a city like Cleveland, with a cost-of-living that is about 20 percent below the national average." But the union pushing the Fight for $15 in Cleveland defends its stance. Anthony Caldwell, the director of public affairs for SEIU District 1199, said in an email, "Our Fight for $15 movement has broad support among members of the community. When polled on support for a $15 per hour minimum wage beginning this January and indexing it to inflation, 77 percent of Cleveland voters supported our cause. And that support crossed all racial, gender and geographical lines within Cleveland." When asked whether the Greater Cleveland Partnership would be more supportive of a minimum wage increase that stepped up gradually, or was more in line with Cleveland’s cost of living, they declined to comment further. Our ruling A proposed $15 minimum wage in Cleveland is the "most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country," according to the head of the Greater Cleveland Partnership, a chamber of commerce group. It turns out that Cleveland, with a minimum wage of $8.10, is at the lowest starting point of any municipality that has passed or is considering a $15 hike. Also, the Cleveland proposal would increase the wage to $15 at once instead of building up gradually, as most other cities have done.

pomt-03413	Says Arkansas Republican Rep. Tom Cotton voted to provide Congress with "taxpayer-funded health care for life."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/28/patriot-majority-usa/pro-democratic-group-says-rep-tom-cotton-voted-giv/	Ahead of what’s expected to be a bruising battle for an Arkansas Senate seat, a pro-Democratic group called Patriot Majority USA is out with an ad attacking Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a potential challenger to incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor. Here’s the voice-over from the ad: "Tom Cotton -- just elected and already seeking the national limelight. Behind the glitz, Tom Cotton forgot about us. Supporting a plan the Wall Street Journal said essentially ends Medicare, costing some seniors $6,000 more a year, while voting Congress taxpayer-funded health care for life. Congressman Cotton: Out for himself, not us." As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker recently noted, the major fact-checking outlets, including PolitiFact, have been critical of the ending-Medicare claim repeated in the ad. But in this item, we’ll look at the ad’s second claim, which we hadn’t seen before -- that Cotton voted to provide Congress with "taxpayer-funded health care for life." PolitiFact didn’t hear back from the ad’s sponsors, but Ty Matsdorf -- a spokesman for Senate Majority PAC, a group apparently involved in the ad alongside Patriot Majority USA -- explained the group’s logic in an email to the Post’s Fact Checker. Matsdorf said that in March, Cotton voted for a repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care law. So how does this relate to health care for life? It gets a little complicated, so bear with us. Before Obama’s law was approved by Congress in 2010, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, proposed an amendment that won enough votes to be attached to the measure. The amendment required lawmakers and their aides to obtain their health care through the new insurance marketplaces that were a cornerstone of the bill. So, if the health care law is ever repealed, the requirement that lawmakers and aides buy their health insurance through the insurance marketplace would be repealed as well. In its place, lawmakers and aides would return to what they’ve already been doing for years, which is to purchase insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. This decades-old program was something of a model for the exchanges themselves: Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings; they pay a share of the premiums and their employer, the government, pays the rest, just as private-sector employers typically do for their employees. First off, we'll note that the vote in question was to repeal Obamacare, and that the impact on congressional health coverage amounted to only a tiny portion of the repeal effort. The ad portrays Cotton's vote as one that's greedy and self-interested for a member of Congress. But in reality, achieving the complicated legislative bank-shot suggested by the ad was not the point of the repeal vote. The claim also faces some important substantive problems: • "Taxpayer-funded" is technically correct, but misleading. "Taxpayer-funded" suggests that the employee is getting a free ride because the taxpayer is picking up the entire tab for health insurance. That’s not the case -- the worker pays a share of the premiums, roughly 25 percent, although the exact share can vary by plan. "Federal employees still pay a portion of premiums, co-pays, co-insurance, and can face a deductible," said Joshua Archambault, director of health care policy at the Pioneer Institute, a free-market think tank. And while it’s technically true that taxpayers are indirectly paying the government’s share, this is no special perk for federal employees. The government simply happens to be their employer, filling the same role that most private employers above a certain size do when they offer health insurance to their workers on a shared-cost basis. • It’s not "health care for life." The federal health plan doesn’t last forever: At age 65, Medicare kicks in. And before age 65, it’s no freebie gravy train. Unlike Medicare recipients, a federal health plan beneficiary "has to elect to remain in the program -- if they stop paying, the coverage ends," said John Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, which promotes government service. (Federal workers on Medicare can choose to continue to purchase insurance off the federal plan as supplemental coverage, but it’s not mandatory.) And, of course, if the voters don’t send you back to Congress, or if you’re an aide who leaves to join a lobbying firm, your new employer will be picking up a share of your health insurance -- not the taxpayer. In all, Jonathan Oberlander, professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said the ad makes "a misleading and peculiar claim." Our ruling The ad suggests that Cotton, in a self-interested fashion, voted to provide lawmakers and aides with free ride from the taxpayers -- a boondoggle, basically. But viewed in context, the vote wasn't about that. Moreover, it’s a stretch to say the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program amounts to "taxpayer-funded health care for life." While the government does fund a portion of federal employees’ health insurance costs, it does so in the same capacity as any private-sector employer that offers health insurance to its workers. And the coverage doesn’t last "for life." We rate the claim Pants on Fire!	None	Patriot Majority USA	None	None	None	2013-06-28T17:37:13	2013-06-27	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-13827	Says Sen. John McCain spent the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling "F-16s and advanced weapons to the folks who harbored Osama bin Laden."	/arizona/statements/2016/jul/14/kelli-ward/image-claims-john-mccain-visited-pakistan-sell-wea/	Sen. John McCain's primary challenger accused him of selling military weapons to allies of Osama bin Laden, on the Fourth of July of all weekends. The campaign of former state Sen. Kelli Ward, R-Lake Havasu City, sent out a July 3 news release attacking McCain for his alleged plans. It included this graphic: McCain did go to Pakistan that holiday weekend, as well as Afghanistan for his annual visit to American troops on Independence Day. But is Ward right that he carved out time to sell F-16 fighter jets, which are used for aerial attacks, and sophisticated weaponry to "the folks who harbored Osama bin Laden" in Pakistan? Ward’s claim distorts the point of McCain’s trip. A meeting in Pakistan Ward spokesman Stephen Sebastian provided us with news reports about McCain’s meeting with Pakistani officials, which included Sartaj Aziz, advisor to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Raheel Sharif. McCain was part of a bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee delegation with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Sen. Benjamin Sasse, R.-Neb., and Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind. The meeting was billed as an effort to strengthen relations between the two countries and defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. While ISIS does not have a major presence in Pakistan, the United States has expressed concern over indirect connections between the terror group and Pakistani militants. At the meeting, McCain emphasized that Pakistan needs to do more to take on terrorist groups, such as the Haqqani Network, an insurgency group with ties to al-Qaeda and Pakistan, that threaten America, according to his spokeswoman. She also said McCain’s visit was within his oversight as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. So the point of the delegation's visit was not to make a deal on aircrafts — especially since Congress had balked at a military proposal for the United States to finance eight fighter jets for Pakistan. The stumbling block: Pakistan's terrorism ties. "Sen. McCain conveyed to Pakistani leaders that U.S. financing for those (F-16) aircrafts will not be supported by Congress unless and until Pakistan demonstrates more robust efforts against terrorists that threaten America," McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero said. F-16s The United States has sold F-16s to Pakistan for decades. But after the U.S. military approved the sale of eight F-16s to Pakistan in February, congressional leaders said they would block U.S. financing and Pakistan would have to pay for the F-16s with its own money. "Given congressional opposition to financing the F-16 sale with Foreign Military Financing (FMF), we asked the Pakistanis to fund the sale entirely," said State Department spokesman Josh Paul. "Pakistan did not accept this offer, and the terms of the sale have expired." McCain wanted a hearing on the F-16s then, saying he was "conflicted" with the proposed sale, noting potential consequences in the U.S.-India relationship. (There was concern that Pakistan could use the weapons against India.) Romero reiterated that McCain can only see a scenario where the United States finances F-16s is if Pakistan bolsters its anti-terrorism efforts. Ward’s campaign cited Pakistan news website Business Recorder, which quotes Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria as saying McCain’s visit was related to "defense cooperation." The Ward campaign also referenced a June 24 meeting between McCain and former Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari in Los Angeles. McCain’s campaign confirmed this meeting, saying it was part of his regular meetings with world leaders. A Pakistani government account of the meeting recounts Zardari making the case for American F-16s and drones to fight terrorists. Sebastian also noted that most of the senator’s itinerary was not available in advance because of security concerns. McCain’s daily schedule is not released publicly. "While F-16s and weapon sales were not the only, or even primary, purpose of the CoDel (congressional delegation) trip, it certainly seems to have been a prominent part of the agenda," he said. That's a much softer take than the message of the campaign ad. Pakistan on terror Now for the Ward attack's characterization of Pakistan as the "folks who harbored Osama bin Laden." Yes, bin Laden was found and killed at a compound in Pakistan in 2011. But University of Michigan history professor Juan Cole, who has written extensively about the Middle East, questioned the graphic’s portrayal of Pakistan in the terrorism fight. "The implication is that Pakistan is an enemy of the U.S., whereas it is designated as a non-NATO ally," Cole said. "McCain's trip is not about arms sales but broader diplomacy." Pakistan has a mixed history dealing with terrorism, despite aiding in the 2003 capture of suspected 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shiekh Mohammed. "Pakistan has failed to attack, and in some cases even provided support and safe haven to a variety of other militant/terrorist groups, including the Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba, that have attacked U.S. troops in Afghanistan and have killed U.S. citizens in India," said Daniel Markey, an international relations professor at Johns Hopkins University. Pakistan does have an Anti-Terrorism Act, which was established in 1997. But the U.S. Institute of Peace even concludes in a August 2015 report that it offers a "very weak deterrence" against terrorism, as conviction rates remain low. "Pakistan has a lot of problems, it has not been a great ally," said Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Alyssa Ayres. "(But) it also is the supply route to support our troops in Afghanistan." As for the accusation that McCain was engineering a sale to people who "harbored" bin Laden, that is also unproven. Ward’s campaign referenced a October 2015 Washington Post story that quotes Pakistan’s former defense minister as saying it was "probable" that the Pakistani military knew of bin Laden’s whereabouts. But Markey said the ad's claim jumps too far. "We don't yet have evidence that top Pakistani military or civilian leaders knew of bin Laden's whereabouts or ‘harbored’ him, as it says in the graphic," he said. Our ruling Ward said McCain was in Pakistan during the Fourth of July weekend selling "F-16s and advanced weapons" to the folks who "harbored Osama bin Laden." Experts we spoke with disagreed. The ad distorts McCain’s mission in Pakistan to stir up questions about his patriotism. While McCain has discussed F-16 fighter jets with Pakistani officials, the meeting over the holiday weekend was part of a larger effort to fight terrorism. Further, the ad oversimplifies Pakistan's complicated relationship with the United States. There is plenty of legitimate concern about the country's approach to terrorist groups, but there is no definitive proof that Pakistan (particularly the ones who met with McCain) harbored bin Laden.

pomt-10340	"We've heard talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels in nearly every State of the Union address since the oil embargo of 1973."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/18/barack-obama/senator-did-you-check-all-those-state-of-the-union/	Sen. Barack Obama called on the nation to "end the tyranny of oil" in a July 11, 2008, speech on energy security. He said it's an issue we've been talking about for decades. "We have heard promises about energy independence from every single U.S. president since Richard Nixon," Obama said in Dayton, Ohio. "We've heard talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels in nearly every State of the Union address since the oil embargo of 1973." The first part sounded true enough — what president hasn't waxed poetic about liberating us from foreign oil? But the latter line about fossil fuels struck us as the sort of thing speechwriters might throw in without fact-checking, on the assumption that no one else would be crazy enough to do so. They didn't count on PolitiFact. We scoured the past 35 State of the Union speeches for "talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels." It was about as fun as a root canal. But it prompted us to put together this quiz showcasing presidents' State of the Union chestnuts. And it enabled us to tell you this about Obama's claim: It's true that the oil embargo of 1973 — when Arab countries cut oil exports to punish the West for supporting Israel in the Arab-Israeli war — prompted serious concern among U.S. leaders about our reliance on oil. Richard Nixon kicked off his 1974 State of the Union speech by commenting on how it was the first of its kind to feature energy as the No. 1 priority. He went on to say that even if the embargo is lifted, "conservation will continue to be necessary." And private enterprise will "develop the new resources, the new technology, the new capacity America will require for its energy needs in the 1980s." In our view, that constitutes "talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels." (Fossil fuels are fuels like coal, oil and natural gas that come from the fossilized remains of plants and animals). Gerald Ford picked up the thread, calling in 1975 for more synthetic fuels, home insulation, efficient cars and the like. And in 1976 he advocated "technology to capture energy from the sun and the Earth." Jimmy Carter was an avid conservationist, and talked at length about the subject during his State of the Union speeches, such as in 1981 when he endorsed technology such as "photovoltaics, which generate energy directly from the sun." Ronald Reagan? Not so much. His first three State of the Union speeches had only glancing references to the environment, and his last four had nothing even remotely related to curbing fossil-fuel use. President George H.W. Bush had just one reference to new energy sources in his State of the Union addresses, and Bill Clinton omitted the subject from his in 1994 and 1995. Since then, every State of the Union has included talk of new ways to power our cars and homes, culminating in the President George W. Bush's call this year to trust American researchers and entrepreneurs to "pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology." The bottom line: 23 of the 35 State of the Union speeches since the Arab oil embargo contained endorsements of the idea of curbing the country's use of fossil fuels. (That's being generous, and including, for example, Clinton's endorsement in 1993 of an energy tax because it "promotes energy efficiency.") The 12 State of the Union addresses in '82, '83, '84, '85, '86, '87, '88, '89, '90, '92, '94 and '95 — though some had references to air pollution — could not reasonably be considered to contain any "talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels." We should note that the first part of Obama's quote — that every president has made promises about energy independence — was startlingly accurate. State of the Union speeches were rife with lines like this one, from Richard Nixon, in 1974: "Let this be our national goal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980, the United States will not be dependent on any other country for the energy we need." But what we are evaluating is Obama's claim that "nearly every" State of the Union speech since 1973 included talk about curbing fossil fuels. And the fact is, about two-thirds of the speeches in question contained a reference. And that is substantial, but not "nearly every." We rule Obama's claim Mostly True. UPDATE: In our original posting of this item on July 18, 2008, we mistakenly attributed a 1976 quote from President Gerald Ford to President Jimmy Carter. The item was corrected on July 21, 2008.

pomt-06265	On advancing state money for a Formula One race	/texas/statements/2011/nov/28/susan-combs/susan-combs-u-turns-advancing-state-money-formula-/	Years before the Formula One racetrack agreement became public knowledge in Central Texas, state Comptroller Susan Combs was a strong supporter. Yet on Nov. 15, 2011, she hit the brakes: Texas would not disburse $25 million in advance of the first race, she announced. We put her statement through PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter. Did Combs do a high-speed turn? Combs’ statement says she has supported bringing a Formula One race to Texas "since 2008." And when the deal became public in May 2010, Gov. Rick Perry praised her efforts. In the 2010-11 budget, approved in 2009, lawmakers sent $25 million to Combs to be placed in the Major Events Trust Fund, whence she could distribute the money under the terms of a 2003 statute. Combs’ agreement to pay in advance was spelled out in a May 10, 2010, letter: "With the understanding that the first Formula 1 United States Grand Prix race will be held in Texas in 2012, full funding on the entire sanction for 2012 will be paid to Formula OneWorld Championship Limited (‘FOWC’) no later than July 31st, 2011." The sanction, reported by the Statesman to be $25 million under the original contract, is the first of ten $25 million annual payments Texas committed to in writing. Payment was delayed when Austin’s race date was put back from June 17, 2012, to Nov. 18, 2012. But Combs’ Nov. 15 statement was the first official notice that Texas would not pay until after the race was held. It unequivocally says, "The state of Texas will not be paying any funds in advance of the event." Does her announcement constitute a flip flop? Combs says no. Specifically, Combs spokeswoman Brooke Botello told us, "It is not a change of position; rather, it’s adhering to the statute." "The ability to advance funds, according to the statute, is discretionary," Botello emailed us Nov. 22. "Considering the events of late, we used that discretion and decided – due to the events outlined in the attached – it would not be prudent to advance the funds." In the attachment Botello mentions, which is Combs’ Nov. 15 statement, the comptroller lists the recently announced Formula One race in New Jersey, set for 2013; slowed construction at the Central Texas site; and disagreements between Formula One and race promoters that "prompted speculation about whether the Austin race will even occur." Our ruling: Combs may have been justified in her recent statement that no state money would go to the race in advance. Still, it’s a reversal of her earlier promise. This is a Full Flop.

pomt-09702	"I didn't endorse" the federal stimulus bill.	/florida/statements/2009/nov/05/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-he-didnt-endorse-stimulus-bill/	Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, facing a potentially bruising Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, continues to run from any assertion that he is linked to President Barack Obama. Last week Crist told reporters he didn't know Obama was traveling in Florida. On Wednesday, Crist told a national television audience he didn't endorse the $787 billion federal stimulus bill pushed by Obama and passed by Congress in February. "I didn't endorse it," Crist told CNN host Wolf Blitzer. "I — you know, I didn't even have a vote on the darned thing. But I understood that it was going to pass and I wanted to be able to utilize it for the benefit of my fellow Floridians." This, from the same man who skipped a Florida Cabinet meeting to campaign with Obama for the stimulus in Fort Myers in February? Who went on national talk shows and across the state selling the plan? As the interview continued, Crist got on a roll. "You know, unfortunately, the president thinks that everything we need to do for every problem that comes along is spend more money and that's just wrong," he said. "Frankly, enough is enough. And I know that the people understand that. And I understand it. And I understand it because I'm the grandson of a Greek immigrant who came to this country with nothing, really taught me the value of a dollar, because his first job in America, in Altoona, Pa., was shining shoes for a living for $5 a month." Crist's comments about the stimulus startled conservatives, Democrats, and frankly, us, who all remember things differently. The conservative Club for Growth responded Thursday with an online television ad, criticizing Crist's support for the stimulus plan. And the Democratic National Committee blasted Crist's comments to reporters across the country. Let's go back to earlier this year, to see what Crist had to say then. From Hardball with Chris Matthews on Feb. 3: Speaking of the stimulus, Crist said, "It's going to help (Floridians') children. It's going to help their traffic situation. It's going to help produce more jobs here in the Sunshine State. That's a perspective that I have to have as, in essence, the CEO of Florida. And that's why I support it." From Time on Feb. 10: "I see this package as a pragmatic, commonsense opportunity to move forward. I didn't campaign for Obama, we don't agree on everything, but he's my president, and my job is to help Florida stay in the black." From Meet the Press on Feb. 22: Q: Why would you buck your own party, which did not vote for this plan in Congress, as you know, to support the stimulus? Crist: "It's not a matter of bucking the party, it's a matter of helping the people. I mean, I really view it as an issue of what can I do that's best for the people of Florida? We've got almost 20 million people that live in the Sunshine State now. I think my obligation is in essence the CEO of the state, to do everything I can to help us get through this tough economy. Certainly this stimulus package, about $12.2 billion to Florida, will help Florida an awful lot." And that's just a sampling. But then there's the rally in Fort Myers Feb. 10. Crist skipped a Florida Cabinet meeting and a lunch with former Gov. Jeb Bush to tout the stimulus bill in person. If you've forgotten, here's a photo and video to jog your memory. Here's the retelling of that day from the St. Petersburg Times : "We know that it's important that we pass a stimulus package,'' Florida's popular Republican governor said amid "Yes, we can!" cheers as he introduced the Democratic president. "This is not about partisan politics. This is about rising above that, helping America and reigniting our economy." Crist went as far earlier this year as to lobby members of Florida's congressional delegation from both parties to support the stimulus package. The Miami Herald reported that Crist lobbied Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, along with Democratic Reps. Kathy Castor and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. In fact, he was one of the few prominent Republicans to support the stimulus at any level, a choice that won him accolades from Obama. And Crist was among a group of governors to write Obama on Feb. 3 to express support for the stimulus plan. "As stewards of the economies of our respective states and regions, we urge the Congress to reach prompt resolution of all outstanding differences and you to sign the bill when it reaches your desk," the letter read in part. Oh, oh, oh. One more. In May, according to the Orlando Sentinel , Crist himself said he would have made the "pragmatic" decision to vote for the stimulus bill that ultimately passed. On Thursday, Crist tried to expand on his CNN comments. When asked by state Capitol reporters if he were changing his position on the stimulus, Crist said, "I don't think so. I don't think so." "The bill that passed wasn't exactly what I would want to vote for. But it's what passed," Crist said. "And once that happened, you need to realize you need to do everything you possibly can to fight for Florida and our fellow Floridians, whether they're school teachers, construction workers or whatever it might be. And so once this happens, you know, I think it's important to embrace it, fight for Florida's fair share and do what's right for the state." That sounds a lot like Obama, actually, who has said several times that the stimulus wasn't perfect. Crist even said as much during his interview on Meet the Press in February. Back to Crist's original statement. He said Wednesday that he didn't endorse the stimulus and offered the fact that he didn't have a vote on the proposal as evidence. Of course, Crist, as governor, couldn't vote for the stimulus. But, strictly speaking, neither could Obama as president. So that's hardly a proper measure to justify a claim that Crist didn't endorse the stimulus bill. What is a proper measure are Crist's actions in January and February. Crist broke ranks with many in the Republican Party by publicly campaigning for the stimulus package on television and with the president. He lobbied Florida's congressional delegation to vote for the bill. And he signed Florida's budget, which was balanced because the state received billions of dollars in federal stimulus money. (The stimulus provides Florida $15.7 billion over three budget years ending next budget year.) White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on Thursday even acknowledged Crist's support. "I think his words at that (Fort Myers) event speak for themselves," Gibbs said. "I think he was very supportive of the legislation and supportive of the benefits that it would have and has had for — for the state of Florida in seeing positive economic growth." Facing a primary challenge from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Crist appears to be trying to rewrite history. But there are mountains of evidence that he not only supported the stimulus, he sang its praises. The meter is ablaze: Pants On Fire.

pomt-13984	"Austin ISD has the highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas."	/texas/statements/2016/jun/10/austin-independent-school-district/austin-districts-claim-highest-graduation-rate-amo/	An ad posted in Austin’s Erwin Center during June 2016 high school graduation ceremonies made us wonder: "Austin ISD has the highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas." That seemingly takes in a lot of school districts. Asked the basis of the message, a spokesman for the Austin school district, Reyne Telles, said by phone that marketing officials focused on 2014 graduation rates for "signature" districts in the state’s five most populous cities. For each district, Texas calculates one graduation rate by counting students in keeping with federal law and another rate that comports with state law. Upshot: The Austin district’s 2014 graduation rate — 88.6 percent or 86.3 percent, depending on which result you choose — outpaced comparable rates for the Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth districts, Telles noted. The district emailed us a spreadsheet presenting its figures, which we checked against Texas Education Agency data confirming that among the five districts, Austin had the highest graduation rates--though it was close: The Dallas district had graduation rates of 86.9 or 86.1 percent, respectively, TEA posts indicate. Statewide, the agency in 2015 announced the 2014 state graduation rate was 88.3 percent, a record high. Texas High School Graduation Rates, Selected Districts, 2014 DISTRICT 2014 GRADUATION RATE USING FEDERAL STUDENT EXCLUSIONS 2014 GRADUATION RATE USING STATE STUDENT EXCLUSIONS Austin 86.3 percent 88.6 percent Dallas 86.1 86.9 Fort Worth 81.0 84.1 Houston 78.6 81.8 San Antonio 78.2 80.8 SOURCES: Online searches using website, "Search Four-Year Graduation and Dropout Data by District, Class of 2014," Texas Education Agency (accessed June 6-7, 2016) Other slices of data We recognized other ways to compare the Austin district to other districts in major Texas cities. For instance, TEA classifies Austin and 10 other districts as "major urban" districts, meaning each one is located in a county with a population of at least 870,000; its enrollment is the largest in the county or at least 75 percent of the largest district enrollment in the county; and at least 35 percent of enrolled students are economically disadvantaged. The "major urban" districts include the districts AISD singled out for its ad plus the Arlington district in Tarrant County, the North East and Northside districts in San Antonio and several districts in El Paso County--El Paso, Socorro and Ysleta. And among these additional districts, per the state, the North East and Northside districts had the highest 2014 graduation rates (93.4 or 94.1 percent depending on the calculation). More than half the North East district lies within San Antonio, the district says, though it takes in smaller cities including Castle Hills. Northside describes itself as located in the northwest quadrant of San Antonio. The Socorro district, with 88.2 to 89.8 percent graduation rates, similarly fared better than the Austin district. The Socorro district says its serves students in East El Paso, the city of Socorro and Horizon City. You could also look at districts based on enrollment, an approach that arguably elevates a suburban Houston district, the 110,000-student Cypress-Fairbanks district, into consideration. Its graduation rates of 91.4 and 92.4 percent, respectively, outpaced the 80,000-student Austin district’s rates. We ran these alternate comparisons past Telles, who said it’s always a challenge to convert educational "speak" and/or data into something digestible for the general public. "We’re dealing with marketers that tell us billboard advertising is kind of complicated when you go more than six words," Telles said. Telles said the district could have compared Austin with its fellow "major urban" districts. Then again, he said, "if you say Northside, the average person, I’d venture to say, would not know where that is." The ad statement, he said, came down to "consumability." In a follow-up email, Telles noted that more than half the Austin district’s student population is considered at risk of dropping out — which is also the case in the four districts it chose for the comparison. But that wasn't so, Telles wrote, for the Northside, North East or Socorro districts. In 2014, according to TEA data, 56 percent of Austin students were considered "at risk." Half of Socorro students were at risk, the agency says, as were 43 percent of Northside students and 36 percent of North East students. Our ruling The Austin district says it has the "highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas." This declaration is rooted in the faulty premise that Texas has only five major cities and only the districts named for those cities are worthy of comparison. Applying those filters gives the statement an element of truth. On the other hand, we identified other districts in the same cities with higher graduation rates than the Austin district.

pomt-11437	"Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges."	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/14/liberty-headlines/no-seattle-police-didnt-use-red-flag-law-seize-man/	Seattle police seizing a man’s gun under the state’s "red flag" law has led to numerous false reports on right-wing websites that police arbitrarily took away a man’s Second Amendment rights. "Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges," stated a March 7 headline on Liberty Headlines. The story was attributed to Zero Hedge, which used a story from the website SHTFplan that claimed that Seattle police used "Nazi style gun confiscation." The same or similar stories have appeared on many right-leaning websites. The Liberty Headlines story said that police seized the man’s gun after neighbors had complained the man had been "staring" at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. Other residents complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel "uncomfortable" and "unsafe." The story declared "tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil" and that "a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government." Sounds alarming. But it’s not accurate. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that the headline was wrong and that the story failed to explain that police obtained a warrant from a judge after the 31-year-old man failed to turn over his gun and appear at a hearing, as ordered by the court. ‘Red Flag’ laws in Washington and other states In 2016, Washington state voters overwhelmingly approved Initiative 1491 to allow courts, upon petition by police or a family or household member, to issue an extreme risk protection order. The order prevents an individual from accessing firearms for a specified time period if the court determines the person poses a significant danger. A handful of other states, including California, have similar "red flag" laws, and many other states are considering passing them. Following the Parkland shooting, Florida passed such a law to allow law enforcement to seek a risk protection order. While the NRA argues the laws violate a person’s rights by taking away a gun when no crime has been committed, law enforcement argues it is a tool they can use to take away a gun before a catastrophe occurs. Details about the Seattle police seizing a man’s handgun PolitiFact interviewed Sgt. Eric Pisconski, who heads up the unit that oversees extreme risk protection orders, as well as Seattle police spokesman Det. Patrick Michaud. Police did not released the suspect’s name. PolitiFact submitted records requests to the King County prosecutor and obtained the criminal complaint that explains the charge against Alexander Sinclair McKenzie, an Army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder. Police said they had received multiple calls about McKenzie’s escalating behavior in the past year. McKenzie voluntarily surrendered a gun in 2017 after he was served with an anti-harassment order, even though he wasn’t required to do so. He acknowledged he was experiencing "stress" and did not want the gun around, Michaud said. Months later, McKenzie, who lives above a restaurant, had several interactions with the restaurant staff. In one instance, he stood in front of the restaurant and yelled obscenities and accused people of talking to him through the floor. "No crimes were committed at that time, but his behavior was erratic and unnerving to all; resulting in contact" by police, Michaud said. McKenzie declined services, but shortly thereafter he called police again to report "taunting and voices" coming from the restaurant below through the floor. He also told police that he was armed with a gun and wanted a female employee "arrested or shot" by police, Michaud said. McKenzie was ultimately taken to a medical facility. On Feb. 13, police petitioned the court to get an extreme risk protection order to take away McKenzie’s gun. A King County Superior Court Judge approved the order and police served it to McKenzie in person at a medical facility. He agreed to call police when he was discharged to hand over the firearm. After he left the medical facility on Feb. 23, police attempted to contact McKenzie multiple times to obtain his firearm. After McKenzie didn’t show up for his Feb. 27 court date about the order to turn over his gun, the judge granted a search warrant based on probable cause to arrest. McKenzie was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a person prohibited by extreme risk protection order, a gross misdemeanor. On March 1, police went to McKenzie’s apartment and took his gun. He was placed into custody and booked at the King County jail. The case remains pending. Pisconski said that since the law went into effect in 2017, Seattle police have received 16 extreme risk protection orders that resulted in collecting about 26 guns. This was the only case in which the suspect didn’t voluntarily surrender a gun. One of the websites that wrote that police took the gun without a "warrant" added an editor’s note about errors in its original article. The SHFTplan website, which has the tagline "when it hits the fan, don’t say we didn’t warn you," updated the article to state that law enforcement did have a warrant. Our ruling Liberty Headlines said, "Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges." The headline and the story make it appear that Seattle police arbitrarily took away a man’s gun, and that’s not the case. Interviews with police officials showed that after police received numerous reports about a man’s troubling behavior, so they sought an extreme risk protection order from the court to remove the man’s gun. Police tracked down the man to inform him about the order. When the man failed to appear in court as ordered and didn’t turn over his gun, the judge signed off on the order that allowed police to arrest McKenzie. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02726	The economic impact of new Atlanta Braves stadium includes 9,241 new jobs and $295 million in wages.	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/20/revitalize-cobb/braves-stadium-jobs-and-wages-numbers-fall-short/	Backers of constructing a taxpayer-subsidized Atlanta Braves stadium in Cobb want residents to know that the new field of dreams will grow jobs and money. Revitalize Cobb, a pro-business interest group, announced the expected yield in a glossy mailer. "9,241 New Jobs + $295,000,000 in Wages + $0 Tax Increase for Homeowners + $3,000,000 Annually for Cobb Schools = 1 Great Deal for Cobb Residents," said the ad, which was sent to residents late last month. Should county taxpayers bet the farm on these numbers? Supporters of major publicly subsidized projects have made similar claims to fend off criticism that taxpayers are getting a bad deal. The Truth-O-Meter has checked a few that reference economic impact studies they say prove their point. But in many cases, they don’t come close. An earlier PolitiFact analyzed the claims that the stadium would require no tax increase for homeowners and provide $3 million for Cobb schools. They were rated Half True. Now it’s time to look at Revitalize Cobb’s jobs and wage figures. The group’s source is an economic impact study commissioned by the Cobb Chamber of Commerce, which has championed the stadium. It estimates the effects of two phases of the project — construction and the stadium’s operations over 10 years. Analysts assumed the ballpark will have 41,500 seats and attract 3 million fans during its first year. (The stadium is projected to open in 2017.) Attendance will stabilize at 2.7 million three years later. Construction will require 5,227 jobs over three years, according to the report, which was prepared by program management firm Brailsford & Dunlavey. The report also states that each year, operating the park will require 1,187 full-time jobs, 1,753 part-time jobs, and 1,074 "nonprofit jobs," an unusual category that we will explain later. Add them up and you get 9,241 jobs, which is the figure used by Revitalize Cobb. The estimate of $295 million in wages combines the salaries earned over three years of construction with one year of wages for workers operating the park. We found a few problems with Revitalize Cobb’s portrayal of the study’s findings. Most jobs will not go to Cobb residents. And from a metro Atlanta and state perspective, by and large, these jobs aren’t "new." First, let’s consider construction jobs. These were calculated using a measurement called a "job year," which is equivalent to one full-time job lasting one year. Economists use this measure to express the number of jobs created during the construction phase of a project because in this industry, positions can last for only a few months. So if four different plumbers worked three months each on the stadium, their combined efforts would equal one job year. According to the study, only 784 of these jobs -- or about 15 percent -- will go to Cobb residents. However, because of the nature of a job year, the stadium may put more than 784 Cobb residents to work. For the ballpark’s operation phase, the study counted a "job" as one position. Only about 27 percent of the full-time jobs and 30 percent of the part-time jobs are expected to go to county residents, the study states. Revitalize Cobb’s claim that the Braves move will result in $295 million in wages is also based on a regional number. "The overall amount of wages is absolutely not the Cobb County payroll. No way," said Bruce Seaman, a professor at Georgia State University who has studied the economic impact of the Braves. Revitalize Cobb did not hide this fact. Some of this breakdown appears in smaller type on the other side of the mailer. But because the group used these numbers as proof that the stadium is "1 Great Deal for Cobb Residents," readers could get the impression that the 9,241 jobs and $295 million in wages would go to locals, Seaman noted. From a state or regional perspective, these are not "new" jobs. For the most part, jobs that already exist in downtown Atlanta are simply moving to Cobb. "You’re taking money out of one pocket and putting it in another," said Robert Baade, a Lake Forest College professor who studies the economics of sports. And many workers at the downtown stadium may not move with the Braves. If these current workers stay behind, Cobb residents have a good shot at the vacancies. "It’s a more direct opportunity for Cobb County residents," said Jason Thompson, a vice president at the firm that produced the study. Plus, new ballparks often provide services that require teams to boost their staffing, he said. Another problem with Revitalize Cobb’s claim is the group’s decision to count 1,074 "nonprofit" jobs among the new positions that would be created by the Cobb stadium. These positions are the result of a Braves program where nonprofit volunteers work for free in stadium jobs, Thompson said. The wages they would have earned go to their nonprofit. This volunteer work does have an economic impact. Their labor infuses money into the economy. However, this isn’t what your average person counts as jobs. By including them, Revitalize Cobb boosts its job numbers by 13 percent. While the study’s annual jobs figures seem a little high, the study’s findings appear to be in the ballpark, said Georgia State University professor Seaman, who reviewed the study at the request of PolitiFact Georgia. Our ruling: Revitalize Cobb used numbers generated by an economic impact study commissioned by the county’s Chamber of Commerce, which supports the stadium. The study’s findings are not unreasonable. But the mailer published by Revitalize Cobb uses its findings in a confusing way that could give the impression that a new stadium’s impact on Cobb is greater than the study predicts. While the interest group tried to provide context through the mailer, it didn’t do enough. It also added projected "nonprofit" positions to its jobs figures, which gives an inflated impression of the number of jobs the stadium is estimated to provide. The pro-stadium mailer had an element of truth, but was a less-than-accurate portrayal of a flawed study commissioned by stadium boosters. Revitalize Cobb earns a Mostly False.

pomt-12156	Says Russian President Vladimir Putin said Pope Francis "is not a man of God."	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/08/blog-posting/vladimir-putin-said-pope-francis-not-man-god-blogg/	Internet posts claim Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Pope Francis "is not a man of God," but we could find no proof of Putin saying such a thing. An Aug. 5, 2017, post on USAConservativeReport.com said that Putin condemned Pope Francis in a speech at the Naval Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Kronstadt, near St. Petersburg. "Pope Francis is using his platform to push a dangerous far-left political ideology on vulnerable people around the world, people who trust him because of his position," Putin is quoted. "If you look at what he (the Pope) says it’s clear that he is not a man of God. At least not the Christian God. Not the God of the Bible. "He dreams of a world government and a global communist system of repression," Putin added. "As we have seen before in communist states, this system is not compatible with Christianity." Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. There are no dates given for Putin’s supposed comments, nor is there any indication to whom he was speaking. The post includes a YouTube video apparently generated by a computer that repeats the information. Comments found in the USAConservativeReport.com post appeared on other outlets, none of which provided an original source for the comments. USAConservativeReport.com has no contact information, and our attempts to reach other outlets that shared similar stories, MacedoniaOnline.eu and YourNewsWire.com, went unanswered. After a thorough search online and through Nexis archives, we didn’t find any record of Putin saying the Pope was "not a man of God." Putin did make an official visit to the Naval Cathedral on July 30, which is Navy Day in Russia, an annual celebration of nautical military might. Putin also spoke to about 5,000 sailors. But he did not discuss the pope. The speech was available on YouTube, with a translation that jibed with Western reports: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Russian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church have a strained relationship, with Russian believers accusing the Vatican of deliberately working to convert worshippers. The Catholic Church has denied doing so. Putin and Pope Francis have met on two occasions, when the Russian president visited Vatican City in 2013 and 2015. While the pair discussed Christian persecution on both visits, topics also included Russian involvement in Syria and Ukraine.

pomt-13514	Under the current procedure, if someone "on a terror watch list" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified.	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/02/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-if-someone-terror-watch-list-tries-buy-g/	A week after Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people and injured more than 50 others at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, appeared on NBC’s "Meet the Press." Days earlier, the FBI disclosed that Mateen had previously been under investigation and was, for a time, on a terrorist watch list. Ryan was asked about legislation intended to delay or prevent people on those lists from obtaining guns. "The question right now," Ryan said, "is if someone is on a terror watch list, are the authorities notified as to whether a person on that list is trying to purchase a gun or not? That is the procedure right now." Is Ryan right that under the current procedure, if someone "on a terror watch list" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified? https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/147e8831-dbe4-4d9a-9465-f16b248bd0bc How gun screening works When we asked Ryan’s office to provide backup for his claim, a spokesman pointed to a 2010 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. That report states the FBI is alerted when a federal background check for a gun transfer is performed on someone whose name is on a terrorist watch list. We confirmed the same with Dave Joly, a spokesman for the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, and Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, a law professor at the UCLA School of Law. Such background checks are mandated under a federal law called the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act — commonly known as the "Brady Bill." States can choose to conduct the background checks themselves, or have the FBI perform them. Either way, a background check involves verifying the buyer’s identity and searching for information in databases that would determine if the gun purchase is illegal. For instance, someone who is under indictment, has a felony conviction, uses illicit drugs or is an illegal immigrant is not permitted to buy a gun. Background checks typically result in approving the gun purchase, denying it or imposing a three-day delay to allow for further investigation. While conducting such checks, the federal government can screen for people whose names appear on terrorist watch lists — though the fact someone is on such a list does not alone disqualify that person from buying a gun under the Brady Bill. Indeed, the vast majority of people on terror watch lists have been allowed to purchase guns. The federal government began cross-referencing gun background checks with terrorist watch lists in 2004, and through 2015, there were 2,477 instances when someone on a terrorist watch list was involved in a gun background check. About 91 percent of those transactions were permitted, according to the Government Accountability Office. If federal authorities are notified someone on a terrorist watch list is trying to buy a gun, they can take steps to thwart the purchase. For instance, investigators can review paperwork the prospective gun buyer completed to check for other new, potentially disqualifying information. Private sales excluded Importantly, the Brady Bill does not require background checks for all gun transfers: It applies only to gun sales by federally licensed firearm dealers. Unlicensed sellers are not required to document or report sales under the law. At least 18 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that go beyond the Brady Bill and require background checks in some private gun sales, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit organization that tracks firearm laws and litigation in the United States and seeks to reduce gun violence. But the other states — including Wisconsin — have no such requirement. There is no definitive figure of how many private gun sales occur, although experts have made some informed estimates. A National Institute of Justice study estimated there were 13.7 million gun transfers between 1993 and 1994 in the United States; roughly 60 percent involved licensed dealers, while about 40 percent were "off-the-books transfers" through unlicensed sellers. Preliminary data from a more recent, yet-to-be-published survey suggests the proportion of unlicensed gun sales has decreased, but such sales still involve millions of guns each year, according to Northeastern University Professor Matthew Miller, who co-directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. Our rating Ryan said that under the current procedure, if someone "on a terror watch list" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified. That is accurate as it applies to gun sales in which a federal background check occurs. But a significant amount of gun sales or other transfers lack background checks, so there would be no red flag when someone on the list tries to buy a gun. For a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-09-02T10:30:00	2016-06-19	['None']
pomt-11553	"Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018."	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/08/lovethispiccom/no-law-banned-smoking-cars-children-effective-jan-/	The days of mom puffing away on a cigarette in the car while her children are in the back seat are over, according to a misleading viral story on Facebook. "Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018," stated a Feb. 3 headline on Lovethispic.com, a blog that encourages users to share images. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat hoaxes online. We found that the story was misleading because no such federal law kicked in at the end of January. The blog said that the law applies to any private vehicle and that violators would face up to a $100 fine. It included a photo of a woman smoking in the driver’s seat while children sat in the backseat. The blog didn’t explain if it was a federal or state or local law -- as evident by comments posted by confused readers who asked what jurisdictions would fall under the new law. The broad statements in the blog could leave the false impression that it refers to a federal law. The story linked to a Feb. 1 Yahoo Lifestyle story and lifted many paragraphs from that article. The Yahoo story stated that on Jan. 30, the Alabama state House of Representatives passed a bill to ban smoking in vehicles with any riders under the age of 19. So that means the bill itself wasn’t enacted as a law by that date -- it still has additional legislative hurdles. However if it becomes law, Alabama would be the ninth state to do so since 2006. There is no federal law -- or proposed federal legislation -- prohibiting smoking in vehicles with children. Alabama is one of 12 states that are considering similar bills this session, said Liz Williams, project manager for Americans for Nonsmokers’ rights. The blog included a few sentences describing of the type of vehicles that it applies to, which closely mirrored the wording of an announcement in July 2015 by the government of the United Kingdom, which banned smoking in cars with children effective Oct. 1, 2015. The lovethispic blog appears to recycle a similar story from 2016, Snopes found. We emailed the lovethispic blog and did not hear a reply. The headline "smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018" is misleading because it could lead readers to believe that a national ban started in January. In reality, the Alabama House did pass such a ban on Jan. 30, but it’s not state law yet. We rate this statement False.

pomt-06611	Says Mitt Romney wrote that if Social Security was done "in the private sector, it would be called criminal."	/texas/statements/2011/sep/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-mitt-romney-wrote-if-social-securi/	Defending his published characterization of Social Security as a failure of legally questionable origin, Texas Gov. Rick Perry turned the tables on Mitt Romney, saying: "You said if people did it in the private sector it would be called criminal. That's in your book." Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, shot back in the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate: "Gov. Perry, you've got to quote me correctly. You said it's criminal. What I said was Congress taking money out of the Social Security trust fund is like (a) criminal (act) and that is and it's wrong." We wondered if Perry accurately recapped Romney’s description of Social Security. Let’s start from a fuller excerpt of their debate exchange. At the debate, Romney challenged Perry’s repeated description of Social Security as a Ponzi scheme. Romney, addressing Perry, said the Ponzi term is "what scared seniors, number one. And number two, suggesting that Social Security should no longer be a federal program and returned to the states and unconstitutional is likewise frightening. "Look, there are a lot of bright people who agree with you," Romney continued. "And that's your view. I happen to have a different one. I think that Social Security is an essential program that we should change the way we're funding it. You called it a criminal--" Perry jumped in: "You said if people did it in the private sector it would be called criminal. That's in your book." We’ve run several looks at Perry’s Social Security descriptions in his 2010 book, Fed Up!, rating False his claim that the government program is a Ponzi scheme. Unlike such a criminal enterprise, Social Security is obligated to pay benefits and participants are aware of how the system operates; it’s public. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, too, Social Security is accountable to Congress and the American people. More recently, PolitiFact in Washington rated True Romney’s charge in the Sept. 12 debate that Perry called Social Security a "failure" in his book and rated Mostly True Romney’s claim that Perry also called Social Security unconstitutional. Perry’s book lacks such an explicit statement, but Perry argues that the Supreme Court should not have ruled significant pieces of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal constitutional and by doing so, "we’ve been forced to accept (Social Security) for more than 70 years now." And did Perry accurately recap Romney’s own Social Security moan? In chapter two of his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, Romney says reporters did not press the 2008 presidential candidates on how they would shore up or reform Social Security, which could be forced to trim benefits starting in the late 2030s if changes aren’t adopted. In chapter six, Romney says Social Security has grown exponentially since its inception in the mid-1930s. He adds that the program’s "trust fund" is a fiction. How so? Payroll taxes fund Social Security. Last year, for the first time since 1983, payouts exceeded receipts. So before last year, Social Security ran an annual surplus that was placed into a trust fund that earns interest. But Congress has routinely borrowed Social Security’s surplus to cover other government spending and left behind IOUs from the U.S. Treasury to cover future costs. "There is no fund" in the conventional sense, Romney writes. Romney’s reference to criminality comes next, in an analogy. "To put it in a nutshell, the American people have been effectively defrauded out of their Social Security," Romney writes, adding later: "Let’s look at what would happen if someone in the private sector did a similar thing. Suppose two grandparents created a trust fund, appointed a bank as trustee, and instructed the bank to invest the proceeds of the trust fund so as to provide for their grandchildren’s education. Suppose further that the bank used the proceeds for its own purposes, so that when the grandchildren turned 18, there was no money for them to go to college. What would happen to the bankers responsible for misusing the money? They would go to jail. But what has happened to the people responsible for the looming bankruptcy of Social Security? They keep returning to Congress every two years." For this article, we’re not judging the accuracy or adequacy of this analogy. Instead, to refresh, we’re drilling in on whether Perry accurately aired Romney’s characterization of Social Security. True, Romney mentions the private sector, as Perry claims. In the book, Romney then shifts into his analogy about a bank spending money from a trust fund that was set up to cover a future expense -- a grandchild’s college education. The bankers in charge of the trust fund in Romney’s example would face prosecution for, in effect, stealing the trust fund’s money. Romney says their behavior would be called criminal, again as Perry says. However, as Romney said in the debate, this reference to criminal behavior focuses on the trust fund’s "surplus" not being socked away and kept safe until needed, a diversion he blames on Congress. By our read, it’s not reasonable to interpret the analogy as saying that if the entire Social Security program were in the private sector, it would be called criminal. Perry’s claim echoes some of Romney's language, but ultimately overreaches.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-09-22T06:00:00	2011-09-12	['None']
pomt-03419	The immigration bill "has a specific provision that says that Secretary Napolitano does not have to build any fence if she chooses not to."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/27/jeff-sessions/sen-jeff-sessions-says-immigration-bill-has-provis/	Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., says he opposes an immigration bill working its way through the Senate because it offers "a mere promise of enforcement in the future." For example, the bill’s promised 700 miles of border fencing — it just isn’t going to happen, he argues. He told Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer on June 23, 2013, that even with a security-boosting amendment from Republican Sens. Bob Corker and John Hoeven, the bill "doesn’t fulfill its promises." "It has a specific provision that says that Secretary (Janet) Napolitano does not have to build any fence if she chooses not to," Sessions said. Senators are expected to vote on the amended bill this week. Does it give Napolitano a choice about how much fencing to build — including none? ‘No fewer than 700 miles’ The border fence is one of five so-called "triggers" that must be in place before most immigrants who get provisional status under the law are eligible for permanent residency. The bill requires a "Southern Border Fencing Strategy" to be submitted to Congress — and implemented — with certification from the Homeland Security secretary "that there is in place along the Southern Border no fewer than 700 miles of pedestrian fencing." There are right now 350 miles of such fencing. The law requires that to be doubled for provisional residents to change status. So: No fence, no path to citizenship. But Sessions’ press secretary, Jack Bonnikson, told us that there’s "an opt-out provision" that allows the secretary to avoid fence-building. It’s in a different section of the bill. Here’s what it says: "Notwithstanding paragraph (1), nothing in this subsection shall require the Secretary to install fencing, or infrastructure that directly results from the installation of such fencing, in a particular location along the Southern border, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain effective control over the Southern border at such location." The "notwithstanding" language trumps other language in the bill, Bonnikson said, giving Napolitano the freedom to decide that no fence is the best option, no matter what the trigger says. Now, we’re not attorneys. So we talked to a few. They said the "notwithstanding" language (which means "in spite of") isn’t nearly as broad as Bonnikson suggests. The provision mentions a particular paragraph and subsection of the bill, neither of which are anywhere near the trigger that requires 700 miles of fencing. Meanwhile, the provision very specifically addresses not the amount of fencing, but its location. Since the southern border is nearly 2,000 miles long, there will be plenty of choices to make. So, while we can’t say for certain a judge wouldn’t take liberties interpreting the language of the legislation, on its face, what Sessions’ office calls an "opt-out" provision just offers the administration considerable choice about where to put fencing — not whether to build it. "This provision just gives DHS discretion not to build a fence at a particular location, not discretion to not build a fence at all," said Stephen Yale-Loer, an immigration attorney who teaches at Cornell Law. Sen. Corker offers the same explanation on his website. Meanwhile, at least one pro-immigrant group has withdrawn its support for the bill because of its focus on "militarization of the border." Our ruling Sessions said the immigration bill "has a specific provision that says that Secretary Napolitano does not have to build any fence if she chooses not to."

pomt-02425	The Redskins Training Camp deal "generated $40 million in new private investment in the city."	/virginia/statements/2014/mar/04/dwight-jones/mayor-jones-says-redskins-training-camp-deal-gener/	Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones says the development deal that brought the Washington Redskins’ summer training camp to the city has paid off in a big way. "The plan generated $40 million in new private investment in the city," he said in his Jan. 30 State of the City Address. We wondered whether Jones’ figure is correct. The deal, signed at the close of 2012, set up a series of agreements between the city, the Redskins and Bon Secours Richmond Health Systems involving three properties. The Redskins camp opened last summer on a 17-acre parcel on West Leigh Street that the city’s Economic Development Authority is leasing from the state. The city shelled out $10 million for construction of a two-story office building and practice fields. Bon Secours agreed to pay the city $3.2 million for the naming rights to the facility, and that’s why it’s officially called The Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center. The hospital system also is leasing the first floor of the new building for use as a men’s health center when the Redskins are not in their three-week training camp, a deal that could generate another $3.1 million for Richmond over six years. So Bon Secours will invest as much as $6.3 million in the training facility over the next six years. The city is hoping to generate more money by finding tenants for the vacant second floor of the building. In exchange for being the major sponsor of the Redskins camp, Bon Secours was given a 60-year lease to the city-owned Westhampton School site on Patterson Avenue to house its School of Nursing and School of Imaging. The final part of the deal calls for Bon Secours to expand Richmond Community Hospital in the city’s East End, which needs medical facilities. Jones’ claim that the plan has generated $40 million in private investment "is based on taxable improvements" from the development of the three properties, according to Tammy Hawley, the mayor’s press secretary. The figure comes from adding the projected construction prices for the improvements on each site: $10 million for the training camp; $24 million for development of the Westhampton School; and $8.5 million for the expansion of Richmond Community Hospital. That comes to a total of $42.5 million. Jones spoke in the past tense, as if the investments already have been made. But in fact, very little private money has been spent so far. Construction at the Westhampton School and Richmond Community Hospital has not begun. Both projects are in planning stages with no firm dates set for start or completion, according to Charlotte Perkins, performance management officer for Bon Secours. In addition, the contracts for these two projects can be voided. Bon Secours can pull out of the Richmond Community Hospital expansion if it is unable to acquire needed properties. It would have to pay a $2.5 million penalty to the city over 10 years. Bon Secours can withdraw from the Westhampton School project if it is unable to meet zoning requirements. As for the Redskins camp, the $10 million construction cost was paid by the city, not private investors. Jones, in his speech, said Richmond has largely recouped that money through selling naming rights and leasing office space in the building to Bon Secours. But by the end of March, the city is due to have received only about $1.82 million. According to contracts, Bon Secours will have paid seven months rent totaling $160,400 and made the first two of four annual installments of $831,250 for the naming rights. We’ll mention again that Bon Secours could be obligated to make as much as $6.3 million in total rent and naming rights payments to the city through the summer of 2019. Richmond is hoping to add to its take by leasing the vacant second floor of the building at the training site. The Redskins do not pay rent for use of the building and fields during their summer training. If the Westhampton School project pans out, the city will receive $5,000 in annual lease payments from Bon Secours over 60 years. That comes to a total of $300,000. In addition, the hospital system has agreed to pay the city $1 million over 10 years to help public schools. Our ruling Jones said the three-part development deal that brought the Redskins training camp to Richmond "generated $40 million in new private investment in the city." The mayor offered a solid estimate of the total construction costs. But he spoke in past tense, as if the money already has been spent. For the most part, it hasn’t. No start dates have been established for two of the projects totaling $32.5 million: Bon Secours’ expansion of Richmond Community Hospital and its redevelopment of Westhampton School. Important contractual conditions first must be fulfilled. The Redskins training facility, which opened last summer, was built with $10 million of city money. Richmond, at the end of March, will have recovered $1.82 million of that money through the sale of naming rights and the leasing of office space at the facility to Bon Secours. That number could grow to as much as $6.3 million over the next five years. No doubt, the three projects have the potential to generate $40 million in private investment. But the mayor is counting the checks before they’ve been written. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Dwight Jones	None	None	None	2014-03-04T12:33:11	2014-01-30	['None']
pomt-10353	Barack Obama has "reversed" on his commitment "to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/10/john-mccain/obama-shifts-emphasis-on-iraq-but-not-position/	The day before the Fourth of July weekend, Barack Obama talked about the likelihood that he will soon travel to Iraq and what it means for his foreign policy. "I've always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability. That assessment has not changed," he said. "And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground, I'm sure I'll have more information and will continue to refine my policies." The John McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee pounced on those comments, charging Obama with flip-flopping. "Since announcing his campaign in 2007, the central premise of Barack Obama's candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately," said Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman. "Today, Barack Obama reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter. He has now adopted John McCain's position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in Iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground." "There appears to be no issue that Barack Obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience," said Alex Conant, a spokesman for the national Republican Party. "Obama's Iraq problem undermines the central premise of his candidacy and shows him to be a typical politician." We reviewed Obama's statements on Iraq from the campaign to try to uncover whether he was back-tracking on earlier promises. Iraq was one of the most pressing issues of the Democratic primary, discussed and dissected during more than 20 debates. We found that Obama has made a few points about Iraq over and over again: that he opposed the war "from the start"; that U.S. troops should leave Iraq quickly and in an orderly fashion ("as careful getting out as we were careless getting in"); and that the U.S. should not have permanent bases inside Iraq. How quickly should troops leave? His campaign Web site says the following: "Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. Obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in Iraq. He will keep some troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats; if al Qaeda attempts to build a base within Iraq, he will keep troops in Iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al Qaeda." The McCain campaign and the RNC have pointed to the "16 months" statement as an indication that Obama favors a "precipitous withdrawal", presumably as early as the middle of 2010. (We checked that claim earlier here and found it Half True.) They also point to a March 2008 statement from Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe. "On Iraq, he has been very clear," Plouffe said in March 2008. "He offered a withdrawal plan well over a year ago. It's essential to his candidacy and a rock-solid commitment. ... It will be 16 months at the most where you can withdraw combat troops." Plouffe's statement appears to be the best evidence to support the McCain campaign's argument. Plouffe was responding to comments from former Obama adviser Samantha Power, who had said the 16-month timeframe was a "best-case scenario" that Obama wouldn't necessarily follow once he was in office. Power was forced to resign after calling Hillary Clinton a "monster." But does this mean a sixteen-month clock starts ticking the moment Obama enters office? We could not find a direct statement from Obama saying that, and found statements he made throughout the campaign that contradicted that. For example: • At a Democratic debate in Hanover, N.H. on Sept. 26, 2007, the late Tim Russert pressed Obama as to whether he would have all troops out by the end of his first term. "I think it's hard to project four years from now, and I think it would be irresponsible. We don't know what contingency will be out there," Obama said. "I will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy, protecting our civilians and making sure that we're carrying out counterterrorism activities there. I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out." • At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, Obama said, "As soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed." • At a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said, "Now, I will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics. Once I've given them a new mission, that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of Iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out, we will not have permanent bases there, once I've provided that mission, if they come to me and want to adjust tactics, then I will certainly take their recommendations into consideration; but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief." • On "Meet the Press" on May 4, 2008, Russert asked Obama what he would do if advisers thought "a quick withdrawal" from Iraq would result in genocide. Obama replied, "Of course, I would factor in the possibilities of genocide, and I factored it in when I said that I would begin a phased withdrawal. What we have talked about is a very deliberate and prudent approach to the withdrawal -- one to two brigades per month. At that pace, it would take about 16 months, assuming that George Bush is not going to lower troop levels before the next president takes office. We are talking about, potentially, two years away. At that point, we will have been in Iraq seven years. If we cannot get the Iraqis to stand up in seven years, we're not going to get them to stand up in 14 or 28 or 56 years." Taken in their entirety, Obama's comments reflect a philosophy of "about 16 months" for withdrawal. He also appears to be willing to take advice from commanders on the ground that might affect the general pace, but not the overall goal of withdrawal. Yet Obama has been artful in his rhetoric. His campaign has clearly emphasized "16 months" when speaking to anti-war audiences and " about 16 months" when answering questions from withdrawal skeptics. But Obama never urged a "precipitous" withdrawal; even a bill he offered in January 2007 that set a deadline for getting out of Iraq contained an exemption for national security. The Plouffe statement, however, stands out. Plouffe said the 16-month time frame was a "rock solid commitment." But it's the only statement we found that supports the idea of withdrawal with no allowances made for circumstances on the ground. After the McCain campaign attacked Obama as a flip-flopper, the candidate responded with another press conference the same day. "I intend to end this war," Obama said. "My first day in office I will bring the joint chiefs of staff in, and I will give them a new mission. And that is to end this war. Responsibly, deliberately, but decisively. And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month. And again, that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months' time." Weighing all these statements together, we find the McCain campaign is off-base in saying Obama has changed position. Obama repeatedly said facts on the ground could affect the tactical moves of an overall withdrawal. Obama's position was not an iron-clad withdrawal timeline in the first place. We find the McCain campaign's statement that Obama has reversed position to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-10T00:00:00	2008-07-03	['United_States', 'Iraq', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-14781	The Charleston, S.C., shooter "should have never been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/06/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-background-check-charleston-c/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defended her call for stricter gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Clinton’s Republican rivals have criticized her for pushing gun control following a terrorist attack. But lax firearms laws, Clinton said on ABC’s This Week, allow people on the no-fly list to purchase guns, just as they enabled Dylann Roof, accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church attack in June. "(Roof) should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough," Clinton said Dec. 6. "We should be able to approach both of these with some sense of, you know, unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting ahold of guns." Is Clinton right that this system didn’t catch the Charleston shooter in time? She omits some important details in her description, but it largely checks out. How Roof obtained a gun Under current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System (the rest of the states do their own background checks). If the check isn’t denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale. What happened in Roof’s case comes down to clerical errors. Here’s how FBI Director James Comey explained why Roof’s background check wasn’t finished in time to prevent his purchase of a .45-caliber Glock pistol. Roof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., a suburb of Columbia, on April 11. A West Virginia-based FBI examiner began vetting him the next business day, April 13, and found that Roof had been arrested for a felony drug charge March 1 (the charge was later corrected as a misdemeanor). Because the records didn’t show a conviction, the examiner couldn’t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof’s criminal history. Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county’s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information on Roof from the wrong county sheriff’s and prosecutor’s offices. The examiner then contacted the West Columbia police, who replied they had no records of Roof’s arrest. Had the database listed the correct police station (Columbia) or included the report in which Roof admitted to possessing drugs, things would have turned out different, according to Comey. "If a NICS examiner saw that, Roof would be denied permission to buy a gun. But the examiner never saw that," he said. When the three days were up on April 16, the case was still listed as "pending" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, on June 17, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. Clerical error or ‘Charleston loophole’ Both sides of the gun debate came to very different conclusions about this news. Clinton and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks, dubbing it the "Charleston loophole." Supporters of gun rights say the onus is actually on the FBI and its botched paperwork. Daniel Webster, the director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University, agrees with Clinton that the FBI would have been able to catch Roof’s conviction if it had more than three days to track down the details. "The follow-up investigation found that the FBI analyst doing the check was still in the process of tracking down the information on the case and hadn’t given up because of the clerical error," Webster said. CNN reported that FBI examiners officially denied Roof’s gun purchase application a week after the shooting, when he was already in custody. Usually when the FBI denies a gun purchase after the fact, the agency notifies the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which then retrieves the firearm. In 2014, the FBI denied approximately 1.1 percent, or 91,000, of would-be gun purchases within three days. Of the transactions that required more than three days to vet, the FBI referred 2,511 for retrieval. Back in 2000, the Government Accountability Office reported it took an average of 25 business days for the FBI to determine whether a gun purchase should have been denied. We could not find more recent data. Our ruling Clinton said the Charleston shooter "should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough." Dylann Roof admitted to a drug offense a few weeks before he tried to buy a gun, so the FBI said he should have been denied one. However, it wasn’t the three-day time limit by itself that undermined Roof’s background check. There were clerical errors in the FBI’s database that prevented the examiner from seeing Roof’s drug admission. Clinton’s characterization misses some important information about Roof’s case. We rate it Mostly True. Note to readers: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly said Roof "admitted to a felony drug offense" before attempting to buy a gun. That is not what the FBI news release said. The release said that a police report about his arrest included Roof's admission to possessing illegal drugs, which Comey said would have been enough to deny the sale of the handgun. The story has been updated to reflect that point.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-12-06T17:54:49	2015-12-06	['South_Carolina', 'Charleston,_South_Carolina']

pomt-00982	"92 million Americans aren't working."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-92-million-americans-arent-working/	The federal government may have announced a good jobs report just days earlier, but Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wasn’t impressed with the state of the American labor market. On the Feb. 8, 2015, edition of CNN’s State of the Union, host Dana Bash asked Cruz whether he would run for president. He responded: "I think we're facing enormous challenges in this country. The Obama economy has led to the lowest labor force participation since 1978. Ninety-two million Americans aren't working. Obamacare is a train wreck. We're seeing our constitutional rights under assault. And abroad the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy is an unmitigated disaster. Leading from behind doesn't work. We’ve previously checked a claim by Cruz that "we’ve got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978." We rated that Mostly True at the time, and it’s still an accurate claim today. But we wondered whether Cruz was right that "92 million Americans aren't working." So we took a closer look. In one sense, Cruz’s estimate is actually too low. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 249.7 million non-institutionalized civilians 16 years of age and older last month. Of those, 148.2 million were employed, leaving 101.7 million not employed. But neither Cruz’s 92 million figure nor the actual 101.7 million figure is especially meaningful -- because they lump in both the young and the old. Of the 101.7 million people who are not employed, 37.5 million are age 65 and over -- an age when Medicare kicks in and many Americans head into retirement. Another 11.9 million are between 16 and 19, meaning they’re either high-school-age or starting college. And another 8 million are age 20 to 24, when many are in college or graduate school. Combined, these groups account for 57.5 million Americans -- or more than three-fifths of the number Cruz cited. Could one quibble with our calculation? Sure -- one could exclude the 20 to 24 category since not everyone that age is college-bound. And improving senior health means that Americans can effectively work past 65. Still, we don’t see much justification for Cruz counting high-school-age kids (roughly 10 million) and Americans 75 and up (17.6 million). Even this far more restrictive definition leaves almost one-third of Cruz’s number questionable. Another point worth noting: Just because someone in the prime working-age range (25 to 64) isn’t working doesn’t mean that they are unemployed. They may be disabled, taking care of children full-time or have gone back to school. The actual number of officially unemployed Americans in January was a little under 9 million -- just one-tenth of the figure Cruz cited as "not working." Our ruling Cruz said that "92 million Americans aren't working." Once you strip out senior citizens and school-age Americans, the number is less than half that. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. UPDATED, Feb. 11, 2015: After this fact-check was published, Cruz’s office got back to PolitiFact with sourcing for the statistic. The statistic, they said, came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- Table A-1, for the total civilian, non-institutionalized population not in labor force, seasonally adjusted, for January 2015. The total for that month was 92.5 million. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said that Cruz was "relying on objective federal labor statistics" in making his statement. However, our fact-check didn’t question the veracity of the BLS statistics – only their relevance to Cruz’s point. We continue to believe the statistic includes Americans too young and too old to be expected to work, and we stand by our rating of Mostly False.

pomt-11348	"USPS loses $1.46 each Amazon package it delivers."	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/06/eric-bolling/usps-amazon-lose-146-every-package-delivers/	Conservative pundit Eric Bolling joined in on the Amazon-USPS firestorm President Donald Trump initiated recently, putting a price tag on the post office’s purported losses. "USPS loses $1.46 (on) each Amazon package it delivers," Bolling tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is the Postal Service losing $1.46 on each Amazon parcel? No. This number is a suggestion from a detailed report of how much more the post office should charge to increase its revenues. It doesn't represent losses. For the record, Bolling acknowledged that Amazon wasn’t even the cause of the Postal Service’s losses. "Without Amazon, @usps would owe us a ton more $$ than they already do," Bolling tweeted. Bolling pointed us to Wall Street Journal and Washington Examiner op-eds that cited the same April 2017 Citigroup study as the source of the $1.46 number. The study focused on how to make the post office break even, given they have lost $65.1 billion since 2007. The Postal Service reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for 2017. Citigroup acknowledges much of the red ink is due to a 2006 law requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund future retirees’ health benefits. Citigroup came up with two responses. One was increasing competitive package deliveries; the other was increasing prices on them. (Competitive packages are those USPS delivers for private companies like Amazon.) They focused only on competitive products, which they determined to be the Postal Service’s main hope for solvency. The report recommended the post office increase prices on package deliveries by $1.46, and that’s where Bolling got his number. That number was arrived at using theoretical pricing models, given that shipping rates for competitive products are kept private between the Postal Service and the company. Another issue is that the price increase was suggested for all of the Post Office’s competitive products clients, not just Amazon. That’s crucial, as the rates the Post Office charges private companies varies depending on the deal each strikes. The Postal Regulatory Commission, which audits these deals, currently mandates that at least 5.5 percent of the Postal Service’s overhead costs be covered by competitive products. USPS factors in overhead costs when charging companies for shipping their packages. We don’t know the actual cost USPS passes onto its individual clients, because those contracts are kept under wraps. UPS, a primary competitor, believes the Postal Service should be charging higher rates, according to a complaint UPS filed to the Postal Regulatory Commission. UPS said the overhead costs were outdated, as they were determined in 2006, when packages comprised a much smaller fraction of the Postal Service’s operations. UPS instead suggested the Postal Service charge a minimum of 24.6 percent to calculate overhead costs. This represents the average share of competitive products in the Postal Service revenue in 2012-14. The Postal Regulatory Commission didn’t see the merit in that calculation in response to UPS. It did, however, propose a higher floor rate that is under review. "Such an approach, which would allocate institutional costs to products based on those products’ relative shares of total attributable costs, has long been rejected by the Commission and by economists in general as being inherently arbitrary," the report reads. In order to arrive at the $1.46 price tag, Citigroup subtracted the price they assumed USPS was charging clients if they only had to cover 5.5 percent of overhead costs from the price USPS would have to charge clients if they had to cover 24.6 percent overhead costs. But 5.5 percent is a floor, not a ceiling rate. We don’t know how much USPS charges clients, just how much the law mandates they charge at a minimum. In fact, in 2017, competitive products covered 22.9 percent of the Postal Service’s overhead costs. That’s after accounting for their individual attributable costs (which are the ones the postal commission determines wouldn’t exist if USPS didn’t have a deal with that company). Citi had suggested 24.6 percent. Competitive prices, then, would only have to increase by 10 cents to contribute the 24.6 percent target in fiscal year 2017. Our ruling Bolling said "USPS loses $1.46 each Amazon package it delivers." The $1.46 figure comes from an April 2017 Citigroup analysis, but Bolling cites the figure inaccurately. The number is what Citigroup suggested the post office charge if it wanted to make more money by using a new pricing formula. The report made no suggestion that the post office was losing that much money on current, actual deliveries. Bolling’s statement is not accurate and we rate it False.

Wolf's comments from that interview are now included in this fact-check and we have changed the rating to True based on the new information. * * * There’s a theory going around that the federal government is using a massive military training exercise as a foundation to take over parts of the West, including Texas. The military has said, no, that’s not the case. But the air remained sufficiently thick with rumors on May 10, 2015, that ABC’s This Week took a few minutes to discuss the matter. Pundits Greta Van Susteren, Rich Lowry, Gwen Ifill and Jamelle Bouie all seemed to brush the talk off as conspiratorial hogwash. "Federal control of Texas is something that was pretty much established in the mid-19th century by President (James) Polk," Lowry said. "So, the idea that the federal government is going to go in and retake over Texas is just nonsense." (Polk was president when Texas became a state.) Lowry wanted to make clear, however, that conspiracies are not only for conservatives. "We've always seen distrust, and it's on both sides," Lowry said. "I don't see liberals worried about military takeovers," said Bouie, a writer for Slate. "Well, look at the left," Lowry said. "They have the anti-vaxxers. They have unscientific fears about nuclear power and GMO foods. During the Bush administration, you actually had a prominent liberal write a book about how Bush was preparing for a fascist takeover of this country." We were curious about Lowry’s point, and honed in on the claim about George W. Bush. Lowry said what he had in mind was a 2007 book by Naomi Wolf called The End of America: Letter of warning to a young patriot. Wolf, a feminist and activist, cast the book as a dire warning about the trajectory of the country. In it, Wolf lists 10 changes that she said typically mark a country’s descent into totalitarianism. Her case studies included the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, China, Italy under Benito Mussolini, and Chile under Augusto Pinochet. "There are 10 steps that would-be dictators always take when they are seeking to close down an open society," Wolf said in a 2007 interview on Comedy Central’s Colbert Report. Wolf’s thesis, which she also shared in a newspaper opinion piece titled "Fascist America in 10 easy steps," is that the United States had taken the 10 steps during the George W. Bush administration. "It is my argument that, beneath our very noses, George Bush and his administration are using time-tested tactics to close down an open society," Wolf wrote. Here’s Wolf’s list, and how Wolf alleges that Bush aligned himself with despots. (We’re simply re-posting her arguments, which obviously are controversial.) 1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy: The war on terror with its warning of a global caliphate that threatens civilization. 2. Create a gulag: The Guantanamo Bay prison and the CIA "black-sites." 3. Develop a thug caste: Private security guards, such as the Blackwater contractors. 4. Set up an internal surveillance system: Government tracking of phone calls, emails and banking transactions, as reported in 2005 and 2006. 5. Harass citizens' groups: Government tracking of anti-war organizations and their activities. 6. Engage in arbitrary detention and release: An airport security list that flags people like Wolf for extra scrutiny. 7. Target key individuals: The outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame after her husband publicly challenged the Bush administration assertion that Iraq had acquired yellow cake uranium from Niger. 8. Control the press: The distribution of false information, such as the yellowcake uranium claim. 9. Dissent equals treason: Bush administration assertion of the power to label an American citizen as an "enemy combatant." 10. Suspend the rule of law: Increased presidential authority to deploy the National Guard. Wolf never actually claimed Bush had a plan to convert the nation into a totalitarian state in the book. Wolf argued that what she saw laid the groundwork for a fundamental loss of liberty. Wolf said "our experiment in democracy could be closed down by a process of erosion." However, Wolf was much more matter-of-fact in an October 2008 interview on KEXP 90.3 FM Seattle. Wolf was there to discuss her follow-up book, Give Me Liberty: A Handbook for American Revolutionaries. In the interview, Wolf warned that Bush may declare martial law if Congress failed to pass the 2008 financial bailout bill. In that scenario, Wolf mused that Bush would stop the 2008 election. "There is not going to be an election, as usual, if he can declare on Oct. 3 that he’s going to engage in martial law if people don’t do what he wants," Wolf said. "Why on Earth would he hand over the power to Barack Obama?" In another part of the interview, Wolf said a coup was already underway. "We have to wake up," Wolf said. "On Oct. 1, the First Brigade of the Third Infantry Division was deployed in the United States of America for the first time since 1807 when a bright line was placed preventing the military from policing American streets. A military brigade -- that's 3/4,000 soldiers -- has been brought in to police our streets." Wolf goes on to say that "the president now has an army." "The coup is here rather than looming," said Wolf, who went on to tell listeners she would be posting instructions on how to arrest the president on a website. Our ruling Lowry said that a leading liberal had written a book about how Bush was preparing for a fascist takeover of this country. The book Lowry cited does not allege a specific plot. Rather it uses events during the Bush administration and compares them to events that happened in the build-up of totalitarian regimes around the world. But in an interview in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, Wolf said a coup was underway and that Bush may declare martial law and prevent the 2008 election. Lowry’s claim rates True.

pomt-12455	"We have 5 percent of world population. 80 percent of opioids."	/missouri/statements/2017/may/10/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-cites-long-disproven-figure-opioid-use/	The state of opioid abuse in America has been deemed an epidemic. Overdose related deaths involving prescribed opioids have reached an all-time high, jumping from 19,000 in 2014 to 22,000 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Considering all opioids (not just prescribed ones), the figures get even worse: In 2015, 33,091 died from opioid related overdoses. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill has set her sights on curbing the issue, writing an op-ed in the Kansas City Star and dedicating a page of her website to facts and figures. One tweet in particular caught our eye: "We have 5% of world population. 80% of opioids." Such drastic numbers paint a dire picture for the state of opioid use and abuse in America. We wanted to fact-check her claim. What we found was that while America certainly consumes more opioids than any other country, the notion that we consume 80 percent of the global supply is greatly exaggerated. ‘One startling number’ Checking the first part of McCaskill’s claim was simple: The United States’ population is, according to the U.S. Census bureau, 324.8 million. The global population is 7.4 billion. That means the United States accounts for roughly 4.4 percent of the total world population. Checking the other half was more complicated. We reached out to McCaskill’s spokesperson, Drew Pusateri, and he supplied us with the source of the figure: a CNBC article published on April 27, 2016. And while the article provides the figures McCaskill cited, it is vague about where exactly the 80 percent figure comes from. Upon its first reference it is simply "one startling number from recent years," and later it is noted that the figure was "cited in various studies," including one by Express Scripts. The Express Scripts study, "A Nation In Pain," was released on Dec. 9, 2014. And while it does cite the 80 percent figure, it was not a study designed to measure American opioid consumption or global consumption. The reality, according to Christopher Jones, the director of the Division of Science Policy in the Department of Health and Human Services, is that America consumes 30.2 percent of globally distributed opioids. 30.2 percent According to data collected by the International Narcotics Control Board, the United States consumed roughly 30.2 percent of opioids in 2015. A Vienna-based "quasi-judicial expert body," the International Narcotics Control Board is tasked with tracking global opioid consumption, among a myriad of other things. The board releases three annual reports on narcotic drugs. "Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2017; Statistics for 2015" is the most recent publication, and includes data for the year 2015. Using the International Narcotics Control Board figures, Jones calculated that the United States consumed 173,332 kilograms of 574,693 kilograms of opioids consumed globally (382,131.6 of 1,266,981.2 pounds), or 30.2 percent. The drugs Jones included in the measurements are: codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, hydrocodone, morphine, oxycodone, pholcodine, dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylate, methadone, pethidine and tilidine. The figures also include the calculated consumption of buprenorphine. To be clear, Jones noted, such data is limited in several ways. The first is that it is government-reported data. The second is that many drugs are marketed in one country and not another; while used frequently in the United States, hydrocodone is virtually unused elsewhere. Additionally, some of the data include drugs that may have been exported from the country of manufacture and consumed in another country. Thus, data from INCB should be considered with great care when comparing consumption levels of narcotic drugs across countries. And finally, the board makes special note that comparing countries by the weight of opioids consumed is not recommended. Instead they suggest using a statistical measurement called "defined daily doses." Defined daily doses A defined daily dose is the quantity of a particular narcotic drug used in a day by one individual. It is not a recommended dosage, but rather it is a calculation created by the International Narcotics Control Board to statistically measure opioid use with a ratio that directly relates a country’s population to its consumption. For example, the daily dose of hydrocodone is 15 milligrams. So, if 60 milligrams are consumed, four defined daily doses would be recorded. The final results are calculated per million inhabitants. The United States consumed the most using this measure from 2013 to 2015: 47,580 doses of narcotic drugs were consumed per day per million people. Canada comes in second with 34,444 defined doses consumed per day, and Germany in third with 30,796. Using such a measurement, it is easy to see that consumption in America, while noticeably higher than in similarly developed countries, is not as astronomical as McCaskill’s cited figure makes it appear. ‘A life of its own’ Jones said it’s common for people to cite the 80 percent figure that McCaskill did, despite its inaccuracy. "I would say it is a commonly quoted statistic...people across a variety of disciplines, who even are somewhat expert on the topic, have repeated that statistic," he said. Jones said he believes the number originated as the percentage of oxycodone that America consumes compared to the world. From there, he said, the figure has "taken a life of its own. It’s now a ‘fact’ because it’s been repeated so many times." But it’s not the full picture. Because while America does consume over 75 percent of oxycodone, and 99 percent of hydrocodone, it doesn’t consume even half of all opioids globally, according to the International Narcotics Control Board data. Which, in part, according to Jones, has to do with marketing. Oxycodone and hydrocodone are marketed in America. Similar opioids are more prevalent elsewhere. Drug control systems Despite conflated numbers, experts agree there is a problem. Martha Maurer, a policy program manager and researcher at the Pain and Policy Studies Group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed that opioid abuse in the United States was an epidemic. But part of the solution, she said, was continuing to figure out how to view the problem. "It’s clear that there has been a lot of harm associated with overdose and abuse," Maurer said, "but it goes back to the question of where (abused) medication is coming from, which we just don’t know." Something worth noting, Maurer said, was that when you look at the milligram-per-person statistics, "some countries, including Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland, have opioid-consumption levels comparable to that in the US, but they are not having the same problems with harms caused by overdose. Their drug-control systems ensure a balanced approach to opioid access." For Jones, it’s about finding the right balance. "From a policy perspective, we’re trying to ensure that opioids are available when they are needed, but that they are being used as a part of comprehensive evidence-based pain care," he said, "not that we’re relying on them just because they’re the easiest thing to prescribe, or there are other external pressures to prescribe them." Our ruling In setting out to combat America’s opioid epidemic by holding pharmaceutical companies accountable, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said that with just 5 percent of the population, the United States consumes "80 percent of opioids." McCaskill’s figure, widely cited as it is, is inaccurate. It presents a narrow view of opioid consumption globally, where some opioids are marketed in select countries, but not others. It also discounts using defined daily doses, which provide a far more accurate representation of consumption when comparing nations. So, while the United States is clearly the largest consumer of opioids, it, at most, accounts for roughly 30 percent of global consumption. We rate McCaskill’s claim False.

pomt-04345	"As governor, I cut $5 billion in spending."	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/24/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-he-cut-5-billion-spending-governor/	Democrat Tim Kaine says he knows how to cut budgets, and that will be helpful if he’s elected to the U.S. Senate this fall. "As governor, I cut $5 billion in spending," Kaine says in opening words of a TV commercial that began airing Oct. 8. That same day, Kaine boasted of his budget prowess in his opening comments of a debate with Republican George Allen. "I was the governor that drew a tough, tough straw," he said. "I was governor during the worst recession since the 1930s and I had to cut $5 billion from the state budget." Did Kaine really cut state spending by $5 billion? We took a look. Kaine says the reductions were made in the general fund, the portion of the state budget that pays for schools, health programs and public safety. It is largely funded by income taxes and sales taxes. When Kaine took office in January 2006, he inherited a general fund budget of $15.1 billion for the fiscal year that started July 1, 2005. The economy was healthy at the start of his term and the general fund for the budget year that started in July 2007 was pegged at $17 billion. But trouble began that October when the nation began sliding into recession. Kaine announced there was a $300 million shortfall in tax revenues needed to pay for general fund programs and took steps to balance the budget, as required by law. By the time he left office in January 2010, Kaine and the General Assembly had filled in cumulative budget holes totaling about $7.28 billion, according state documents from the final three years of his administration. About 85 percent of the shortfall was caused by dwindling tax receipts; the rest was caused by increased expenses, mainly in providing Medicaid. Kaine and the General Assembly closed the gap by drawing on emergency funds, transferring state funds, using bookkeeping techniques and cutting programs. There’s no single document that lists each action Kaine and legislators took to balance the general fund. But a solid summary can be constructed by piecing together figures contained in a variety of reports issued by the General Assembly’s money committees, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission and the Kaine administration. Actions approved during Kaine’s term How did Kaine and the General Assembly balance the $7.34 billion in general fund shortfalls? For starters, they made about $4.03 billion in budget adjustments that did not require cuts in spending. *They used $1.5 billion in federal stimulus money to pay for programs. *They withdrew $895 million in emergency reserves from the state’s Rainy Day Fund. *They found $525 million in short-term savings by switching the financing on some construction projects from cash to bonds. *They wiped $240 million off the books by rescinding a 2 percent raise for state employees and teachers before it went into effect in 2008. *They transferred $244 million into the general fund from other state accounts. *They collected $234 million in unspent money in state accounts at the end of budget years. *They gained $171 million by changing tax and fee policies. *They saved $133 million by delaying the reimbursement of Medicaid providers. *They saved $93 million by changing business practices, such as delaying purchases. As we noted, these steps erased about $4.03 billion of the shortfall without imposing spending cuts. That leaves about a $3.31 billion portion of the shortfall that was eliminated with cuts to general fund programs. So how does Kaine get to $5 billion in cuts? Kaine’s farewell budget During the final weeks of his term in late 2009, Kaine confronted an additional $4.2 billion shortfall facing the state for the fiscal year starting the following July 1. On Dec. 18, 2009, Kaine proposed an outgoing budget with steps to balance the future shortfall. He called for a $1.9 billion tax hike and $2.3 billion in other budget-balancing steps. Kaine left office four weeks later, before the General Assembly took up his proposals. Lawmakers eventually rejected the tax hike. Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for Kaine, said the General Assembly embraced the rest of Kaine’s plan and the campaign adds its entire $2.3 billion impact to Kaine’s tally of cuts -- pushing him well above a $5 billion total. But a different picture emerges from documents issued by the General Assembly’s money committees in January and June of 2010. They show that the $2.3 billion portion of Kaine’s plan included $660 million in adjustments that did not require general fund cuts; half it coming from an additional draw on federal stimulus funds and half coming from increased fees and transfers from other state accounts. That leaves us with about $1.64 billion in spending cuts proposed by Kaine and, of them, the General Assembly adopted about $1.33 billion worth. Our rating Kaine said, "As governor, I cut $5 billion in spending." As governor, Kaine approved about $3.31 billion in general fund spending cuts. After he left office, the General Assembly adopted additional budget cuts recommended by Kaine totaling about $1.33 billion. If we count everything, we come to about $4.64 billion. Should Kaine receive some credit for cuts that he recommended but were enacted after he left office? We think so. But the actual spending cuts still fall short of $5 billion. We rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2012-10-24T12:00:00	2012-10-08	['None']
pomt-11104	Says most of Austin’s biggest parks have recycling though as "many as 293 out of 300" Austin city "parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park."	/texas/statements/2018/jun/08/texas-campaign-environment/most-austin-city-parks-lack-recycling-zilker-park-/	Despite’s Austin’s "zero-waste" commitment, an advocacy group says that nearly every city park lacks recycling. We wondered about that declaration by the Texas Campaign for the Environment, which describes itself as the state’s largest environmental group organizing support through door-to-door canvassing. An April 2018 handout from the group notes that the city adopted a zero-waste commitment in 2011 requiring businesses and landlords to provide recycling. The city has a goal of reducing trash sent to landfills by 90 percent by 2040. "Unfortunately," the TCE handout says, the "zero-waste" requirement "does not apply to city government operations" and parks rank among big missed opportunities. "As many as 293 out of 300 parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park," the handout says. There’s also good news, the handout says, in that the city has launched recycling in every recreation and cultural center and in most of Austin’s biggest parks. Still, 293 of 300 parks, including nearly every neighborhood park, have no recycling? By email, Andrew Dobbs, the group’s Central Texas program director, said he based his statement on an April 2018 city staff presentation to Austin’s Parks and Recreation Board. A slide in the presentation says the city has 300 parks. Two subsequent slides say a pilot program has introduced recycling to Zilker, Town Lake, Walnut Creek, Bull Creek and Ramsay parks plus Walsh Boat Landing. Other slides say recycling also has been added to more than five city swimming pools, five of six city golf courses and two softball complexes. Dobbs told us the campaign knows of one other park with recycling bins thanks to a neighborhood association. The group’s handout, Dobbs said, says "as many as 293 out of 300" parks have no recycling "because we aren’t 100% certain if other parks might have recycling added on an ad hoc basis." Records show Austin’s Parks and Recreation Department made the recycling presentation to two city boards. By phone, we separately confirmed TCE’s count of parks without recycling from Charles Vaclavik, a parks department official, who told us that plans are in motion next to expand recycling mostly along the south side of Lady Bird Lake through Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Park. Vaclavik said Austin’s parks-with-recycling count would be higher if the department had started its pilot recycling program in 2017 by concentrating on small neighborhood parks rather than installing recycling bins in large "metropolitan" parks the city’s jewel, 351-acre Zilker Park. "We concentrated (instead) on the activity centers that have the most people," Vaclavik said, seeking a "bigger bang for the buck." To date, he said, the recycling pilot has diverted about 35 percent of materials previously destined to move from trash cans to a landfill. Another factor: The city has yet to budget for recycling in its parks. Liana Kallivoka, the department’s assistant director, told the city’s Zero Waste Advisory Commission at its April 11, 2018, meeting that department officials were drafting a request for $250,000 in recycling-specific funding in the next city budget. If approved by the Austin City Council, Kallivoka said, the money would fund a program coordinator and hundreds of pairs of waste-recycling receptacles with tops, which run $1,100 each, to follow on 150 pairs already installed in park facilities and outdoors. Shelley Parks, a city spokeswoman, told us by phone that the cost of the installed bins was covered largely by donors including the Austin Parks Foundation, the Trail Foundation, neighborhood associations and the office of City Council Member Alison Alter, who represents District 10. Generally, Kallivoka told the commission, the department’s goal is to extend recycling to all parks and facilities in three phases wrapping up with the addition of recycling to neighborhood parks. Commission members approved a resolution calling for the city to create a Parks & Recreation Recycling Task Force. The resolution says, in part, that "approximately 4 of 300 City of Austin parks and 14 of 51 City of Austin aquatic facilities currently provide recycling opportunities." Austin’s Parks and Recreation Board voted to urge creation of the same task force at its April 24, 2018, meeting. Dobbs also spoke to the commission, saying: "The good news is that we’re at a point where everybody wants to do this." Our ruling TCE’s handout says that most of Austin’s biggest parks have recycling though as "many as 293 out of 300" Austin city "parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park." City figures support this analysis. The city hasn’t funded a parks recycling program. We rate the statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-14302	North Carolina spent "almost as much as it spends on government rape crisis programs in a year" to convene a special session for HB2.	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/01/lgbt-progress/lgbt-group-says-nc-spent-much-hb2-special-session-/	The North Carolina General Assembly convened a special session last week and passed a sweeping bill that prohibits schools from letting transgender students use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. It also prohibits cities and counties from raising the minimum wage or passing local anti-discrimination laws. The bill was supported by every Republican member of the N.C. House and Senate, as well as 11 House Democrats. Some critics cried foul that it took away discrimination protections from the LGBT community. Others, including the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, criticized the GOP for calling a special session at an extra cost to taxpayers. When the legislature is in session it costs the state approximately $42,000 a day, on average. The LGBT Progress branch of the Center for American Progress compared that figure unfavorably to state spending that helps rape victims. A few minutes after the bill passed, the group tweeted: "NC spent $42K today to ban trans ppl from bathrooms. That’s almost as much as it spends on government rape crisis programs in a year." The tweet’s premise itself is slightly misleading, perhaps due to the forced brevity in Twitter’s 140-character limit. North Carolina did not ban transgender people from bathrooms. It banned them from the bathroom of the gender they identify as. They may still use whichever bathroom corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. But let’s look at the second part of the tweet. Did North Carolina really just spend nearly as much meeting to overturn the Charlotte ordinance – citing fears over sexual assault as a major motivation – as it spends in a year to help victims of rape? Yes and no. The state spends about $45,000 a year on government-run rape crisis program. That’s close to the $42,000 estimated price tag for the special session. But the state also spends another $2.8 million annually on funds that get distributed to the charities that run the vast majority of rape crisis centers throughout the state. But the tweet did specify government rape crisis programs. Sarah McBride, the campaigns and communications manager for the think tank’s LGBT branch, said it was carefully worded that way. "The government rape crisis program appropriations was $44,678 in the NC certified 2015-2016 budget and the same in the 2016-2017 budget," she wrote in an email, providing a budget document as proof. "Note that the spending for NGO rape crisis programs is much higher, but that the tweet specified "government programs." NGO means non-government-organization – in this case, charities like the North Carolina Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which maintains more than 100 rape crisis centers and emergency hotlines for victims all over the state. In addition to donations, these NGOs also rely on some government funding. In recent years, that support has equated to $2.8 million – in addition to the nearly $45,000 that the state spends on government-run rape crisis initiatives. We appreciate McBride’s transparency. But the average person reading that tweet isn’t going to be familiar with the government-versus-NGO breakdown of rape services in North Carolina, which makes it fairly misleading. In fact, even a spokesman for the N.C. Department of Administration – the agency that distributes the state’s $2.8 million rape crisis budget – said he had no idea what the tweet was referring to. Our ruling LGBT Progress said North Carolina spent "almost as much as it spends on government rape crisis programs in a year" to convene a special session for HB2. While that’s technically not wrong, due to careful wording, it’s highly misleading. The vast majority of government spending to help aid victims goes to local charities, not government rape crisis programs, which is less than 2 percent of annual spending on assistance to rape victims. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	LGBT Progress	None	None	None	2016-04-01T19:08:38	2016-03-23	['None']

pomt-13626	Says President Bill Clinton did not sign NAFTA.	/punditfact/statements/2016/aug/11/nowthis/nowthis-news-site-says-donald-trump-wrong-and-bill/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement and pointed out that it was signed by President Bill Clinton, husband of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. NowThis, which spreads stories on social media, has accused Trump of getting it wrong — repeatedly. On Aug. 10, 2016, NowThis posted a video on Facebook headlined "Fact Check: Everything Donald J. Trump says about NAFTA is wrong," and on YouTube titled "Donald Trump Can't Get The Facts Right About NAFTA.". It shows five clips of Trump saying that Bill Clinton signed the treaty and follows four of them with these superimposed comments (in order): "False," "Nope," "Donald Trump Keeps Lying About the North American Free Trade Agreement," and "False: Bill Clinton Didn't Sign NAFTA." Others, such as the liberal site Anti-Republican Crusaders, shared the video as well. As of Thursday afternoon it had been viewed over 1.1 million times. We wondered how we could have repeatedly missed Trump being so wrong so often when it comes to the treaty. It turns out that Trump isn't wrong. Clinton signed the deal on Dec. 8, 1993. His speech that day is available in print form and on YouTube. However, it should be noted that Clinton isn't the only one responsible for the deal. It was inaugurated by his Republican predecessor, George H.W. Bush, who signed the initial version of the treaty in December 1992, before it was submitted to Congress for ratification and after he had lost to Clinton. But Clinton had campaigned for changes to the deal and sought side agreements requiring Mexico to enforce labor standards, improve working conditions and create better environmental safeguards. Negotiations were begun and those side deals were signed by Clinton in August 1993. After a tough political battle in which Clinton campaigned hard for the pact, the agreement was ratified by the House 234-200 and the Senate by 61-38. Republicans provided the margin of victory in both chambers, leading to Clinton's signature on the final version. When we contacted NowThis, editor Sarah Frank focused on the original signing by Bush. acknowledging that "Clinton signed the legislation into law after it was passed by Congress." "Trump is saying 'Clinton signed NAFTA' as though it was his deal. It was Bush's deal," Frank said in a followup email. Our ruling NowThis repeatedly says in its video that Trump's statements accusing Clinton of signing NAFTA are "False: Bill Clinton didn't sign NAFTA." It's true that the George H.W. Bush administration first negotiated the deal and that Trump is ignoring that element. But Clinton got it modified, pushed hard for the final version, and signed it with enthusiasm once Congress ratified it. The statement is not accurate, and we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f3d8de22-bdfa-4558-a964-cd4c46f0ad04	None	NowThis	None	None	None	2016-08-11T17:50:36	2016-08-10	['Bill_Clinton', 'North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement']

pomt-13939	Says Kelly Ayotte "voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- (buyers) can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks."	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/jun/21/maggie-hassan/challenger-maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-a/	In the wake of a mass shooting in Orlando, lawmakers in Washington have refocused their efforts on federal gun laws. But on Monday the U.S. Senate shot down a number of firearm bills, designed to expand or strengthen background checks and prevent sales to people on terror watchlists. And now the issue is becoming a central line of attack against Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is seeking re-election in one of the most competitive races this year. The New Hampshire Democratic Party took the first swing, followed by Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is running for Ayotte’s senate seat. "Ayotte voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- meaning dangerous individuals, including suspected terrorists, can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks," Hassan’s campaign said in an email on Tuesday, June 21, 2016. We decided to take a look at Ayotte’s votes and see if she voted against expanded background checks, as Hassan said. The U.S. Senate took four votes June 20 on a variety of firearm proposals, all of which failed to earn the necessary 60 votes to progress. Hassan’s campaign pointed us to an amendment sponsored by U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Current law requires background checks only for purchases from federally licensed gun dealers. Murphy’s proposal would have expanded the checks to include sales at gun shows, over the internet and those between friends and family members. Ayotte joined Republican colleagues on a mostly partisan vote to defeat the measure 44-56, well short of the 60 votes needed to advance. "The Murphy legislation is very broad ... and I think that there are concerns about it," Ayotte said Monday, according to The Hill. "I’ve previously said that I think it’s important to fix the current system." Ayotte voted against a similar background check amendment in 2013, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and internet sales. Back then, Ayotte instead supported an amendment by Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, which would have increased the mental health records given to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and provided money for prosecuting background check violations. But it did not expand background checks to cover firearms sales at gun shows or over the Internet. It failed 52-48. On Monday, Grassley introduced a similar amendment, and Ayotte supported it, again. Like the amendment from three years earlier, it would have increased money for the background check system and further defined what it means to be "mentally competent" to buy a firearm, but did not expand background checks to cover any new firearms sales, including gun shows and internet sales. It resulted in a familiar outcome as three years ago: It failed 53-47. For the most part, Democrats favored the Murphy amendment, while Republicans supported Grassley. Ayotte backed the Grassley amendment because she said it improves on the current system. Ayotte’s campaign spokeswoman said Hassan’s claim is misleading. "The Murphy amendment, which was opposed by one of the Senate’s top Democrats, is a broad expansion of a flawed system, and does not require law enforcement notification when an individual who was on the terrorist watchlist in the past five years attempts to buy a firearm," spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in a statement. Ayotte did vote for two competing proposals Monday that sought to block the sale of firearms to suspected terrorists. One, proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, would let the attorney general stop anyone on the federal terrorist watch lists from buying a gun, according to the Washington Post. Another, put forward by Republican Sen. John Cornyn, would let the government delay a sale to known or suspected terrorists for 72 hours while it investigated. Neither proposal passed, failing to win the needed 60 votes. Ayotte had previously voted against the Feinstein amendment, but voted Monday in support. Our ruling Maggie Hassan said Kelly Ayotte "voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- (buyers) can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks." In 2013, Ayotte voted against the bi-partisan Manchin-Toomey amendment that sought to expand checks for firearms purchased online and at gun shows. On June 20, Ayotte voted against a Democrat-sponsored amendment that similarly sought to expand background checks. Both times, Ayotte instead voted for a different amendment that would have strengthened the current system, but did not expand background checks to cover firearms sales at gun shows or over the Internet, two things cited by Hassan. We rate the statement True.	None	Maggie Hassan	None	None	None	2016-06-21T19:06:08	2016-06-21	['None']
pomt-15024	About "3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually (legally) purchase those guns."	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/05/joe-scarborough/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-tiny-fraction-crimes-commit/	The public debate to the shooting in Oregon so far has followed a familiar script. Some observers focus on cracks in mental health services. Some highlight families who fail to keep weapons away from disturbed sons and fathers. Others talk about background checks and reining in the firepower available to private citizens. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, trained his sights on the underground market in guns. "Isn't it true that only like 3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually purchase those guns?" he asked a guest on his Oct. 2 show. "Isn't this a big trafficking problem, too?" Scarborough supports background checks, but his focus on black market guns caught our eye. We decided to dig into the stat that only a tiny fraction of violent crimes involve guns that were purchased on the up-and-up. From the data and experts we reached, we learned Scarborough might be correct, but the data don’t precisely confirm it. Before we review the data, we should note that Scarborough’s claim is a bit ambiguous. He might have meant that out of all violent crimes, 3 percent involve a legally purchased firearm. But it’s also possible that he was thinking that out of a smaller set of violent crimes -- those involving a firearm -- the firearm was purchased legally 3 percent of the time. (We reached out to Scarborough and did not hear back.) Philip Cook, a professor of economics and sociology at Duke University, has done some of the most recent and detailed research on where criminals get their guns. But note: His work begins with the criminals, not the crimes -- which was Scarborough’s approach. Cook knows of no study that takes the crime as the starting point. And for good reason. "The problem is that only a very small fraction of gun crimes result in the recovery of the weapon or in any other way allow us to determine how the gun was acquired by the person who committed the crime," Cook told us. On the other hand, if Scarborough had said that 3 percent of criminals who use guns get them legally, he would have come closer to the truth. There are still big issues with that, but he would have found some support in Cook’s work. The Chicago Crime Lab study Cook and colleagues Susan Parker and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago interviewed 99 inmates of the Cook County Jail in Chicago. They were looking for criminals who were likely to have used a gun or had ready access to one. The authors described the group of participants as "a convenience sample of gun-involved, criminally active men living in greater Chicago." "It is difficult to say how representative they are of the larger population with that description," they wrote. "For that reason, we do not place much emphasis on the statistical results, as opposed to the qualitative patterns that emerged from these data." That said, of the 70 inmates who had possessed a firearm, only 2, or 2.9 percent, had bought it at a gun store. The report found that percentage was in line with the findings of the Chicago Police Department when it traced weapons seized from suspected gang members. (For a glimpse into how guns move through a community, Cook's full article is good reading.) There are some important caveats however. First, Cook noted that it’s possible to buy a gun illegally from a gun store. You can use a fake ID or employ a straw purchaser (someone who can pass a background check who buys the weapon on your behalf). Furthermore, just because the rest of the people interviewed didn’t purchase a gun at a gun store doesn’t mean they acquired it illegally. "It’s possible to make a legal acquisition from another source – a gift from a family member, a purchase from a private seller, etc.," Cook said. "Whether transactions of that sort are legal depend on the details of the transaction and local regulations." Cook also cautioned that the numbers from the Chicago study might not apply across the country. The national data In 2004, the government conducted its periodic Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities. It found that among inmates who had a gun when they committed their crime (16 percent of all prisoners), about 11 percent had bought the firearm at a retail store, a pawn shop, a flea market or a gun show. Another 37 percent had gotten it from a friend or family member. About 40 percent said they got it illegally on the black market, from a drug dealer or by stealing it. But the same caveats apply. A retail purchase might not have been legal and a gift from a family member might not be illegal. A 1994 study by researchers James Wright and Peter Rossi came up with a larger percentage of potentially legal purchases. They surveyed prisoners in 10 states. About 21 percent said they acquired their weapons from a gun or other "customary retail outlets" as the researchers put it. About one out of four came through gray or black market sources. However, gun laws were looser when that data was collected. The Brady Bill and its background check provisions passed the year the study was published. Ultimately, there are holes in the data. But Cook said while 3 percent or 10 percent might not be the exact number of legally purchased firearms used by criminals, the fraction is in that ballpark. "I think it’s safe to say that a low percentage of criminal assaults and robberies are committed with guns that were acquired by legal purchase from a gun store," Cook said. Joseph Olson, a professor at Hamline University School of Law and former board member of the National Rifle Association, believes that the number of legally acquired firearms used by criminals is negligible. "Criminals don’t go through background checks because they know they wouldn't pass them," Olson said. Olson said with homicides, there are two key exceptions. Legal firearms are often found when the killings occur duing domestic violence or mass shootings. Our ruling Scarborough said that about "3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually (legally) purchase those guns." Recent studies that look at prisoners who had a gun when they committed a crime found that between 3 and 11 percent purchased the weapon at a store or gun show. But the studies only tell us where the guns came from, not whether they were acquired legally, and there are issues with using the data to reach the conclusion Scarborough did, experts told us. We rate this claim Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joe Scarborough	None	None	None	2015-10-05T11:55:18	2015-10-02	['None']
pomt-02668	Members of the military don’t "contribute toward their pension."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/12/paul-ryan/do-members-military-unlike-other-federal-employees/	House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has drawn some praise -- but also fire, especially from veterans -- for co-brokering a federal budget deal that includes smaller pension payments for younger military retirees. The two-year agreement reached by Ryan and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., became law in December 2013. To help reduce the deficit, pensions for those who retire from the military before age 62 won’t be as large. Those younger retirees will receive annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to their pensions that are 1 percent lower than the rate of inflation (full COLAs will continue to be given to military retirees who are over 62). In defending the move, Ryan made a claim about military pensions that we want to check. "Civilian public employees have a 401(k) with the match, a defined-benefit pension and health care. They don't have (pension) COLAs at all if they retire before the age of 62. And they do contribute some to their pensions, and now we're having (newly hired employees) contribute more," the Janesville Republican told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board Dec. 19, 2013. "The military doesn't contribute toward their pension. They don't have a paycheck – payroll deduction -- toward their pensions. And they do have a COLA before they're 62." With more public employees -- notably state and local government workers in Wisconsin -- contributing more toward the cost of their benefits, we wondered if Ryan was right. Do members of the military contribute nothing toward their pensions? Evolution of military pensions Military pensions have expanded in scope since the first national pension law was passed in 1776, in the early stages of the Revolutionary War. At that time, pensions were strictly for those "losing a limb in any engagement, or being so disabled in the service of the United States as to render him incapable of earning a livelihood." Over the next several decades, pensions were awarded to Revolutionary War veterans based on need and later they became full pay for life, regardless of need. In 1948, 20 years was established as the minimum requirement for voluntary retirement for the Army and Air Force, putting those services on par with the Navy. Since 1986, military pensions have been "inflation protected," with annual cost-of-living adjustments tied to the Consumer Price Index. The military retirement system now provides some $52 billion per year in pension payments to more than 2 million military retirees and their survivors. (By the way, pensions for civilian federal employees were created in 1920. Social Security was created in 1935.) At the individual level, members of the military are guaranteed a specific monthly pension payment after 20 or more years of service. However, it is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition: Those who serve at least 20 years are fully vested, but those who leave the military earlier usually receive no retirement benefits. Only 17 percent of those who serve in the military end up getting a retirement benefit, according to the Defense Business Board and the House Budget Committee. But, as Ryan indicated in his comments, military retirees begin receiving their monthly pension payments immediately, regardless of age. So, many begin drawing military pensions in their early to mid-40s, often while working in another career. Other public-sector employees, and those in the private sector, typically do not begin receiving an annuity until age 55, 60, or 65. Pension contributions So, what about contributions toward pensions? In other words, where does the money for the military retirement checks come from? A Congressional Budget Office report and a Department of Defense report cited by Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert say members of the military make no contribution toward their pensions. So does a report we found from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. And, Andrew Biggs, a public employee retirement expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told us the same. That contrasts with all other federal employees (including civilian employees in the military). They contribute a portion of their pay toward pensions; the rates mainly depend on when they were hired. Here’s a breakdown of pension contributions, according to data we collected from the Congressional Research Service, the federal Office of Personnel Management and the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, which advocates for pay and benefits for federal employees. Type of federal employee Percentage of pay contributed by employee Percentage of pay contributed by employer Military personnel 0 41.8 Civilian, hired before 1984* 7 19** Civilian, hired 1984-2012 0.8 11.9 Civilian, hired in 2013 3.1 9.6 Civilian, hired in 2014 4.4 9.6 *Generally do not pay into or receive Social Security; employees hired after 1984 pay 6.2% toward Social Security. **An aggregate figure. For most federal employees, the government contributes 12.7%; the employer and employee percentages are higher for law enforcement officers and certain other types of federal employees. Our rating Ryan said members of the military don’t "contribute toward their pension." Civilian federal employees contribute a portion of their pay toward their pensions, but members of the military don’t. We rate Ryan’s statement True.

pomt-13596	Kim Myers "voted repeatedly to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters."	/new-york/statements/2016/aug/16/claudia-tenney/myers-raised-taxes-dicks-moved-aiport/	Dick’s Sporting Goods announced in July that it will spend $100 million to build a distribution facility in Broome County. Still, Republican congressional candidate Claudia Tenney uses the company’s history in the area to attack her Democratic opponent, Kim Myers, whose father founded the retailer. The company grew for more than four decades in the area before relocating its headquarters to the Pittsburgh area in 1994. "After all, Myers is an Albany-style liberal politician who voted repeatedly to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters and jobs to Pennsylvania for a more favorable tax climate." This is Tenney’s second run for the 22nd Congressional District seat. Current U.S. Rep. Richard Hanna will leave office at the end of this term. It is Myers' first campaign for Congress. Did Myers vote to raise taxes in Broome County, but make millions off of tax savings when her family’s company relocated? Who’s Kim Myers? Kim Myers is the daughter of Richard "Dick" Stack, who founded Dick’s Sporting Goods in Binghamton in 1948. He was 18 years old at the time. Myers worked in the family business after college, but she left in 1987 - seven years before Dick's left Binghamton - to start a children’s clothing store. That small business no longer exists. She served 18 years on the Vestal Central School District board, eight years as president. In 2014, she won election to the Broome County Legislature. Voting on taxes She has voted on one county budget since her election to the legislature. In November 2015, Myers voted for a budget with a 1.88 percent tax levy increase. That was lower than the 2.21 percent increase Broome County Executive Debbie Preston proposed. She also voted to raise property taxes when she served on the Vestal School Board. That only affected residents in the school district, not Broome County overall. In New York State, it’s not unusual for school districts to increase taxes. The Vestal Central School District’s board one year approved an increase of less than 1 percent. Another year it approved a 3.9 percent increase. The tax levy decreased by 1 percent for the 2009 - 2010 school year. Moving to Pennsylvania Seven years before Dick’s Sporting Goods moved its headquarters to Pennsylvania, Myers had left her direct role in the company to start her own business. Tenney claims that Dick’s saved enough money on taxes from the move for Myers to make millions. Tenney’s campaign could not provide us with any evidence to support that claim. Dick’s Sporting Goods did not reply to our questions about its move from Binghamton to the Pittsburgh area. Broome County Historian Gerald Smith found a print article in Binghamton’s newspaper, The Press & Sun Bulletin from 1994. No mention was made of tax savings in the article. Instead, the article cited the new location's proximity to Pittsburgh International Airport. An article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also cited the airport. A copy of the International Directory of Company Histories says Dick’s chose Pittsburgh "because of its access to airports and its national sports teams and as an area of extensive growth for the company, with a local population of outdoor enthusiasts." Tax incentives were not mentioned. The state would not give us a list of financial incentives given to the company. In our search, the first mention of incentives comes four years later, when Dick’s had considered moving out of the Pittsburgh area. Dick's was given a $1 million loan from Allegheny County, a $350,000 grant from the state and local school tax abatements for five years on a sliding scale. Our analysis of historical data from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue reveals the corporate tax rate in the early 1990s was higher in Pennsylvania than New York. The personal income tax rate in Pennsylvania was less than half of New York State’s rate, but at that point Myers was not directly involved in Dick’s Sporting Goods. Family company stock Myers did not own shares in Dick's Sporting Goods until the company went public in 2002, almost a decade after it relocated to Pennsylvania. A financial disclosure form Myers filed on May 29 with the House of Representatives shows she received between $100,000 and $1 million in dividends in 2016 from her share in the company, the same as in 2015. The form allows candidates to report their assets and income in ranges, not exact amounts. Our ruling Claudia Tenney said in July that Kim Myers voted "to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters and jobs to Pennsylvania." In her only budget vote since joining the Broome County Legislature, she supported a spending plan that raised the tax levy by under 2 percent. She also voted to increase property taxes while president of the Vestal School Board. Dick’s Sporting Goods relocated its headquarters to Pennsylvania 20 years before Myers’ election to the Broome County Legislature. We could not find any information to support Tenney’s claim that the company saved millions in taxes by moving to Pennsylvania. We rate this claim as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b6815b53-19e1-4b4c-88dd-5bd51c4d7346	None	Claudia Tenney	None	None	None	2016-08-16T21:50:00	2016-07-07	['None']
