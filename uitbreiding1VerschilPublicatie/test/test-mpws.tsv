mpws-00031	Marty Seifert has issued a challenge to Gov. Mark Dayton: refuse campaign contributions from lobbyists. Seifert says he’s never taken lobbyist contributions and wants Dayton, whom Seifert hopes to unseat this fall, to do the same. “Not accepting lobbyist contributions so far this election, and in all my previous elections, has made my campaign unique,” said Seifert in a press release. Seifert’s campaign finance reports don’t include lobbyist contributions. But that doesn’t mean he hasn’t taken them. 	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/06/poligraph-seifert-misleads-on-campaign-dollars/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Seifert misleads on campaign dollars	June 13, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Mark_Dayton']
mpws-00004	By now you have probably heard of Minnesota’s State Auditor. That’s because a change in the state auditor’s responsibilities was, at least for a few days, the main reason legislators hadn’t met yet for a special session. Because of a law that passed during the regular session, counties can outsource their audits to accounting firms instead of having the state auditor’s office do the work. Rep. Sarah Anderson, R- Plymouth, who sponsored the state government funding bill, which included the change, said the idea is to save counties money. State Auditor Rebecca Otto says the change will gut her office, and she plans to take the issue to court. 	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/06/poligraph-truth-elusive-in-state-auditor-claims/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Truth elusive in state auditor claims	June 12, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'State_auditor']
mpws-00005	Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., brought his populist message to Minneapolis last Sunday. His speech, which he gave to mark the start of his campaign here, focused largely on income inequality. PoliGraph looked at two statements Sanders made and found that, while Sanders tends toward hyperbole, his claims were mostly backed by facts. “In America today, we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major industrialized country on earth.” This line is standard fare in Sanders’ speeches, and not too long ago, FactCheck.org said it was an exaggeration. Since then, Sanders has fine-tuned his rhetoric a bit, saying America has the worst income and wealth inequality of any other industrialized nation on earth. By adding that qualifier, Sanders comes closer to the truth, but a lot depends on how you define industrialized countries. A Sanders spokesman pointed to a recent CNN article that said Israel and the U.S. are at the top of the list when it comes to income inequality. Other rankings put the U.S. in a similar position. According a report by the Credit Suisse Research, the U.S. is near the top of wealth inequality, too. But using a list of “advanced” or industrialized nations from the World Factbook, which is published by the Central intelligence Agency, the U.S. is outranked by Turkey and Hong Kong. Different sources use different standards for defining industrialized nations and income inequality, but Sanders is mostly correct in his statement: The U.S. is near the top of income and wealth inequality rankings when it comes to industrialized nations. “The truth is that unemployment in America is not 5.4 percent…. If you include those people who have given up looking for work, and those people who are working part time, real unemployment in America today is close to 11 percent.” Sanders is right that national unemployment is 5.4 percent. And Sanders is correct that the national unemployment rate doesn’t tell the whole story. For instance, the official unemployment rate doesn’t include people who are discouraged from looking for work, or who are marginally attached to the work force. Those people are captured in a separate statistic that also includes people who are working part-time but say they would like to be working more. Right now, this figure is roughly 11 percent. Politicians on the left and right have often pointed to the “U-6,” the technical term used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as the “real” unemployment rate. But the BLS routinely pushes back on that description in part because it does include people who are employed part time. Sanders is clearly using a higher number to make a political point. But what he does get right is the fact that the U.S. employment outlook is more complicated than just one number. And the U-6 is a legitimate figure sometimes used by politicians and economists to paint a broader picture of economy. 	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/06/poligraph-sanders-claims-about-inequality/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Sanders claims about inequality	June 5, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['United_States', 'Bernie_Sanders', 'Hong_Kong', 'Minneapolis', 'Israel', 'FactCheck.org', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'The_World_Factbook', 'Central_Intelligence_Agency', 'CNN']
mpws-00020	Earlier this week, Gov. Mark Dayton unveiled a cornerstone of his second-term agenda: more assistance for people sending their kids to day care. Dayton wants to expand an existing child care tax credit to cover 130,000 Minnesota families. To make his case, Dayton’s administration said in a press release that Minnesota’s child care costs are unusually expensive. “Right now in Minnesota, child care costs $901 per month, on average – totaling $10,812 per year just to provide quality care for one child. These high costs make Minnesota the 3rd-most expensive state in the nation for child care, based on the cost of infant care as a share of median income (15.5%).” There are a lot of rankings and a lot of ways to measure the cost of care, but any way you look at it, Minnesota is among the most expensive places in the country to send children to day care. 	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/01/poligraph-minnesotas-child-care-costs/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Minnesota’s child care costs	January 21, 2015, 2:07 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Mark_Dayton']
mpws-00041	Last week, the five Republican candidates competing to unseat Gov. Mark Dayton gathered for a joint press conference to criticize a proposed office building for the state’s senators. The group was unified in its belief that the project spells wasteful government spending. To underscore his opposition to the building, candidate Scott Honour pointed out that government is spending more on its citizens than ever before. “Our government spends two-and-half-times as much per citizen today as it did 30 years ago.”​ 	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/04/poligraph-honour-claim-about-govt-spending-correct/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Honour claim about gov’t spending correct	April 2, 2014, 2:30 PM	None	['Mark_Dayton', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
