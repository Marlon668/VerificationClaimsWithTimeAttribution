pomt-05531	"Our rainy day fund has gone from 89 cents to $240 million."	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/11/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-rainy-day-fund-has-grown-89-c/	Gov. John Kasich has had both setbacks and victories since taking office in January 2011, but a Fox News interview on April 2 gave him the chance to focus on success. "We were the number one job creator in America in February," he told anchor Neal Cavuto, "and we are now the number four job creator in the last year" -- claims that PolitiFact Ohio checked and rated as True. Kasich went on to tout the state's fiscal progress, saying, "Our rainy day fund has gone from 89 cents to $240 million." That's quite a swing. We wondered about the numbers, and especially about that bargain-basement figure of 89 cents. We asked Kasich's office for verification. Spokesman Rob Nichols referred us first to the Office of Budget and Management. Lest we search and not find, it promptly corrected us that it's not really the "Rainy Day Fund" but the less colorful "Budget Stabilization Fund." (Bob Dylan didn't write "Budget Stabilization Women #12 & 35.") OBM issued a statement last July saying that $246.9 million had been transferred from general revenue into the Budget Stabilization Fund, giving it a balance of $246.9 million. We did the arithmetic with the exact numbers and found the starting balance was $1.78. It's the opening balance for the current fiscal year, according to OBM's summary of fund activity. Kasich's number of 89 cents is half of that. The governor explained the difference near the end of his State of the State address in February: "When I came in," he said, "we had a rainy day fund that had 89 cents, and I'm told that budget guru over there, Brian Perera, sent an 89-cent check to double the amount of money we had in the rainy day fund." Perera is budget director of the Senate Republican caucus and an acknowledged expert on state finances. The same story about him appeared almost a year ago in the blog Ohio Budget Watch. It was true, he told us. The rainy day fund, which was drained by the recession after topping a billion dollars, was left in April 2011 with a balance of 89 cents. Seeing an opportunity few of us could resist, Perera wrote himself into state legend by writing a check to the state for 89 cents and doubling the fund. Kasich actually understated the fund’s latest balance, as of March 30, when he rounded it to $240 million. The 89 cents was accurate. His statement rates as True.

pomt-11742	"Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left more than 12 million people in Texas and Louisiana without homes."	/texas/statements/2017/dec/08/ryan-sitton/ryan-sitton-errantly-says-12-million-people-left-w/	A Texas official's guest editorial, shared on his campaign website, made us wonder about the whopping impact of Hurricane Harvey. Ryan Sitton, a Houston Republican on the Texas Railroad Commission, opened his Nov. 7, 2017, article in Drilling Contractor: "Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left more than 12 million people in Texas and Louisiana without homes. The devastation of this storm was more far-reaching than anyone imagined." That many people left homeless? That breaks out to an improbable 38 percent of the states’ combined populations. We sought Sitton’s elaboration; a state aide, Katie McKee, said by email that she’d typed the 12 million figure when she intended to write 1 million. McKee said that we’d brought the error to Sitton’s attention and a correction would be sought. Before we completed this fact-check, the version of his editorial on his campaign site had been amended to say 1 million; Drilling Contractor’s post still said 12 million. McKee told us Sitton intended to say the hurricane left more than 1 million people without homes, per a Sept. 8, 2017, CNN news story stating that after Harvey swirled over southeast Texas for several days, the "storm and subsequent flooding left more than 70 people dead and ravaged nearly 300 miles of the Texas coast and parts of Louisiana, flooding homes and displacing more than a million people." FEMA figures That story doesn’t say how CNN got to its million-plus figure. For our part, we fruitlessly hunted other news accounts estmating the number of Texas and Louisiana residents left homeless. Next, we turned to press releases issued by agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency starting after Harvey landed and wreaked havoc in late August and early September 2017. On Sept. 22, 2017, FEMA summed up Harvey’s punch: "More than 19 trillion gallons of rainwater fell on parts of Texas, causing widespread, catastrophic flooding. Nearly 80,000 homes had at least 18 inches of floodwater, 23,000 of those with more than 5 feet." That release further said: "Nearly 780,000 Texans evacuated their homes. In the days after the storm, more than 42,000 Texans were housed temporarily in 692 shelters. Local, state and federal first responders rescued 122,331 people and 5,234 pets." Also, the release said: "The volume of applications for disaster assistance was one of the highest in FEMA history. To date, 792,000 households have applied for assistance." (That figure was approaching 900,000 as of early December 2017.) So, per FEMA, nearly 780,000 Texas residents evacuated homes. Might that mean that many people were left without homes? A FEMA spokeswoman, Deanna Frazier, initially told us that the agency had "no data on those left homeless as a result of the hurricane." Frazier otherwise said the 792,000 figure in FEMA’s release reflected the number of Texas households that had filed requests by late September 2017 to receive grants for rental assistance, home repair, personal property replacement or direct housing (manufactured housing units or travel trailers). Estimating flood-hit homes Meantime, we noticed a Texas General Land Office press release, issued in December 2017, quoting the Texas land commissioner, George P. Bush, saying: "Hurricane Harvey affected nearly 50,000 square miles of Texas and damaged or destroyed more than a million homes." By email, Bush spokeswoman Brittany Eck attributed Bush’s "more than a million homes" to an earlier estimate of damaged or destroyed homes made by Gordon Wells, Ph.D., a research associate with the University of Texas Center for Space Research. Eck advised that when Harvey came ashore, Wells was "embedded with the GLO for hurricane response at the State Operations Center run by the Texas Department of Emergency Management." By phone, Wells told us he didn’t have an estimate of Texas residents left without homes by Harvey. But Wells said he estimated the extent of Harvey-caused flooding initially by geo-locating homes for which 338,829 flood insurance claims had been filed by early October 2017. Wells said that far more homes were flood-hit, however, considering that some 80-plus percent of homeowners and renters lacked flood coverage. "If the figure of 339,829 affected structures represents the insured population of homeowners," Wells wrote, "then the total number of impacted structures in the region would rise by a factor of five to nearly 1.7 million, including a large number with only minor water damage," Wells said. "This is higher than my original estimate of 1 to 1.1 million affected structures estimated from the insurance data available in early September." Wells cautioned too that he did not gauge the destructive results of the hurricane’s winds alone. "The distribution of the insurance claims, widespread floodwater detected in satellite and aerial imagery and the tendency for homeowners not to insure their property for flood damage lead me to estimate that water damage of some degree occurred to over one million properties in Texas as a result of Hurricane Harvey and perhaps as many as 1.7 million properties based on the best available data," Wells wrote. Fewer Louisiana residents left without homes? Sharon Karr, a Louisiana-based FEMA spokeswoman, said the federal government issued a major disaster declaration in October 2017 for 20 of the state’s Harvey-affected parishes--including six bordering Texas, a FEMA map shows. Nine of the parishes, Karr said by email, became eligible for aid to remove debris and repair roads and bridges, water control facilities, public buildings and utilities, parks and other recreational facilities. By phone, though, Karr said FEMA did not authorize "individual disaster assistance" awards that could include housing assistance. We separately noticed that Louisiana’s September 2017 request for the disaster declaration said 312 residences in the state were "impacted" by the hurricane, including 19 "destroyed" residences and 48 with "major damage." We also reached Mike Steele of the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, who said by phone the state doesn’t have a tracking system to tally displaced residents after a disaster. Karr and Steele each suggested we elicit detail about residents left without homes from preparedness officials in Calcasieu Parish. Our attempts to do so didn’t succeed. Our ruling Sitton wrote: "Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left more than 12 million people in Texas and Louisiana without homes." This figure, attributed to a typo, is improbably high. We also didn’t spot an authoritative alternate count though it seems reasonable to say--based on requests for help through FEMA and a state expert’s review rooted in flood insurance claims--that more than a million Texas residents sustained home damage. It looks to us like the hurricane left far fewer Louisianans without homes. We rate Sitton's published claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Today, it's 2.3-million, and 70 percent of them are black, African-American."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/30/mike-gravel/hes-off-way-off-on-whos-in-prison/	In a debate at the historically black college, Gravel said, "one of the areas that touches me the most and enrages me the most is our war on drugs that this country has been putting forth for the last generation." Then he put forth statistics. 2.3 million people in jail. 70 percent of them African-American. Yikes. He got the first one right, but that 70 percent figure? That's not just wrong, that's Pants-On-Fire wrong. The real figure, according to the June 2007 report of the Bureau of Justice Statistics that counts federal, state and local jails, is 40 percent. We're giving Gravel our harshest ruling because he botched this fact so badly and because it's such an important one to get right. It's something of a popular myth that most of the people in jail or prison are black, so to hear a presidential candidate make the false claim with such authority should not be overlooked. It also is worth noting that the 2.3 million figure that Gravel got right comes from the very same Bureau of Justice report that shows how wrong he was about the incarceration of black people. He should have kept reading.	None	Mike Gravel	None	None	None	2007-08-30T00:00:00	2007-06-28	['None']
pomt-05807	Says in the last 20 years, the French have not "stood by" the United States on foreign policy.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/22/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-you-cant-name-one-time-last-20-/	At a presidential campaign event in Georgetown, Ohio, on Feb. 17, 2012, Rick Santorum took a shot at France. President Barack Obama, Santorum said, "actually went to France a year or so ago and was with Nicolas Sarkozy and said that, 'Here I am with the French Prime Minister, our best ally in the world.' Now think about this. Name one time in the last 20 years that the French stood by us with anything. But in Barack Obama's eyes, that makes them our best ally, because they fought what was in the best interest of our country." We’ll overlook the fact that Santorum misstated Sarkozy’s title -- he’s France’s president. What we were wondering about is whether Santorum is right that it’s impossible to "name one time in the last 20 years that the French stood by us with anything." We’ll focus on his underlying point, that France has consistently gone its own way on foreign policy rather than standing by the United States. We emailed the Santorum campaign asking for support for the candidate's statement, but we received no response. It’s true that France pushed for a more multilateral approach to confronting Saddam Hussein's Iraq than the George W. Bush adminstration wanted. The run-up to the Iraq war in 2002 and 2003 represented a major break in the normally amicable U.S.-French relationship, epitomized by the House of Representatives’ decision to change the name of "french fries" to "freedom fries" in its cafeteria. But experts on United States and European diplomacy say it’s wrong to extrapolate from that one case. Overall, they agreed, Santorum’s claim is way off base. It’s "inaccurate and terribly misleading," said Richard Kuisel, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s BMW Center for German and European Studies and author of The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power (2011) and Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization (1993). Santorum’s "clock stopped in 2003," added Justin Vaïsse, senior fellow and director of research at the Center on the U.S. and Europe at the Brookings Institution. The role of Sarkozy A major reason for the improvement in the U.S.-French relationship has been the shift from former president Jacques Chirac to Sarkozy in 2007. "French-American military and diplomatic relations have been excellent under Sarkozy, who is an open admirer of American culture and society," said Jean-Philippe Mathy, a professor of French at the University of Illinois and author of French Resistance: The French-American Culture Wars (2000). When Sarkozy came to Washington to address a joint session of Congress in 2007, "he found himself met by a standing ovation and occasional whoops," the New York Times reported. "He at first appeared to revel in it, but as it extended to two minutes and longer, he began to appear almost embarrassed." "We may have differences, we may disagree on things, we may even have arguments, as in any family," Sarkozy said. "But in times of difficulty, in times of hardship, one stands true to one’s friends, one stands shoulder to shoulder with them, and one helps them." Sarkozy’s reception was a far cry from Chirac’s, when only about 100 members of Congress attended and "young pages were recruited to fill empty seats," the Times reported. Afghanistan The most prominent example of U.S.-French cooperation has been France’s contribution to the NATO forces in Afghanistan -- an operation instigated and heavily supported by the U.S. As of mid-January, France had 3,832 troops deployed, the fifth-largest number of any country after the U.S., the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. About 600 French troops have been training the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police Force, according to the Congressional Research Service. Since the start of operations, France has lost 82 servicemembers in Afghanistan. None other than George W. Bush praised France’s commitment to the Afghanistan operation in a speech on the six-month anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. "The power and vitality of our coalition have been proven in Afghanistan," Bush said. "More than half of the forces now assisting the heroic Afghan fighters, or providing security in Kabul, are from countries other than the United States. There are many examples of commitment: our good ally, France, has deployed nearly one-fourth of its navy to support Operation Enduring Freedom." Côte d’Ivoire, Libya and NATO Afghanistan is not the full extent of France’s military engagement alongside the United States. As of February 2011, France had nearly 9,000 troops in a variety of military operations across the globe, CRS wrote. In addition to Afghanistan, which is a NATO operation, France had almost 1,500 military personnel under U.N. auspices in Lebanon and at least 1,000 soldiers in Côte d’Ivoire. "France and the U.S. have been constantly on the same line regarding Côte d’Ivoire since 2002, even when the two countries were at odds over Iraq," Vaïsse said. "Last year, with the approval of Washington, France provided the troops and helicopters for the U.N. mission to oust Laurent Gbagbo and install Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected president." France also cooperated with the U.S. in Libya -- in fact, France, along with the U.K., pushed the U.S. to action there in the first place. More quietly, but significantly, Sarkozy in 2009 ended a self-imposed exile from NATO’s integrated command structure, an absence that dated back more than 40 years to French president Charles de Gaulle. "France is currently the fourth largest contributor of troops to alliance operations and a significant financial contributor to NATO," CRS wrote. "However, it had only very limited participation in the alliance’s military decision-making structures after then-President de Gaulle withdrew the country from NATO’s integrated command structure in 1966. Despite domestic opposition from critics who fear that the move could limit French military independence, the French parliament approved Sarkozy’s decision by a vote of 329-238 on March 17, 2009. U.S. officials have welcomed French reintegration as an important step toward improving alliance cohesion and strengthening the European role within NATO." During the past 20 years or so, France has also fought in cooperation with the United States in the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s and in Bosnia and Kosovo in the mid-1990s. Anti-terrorism and Iran sanctions France has been a strong partner with the U.S. on anti-terrorism intelligence and coordination, especially under Sarkozy, a former Interior Minister. "France has been the best ally in the war on terrorism, having had a head start on al-Qaida networks because of bombings in Paris in the 1990s that were linked with the Algerian civil war," Vaïsse said. Finally, France has sought stringent sanctions against Iran for its pursuit of nuclear technology. France has "played a central role in pushing for three rounds of U.N. sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program," CRS wrote, including "a key role in passing the latest and most stringent U.N. sanctions against Iran to date." Those sanctions, imposed in 2010, included a ban on new investment in Iranian oil and gas industries, a ban on insurance and re-insurance of Iranian government institutions and their affiliates; and extensive asset freezes of Iranian companies and individuals. In fact, France has sometimes sought more stringent sanctions against Iran than some of its allies. "On Iran sanctions, the French are actually on a tougher line than the Obama administration -- a hard line that would be closer to Republican candidates like Santorum and Romney, and Congress in general," Vaïsse said. Our ruling Santorum’s mockery of France’s willingness to advance U.S. foreign policy goals is misplaced. It’s true that the two allies broke over Iraq policy, but that’s the exception rather than the rule. On a wide range of issues over two decades -- from the Persian Gulf War to the Balkans to Afghanistan to counter-terrorism to Iran sanctions -- France has worked diplomatically with the U.S. and has repeatedly put its troops in harm’s way. We rate Santorum’s statement Pants on Fire.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-02-22T14:59:38	2012-02-17	['United_States', 'France']
pomt-08985	"We went from losing 3 million jobs in the last six months of the Bush Administration," adding almost 600,000 private sector jobs in the first six months of the year.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/15/joe-biden/joe-biden-lauds-obamas-job-creation-record/	On July 14, 2010, Vice President Joe Biden and Christina Romer, who chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, held a news conference to discuss the latest quarterly report on the impact of the economic stimulus bill enacted in February 2009. At one point, Biden said, "We went from losing 3 million jobs in the last six months of the Bush Administration and 3.6 million, or 3.7 million in the first six months we took office -- inheriting the policy we could not possibly turn around before we could pass anything -- to the first six months of this year, actually adding almost 600,000 private sector jobs." With Republicans simultaneously putting a less favorable spin on the administration's record of job creation, we thought it would be worth checking each side's facts. (We also analyze a statement by House Minority Leader John Boehner.) We'll take the claims in order. • Did the economy shed 3 million jobs during the last six months of President George W. Bush's administration? Actually, that understates the losses. In July 2008, the general employment level was 137,075,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2009, it was 133,549,000 -- a decline of about 3.5 million jobs. • Did the economy shed 3.6 million or 3.7 million jobs in the first six months under Obama? That modestly overstates the losses. In January 2009, the general employment level was 133,549,000. In July 2009, it was 130,294,000. That's a decline of 3.26 million jobs. • Did the economy add almost 600,000 private sector jobs during the first six months of this year? Very, very close. In December 2009, the number of private-sector jobs stood at 107,107,000. By June 2010, the number was 107,700,000. That's a difference of 593,000 jobs -- "almost 600,000" in our book. In all, Biden's numbers understated the losses under Bush and overstated the losses under Obama, but both of these errors work against the administration's own interests. And in the third case, Biden's number easily qualifies as "almost 600,000." All in all, we rate Biden's statement Mostly True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2010-07-15T17:23:11	2010-07-14	['None']
pomt-02319	"Nine out of the 10 poorest states are Red states."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/28/occupy-democrats/pro-democrat-group-says-9-10-poorest-states-are-re/	Editor's note: On Jan. 12, 2014, we rated this statement as True. We decided to re-rate our item after considering an additional poverty ranking that incorporates factors such as housing costs from state to state. The original item can be found here. The partisan blogosphere is filled with arguments over whether liberal or conservative policies are better for states. No matter what is proposed -- cutting the sales tax, raising the minimum wage, etc. -- someone can always come up with a state to cite as an example of why it's a good (or bad) idea. But we were struck by this claim posted by the pro-Democrat group Occupy Democrats on Facebook: "If Republican economic policies are so great for America, how come 9 out of the 10 poorest states are Red states?" We're not going to rule on the cause-and-effect question posed by the posting. Yet because Red states have a reputation for being more business-friendly, and because many argue that pro-business policies lead to better lives for everyone, we wondered whether the Occupy Democrats' claim was correct. When we emailed Occupy Democrats, founder Omar Rivero sent us links to several sources including a sortable Wikipedia table based on the 2010 U.S. Census, along with more recent data from the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. We also did our own search of the U.S. Census database. We’ll start with the standard definition of a Red state. At PolitiFact Rhode Island, we recognize that whether a state is Red or Blue can be a matter for debate. Our state is considered to be among the bluest of the Blue, yet it has had Democratic governors in only 20 of the last 50 years. Nonetheless, the color is typically defined by how a state votes in the presidential elections, so we're going to classify states by how they voted in the 2012 Obama-Romney race. It should be noted that there are different ways to measure poverty. Occupy Democrats says its claim is based on per-person income. We looked at that, along with median household income and median family income. By all three measures, 9 out of the 10 poorest states voted Republican in the last presidential election. (In fact, they voted Red in the last four elections.) According to the latest Census data, 9 of the 10 states with the lowest per-person income levels were Red: Mississippi, Arkansas, Idaho, West Virginia, Kentucky, Utah, Alabama, South Carolina and Oklahoma. The Census data also show that 9 of the 10 states with the lowest median household income were Red: Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma. And 9 of the 10 states with the lowest median family income were Red: Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Louisiana and South Carolina. The only Blue state on each list: New Mexico. By the way, 9 of the 10 states with the highest per-person income voted Blue in the 2012 presidential race: Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Virginia and Washington. The only Red state on the list: Alaska. It could also be argued that state-by-state costs of living should be taken into account when considering which states are poorest. Unfortunately, the federal government doesn't do its cost of living calculations by state. However, the Census Bureau's "supplemental poverty measure" tries to adjust for some of the geographical cost differences. So while, under the bureau's standard poverty measure nine of the 10 poorest states are Red, the latest Supplemental Poverty Measure changes that ranking significantly. Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee fall from the list, replaced by California (the poorest), Nevada, Florida, New York, and Hawaii, which were all Blue states in the 2012 race. (Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas -- all Red states -- make the list either way.) The supplemental measurement adjusts for local variations in the cost of housing, which is not considered by the standard poverty measure, said Kathleen Short, an economist with the Census Bureau. But there's a twist. It also counts a family's government assistance -- such as food stamps, housing assistance and tax credits for the poor -- as income, further complicating the matter. Housing costs are the biggest factor that move states in the ranking, she said. In addition, states where a lot of poor people are getting government assistance may look less poor in the supplemental ranking. Ultimately, each measure of the poorest states has its drawbacks. But the supplemental poverty measure offers a reason to temper the evidence from traditional measures that demonstrate the statement to be True. For that reason, we rule the "9 in 10" claim Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-04133	"Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever."	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/06/environment-new-jersey/environment-new-jersey-claims-sandy-most-destructi/	Hurricane Sandy is probably the worst storm to hit New Jersey after it killed 40 people, remade parts of the Shore’s coastline and caused damages in the tens of billions of dollars. But just how bad was it compared with other hurricanes? "New Jersey can and must do more to slow global warming, especially after 2012's extreme weather and Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever," Environment New Jersey said recently on its website. The most destructive Atlantic storm? Ever? Considering the magnitude of some other hurricanes in history, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to investigate. Doug O’Malley, interim director for Environment New Jersey, said 'destructive' refers to the storm's financial damages. Data shows that while Sandy may be the worst storm to ever batter New Jersey and the tristate region, it’s not the most destructive Atlantic storm in history. Let’s start with some background. Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, leveling houses along the Shore and inland, and leaving millions without power for extended periods. The storm also unleashed a similar fury on New York and Connecticut. We checked Atlantic storms in the National Hurricane Center’s data archives, which tracks storm costs through 2010. Hurricane Irene, which hit New Jersey in 2011, is not included. Leading the list is 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, at $108 billion. Even though Katrina was largely a Gulf Coast storm, doing the most damage in Louisiana and Mississippi, it formed in the Atlantic and made landfall near Florida’s Miami-Dade/Broward county line. It then moved across south Florida into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, according to Hurricane Center data. "Katrina is still a clear runaway number one" in terms of damages, said Dennis Eltgen, a spokesman at the Miami-based Hurricane Center. Second on the list is 1992’s Hurricane Andrew, at $26.5 billion in damages. Andrew devastated parts of south Florida, continued into the Gulf of Mexico and turned north, hitting Louisiana. Those rankings change when damages are adjusted for 2010 dollars. In that case, the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 that hit southeast Florida and Alabama ranks first, at $164.8 billion; Katrina second, at $113 billion; and Andrew fifth, at $58.5 billion. Sandy, however, is different than many hurricanes that often swing through the Gulf of Mexico. "I don’t think we were trying to claim that Sandy was more destructive than Katrina," O’Malley said. "We were trying to say Sandy was the worst hurricane to fully hit the Eastern Seaboard. That being said, Katrina did obviously really hit New Orleans but clearly, it tailed over Florida. We were counting Katrina as only hitting the Gulf Coast. We trust the National Hurricane Center. If they say it’s both, we agree with that." The governors of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have estimated Sandy’s damages at $82 billion. President Obama has requested $60 billion in federal aid for the three states. The Senate approved the request and the House passed a $9 billion aid package Friday, and additional aid is expected to pass on Jan. 15. In making the aid request for the White House, Jeffrey D. Zients, deputy director for Management for the Office of Management and Budget, described Sandy’s place in hurricane history in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). "All told, although estimates of the total damage of Hurricane Sandy remain in flux, current projections are that Sandy is on track to be the second or third most costly natural disaster in U.S, history, behind Hurricane Katrina (2005) and close to Hurricane Andrew (1992)," Zients wrote. Our ruling Environment New Jersey claimed that October’s Hurricane Sandy is "the most destructive Atlantic storm, ever." Sandy may be the most destructive storm to hit a part of the Eastern Seaboard but in terms of most destructive Atlantic storms, that title goes to Katrina, which formed in the Atlantic and whose damages topped $100 billion, according to Hurricane Center data. Sandy, however, is very high on the list, with damages totaling at least $82 billion. Still, that’s not number one in today’s dollars or compared with storms adjusted for inflation in 2010. We rate this statement Mostly False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com. Correction: This report has been corrected: Speaker of the House John Boehner represents Ohio, not Illinois.

Opioid deaths have tripled on his watch and there have been cuts to funds for first responders and people in the community fighting the crisis," Cordray said in Springfield June 4. Cordray has previously pointed the finger saying DeWine and Republicans were "asleep at the switch" on opioids and that DeWine "did nothing about it." Cordray’s statement is an overreach. Although Ohio is one of the hardest hit states by opioid overdoses, this is a national problem. Opioids (including prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl) killed more than 42,000 people in 2016, more than any year on record. About 40 percent of all opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid. In October, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. The over-prescribing of opioids began in the mid 1990s amid a marketing campaign telling doctors that they should prescribe more opioids to help ease patients’ pain. Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University, said it is "silly" to blame DeWine — or any other state attorney general — for the increase in overdose deaths. "There are certain levers attorney generals can pull to impact opioids, but they would not have any short-term impact on opioid deaths," he said. "Opioid deaths have tripled on (Mike DeWine’s) watch" Cordray's campaign cited state health data showing opioid overdose deaths tripled from 1,163 in 2011 to 3,495 in 2016, overlapping with DeWine’s tenure. Cordray was elected attorney general in November 2008 to fill a vacancy, and he lost his bid to keep the seat to DeWine in 2010. The data shows that one of the key reasons behind the spike in overdoses was the increase in deaths from fentanyl, which is up to 50 times more potent than heroin. These overdoses soared from 73 in 2011 to 2,357 in 2016. To tackle the epidemic, DeWine filed has lawsuits against drug manufacturers in 2017 and drug distributors in 2018. He has also devoted money to assist addicts and victims, added scientists and equipment to test drugs, sponsored training for law enforcement, formed a heroin unit and negotiated an agreement to reimburse local agencies that use Naloxone, a treatment to stop overdoses. But bringing the epidemic under control requires reducing the incidence of new people addicted and increasing access to treatment. Those goals are not under the purview of an attorney general. "I do not think it makes sense to blame the attorney general," said Kolodny. "I think there is a lot of blame to go around but pointing to a single state official is silly." Kolodny has criticized the federal response both under Trump and Barack Obama and called for more federal money. Orman Hall, who worked in Gov. John Kasich’s administration on the opioid epidemic, said he doesn’t believe law enforcement will solve this problem. DeWine effectively used his bully pulpit and put forth a good-faith effort to deal with the problem. However, as the attorney general, he doesn’t have access to funds to significantly impact treatment or the health care system. DeWine countered that it was Cordray "who was asleep" on the issue of opioids when he was attorney general, a position he held before DeWine. It’s also misguided to blame Cordray, because when he was attorney general the state didn’t yet fully understand the extent of the problem but was beginning to take action, Hall said. "Everybody made a good faith effort," Hall said. "Nobody has done anything very successful." "Cuts to funds for first responders and people in the community fighting the crisis." Cordray’s campaign pointed to news reports about the state budget cutting money to local governments. Some of those cuts started before DeWine was attorney general and then were exacerbated amid a nearly $8 billion budget shortfall in 2011. Kasich initiated reductions to the state’s Local Government Fund, which is used by local governments for any purpose. The cuts by the state led to cuts for police, fire and other local services. Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart, a Republican who endorsed Cordray, told PolitiFact that the cuts hurt law enforcement’s ability to investigate crimes, including crimes related to opioids. Cordray spokesman Mike Gwin said that DeWine "failed in his responsibility to stand up for law enforcement - to fight for additional money in the state budget for badly-needed resources for the first responders, sheriffs, and police officers on the front lines of this fight." However, as attorney general, DeWine doesn’t oversee the state budget signed by Kasich and can’t be blamed for state budget cuts. Our ruling Cordray said, "Opioid deaths have tripled on (Mike DeWine’s) watch and there have been cuts to funds for first responders and people in the community fighting the crisis." Opioid deaths tripled between 2011 and 2016. However, there is no evidence that DeWine bears responsibility for the spike in overdoses, something that occurred nationally. The state budget did cut money to local governments but as attorney general, DeWine doesn’t set the overall state budget. There is a kernel of truth here in that the deaths did triple on DeWine’s watch and Kasich did sign state budgets that cut money to local governments, but Cordray has failed to provide evidence that as attorney general DeWine is to blame. We rate this claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Richard Cordray	None	None	None	2018-06-12T10:30:00	2018-06-04	['None']
pomt-10189	Sarah Palin endorsed a Wasilla policy that charged sexual assault victims for their "rape kits."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/22/blog-posting/wasilla-had-the-policy-but-palin-didnt-comment-on-/	As bloggers have scrutinized every aspect of Sarah Palin’s record as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, many of them have criticized a city policy that sought reimbursement for forensic exams from victims of sexual assaults. The bloggers contend Palin supported the policy and have criticized her for allegedly being insensitive toward rape victims. To check out their allegations, we examined documents from the city and the Alaska Legislature and interviewed people in Wasilla, advocates for sexual assault victims and a former state legislator. We found the truth is murky. Although Wasilla had such a “rape kit” policy while Palin was mayor, there is no evidence that she explicitly endorsed the policy. But nor have we found any evidence that she opposed it. The policy sought to have rape victims’ health insurance companies reimburse the city for the $500 to $1,200 cost of a forensic exam that is conducted after a sexual assault. Presumably, some of the cost might have been passed along to the victim through requirements for deductibles or co-payments, although victim advocates say they don’t know of anyone in the small town who had to pay such a fee. The policy generated little if any controversy during the first four years after Palin became mayor in 1996. Anne Kilkenny, a civic activist in Wasilla who has written a widely circulated e-mail criticizing Palin, told PolitiFact she does not recall that the issue ever came up. The policy came to light briefly in 2000 when the Alaska Legislature passed a law that required state and local law enforcement agencies pay the full cost of the exams. “We would never bill the victim of a burglary for fingerprinting and photographing the crime scene, or for the cost of gathering other evidence,” then-Gov. Tony Knowles said when he signed the bill into law. “Nor should we bill rape victims just because the crime scene happens to be their bodies.” Legislators and activists have said the law was prompted by Wasilla and several other communities with a similar policy. But a search of the committee minutes for the bill found no mention of Wasilla or Palin. Nor could we find any indication that city officials spoke up about the bill until after it was passed, when Police Chief Charlie Fannon was quoted in the local newspaper The Frontiersman saying he opposed it. “In the past we’ve charged the cost of exams to the victims’ insurance company when possible,” he told the newspaper. “I just don’t want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer.” He estimated the new law would cost his department $5,000 to $14,000 per year. His comments suggest the city sought the money more from insurance companies than the victims themselves. The paper quoted him as saying that "ultimately, it is the criminal who should bear the burden of the added costs.” Fannon could not be reached for comment. His phone number has been disconnected. City officials, who have been swamped with calls and public records requests about Palin, referred PolitiFact to items on the city Web site. (They've gotten so many requests they created a page of Questions & Answers Concerning Former Mayor Palin . But those documents provide an incomplete picture because some don’t include details prior to 2000, when Wasilla had the policy. There’s no evidence that Palin ever commented on the rape kit policy. Bloggers and other critics contend that she must have known about it because she approved the city budget. “If she was against charging for the rape kit, as mayor she could have made the decision not to charge for the rape kit,” Andrew Halcro, a Republican who co-sponsored the bill when he was a state legislator, said in an interview. He ran for governor as an independent in 2006 but was defeated by Palin. City documents are inconclusive. The budget documents we reviewed were signed by Palin but don’t explicitly mention the policy. In response to recent criticism, the McCain-Palin campaign said in a statement that Palin “does not believe, nor has she ever believed, that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence gathering test." Yet the campaign has not provided any evidence that Palin ever opposed the policy. So where does that leave us? Wasilla clearly had the policy. Bloggers have portrayed it as a heartless rule seeking money from rape victims, but they have neglected to mention that the policy seems to have been aimed more at getting money from insurance companies than from victims. We can’t find that Palin ever commented on the policy, pro or con. But as mayor, she indirectly endorsed it by approving city budgets that relied on the revenue. So we find the bloggers' charge to be Half True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2008-09-22T00:00:00	2008-09-12	['None']
pomt-04492	"Carol Shea-Porter … wants to increase taxes on small business and job creators."	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/05/frank-guinta/us-rep-frank-guinta-wrong-shea-porters-small-busin/	U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta and his challenger, former Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter, have been going back and forth over veterans in recent weeks. In response to an ad from Shea-Porter accusing him of voting to cut funding for veterans, Guinta released an advertisement of his own on Sept. 25, charging his opponent with failing to support small businesses. "Carol Shea-Porter? She wants to increase taxes on small business and job creators," a narrator reads in the ad, aired on WMUR-TV, among other stations. "Higher taxes, fewer jobs," the ad reads, showing a faded picture of her face. To our knowledge, Shea-Porter has not advocated throughout this or any previous campaign to raise taxes on small business. So, we decided to check her record. During her time in Congress, Shea-Porter voted in favor of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (known commonly as the HIRE Act of 2009), which offered a payroll tax exemption and new hire retention credit to businesses who hire and retain unemployed workers, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And before she left office the next year, Shea-Porter voted in favor of the Small Business Jobs Act, which, as noted in past PolitiFact rulings, featured eight tax cuts for small businesses, including new and greater deductions for business start-up expenses, cell phone use and health care costs for the self-employed, among others. These votes, along with her support for the federal stimulus package and its $400 tax cut for individual workers (and $800 for working couples), seem to indicate support from Shea-Porter for small businesses. So, we asked the Guinta campaign what they were referring to in the ad. In response, the campaign directed us to a letter Shea-Porter signed onto before she left Congress. The letter, sent Dec. 9, 2010 to U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, urged the then-Speaker not to accept the House Republicans push to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for all taxpayers, but to rescind the tax breaks for those making more than $200,000 a year, or as they said in the letter, "millionaires and billionaires." "First, it is fiscally irresponsible," Shea-Porter and 53 other Congressmen and women wrote at the time. "Second, it is grossly unfair. (It) will hurt, not help, the majority of Americans in the middle class and those working hard to get there." Despite their pleas, the House of Representatives agreed to extend all the cuts for two years, approving the matter Dec. 16, 2010 in the form of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law one day later, and it’s a good thing he did, according to Guinta’s campaign. Like the current situation - the tax cuts are set to expire once again at the end of the year -- failing to extend the cuts would have led to higher taxes on small businesses across the country, Guinta suggested. We’ve heard similar claims before. In November 2010, less than a month before Shea-Porter and her colleagues sent the letter to Pelosi, U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor, now the House Majority Leader, earned a Barely True rating (now Mostly False) for saying the expiration of the tax cuts will raise small business taxes. The question then, just as now, is how many businesses are we talking about. At the time, Cantor referred to an oft-cited Treasury Department report that determined about 75 percent of the nation’s wealthiest taxpayers are "flow through-business owners" who claim some of their earnings through partnerships, sole proprietorship or other form of business income. The 2007 report did not indicate that all these taxpayers are small business owners, however. Rather, this income could be linked to "anyone who earned money from a source other than a regular job, such as consulting or public speaking," PolitiFact ruled at the time. "It could also be reported by those who make most of their income from partnerships such as law firms and medical practices," according to PolitiFact’s previous reporting. "And it could include investors who have very little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company." Now, two years later, this still holds true, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The category includes many business entities that are not small and others that are not businesses at all, CBPP analysts .Chye-Ching Huang and Chuck Marr wrote in a July report, "Allowing High-Income Bush Tax Cuts to Expire Would Affect Few Businesses." "For example, taxpayers can create pass-through entities simply as a vehicle to invest in other businesses," they wrote. "Pass-through income also includes income from the incidental rental of a vacation home." According to the CBPP analysis, only 2.5 percent of small business owners, and 7.9 percent of taxpayers who receive any income from small businesses, qualify for the top two tax rates. The Tax Foundation, a more conservative, business-backed organization, contends that, however few, those higher earning businesses earn most, up to 72 percent, of total business income. "Small business owners can end up with what seem like very high annual incomes," foundation spokesman Richard Morrison wrote in an email, "but because most of that money needs to be put back into the business in order to stay afloat, they often end up both paying taxes in the top bracket ... with relatively little in actual personal income at the end of the year." Still, CBPP argues that the small number of businesses qualifying for the top income brackets means the Bush-tax cuts have little effect on small business. "Very few of the high-income taxpayers who benefit from the upper-income tax cuts are in fact ‘small businesses’ in the way the term is commonly understood," Huang and Marr wrote in their report. "Policymakers ought not let myths and lobbyists’ slogans regarding high-income taxpayers and small businesses drive them toward a costly policy that would add heavily to deficits while delivering little economic benefit." Our ruling: As Guinta suggests, Shea-Porter both lobbied and voted against extending the Bush tax cuts before she left office in 2010, calling the matter "fiscally irresponsible" and "grossly unfair" to middle class Americans. Despite Guinta’s claims, however, nowhere in the letter did Shea-Porter mention wanting to raise taxes on small businesses, nor do analyses suggest that eliminating the tax cuts for the highest income earners would have affected many business owners In votes relating more to small business, Shea-Porter offered support for the HIRE Act and the Small Business Act, among others. In total, her record shows no evidence of "wanting to increase taxes on small businesses," not now or during her time in office. We rate this claim False.

pomt-06052	Rob Cornilles is a Tea Party candidate.	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/11/democratic-party-oregon/rob-cornilles-real-tea-party-candidate/	For months, Democrats have labeled Republican Rob Cornilles a Tea Party-er in order to persuade voters that he’s not as moderate as he claims. In TV commercials, on websites and in press releases Cornilles has been called the "original Tea Party candidate" or shorthanded as just "Tea Party politician Rob Cornilles." The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put up a website called teapartycornilles.comand started a twitter account for @TPartyCornilles. Its first campaign ad in the race features Cornilles saying "I was the original Tea Party candidate" from a May 2010 forum. The Democratic Party of Oregon has jumped in, just as eagerly. In a press release issued Nov. 27, 2011, Democratic Party of Oregon executive director Trent Lutz chastised Cornilles for running on a "far-right tea party platform" in 2010 and then trying to refashion himself as a moderate in 2012. "When Rob Cornilles brands himself ‘the original tea party candidate’ one year and then tries to align himself with the Occupy movement … voters are right to be skeptical about whether he has any convictions beyond getting himself elected to office." As Democrats have taken advantage of this term, we thought it might be helpful to flesh out the origin of the statement and judge the accuracy of its use. Here’s what Cornilles said in its entirety at a meeting of the Executive Club in May, 2010: "I was the original Tea Party candidate because like the Tea Party movement, I got off the couch and I decided to run for office. I am the longest tenured candidate running for Congress of all five districts in the state of Oregon. You tell me that doesn't summarize and epitomize what the Tea Party movement is all about." For party Democrats, that’s all the evidence they need. He said it, therefore he’s a Tea Party candidate. (Democrats often repeat just the first part of his quote.) The rest of us are probably scratching our heads: Why is he talking about getting off the couch? How does that make him a Tea Party original? We got some more clarity on his thoughts in a 2011 interview on KGW’s Straight Talk, which the Democratic Party of Oregon posted to its website, the realrobcornilles.com. He was asked: How closely do you affiliate with the Tea Party? "Well, I really don’t know what we mean when we say Tea Party, quite frankly. If we mean that the Tea Party is made up of individuals who decided to get up off the couch and actually hold their elected officials accountable, who decided to do more than just yell at the TV and become active and involved in the political process, then I think everybody who is paying attention right now is a part of that movement." [News Channel 8, KGW.com, 4:55, 10/15/11] More recently, Cornilles told KATU's Steve Dunn that the Tea Party quote from the Executive club meeting was taken out of context, and reiterated the explanation he gave to KGW. Moreover, the Oregon Tea Party, which is not a political third party, has rejected Cornilles, saying that the group does not plan to endorse any candidate in the special election, nor is it affiliated with a specific party. The group’s John Kuzmanich said that as much as he prefers Cornilles over Democrat Suzanne Bonamici, Cornilles does not hold core Tea Party values. For example, Cornilles has refused to call President Obama’s 2010 health care reform legislation ‘Obamacare,’ as some other Republicans do, and said in a debate last year that he wouldn’t waste time trying to repeal it, Kuzmanich said. Just as alarming to Kuzmanich, Cornilles has stated he understands why we need a new Columbia River Crossing and at one point wanted to turn Portland’s Memorial Coliseum into a multimedia production space-- when neither project reflects the group’s main tenets of limited government, fiscal responsibility and free market principles. On the other side, the DPO’s Lutz has no problem sticking a group label on a candidate when that group has rejected that candidate. "I don’t think we’ve gone too far in depicting the story," Lutz said. "I think it’s holding him accountable to where he was two years ago." Amber Moon, a spokeswoman with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said it’s more than just his truncated quote from the Executive Club meeting. Cornilles is collecting money from a tea party political action committeeand he appeared at a 9/12 Project forum in early 2010, where he said that he had attended tea party meetings for "months and months and months." "The evidence speaks for itself," Moon said, "and he speaks for himself." What’s PolitiFact Oregon to think? We go back to the original question. When we first heard the claim, we thought nothing of it. But the onslaught of websites, tweets, promoted tweets, commercials and press releases made us ask ourselves: Is it true that he’s a Tea Party candidate? Certainly he’s a Republican candidate. Certainly Republicans who identify with Tea Party values are more aligned with Cornilles over the Democrat in the race. Certainly, Cornilles courted such voters in 2010, when the movement was more popular than it is now. But let’s go back to the tenets of the Oregon Tea Party, as espoused by Kuzmanich and repeated by the national Tea Party Patriots: limited government, fiscal responsibility and free market principles. Instead, Cornilles supports the Columbia River Crossing and finds deportation of illegal immigrants impractical and won’t sign a pledge to oppose new taxes. U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., he’s not. Democrats say Cornilles called himself the original Tea Party candidate, but he was referring to the grass-roots nature of the party, not idealogy. Democrats point to Cornilles’ opposition to abortion as evidence of his extremism, but there are lots of Republicans who feel as he does and aren’t considered Tea Party activists. Is he pandering? Blowing smoke? That’s for voters to decide. We will note that Cornilles has been more willing to buck his party this cycle than Bonamici has. So we’re not sure how that makes him a "Tea Party" candidate. The statement contains an element of truth -- he said those things in 2010 -- but ignores critical facts, such as his platform and his lack of endorsement from the Oregon Tea Party. We rule the statement Mostly False. Return to OregonLive to comment.	None	Democratic Party of Oregon	None	None	None	2012-01-11T17:45:26	2012-01-05	['None']
pomt-01102	"Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/11/chris-coons/chris-coons-keystone-means-unlocking-canadian-oil-/	The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline between Canada and the United States is the first big political battle of 2015. The House passed a bill Friday approving construction of the oil pipeline in spite of a veto threat from President Barack Obama, who has said he is waiting on input from the State Department before making a decision on the pipeline. On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked an opponent of the project, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., what Keystone XL means for energy and the environment. Coons responded, "Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands, some of the dirtiest sources of energy on the planet, and allowing those tar sands to go across our American midwest and then reach the international market." We’ve looked into where Canada would export oil carried through Keystone XL, as well as the pipeline’s effect on the environment. But what about Coons’ claim that Keystone XL would mean "unlocking" western Canada’s tar sands? Does the pipeline make a difference between pumping, or not pumping, crude oil from the tar sands? The short story is the impact seems relatively small. Oil drilling companies in Western Canada have been extracting oil from its sands and transporting them to the United States for production for years, and that practice is expected to continue regardless of Keystone XL. But given the right circumstances, the absence of the Keystone XL pipeline could prevent the region from producing at full capacity. A Coons spokesman said "he might have been better served saying ‘further unlocked’ than simply ‘unlocked.’ " The basics The 875-mile Keystone XL pipeline, operated by TransCanada, would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Neb. Then it would connect with an existing southern leg that opened in early 2014, delivering more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The oil would come from the tar sands of Canada’s boreal forests. Extracting this type of dirty, thick crude oil is expensive, energy intensive and produces a significant amount of carbon emissions. Critics say that Keystone XL will elevate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change by encouraging expansion of tar sands development. However, an oft-cited U.S. State Department report about Keystone XL says the project is "unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands." This is because Canadian officials and oil producers vow that the oil will be extracted and reach the American marketplace by other means regardless of the proposed pipeline. Already, trains and several existing pipelines carry Western Canadian crude oil into the United States at an increasing rate -- almost 2 million barrels per day produced in 2013, with the United States importing about half of that. "Keystone XL would only provide a more direct and somewhat less costly method of transporting Canadian heavy crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining and exporting," said Anastasia Shcherbakova, a University of Texas Dallas clinical assistant professor in energy economics and energy finance. At most, Keystone XL would allow an increase in oil sands production of about 25 percent from today's levels, said Andrew Leach, a professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta School of Business. He said that tar sands will come out as long as there is someone willing to pay for the oil, and "that demand doesn’t go away if there’s no pipeline from Canada." There are several other pipelines under consideration that could carry tar sands oil to the United States. If they are built, Keystone XL on its own wouldn’t have much impact because the oil will get to the United States by other cost-effective means, said James Coleman, a law and business professor at Calgary University. On the other hand, if Keystone XL and the other pipelines aren’t constructed, oil companies could take a sizeable hit to their profit -- about $8 a barrel -- because they would have to transport the oil by rail and other means, which are more expensive, according to the State Department report. But the absence of Keystone XL on its own wouldn’t be enough to induce these added costs. Coons spokesman Ian Koski pointed to a report from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers that shows projected growth to about 8 million barrels per day by 2030 (including U.S.-produced oil that travels on the Canadian pipelines) after adding the several pipelines under consideration, including Keystone. But if those pipelines aren’t included, growth appears stuck at around 5 million barrels per day. Without Keystone XL and the other pipelines, the tar sands could not be fully extracted because the oil would "have nowhere to go," he said. Koski pointed to a couple examples of Canadian oil sands mines that were put on hold due to, in part, rising industry and transportation costs: the Joslyn Mine and the Statoil Corner project. "Costs for labor and materials have continued to rise in recent years and are working against the economics of new projects," Statoil said in a statement. "Market access issues also play a role -- including limited pipeline access, which weighs on prices for Alberta oil, squeezing margins and making it difficult for sustainable financial returns." Regardless, experts and the State Department don’t think that Keystone XL will have a major impact one way or another on whether oil companies will continue to exploit the tar sands. However, there is a catch: Low oil prices could potentially curtail production. Cost of oil Oil prices have dropped to about $50 per barrel -- the lowest prices since 2009, the height of the recession. For Canadian oil sands to break even on production costs, oil prices need to be around $70 a barrel. Without the Keystone XL pipeline, transportation costs are high, which exacerbates the hit to revenue after low oil prices. The State Department’s report assumed oil prices staying at around $75 per barrel. It said that if oil prices fall between $65 and $75 per barrel, then the cost of transporting oil without the Keystone XL pipeline might make a difference as to whether or not Canada continues to produce tar sands oil at current rates. But under $65 per barrel -- where prices are now -- it’s more the sheer low price of oil that would negatively impact oil production rather than any pipeline in particular. "You still need pipes, but Keystone XL or any other individual line in and of itself is not as crucial to likely growth plans," Leach said. Additionally, the price of oil is volatile, and many experts think it will go back up again, so a long-term impact on tar sands production due to low oil prices is not likely. "Under State's analysis, blocking Keystone XL will only have an effect on oil sands production if all the other pipelines are blocked, and oil prices stay below $75 per barrel," Coleman said. "How likely is that? I'd say it's unlikely, but no one really knows." Our ruling Coons said building "Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands." Oil production has been steadily growing in the Canadian tar sands without the Keystone XL pipeline. Most experts expect that trend to continue despite current low oil prices. Coons would have been on safer ground if he said Keystone XL would unlock Canada’s ability to further increase its production capacity. The pipeline would offer much lower transportation costs than current transportation methods, which would encourage greater oil production. But his literal words weren’t accurate. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Chris Coons	None	None	None	2015-01-11T11:46:44	2015-01-11	['Canada']
pomt-13591	Says her campaign platform includes the "biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-claim-she-would-make-biggest-jobs/	In nearly every campaign speech, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says her jobs platform is historic in magnitude. "My top priority is create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, which is why I've set five ambitious goals to get us there," she said in Scranton, Pa., Aug. 15. "First, we are going to make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II." We’ve heard this phrase many times, so we decided it’s time we fact-checked it. A sizeable investment Remember, Clinton is comparing her proposed spending to actual spending since World War II. No one can say at this point how much Congress might approve if she is elected president. With that in mind, let's dig into the nitty-gritty. Clinton has proposed total federal spending in several areas: $275 billion on infrastructure, $500 billion on higher education, $100 billion in energy and research, and $25 billion on housing, plus less expensive investments in a few other areas. So that’s a total of at least $900 billion in new spending over a 10-year period (or two terms plus two years after she leaves office). How does that compare to the past? According to the Clinton campaign, the largest total federal investment in three job-making categories — infrastructure, education and research and development — since World War II was about $766 billion over a 10-year period starting in 1998, when her husband Bill Clinton was president. How Clinton’s policy team came up with this figure gets a little wonky. In a nutshell, her campaign collected historical data going back to 1947 to estimate how much the federal government spent on public investments each year — including spending on non-defense infrastructure, education, and research and development. Then, for each year, they calculated how much investment increased or decreased over the following 10 years compared to that first year. (All figures were adjusted for inflation.) Here’s a taste of what that means: The Clinton campaign estimated that the total "public investment" in 1998 was $174 billion. Over the next 10 years, the total increase in public investment was $766 billion. This is much smaller than Clinton’s proposed $900 billion (or more) in increased investments over the next 10 years. It’s a rough estimation, one that doesn’t necessarily capture all aspects of public investments, let alone how the spending leads to new jobs. But experts told us this is a plausible representation of the size of Clinton’s proposals compared to historic spending increases in these areas. They added, however, that we should look at the size of the investment as a share of gross domestic product, which helps scale the spending as a share of the economy’s size at the time. We ran the calculations (thanks, Excel!) and found Clinton’s statement isn’t quite as airtight once you factor in GDP. Clinton’s investment would be larger than most years, at about a 5 percent share of current GDP. But the share was higher every year from 1954-64 (ranging from 6 to 12 percent) and in 1998 at 6 percent. Still, Clinton’s proposals amount to a lot of spending, much of which she plans to finance through changes to the tax code. Her spending proposal "does seem historically large," said Jesse Rothstein, director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at University of California, Berkeley. Rothstein noted for comparison that total federal spending on job training is under $5 billion per year, and the entire budget of the Education Department is less than $100 billion. For a more historical comparison, consider the biggest investment in infrastructure since World War II — the interstate highway system, launched in the 1950s under President Dwight Eisenhower. The project cost about $500 billion in today’s dollars over its decades of construction, according to industry analysts. Clinton + historic spending = jobs? Clinton’s argument evokes a classic economic debate: Does government spending create jobs, or are jobs lost as a result of increased spending and borrowing? Federal investment doesn’t necessarily equal "new, good-paying jobs," though it can, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group concerned by rising deficits. But if the spending isn’t appropriately allocated, it can go to waste or get in the way of the private sector. Parts of Clinton’s platform are clearly geared toward creating new jobs, such as the $275 billion investment in infrastructure, which would involve construction jobs, and parts of a $10 billion package for the manufacturing sector that the campaign says would "reward" manufacturers for creating new, well-paid, local jobs. Other proposals are more nuanced or require making some assumptions, such as the notion that an investment in energy research and development would lead to higher productivity, as well as more private investment and eventually more jobs. The Clinton campaign argues her college and workforce training plans would result in higher-skilled workers being available for higher-skill jobs. However, much of that money will go toward reducing debt for many students. That might help some kids get through college who wouldn’t have, but for many, their job prospects would be the same — they would just have less debt. "Obviously, not every dollar of that will go directly toward paying the salary of a new job," Rothstein said. "But I think it is reasonable to count, say, relief of student debt as an investment in good-paying jobs, since a grad who gets an otherwise good job but needs to pay much of her salary in loan payments doesn’t actually have a good-paying job." Our ruling Clinton says her campaign platform includes the "biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II." Using rough estimates of public investment in several sectors, the size of Clinton’s proposals — at least $900 billion over 10 years — appears larger than any other 10-year investment since World War II. It’s worth keeping in mind, though, that when we look at the size of the historical public investments as a share of GDP, there have been 12 years since World War II with larger public investments. In terms of whether these investments will result in "new, good-paying jobs," that’s all a matter of prediction. In many cases, the new spending Clinton proposes for education, research and development, and infrastructure isn’t going to literally create new employment positions. Rather, much of the money will go to programs that the Clinton campaign argues will spur job creation. Her claim is partially accurate but requires additional information. We rate Clinton’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/33b01e65-a13b-4a49-ab8a-80c2d1801b6a	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-17T12:05:52	2016-08-15	['None']
pomt-01160	When Colorado eased its medical marijuana laws, fatal accidents involving pot-using drivers soared while overall traffic fatalities decreased.	/georgia/statements/2014/dec/15/charles-chuck-spahos/drugged-driving-claim-base/	Cautions abound from opponents and supporters alike in Georgia’s debate about whether to legalize medical marijuana. The most likely measure to pass is a bill that gained traction last year and is being reintroduced this year by state Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, to allow cannabis oil for treatment of certain seizure disorders and other health problems. But a second bill to allow vaporized, edible and smokeable marijuana for medical use has prompted new claims about safety problems and other unintended consequences. Chuck Spahos, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, told a joint legislative committee that no district attorney in the state will prosecute those caught with cannabis oil. But he warned lawmakers about smokeable marijuana, saying that Colorado has seen the number of traffic fatalities go up among drivers who test positive for marijuana, at the same time that state’s overall traffic fatality rate declined. "Colorado has seen a decrease in traffic fatalities by 14.8 percent between 2007 and 2012," Spahos said. "But it’s up 100 percent for operators who tested positive for marijuana." "We don’t want to stand in the way of this oil being available," he said. "This is how bad it’s going to be if we let it go too far." So did medical marijuana really lead to such a dramatic uptick in stoned drivers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. First, it’s important to understand Colorado’s history on the issue. Voters there approved medical marijuana in its smokeable form in 2000. But commercialization of the drug did not really begin until 2009, when federal officials announced they would not seek prosecution of those complying with state medical marijuana laws. Voters approved recreational use of the drug last year. So the statistics Spahos referenced covered just before the rapid growth of marijuana dispensaries but before recreational use was permitted. He cited an August 2014 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Traffic Area as his source. The report is unequivocal. The exact figures cited by Spahos are found in the findings under the report’s section for impaired driving. A chart breaks down the actual numbers: Year Statewide Fatalities Operators Testing Positive 2007 554 39 2008 548 43 2009 465 47 2010 450 49 2011 447 63 2012 472 78 Based on this report, Spahos’ claim appears accurate. However, there are several complications with the data. No one from the RMHIDTA responded to requests for comment. The report cites the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and its own research for its data. But when contacted, a spokesman for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration referred us back to the Colorado Department of Transportation for the figures, saying each state reports different information. No federal data could confirm the report’s claim. Meanwhile, the statistics from Colorado’s DOT don’t match the RMHIDTA report. The DOT figures are: Year Statewide Fatalities Drivers Testing Positive 2007 554 26 2008 548 31 2009 465 37 2010 450 42 2011 447 52 2012 474 36 The DOT figures confirm an overall decrease in traffic fatalities, but show about a 39 percent increase for drivers who tested positive for marijuana. That’s still an increase, but hardly a 100 percent jump. More importantly, Colorado DOT spokeswoman Amy Ford said the agency is cautious to use their own data to make any pronouncements. That’s because the data is incomplete. Not every driver in a fatal crash is tested for drugs. Colorado law long allowed a conviction based on just drunken driving – at .08 percent blood alcohol level – so some agencies never bothered with any additional testing. The state only began tracking drugged driving – driving high – this year, so there is no historical data to compare, Ford said. "We do not draw an incredible amount of conclusions from that data," she said. The federal data for all states likewise focuses on drunken, not drugged, drivers. Several studies show that marijuana can slow reaction time and similarly impair drivers in much the way alcohol does. One study found that dead drivers were three times more likely to test positive for cannabis in 2010 when compared to those who died in 1999. But the marijuana will show up longer in blood work and does not appear to increase the chances of a fatal accident as much as booze, according to a 2013 study by researchers at Columbia University. So if Georgia were to legalize smoking marijuana, does that mean there would not be a rash of high drivers risking their safety and that of others? Colorado’s research indicates specific drivers – essentially young men – are more likely to drive high when the drug is legal. The state has launched a public awareness campaign to the new law that allows police to cite those motorists for driving under the influence, Ford said. In other words, there are clear dangers to driving under the influence of marijuana, much as there are for driving intoxicated. But while a regional report claims that those risks have led to a 100 percent increase in fatal crashes where the driver tested positive for cannabis, official state figures directly contradict those figures. Spahos was citing that published report, but the report and figures surrounding the topic are flawed. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-11633	"In American history since 9/11, we've had 85 major attacks in our country, 73 percent of them have been by white nationalist hate groups."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/18/cory-booker/fact-checking-cory-bookers-statistic-attacks-white/	U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said in an interview on CNN that President Donald Trump’s reported comments describing Haiti as a "s---hole" present a "moral moment" for our country and caused pain for Haitians and other minorities. Booker then pivoted to talk about minorities being victims of crimes by white nationalist groups: "In American history since 9/11, we've had 85 major attacks in our country, 73 percent of them have been by white nationalist hate groups against minorities, against Muslims, against others," Booker said Jan. 16. We fact-checked Booker’s numbers and found that he cited a valid government report. However, he took a statistic in the report and flubbed how it was labeled. Government report on perpetrators of major attacks Booker’s spokesman said he was citing numbers from an April 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, "Countering Violent Terrorism." The report draws on data from the U.S. Extremist Crime Database that is maintained by the University of Maryland National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. The GAO report examined terrorist violence from Sept. 12, 2001 -- the day after the 9/11 terror attacks -- through Dec. 31, 2016. It found 85 deadly attacks in the United States by violent extremists. Among those incidents, far-right violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 incidents (73 percent) while radical Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 incidents (27 percent). Booker used the term "white nationalists," but that’s not exactly the same thing as far-right extremist groups. Far-right extremist groups are motivated by ideologies seeking an idealized future favoring a particular group. They include white supremacists and anti-government militias, among others. The GAO report (see page 29) shows that a subset of far-right incidents -- about 38 incidents -- were committed specifically by white supremacists. That means that about 45 percent of the 85 incidents were committed by white supremacists while Booker had said that 73 percent of the incidents were committed by white nationalist hate groups. We sent our findings to Booker’s spokesman Jeff Giertz to show that the GAO report showed a smaller percentage committed by white supremacists than the figure cited by Booker. Giertz pointed to additional perpetrators who were not identified as white supremacists in the table, but other sources such as news accounts or court records showed they held white supremacist or racist views. For example, the GAO labeled the murderers of minority victims in an Arizona incident as "far right violent extremists" but an Arizona Supreme Court ruling stated that they participated in a militia that focused on "uplifting" the white race and fostered negative views of minority groups. William Parkin, who helps direct the U.S. Extremist Crime Database, said that they break down incidents into categories based on the primary ideological motivation of the act. There could be secondary or mixed motives. "That being said, there is a fluidity between varying far-right extremist ideologies," said Parkin, a Seattle University criminal justice assistant professor. "At the individual level, it would not be uncommon for those who identify as being white supremacists to also be anti-government, and vice versa." We will note that pinpointing what percent of attacks were committed by any particular label of perpetrator is not an exact science, and that the numbers can change depending upon definitions. Another source of data on such attacks is the New America Foundation, which found that about 70 percent of deadly attacks are by people motivated by far right views since Sept. 11. However, that includes individuals motivated by views other than white nationalism including more general anti-government views and anti-abortion views. "Overall, though the definition of the ideologies is a bit too specific in Booker’s comment, it does convey the larger difference in number of deadly attacks from the far right as opposed to other motives though it is important to note that jihadists have killed more people despite carrying out fewer attacks," said David Sterman, New America analyst. Our ruling Booker said, "In American history since 9/11, we've had 85 major attacks in our country, 73 percent of them have been by white nationalist hate groups." Booker cited a GAO report that analyzed violent incidents. While Booker said that 73 percent were by "white nationalist hate groups," the report said that 73 percent were by a broader category of "far right wing violent extremist groups." The same report shows about 45 percent of incidents were committed by white supremacists. The number could rise if we counted additional perpetrators who sympathized with white supremacist ideals but were not labeled as white supremacists by the GAO. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-15188	"The U.S. has now spent more on reconstructing Afghanistan than was spent on the Marshall Plan and the reconstruction of Europe."	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/20/matt-wuerker/has-us-really-spent-more-afghanistan-post-wwii-eur/	The days of a massive American military presence in Afghanistan are over. Afghan forces might benefit from about 10,000 U.S. trainers and advisers, but otherwise, the country’s security is in their hands. Yet after more than a dozen years of American engagement, the situation is fragile in the extreme. Talks between the government of President Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban are on hold with no date to restart. Military casualties are up 50 percent from last year. Nearly 5,000 civilians have died so far in 2015. In this context, Politico cartoonist Matt Wuerker offered his take on the results of billions of American taxpayer dollars invested in rebuilding the country. In an Aug. 4, 2015, cartoon, a bewildered Uncle Sam stands on top of a pipeline of aid to Afghanistan riven with cracks that spell the word "corruption." Superimposed is a box that says, "The U.S. has now spent more on reconstructing Afghanistan than was spent on the Marshall Plan and the reconstruction of Europe." A reader asked us to verify that comparison. In terms of inflation-adjusted dollars, the statement holds up. But, as we’ll explain, it falls short on two points. The primary source of the claim Wuerker pointed us to one of many news reports during 2014. In June that year, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction released one of its regular updates for Congress. In a short section, it compared the two programs. "Adjusted for inflation, U.S. appropriations for the reconstruction of Afghanistan exceed the funds committed to the Marshall Plan, the U.S. aid program that delivered billions of dollars between 1948 and 1952 to help 16 European countries recover in the aftermath of World War II," the report said. The Inspector General analysts wrote that in inflation-adjusted dollars, the United States had spent $103 billion on the Marshall Plan and $109 billion on Afghanistan. The investment of American dollars is a fair yardstick, but experts noted others. Two very different programs While both efforts aimed to rebuild war-torn nations, the most striking difference is the Marshall Plan spent no money on the European armed forces. In contrast, about 60 percent of the aid spent on Afghanistan went towards arming and training the military and police. In fact, the Inspector General’s report makes note of that distinction. By its tally, building the Afghan security forces absorbed nearly $62 billion of the total. (To clarify, the total for Afghanistan excludes the cost of American military operations.) The Marshall Plan unfolded long ago, so a short summary is in order for those who might not know it well. The Truman administration and Congress created the Marshall Plan to stabilize the economies of Western Europe. In the early part, the program delivered hard goods such as food, animal feed, fertilizer and fuel. Later, direct aid shifted to providing raw materials and production equipment. Aid also came in the form of grants and loans. In the dollars of the time, spending reached $10.3 billion. About half was invested in power plants, roads, railroads and agriculture. Another portion went towards debt relief. There were loan guarantees to spur American firms to invest in Europe. Charles Maier, a Harvard historian, is a leading authority on post-World War II Europe. Maier told us that making comparisons across a span of more than 50 years is "notoriously tricky." The circumstances on the ground in Europe in the later 1940s and Afghanistan today are fundamentally different, Maier said. "The European countries — outside Greece — were really functioning administrative systems," Maier said. "Few of those societal infrastructures have been operative in Afghanistan. Also, when the aid was being provided, there was no fighting in the recipient countries, except for the civil war in Greece, 1946-49." Maier also emphasized that while the inflation-adjusted dollars might put the Afghanistan price tag above that of the Marshall Plan, when compared to the size of the American economy at the time, the Marshall Plan represented a much heftier commitment than U.S. aid to Afghanistan. U.S. GDP then and now During the years of the Marshall Plan, the size of the U.S. economy was in the neighborhood of $310 billion (in dollars at that time). So, with total spending of $10.3 billion on European reconstruction, the Marshall Plan represented about 4.3 percent of average GDP. Maier then contrasted that with the Afghanistan spending between 2002 and 2014. During those years, the economy averaged about $14.3 trillion. The money spent on Afghanistan represented about 0.75 percent of average GDP. "That's about one-twentieth of the Marshall Plan burden," Maier said. "This seems a much more rational way of thinking about the burden the U.S. was bearing." Seen through the lens of the strain on the American economy, the Marshall Plan required more effort than rebuilding Afghanistan. Our ruling Wuerker said that the United States has spent more for Afghanistan reconstruction than it did to rebuild Europe under the Marshall Plan. While the math behind the claim adds up, it's important to know that the reconstruction programs are not identical. The Marshall Plan spent no funds on military projects, while about 60 percent of Afghanistan aid was spent on security. The Marshall Plan was entirely focused on economic investments, while the spending in Afghanistan has been weighted much more toward establishing a secure space in which economic growth can occur. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13448	Mark Kirk’s claim of national security expertise is "based on his military record which he lied about at least 10 times."	/illinois/statements/2016/sep/15/tammy-duckworth/tammy-duckworth-hits-mark-kirk-military-embellishm/	In a speech Aug. 18 in Springfield, Ill., to the county leaders of the Illinois Democratic Party, U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth revived and added specificity to a charge that dogged U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk throughout his successful 2010 U.S. Senate campaign. "This is the man who knows so much about national security. He’s been wrong about every issue on national security he’s ever been involved in," Duckworth said. "And who, by the way, claims all this based on his military record which he lied about at least 10 times." Those who followed Kirk’s campaign against then-Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias likely recall that Kirk in 2010 issued clarifications and apologies related to his military claims on more than one occasion. But "at least 10?" The Duckworth campaign provided a list of Kirk’s alleged infractions. It says Kirk falsely claimed he: won the Naval Intelligence Officer of the Year Award, performed combat duty in Kosovo, was shot at in Afghanistan and while flying over Iraq, was "deployed" to Afghanistan, took part in Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, was the only member of Congress as of 2005 who was a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, commanded the Pentagon’s war room and did not violate military policy about campaigning while on duty. We decided to look into the allegations. The background Kirk served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1989 to 2013 and frequently mentioned his military experience during the years he spent as U.S. representative for Illinois’ 10th Congressional District from 2001-11. There’s nothing unusual about that. As Chicago Sun-Times columnist Carol Marin noted in a June 2, 2010, column, "In American politics, military service is like a platinum credit card." Kirk might have kept his platinum card status had Terry Welch, an Afghanistan veteran and blogger at Nitpicker.com, not looked into a claim in 2005 by U.S. Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Ohio, that Kirk was the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress. (Kirk became part of this narrative only as a side player. Schmidt brought up Kirk’s service record to refute a claim by her opponent that, if elected, he would be the first Iraq War vet in Congress.) Kirk’s official House website at the time said Kirk "is the only member of Congress to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom…" In a series of posts in 2005 (here, here and here), Welch painstakingly dissected Kirk’s claim of Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran status. Kirk’s office eventually changed the wording, though Welch noted that it took 50 days for it to do so. "While we applaud the service of Mark Kirk, his service occurred before the March 19, 2003, start date of the mission, according to the Bush administration itself," Welch wrote in this post. The episode, though clumsily handled by Kirk’s office, faded in the years that followed. But when Kirk in 2010 became the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Barack Obama, it became a crack in a dam that soon would unleash a flood of reporting on similar incidents in which Kirk inaccurately described his military career. The questions started anew in May 2010, when Kirk’s opponent, then-Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, challenged Kirk’s claim to have been named Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer of the Year in 1999. This led to an admission by Kirk that he had not won the award, but was part of a unit that won a different honor. "Commander Danny Hernandez, a Navy spokesman, said Thursday the individual 1999 Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer of the Year was given to another reservist and not to Kirk," the Chicago Tribune reported. Also around that time, Kirk changed his website to remove the word "combat" from his description of military service in Kosovo. On June 3, Kirk faced new allegations of embellishment when he visited the Chicago Tribune editorial board. From the Tribune’s report: In a new disclosure, Kirk acknowledged that his campaign's promotion of him coming under fire while flying aboard an intelligence reconnaissance plane in Iraq may not be correct because there is no record of whether his aircraft was being fired upon. Kirk also acknowledged a constituent letter sent out by his North Shore congressional district office last year that described him as a member of Operation Desert Storm, though he did not participate in that effort. "I am sorry, absolutely," Kirk said. "You should speak with utter precision. You should stand on the documented military record. In public discourse, for high office, you should make sure that there is a degree of complete rigorous precession." If you’re keeping score, that’s six of the 10. On June 13, the Tribune ran a story challenging Kirk’s claim that he had been "deployed" to Afghanistan when really he had been there for short training stints. The article again quoted Navy spokesman Commander Danny Hernandez. "A deployment is a deployment and annual training is annual training," Hernandez said. That’s No. 7. On July 8, 2010, PolitiFact summarized more inaccuracies in Kirk’s telling of his military background. These found Kirk claiming, incorrectly, that he had served in Operation Desert Storm and that he "command(ed) the war room in the Pentagon." PolitiFact mentioned those and other incidents while testing the veracity of a claim by Kirk’s opponent that Kirk had been disciplined for "violat(ing) Pentagon rules...for improperly mingling politics with his military service." PolitiFact ruled the statement True, which brought more trouble for Kirk when his office persisted in claiming that he never had violated those rules. That’s 8 and 9. But Duckworth specified 10, and among those was a claim that Kirk lied about being shot at in Afghanistan. This is based on a Huffington Post article published June 4, 2010, that claimed Kirk had given conflicting accounts of whether or not he was shot at in Kandahar. In January 2009, Kirk had told the suburban Lake County News Sun that he "never got shot at" during recent service in Afghanistan. In January 2010, Kirk was asked on a Chicago Sun-Times questionnaire about the "wildest thing" he had ever done in his career. He responded, "Last year, I was with a Dutch armor unit in Kandahar, getting shot at." The original HuffPo article inferred that Kirk gave conflicting reports about the same incident. But Kirk’s campaign spokesman said in an addendum to the article that that was not correct: Eric Elk, a spokesman for Kirk, said that there is no contradiction in the statements. The Congressman, he says, was referring to two different instances in which he was in Kandahar. "He there was there in December 2008/Jan 2009 and then December 2009/Jan 2010," said Elk. That would be the last of the new accusations pertaining to Kirk’s military career. Kirk weathered the storm and made numerous statements of contrition, then went on to defeat Giannoulias in a narrow victory in November. Our ruling Duckworth said Kirk claims military and defense expertise "based on his military record which he lied about at least 10 times." There is no disputing that Kirk spent the summer of 2010 explaining and apologizing for misstatements in describing his military experience. The Duckworth campaign listed these 10 examples when we asked: Naval Intelligence Officer of the Year Award Taking fire while flying over Iraq Serving combat duty in Kosovo Being shot at in Afghanistan Being "deployed" to Afghanistan Taking part in Operation Desert Storm Participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom Claimed to be the only member of Congress who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom Claimed to command the Pentagon’s war room Claimed he had not violated Pentagon policy about campaigning while on duty The fourth claim on this list, that Kirk lied about being shot at in Afghanistan, is in dispute. The original source for that claim contains an update indicating Kirk described two separate incidents. Kirk’s current campaign spokesman, Kevin Artl, reiterated that explanation when contacted for this article. The groundwork on the other nine claims was done six years ago or longer, sometimes by multiple media outlets. If you follow the links included above, you’ll see that the coverage at times creates a confusing patchwork of sourcing that makes it difficult to put all this into a smooth timeline. You’ll also see a long pattern -- albeit one that appears to have ended after the summer of 2010 -- of ambiguous language and conflicting claims throughout Mark Kirk’s frequent pronouncements on his military activity. We rate Duckworth’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8059518-2eac-4135-b133-dc20c19ae331	None	Tammy Duckworth	None	None	None	2016-09-15T17:37:27	2016-08-18	['Mark_Kirk']
pomt-11824	"Ending (Temporary Protected Status) and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/13/joaquin-castro/rep-joaquin-castro-claims-tps-end-will-lead-164b-g/	Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro claimed the U.S. economy would be negatively impacted if the Trump administration eliminated an immigration protection mostly benefitting Central Americans. The U.S. government routinely reviews whether to extend or terminate a country’s Temporary Protected Status designation, applied to countries with ongoing armed conflict, natural disasters, epidemics and other extraordinary, temporary conditions preventing the safe return of their nationals. Opponents of this status argue that while the protection is intended to be temporary, some designations are continuously renewed, allowing some recipients to stay in the country for many years. But Castro said ending it would come at a real cost of lost workers. "Ending #TPS and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade," Castro tweeted on Nov. 1, ahead of the deadline for the U.S. government to decide on the current TPS status for Honduras and Nicaragua. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The United States on Nov. 6 decided to end Nicaragua’s designation, effective in 2019. Honduras’ designation, set to expire Jan. 5, 2018, was extended until July 5, 2018, because the Department of Homeland Security said it needed more time "to obtain and assess" additional information. We wanted to know if Castro’s claim on gross domestic product losses was accurate. The Texas representative's tweet is based on a report from a left-leaning organization whose calculation included immigrants’ potential lost earnings and industry chain reactions. Another group’s estimates, without industry output calculations, found a lower GDP loss of $45.2 billion. Will ending TPS lead to an estimated $164 billion GDP loss over a decade? Castro’s office told us the congressman’s claim stemmed from an October report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization. The group supports the designation, which is currently in effect for 10 countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Immigrants living in the United States illegally as well as individuals on a valid nonimmigrant visa may apply for Temporary Protected Status if they meet certain criteria. Receiving the protection allows them to get work permits and avoid deportation, but does not lead to lawful permanent resident status. The center focused on GDP losses tied to recipients from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the countries with the most beneficiaries. TPS holders from those three countries "are employed at high rates," and are "key contributors" to the industries of construction, restaurant and other food services, landscaping services, child care, and grocery stores, the report said. The group’s analysis is based on estimates from the Center for Migration Studies of New York of about 302,000 TPS beneficiaries from those three countries (estimated using recent census data). If an estimated 244,200 beneficiaries from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti are removed from the workforce, the United States would lose $164 billion in GDP over the next decade, the Center for American Progress report said. The calculation derives from a broader, separate study on GDP loss resulting from the removal of unauthorized workers in the United States. The researchers multiplied the number of employed TPS recipients with the losses associated with each unauthorized worker. "By both assuming that the skill distribution of the workforce with TPS reflects that of the broader unauthorized workforce and expressing data in 2013 dollars, this analysis reflects a conservative estimate," the report said. The only other estimate of the potential consequence of ending this program that we could find was even more conservative. An April report from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center estimated a much lower GDP loss over a decade — $45.2 billion — without the wages of an estimated 190,000 TPS individuals from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti. Nicole Svajlenka, coauthor of the Center for American Progress analysis, said her team’s numbers are much higher because they considered "all that goes into a GDP, which is beyond earnings." "We take into account workers’ educational attainment, nativity, and work experience as well as the industry composition to determine what would change if that worker was removed," Svajlenka said. "Basically, we’re simulating some chain reactions — without these workers, some industries would shrink, other workers would shift, etc." Several researchers we reached out to said they had not done their own, independent analysis on this issue, but did not challenge Center for American Progress’ findings. David Dyssegaard Kallick, director of immigration research at the Fiscal Policy Institute, said it is sound to look at industry output when thinking about GDP loss. "GDP, after all, is about measuring total output in the economy," he said. The center’s GDP estimates can also be seen as conservative "since they do not take into account impacts associated with the likely withdrawal of a significant number of U.S.-born children of TPS holders," said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, an associate professor in the UCLA Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. He added that TPS workers are also supporting the people hiring them, helping them generate profits. Many TPS holders also bought houses and have mortgages, said Hinojosa-Ojeda. Our ruling Castro tweeted, "Ending #TPS and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade." Castro accurately cited GDP loss reported by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. But at least one other report pegged a GDP loss three times as small, $45.2 billion. The report Castro used calculated lost earnings and impact on industries, the other report only looked at lost wages. We rate Castro’s claim Half True.

pomt-03508	My office is about a 300-step walk to the governor's office.	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/05/kasim-reed/distance-between-deal-reed-can-be-measured-steps/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal have become something of a team, delivering a one-two punch for various economic development projects in Georgia, including metro Atlanta. Although the two line up on opposite sides of the political aisle, they have managed to put the D and R aside to work together on getting funding for Georgia ports, get a new football stadium built and get Porsche to move its North American headquarters close to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The relationship has caught the eye of politicos far and near as an example of how leadership should work. But that hasn’t always been the case. And Reed noted this last month during the Governing Georgia Leadership Forum in downtown Atlanta. "My office is about a 300-step walk to the governor's office," Reed said. "But you would have thought previously that walk was a 10k." PolitiFact Georgia is always looking for an opportunity for a little fun and exercise. So we grabbed our pedometer and set out for a walk. At the Leadership Forum, Reed and Deal were co-presenters for a 30-minute session titled "Shared Fortunes -- Building a Better Georgia." The description of the discussion said: "the state's governor, a Republican, and the mayor of its largest city, a Democrat, discuss how they are working together to advance a common agenda." And to work together you have to be together. And being together includes office visits, so we set out to check the distance between them. Not depending on our math alone, we got out a pedometer for a more accurate step count. We walked the path from Reed’s office in Atlanta City Hall to Deal’s office on the main floor of the Georgia State Capitol, and back again, twice. We began walking at a normal pace. But the mayor stands at 6 feet, a full six inches taller than this PolitiFact Georgia reporter, so we extended our stride a bit. Our calculations found that Reed was correct. The distance from the governor’s office to the first step outside City Hall was 300 steps. Throw in the distance from the outside City Hall steps to Reed’s actual office and the step count increases between 65 and 100 steps, depending on the route through the lobby, whether you take a short ramp or the few steps up to the main office level, and stride of the walker. To sum up, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said his office was about 300 steps from Gov. Nathan Deal’s office. Walking the path that the mayor is likely to take, it is 300 steps from Deal’s office to the bottom of the first step of Atlanta City Hall, where Reed’s office is located. Walking all the way to the receptionist that sits just outside the mayor’s office adds additional steps, based on our calculations, which could make the mayor’s claim off by about one-third. Reed’s overall point was that the political divide between he and Deal has closed. Based on their history of delivering economic development projects for the city and state, that statement is correct. But the mayor is off just a bit on his distance claim if you take his statement literally. We rated Reed’s claim Mostly True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2013-06-05T14:22:27	2013-05-29	['None']
pomt-11182	"You’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/21/mo-brooks/mo-brooks-incomplete-comments-antarctic-ice/	It’s not every day that a hearing of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee goes viral, but that’s what happened on May 16, 2018, when a Republican lawmaker questioned aspects of climate change. The most frequently shared exchange from the hearing involved Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and a witness, Phil Duffy, the president and executive director of the Woods Hole Research Center. At one point, Brooks suggested that England’s White Cliffs of Dover and the California coastline are continually eaten away by erosion, perhaps driving a rise in sea levels that scientists ordinarily blame on melting ice. Others have debunked the idea that cliff erosion or sediment release from rivers constitutes a significant factor in sea level rise. (Philip Bump at the Washington Post estimated the current annual sea level increase of 3.3 millimeters would require, every year, "a volume of earth equivalent to taking the top five inches of every one of the United States’ 9.1 million square miles of land area and using it to coat the bottom of the world’s oceans.") So we won’t go over the same territory. Instead, we decided to look at another comment from Brooks’ exchange with Duffy: Brooks: "Would it surprise you to know that if global temperatures rise, assuming for the moment that they do, that that actually increases the amount of ice that is collected on Antarctica?" Duffy: "That’s not true, sir." Brooks: "I made a trip down to Antarctica and met with National Science Foundation scientists, and they all agreed with global warming, and they emphasize that you’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming.… "Do you understand that as temperatures rise, more moisture is contained in the atmosphere and then that moisture in Antarctica collects on land, and it takes hundreds and hundreds of years for that ice that is deposited on Antarctica to actually ever reach the shoreline where it touches the oceans where it can affect in some way sea level increases?" Is it true, as Brooks said, that "you’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming"? In a statement to PolitiFact, Brooks reiterated what he said he learned from the scientists in Antarctica, including those who believe that global warming is real. The increase in interior ice, he said the scientists told him, should "offset the loss of Antarctic sea ice, Arctic sea ice, and whatever melting occurs in places like Greenland." (Read Brooks’ full statement here,) However, more than a dozen scientists told PolitiFact that while Brooks is correctly describing one part of the complicated interplay around Antarctic climate change, whatever ice gains materialize from this process are almost certain to be overwhelmed by melting ice that he’s overlooking. What Brooks said "is like talking about the money in your bank account by only looking at deposits and ignoring withdrawals," said Gary T. Mitchum, a professor and associate dean at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science. "It’s just flawed. I sure wish I could get away with this at my bank." Why Antarctica might see an increase in ice How could ice increase due to global warming? It stems from the tendency for a warmer climate to produce more precipitation. In the context of Antarctica, this means increased amounts of frozen precipitation. "On the whole, the amount of precipitation increases in the coldest climates as they warm," said John Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University atmospheric sciences professor. "This comes about because the amount of moisture the atmosphere can hold -- and thus deliver as snow -- increases dramatically as the temperature warms." In fact, there’s already evidence of this occurring in certain parts of Antarctica. One paper documenting this was written by Jay Zwally, a glaciologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 2015. He found significant increases in ice in eastern Antarctica. Zwally is considered a credible scientist, but other scientists said his methodology in the study is not foolproof. Critics suggest that much of the increase Zwally measured may be coming from additional snow rather than ice. Because ice contains more water than snow does, an increase in snow rather than ice would mean that Antarctica isn’t taking as much water out of circulation as the paper suggests. Indeed, a study using a different method, headed by Alba Martin-Español of the University of Bristol in England, concluded that the ice gains in eastern Antarctica were only about one-third as large as Zwally had found. Why that added ice may not matter much An even more important point is that any ice gains need to be measured against losses elsewhere. To look only at the ice gains, as Brooks did, amounts to cherry picking. "The important thing for science and policy is whether there's a net gain or loss of ice on Antarctica" from all sources, Nielsen-Gammon said. Scientists we checked with agreed that, while Antarctica’s increased banking of water through precipitation is a real phenomenon, it pales in comparison with the amount of water being lost through melting. Basically, the continent may be adding ice in one place, but it’s losing a larger amount elsewhere due to melting, evaporation, or glaciers falling into the sea. "Rep. Brooks is correct that one may expect an increase in precipitation in a warmer climate," said Justin C. Burton, a physicist at Emory University. "However, this is a small feedback effect compared to melting from a warmer climate, and especially a warmer ocean." For the past few decades, most scientific studies have shown that the net change in ice has produced shrinkage overall, not expansion, said Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. In western Antarctica, Scientific American has reported, "the floating platforms of ice that ring the coast are thinning, glaciers are surging toward the sea, meltwater is flowing across the surface, fast-growing moss is turning the once shimmering landscape green, and a massive iceberg the size of Delaware broke off into the ocean in July of 2017." "The near unanimous view is that the net effect, by a pretty big margin, would be melting," said John Reilly, co-director of the joint program on the science and policy of global change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The fear, he said, is that ice "will break loose and float out, raising sea level and in turn reduce the friction holding back ice on shore, which will then flow faster into the ocean." Given this degree of melting, Scambos said, the likeliest impact from the increased snowfall that Brooks is pointing to would be to "slow the pace of ice loss slightly," Scambos said. "Greenland, which is somewhat more impacted by climate change, has not shown enough increase in precipitation to offset the very large peripheral losses in the past few decades." Even beyond melting, sea level is increasing as the temperature warms because when water gets warmer, it expands. It’s worth noting that the net change in sea level has zig-zagged a bit. In 2011, for instance, it fell, prompting some to suggest an end to the problem. However, sea levels soon started rising again. Such blips are "common," said Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz. "There are year to year variations, but the overall trend is clear." All told, "the vast majority of scientists agree that a warming climate will most certainly lead to a net ice loss from Antarctica," Burton said. "The question is really how much and how fast?" Our ruling Brooks said, "You’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming." Scientists agree that parts of Antarctica may already be seeing higher levels of frozen precipitation due to global warming. However, focusing on this increase amounts to cherry-picking, because the same higher temperatures also mean faster melting of existing Antarctic ice. On balance, scientists expect the amount of ice lost from added melting to be much higher than the amount of ice added from greater precipitation. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00545	On same-sex marriage.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/	On the day that the U.S. Supreme Court was poised to hear oral arguments about same-sex marriage April 28, Hillary Clinton changed her "H" logo to rainbow-colored and tweeted: "Every loving couple & family deserves to be recognized & treated equally under the law across our nation. #LoveMustWin #LoveCantWait." Clinton came out in support of same-sex marriage in 2013 after more than a decade of opposing it. But her views are particularly in the spotlight now that she is a presidential candidate. We decided to put Clinton’s statements about same-sex marriage on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether a candidate has changed their views without making a value judgment about such flips. We found that as public opinion shifted toward support for same-sex marriage, so did Clinton. She has had plenty of company among members of her own party to change their stance on same-sex marriage. In 2012, we gave Obama a Full Flop when he announced his support for same-sex marriage. Currently about three dozen states allow same-sex marriage. The outcome of the decision, expected in June, could mean either that same-sex marriage will become legal in all states or that some states will institute new bans on same-sex marriage. (A spokesman for Clinton’s campaign declined to comment for this Flip-O-Meter item.) Clinton’s statements during her 2000 Senate race In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined federal marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Hillary Clinton would face questions about same-sex marriage starting with her 2000 campaign for Senate. Let’s look at the highlights of her statements between 1999 and 2015 in a timeline: December 1999: Clinton told a group of gay contributors at a fundraiser that she was against the "don't ask, don't tell" military policy signed by her husband. The New York Times reported that Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said she supported the Defense of Marriage Act but added that "same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets." January 2000: At a news conference in White Plains, Clinton said, "Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman. But I also believe that people in committed gay marriages, as they believe them to be, should be given rights under the law that recognize and respect their relationship." April 2000: Clinton again expressed support for civil unions. "I have supported the kind of rights and responsibilities that are being extended to gay couples in Vermont," she said. July 2004: Clinton spoke on the Senate floor against a proposed federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage. (The amendment ultimately failed.) Though she opposed it, she said that she believed that marriage was "a sacred bond between a man and a woman." However, she said she took "umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage, or to the fundamental bedrock principle that exists between a man and a woman." October 2006: Clinton told a group of gay elected officials that she would support same-sex marriage in New York if a future governor and Legislature chose to enact such a law. "I support states making the decision," she said. As a 2008 presidential candidate In 2007, all the presidential contenders except for longshot candidates -- both Democrats and GOP -- were against same-sex marriage, the New York Times reported. So were the majority of Americans, polls showed. May 2007: In a questionnaire for the Human Rights Campaign in 2007, Clinton backed away from the Defense of Marriage Act: "I support repealing the provision of DOMA that may prohibit the federal government from providing benefits to people in states that recognize same-sex marriage." In response to a question about whether marriage should be made legally available to two committed adults of the same sex, Clinton marked that she was "opposed" though she stated she supported civil unions. August 2007: In a Democratic primary debate sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and LOGO Network (a gay-oriented TV station) Clinton was asked "What is at the heart of your opposition to same-sex marriage?" Clinton replied: "Well, I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions. You know, it’s a personal position. How we get to full equality is the debate we’re having, and I am absolutely in favor of civil unions with full equality of benefits, rights, and privileges." As a 2016 presidential candidate As Clinton got ready for her second presidential bid, she again modified her position. March 2013: After leaving her position as secretary of state, she announced her support for same-sex marriage in a video with the Human Rights Campaign on March 18, 2013. "LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones. And they are full and equal citizens, and they deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage. That’s why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples. I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law, embedded in a broader effort to advance equality and opportunity for LGBT Americans and all Americans." The comments put her in line with other Democrats at the time who were mentioned as potential 2016 presidential contenders, including Vice President Joe Biden, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Obama had announced his support for same-sex marriage in May 2012. June 2013: Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton issued a joint statement about the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the Defense of Marriage Act. The congratulatory note didn’t mention that Bill Clinton had signed the law back in 1996: "the Court recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union." June 2014: NPR’s Terry Gross grilled Clinton about her past positions’ on gay marriage in what led to a testy exchange. Gross tried to get Clinton to explain if she had truly changed her stance or if the shifting political landscape made it possible for her to announce her support. At one point Gross asked, "Would you say your view evolved since the '90s or that the American public evolved, allowing you to state your real view?" Clinton replied: "I think I'm an American. (Laughing) And I think we have all evolved, and it's been one of the fastest, most sweeping transformations." April 2015: On the day of the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments about same-sex marriage bans in a handful of states in April, Clinton changed her "H" logo to rainbow-colored and tweeted a message of support: "Every loving couple & family deserves to be recognized & treated equally under the law across our nation. #LoveMustWin #LoveCantWait." Our conclusion Clinton opposed same-sex marriage as a candidate for the Senate, while in office as a senator, and while running for president in 2008. She expressed her support for civil unions starting in 2000 and for the rights’ of states to set their own laws in favor of same-sex marriage in 2006. As polls showed that a majority of Americans supported same-sex marriage, Clinton’s views changed, too. She announced her support for same-sex marriage in March 2013. It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about her changed stance, but on same-sex marriage we give Clinton a Full Flop.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-06-17T10:42:01	2013-03-18	['None']
pomt-06968	"New Mexico is the second Hollywood" because of tax incentives for the film industry.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/15/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-tax-breaks-made-new-mexico-secon/	Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson is basing his Republican presidential campaign on his fiscal conservatism and libertarian stands, but he’s also big on tax breaks, like the rest of the GOP field. In an interview in Manchester, N.H., in June 2011 with the New Hampshire Business Review and thelobbynh.com, Johnson cited a 15 percent film production tax credit he signed in 2002, his last year in office, as the type of pro-business tax relief that can help create jobs. Under the incentive, spending on production and post-production film and television work subject to New Mexico state taxes, including wages paid to state residents and nonresident actors working through a personal service corporation, can generate a tax credit now worth up to 25 percent. (The program was capped at $50 million worth of tax credits available annually as of July 1, 2011.) "They passed a film incentive bill in New Mexico. The idea was to make New Mexico the second Hollywood. I signed the bill. I said I'm going to sign this bill but doesn't everyone see that we could be doing this for every business in New Mexico? ... It will happen. This will happen. But why the film industry? Why not all of us that have been here working all this time," Johnson said. "Well, did it work?" asked Review editor Jeff Feingold. "Yeah, it's the second Hollywood of all 50 states. New Mexico is the second Hollywood," Johnson said. Met with some friendly laughter, he continued: "No, it is, it is. They built all sorts of film studios. I can just go down the list, I can click down the list for you of all the movies that have been made in New Mexico." Johnson may have greenlighted the tax incentives for the film industry but has New Mexico’s program become a Hollywood blockbuster? The state certainly is scenic and hip -- spend a few nights in Santa Fe and a sunny day driving the High Road to Taos, and you may want to move to the Land of Enchantment, pronto. Albuquerque is only a 90-minute flight for actors and producers flying in from Los Angeles, and the sunny weather in winter and high-altitude temperatures in the summer makes for a cooperative climate for shoots, as well. But when PolitiFact asked about Johnson’s claim, his campaign wasn’t able to provide much substantiation and said determining "the second Hollywood" isn’t easy. In an e-mail, the Johnson campaign’s communications director, Joe Hunter, wrote: "While quantifying -- or even determining how to quantify -- that New Mexico or any other state is the ‘second Hollywood’ is obviously imprecise, Governor Johnson’s statement was made in the context of having signed into law tax credits that were tremendously successful in attracting the film industry to the state. Those tax credits worked, and New Mexico is consistently identified as one of the best locales for film production." Actually, it is possible to compare the size of film industries in various states, and New Mexico does have a decent story to tell. For starters, it’s no California, which tallies its film and television industry at $30 billion a year, with 140,000 production jobs, according to Amy Lemisch, executive director of the California Film Commission. And New Mexico is not about to supplant New York either. In 2008, 63,000 people were employed as actors, camera operators, film editors and other production and post-production jobs in the state, with film and television-related wages of about $5 billion, according to the New York Office of the State Comptroller. Industry experts say New Mexico can rival Louisiana, generally perceived as the third-largest state for the film and TV industry, especially since Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson, who succeeded Johnson, helped expand the incentive program, including raising the tax credit to 25 percent. Both states adopted film tax credits in 2002, and an estimated $674 million was directly spent on motion picture productions in Louisiana in 2010. Since the tax credit became law, the state has averaged 92 productions, and more than 6,000 jobs per year, according to Louisiana Entertainment, the state agency that works with the film industry. Louisiana has recently been the locale for Twilight: Breaking Dawn, Battle: Los Angeles, Green Lantern and 21 Jump Street, a new movie based on the TV series. Meanwhile, in fiscal year 2010 in New Mexico, $204 million was spent directly on filming, creating 184,120 "worker days" and a financial impact of $612 million, according to the New Mexico Film Office. And as the state’s production facilities – like the state-of-the-art Albuquerque Studios-- have grown and matured, the "filmography" from the state has increased from five major productions in 2003 to 17 in 2011. Among the films and TV shows shot in New Mexico over the past nine years are Rent, Transformers, Fright Night, No Country for Old Men, Breaking Bad, True Grit, In Plain Sight and Marvel’s The Avengers. Still, it’s a stretch to call the state "the second Hollywood." Jeff Begun of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based The Incentives Office, which tracks inducements from various states for the film-production industry, said by e-mail that New Mexico "is not the second Hollywood -- particularly with the new $50 million ‘rolling cap’ per year" recently imposed on available tax credits in the state. Begun said a handful of other states host more production than New Mexico, and "If anything, Louisiana would be the second Hollywood -- I think they will do fairly close to a billion dollars in production this year. "That being said, N.M. is not bad -- a 25% refundable credit with $50 million available represents about $250 million in production," Begun noted. Similarly, Joe Chianese, the senior vice president of tax production planning and business development at Entertainment Partners in Burbank, Calif., said calling New Mexico the new second Hollywood "is probably being a bit overdramatic." But he also said the state "has been busy," and noted that the crew base in New Mexico has grown from less than 300 a decade ago to more than 3,000 now. Lemisch, the director of the California Film Commission, also suggested Johnson’s claim was a bit over the top but not without some foundation. "Obviously, he was exaggerating, but New Mexico has been quite a hub, but not as much a hub as Louisiana," she said. To be clear, New Mexico hasn’t gotten all the business it wanted. Although the Disney Channel zit-flick High School Musical is set in Albuquerque, it actually was shot in Utah, which also offered incentives. It’s also worth noting that the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group that researches tax and budget issues, last year reported that 41 states followed New Mexico and Louisiana’s lead, but that many of the tax credits were costing the states money while generating few meaningful jobs for in-state residents. The study said employment in the film and video production industry grew "six-fold" in the two states between 2002 and 2008, and that New Mexico also had used its colleges and universities to foster the industry. But the study also noted that employment dipped in 2009 during the recession and that the California firm that owns Albuquerque Studios, which has four of the largest sound stages in the country, filed for bankruptcy in July 2010. The studio has continued to operate during the reorganization, with major productions such as The Avengers and Breaking Bad being filmed there. So was Gov. Johnson overstating the case when he said New Mexico has turned into the "second Hollywood"? Of course, but hey, it’s show business. And he is correct in asserting that New Mexico has become a player in the movie industry. We’ll give him a Half True.	None	Gary Johnson	None	None	None	2011-07-15T06:00:00	2011-07-14	['New_Mexico']
pomt-12796	In the "past few weeks," President Donald Trump pointed out "Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ‘Israel must be destroyed.’ "	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/15/benjamin-netanyahu/benjamin-netanyahu-largely-correct-iranian-missile/	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of the danger to his country from Iranian ballistic missiles in his first joint news conference with President Donald Trump. Israel has been firmly opposed to the United States-Iran nuclear agreement even before it was signed during the Obama administration. Trump was often critical of the deal on the campaign trail. Two weeks before the Feb. 15 news conference, Iran tested a medium-range ballistic missile that could theoretically reach Israel, as well as many other targets in the region. The Trump administration considers Iran’s Jan. 29 test to be against the terms of the agreement, while Iran considers it permissible. Days later, the Trump administration announced new sanctions on Iran, specifically citing the missile test as the reason. At the news conference, Netanyahu said his goal, and Trump’s, is to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. "I think beyond that," he said, "President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. He pointed out there are violations — Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ‘Israel must be destroyed.’ Iranian Foreign Minister (Mohammad Javad) Zarif said, ‘Our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country.’ No, they write on the missiles in Hebrew, ‘Israel must be destroyed.’" A reader asked us to check what Netanyahu said about the Hebrew lettering. So we took a closer look. The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not reply to an inquiry, but we found news reports from March 2016, such as this one in the Times of Israel, that discussed such an incident. The claim was sourced to the Fars news service, which has been described as a "semi-official" organ of the Iranian government. We tracked down the Fars article, dated March 9, 2016. It said that the the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had successfully launched two "Qadr H" ballistic missiles at a target in southeastern Iran 1,400 kilometers away. It described the Qadr as a liquid-fueled ballistic missile that "can reach territories as far as Israel." (The Obama administration condemned the test.) "One missile," the Fars post said, "had a message written on it that said in Hebrew, ‘Israel should be wiped off the Earth.’ " The English-language version of the Fars site didn’t include the exact words, but the Times of Israel article showed a screenshot of the Farsi-language page, which specifies the Hebrew phrase "Yisrael Tsricha LeHimachek Me’Al." The Times of Israel noted dryly that "the words mean ‘Israel must be wiped out from.’ Apparently, Iran’s Hebrew writers intended to complete the phrase with something to the effect of ‘the face of the Earth’ but messed up their translation." The translation of the Hebrew in the Times of Israel article is accurate, said Michael J. Koplow, policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, a group that advocates for a negotiated two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Koplow and other experts said they see no reason to doubt the accuracy of the Fars post. "This story has the ring of truth to it because I do not see why Iran would lie about it," said Michael M. Gunter, a Tennessee Technological University political scientist who studies the region. We won’t quibble over the exact wording, which Netanyahu got wrong but which conveys the same message. But we will raise one caveat. Hearing Netanyahu’s comments, one could assume that he’s talking about the most recent missile tests from January 2017, rather than the ones from 2016. Not only did his comment about the Hebrew lettering immediately follow a mention of the most recent tests, but he used the present tense to say that "these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew." We found no evidence that the most recent round of tests included missiles with threats written in Hebrew letters. "It is striking to me that Prime Minister Netanyahu must go back to an Iranian report of a March 2016 ballistic missile test to make his point about malign Iranian intentions," said Greg Thielmann, a former foreign service officer and Senate Intelligence Committee staffer who is now a board member at the Arms Control Association. He suggested that the Hebrew lettering may have been "a one-time event, and not necessarily authorized in Tehran." The botching of the text may suggest that the gambit was ad-hoc "sloganeering" by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, "rather than an explicit policy dictated from the top," Thielmann said. Our ruling Netanyahu said, "President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. He pointed out there are violations -- Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests.

pomt-03463	Says that when the Rolling Stones performed in an Austin park, they paid $25,000 to the nearby city of Rollingwood "for one night of inconvenience."	/texas/statements/2013/jun/17/barry-bone/rollingwood-mayor-says-rolling-stones-donated-2500/	Barry Bone says private interests that profit from occupying Austin’s Zilker Park for concerts should routinely compensate Rollingwood, a 1-square-mile city on the other side of MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) from the park. Bone, the city’s mayor, declared in an opinion column published in the June 13, 2013, edition of the weekly Westlake Picayune that C3, the promoters behind the annual Austin City Limits Music Festival, had rebuffed his request that it pay $150,000 to Rollingwood "for six nights of disruption, plus expenses, to compensate our city for the festival." Bone added: "When the Rolling Stones rolled through a few years back, they paid us $25,000 for one night of inconvenience." Talk about satisfaction. Did the Stones really pony up? We took our first cue from a Feb. 8, 2007, Austin American-Statesman news story stating the Stones’ October 2006 concert resulted in about $300,000 in proceeds going toward beautifying neighborhood parks and Zilker Park. The plans, the story said, were announced by the Austin Parks Foundation, which was described as intending to award the money as grants. "Half of it will be spent on improving smaller parks in the Barton Hills, Zilker, Bouldin Creek, Old West Austin, West Austin and Rollingwood neighborhoods," the story said, with the remaining $150,000 devoted to the park’s irrigation system. Spread $150,000 evenly among six neighborhoods and it comes to $25,000 each. But that’s indirect guidance; we sought definitive evidence. By email, Bone guided us to Abel Campos, a city accountant, who emailed us a copy of a $25,000 check, dated Jan. 12, 2007, made out to the city by the parks foundation. Campos also shared a March 20, 2007, letter to the city from Charlie McCabe, then the foundation's executive director, stating the money reflected proceeds from the Rolling Stones concert. Our ruling Bone said the Rolling Stones gave $25,000 to Rollingwood after the band performed at Zilker Park. That’s the amount of money that flowed through the Austin Parks Foundation to the city described as proceeds from the big show. We rate the statement as True.

pomt-09151	Starting in 2011, "you will be required to pay taxes" on "the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/10/chain-email/w-2-tax-forms-hr-3590-health-insurance-pay-taxes/	A new chain e-mail makes the claim that most people, even retirees, will see big tax increases next year thanks to President Barack Obama's new health care law, because it will start taxing health insurance as regular income. "You really need to read this," it begins. "Starting in 2011 (next year folks) your W2 tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company. It does not matter if that's a private concern or governmental body of some sort. If you're retired? So what; your gross will go up by the amount of insurance you get. You will be required to pay taxes on a large sum of money that you have never seen. "Take your tax form you just finished and see what $15,000 or $20,000 additional gross does to your tax debt. That's what you'll pay next year. For many it also puts you into a new higher bracket so it's even worse. This is how the government is going to buy insurance for 15% that don't have insurance and it's only part of the tax increases." The chain e-mail is correct that employers will be required to start listing the cost of insurance. The requirement starts for the tax year 2011, so employees will see it on the W-2s they receive in 2012. But that amount will not be taxed. Current law excludes health insurance from taxable income, and there's nothing in the health care law that changes that. Several experts on health care benefits and the workplace confirmed that. "It will not affect your taxable income under the new law," said Dallas Salisbury of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in an e-mail interview. Since the health care law actually continues the tax exemption on employer-sponsored insurance, why include a requirement that employers report the value of health insurance on the W-2? There are several reasons. The new health insurance law will eventually penalize people who are not insured with a tax penalty. The W-2 reporting requirement will help the Internal Revenue Service verify that people have coverage, both for themselves and their dependents. There's also a tax on the so-called "Cadillac" or "gold-plated" health insurance policies, which are policies that cost significantly more than the national average. The W-2 reporting will allow the IRS to more easily collect the tax. We should also emphasize that the Cadillac tax doesn't go into effect until 2018, and it will apply to health insurance plans that cost more than $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, with some exceptions for people in high-risk categories. Most people will not be affected by the tax; analysts expect it to hit fewer than 20 percent of all policies. The chain e-mail we looked at goes the extra mile to promote its deceptive claim that everyone will be taxed next year, however. "Joan Pryde is the senior tax editor for the Kiplinger letters. Go to Kiplingers and read about 13 tax changes that could affect you. Number 3 is what I just told you about," the chain e-mail states. "Why am I sending you this? The same reason I hope you forward this to every single person in your address book. People have the right to know the truth because an election is coming in November." We looked up the Kiplinger letter and couldn't help noticing that the article states the following: "A requirement that businesses include the value of the health care benefits they provide to employees on W-2s, beginning with W-2s for 2011. The amount reported is not considered taxable income." Got that? "Not considered taxable income." So the e-mail's own evidence refutes its premise. The e-mail is correct that employers will have to let employees know how much their health insurance costs the employer. But the e-mail's main point -- and the fact that we're checking here -- is that you will be taxed on your health insurance. That is not only wrong, but refuted by its own reference. Assuming the e-mail's author read that Kiplinger entry, we can only conclude that this is a deliberate attempt to upset and mislead voters. This sort of fear mongering rates a Pants on Fire.

pomt-00544	"When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Japan? It doesn’t exist, folks."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-chevrolet-tokyo-japan-doesnt-exist/	Bombastic billionaire and new GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump painted the United States as an international embarrassment these days, losing on everything from jobs to car sales to other countries. "When did we beat Japan at anything?" Trump said in announcing his candidacy June 16, 2015. "They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time." We couldn’t travel to Tokyo for this fact-check, but we did hear from Chevy and other sources to shed light on whether it’s really true that Chevy "doesn’t exist" in Tokyo. Literally, it’s not true. Chevy sells cars in Japan in four models: Sonic, Captiva, Camaro and Corvette. (Here's a screenshot of www.ChevroletJapan.com): But Trump, in what we might describe as his Trumped-up speaking style, has a point in that Chevy’s Japanese sales are a big struggle story. In 2014, Chevrolet sold 597 cars in Japan. No, we are not forgetting any zeroes at the end of that figure. "To be sure, if you visit Tokyo, chances are you won’t see a single American brand car during your entire stay," said Hans Greimel, the Asia editor of Automotive News who has documented GM’s troubles in Japan. "They are incredibly rare here because their reputation is bad, and their sales are so low." Still, GM-owned Chevys and Cadillacs, plus Fords and Jeeps, are all actively sold, Greimel said. Import sales data show Chevrolet sold 367 vehicles in the first five months of 2015. Cadillac sold 358, Ford sold almost 2,000, and Jeep sold 2,756. Japanese automakers — Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Daihatsu, Subaru, Mitsubishi — accounted for 92 percent of the 5.45 million vehicles sold in Japan in 2014, according to financial research group IHS Automotive. One issue: In Japan, like in the United Kingdom, motorists drive on the left side of the road with the steering wheel on the right side. GM sells two Chevy cars with right-hand drive in Japan, Greimel reported, but not in Cadillac. GM spokesman Jim Cain calls GM’s strategy in Asia "a question of priorities." The Japanese market is tough for non-domestic manufacturers to crack. "We’re concentrating on markets and segments where we can be a successful and profitable growing enterprise," Cain said, "and the reality is that the barriers to entry in Japan are very high for foreign automakers." GM is more aggressive in China, Singapore and South Korea. In 2014, Chevrolet sold 700,000 cars in China, according to its 2014 global sales report. A spokesperson for Trump did not return our email. Our ruling Trump said Chevrolet cars in Tokyo don’t exist. Literally, that’s not true. Chevy sells cars in Japan. However, Chevy sales are more like a trickle compared to the flood of Japanese brands in the market. A journalist who covers the auto industry in Japan told us visitors would not likely see a Chevy during their stay in Japan. Trump has a point here, but he should have used different words to make it. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-06-17T11:45:24	2015-06-16	['Japan']
pomt-13572	"In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature," but it’s still only "19 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/22/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-correct-about-how-poorly-us-fares-percen/	Hillary Clinton is running to become the first female president in American history. But even as she makes her potentially historic run, the number of women in Congress remains far from parity with men, said Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine. "In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the Federal legislature, 19 percent," said Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia. "That's the best job we've ever done. Hold on for this, folks: Nineteen percent ranks the United States 75th in the world, below the global average. Iraq is 26 percent. Afghanistan, 28 percent. Number one? Rwanda, 64 percent." We wondered if Kaine is correct that "in Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature," but it’s still only "19 percent." First, let’s look at the 19 percent number. According to the World Bank, which cites data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the 19 percent figure is right on for 2015. The U.S. figure has remained at 19 percent in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union data, which is current through June 2016. Specifically, in 2016, there are 104 women serving in both chambers of Congress, comprising 19.4 percent of the 535 combined members. (In all, 76 are Democrats and 28 are Republicans.) Chamber by chamber, 20 women serve in the Senate, accounting for 20 percent of all members in the chamber, and 84 women serve in the House, accounting for 19.3 percent. Is 19 percent the highest in United States history? As it turns out, Kaine is correct on that point, too, as the following chart from the Congressional Research Service shows. "It's pretty straightforward," said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics. "It's a record high, but it's quite low." If anything, Kaine underplayed the United States’ deficit compared to the rest of the world. The U.S. rank has bounced around a bit over the past year, but it places 96th in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union rankings, among 191 countries for which there is data. That’s even worse than the 75th-place finish Kaine cited. By comparison, the other countries Kaine mentioned did better, though hardly close to male-female parity. Iraq had 27 percent female legislators (58th in the most recent rankings), Afghanistan had 29 percent (ranking 50th) and Rwanda was indeed No. 1 in the world with 64 percent. Our ruling Kaine said, "In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature," but it’s still only "19 percent." He’s right that the current figure for the United States is 19 percent, and he’s right that that’s a record high.

pomt-05627	"More than half of the births in Texas are paid for by Medicaid."	/texas/statements/2012/mar/24/elliott-naishtat/democratic-legislators-say-more-half-texas-births-/	In an op-ed column questioning the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from a women’s contraception program, Austin members of the Texas House say the result would be more government-funded births. "More than half of the births in Texas are paid for by Medicaid and, without this (women’s) program, that percentage will undoubtedly increase," says the column posted on the Austin American-Statesman’s website on March 5, 2012. The Medicaid Women’s Health Program, which has a goal of reducing Medicaid-funded births, has not been eliminated, though its federal ties are in transition. Specifically, the Statesman op-ed article, by Democratic Reps. Elliott Naishtat, Dawnna Dukes, Eddie Rodriguez, Mark Strama and Donna Howard, objects to a move by the state’s Republican leaders to remove Planned Parenthood clinics as providers in the 5-year-old program, which has annually offered contraception and cancer screenings to tens of thousands of low-income women. After the state action, the federal government announced that it was phasing out its aid to the Texas program. Gov. Rick Perry replied that state funds would be found to make up for the loss. While none of the barred clinics provided abortions, state leaders said they were rightly enforcing a state law against state aid reaching any clinic with a connection to Planned Parenthood, which has other clinics that do provide abortions. We can’t judge the Democrats’ prediction that more births will need to be paid for by Medicaid because of these turns. For this article, we wondered if indeed more than half of Texas births are currently covered by Medicaid, the government insurance program that mostly serves low-income mothers and children. Naishtat’s legislative director, Nancy Walker, passed along a January 2011 Texas Health and Human Services Commission presentation, "Medicaid and Healthy Babies," stating that more than 55 percent of Texas births are paid for by Medicaid. "Medicaid is the primary public coverage program providing prenatal and perinatal care in Texas, and is the primary payor of all Texas births," the presentation says. "Texas spends over $2.2 billion per year in birth and delivery related services." In 2001, Medicaid covered 47.5 percent of all Texas births, according to a chart in the presentation. The Medicaid-funded share of births escalated to 56.5 percent in 2006, 56.3 percent in 2007 and 55.4 percent in 2008. By email, commission spokesman Geoffrey Wool confirmed the cited figures, adding that in 2010, 56.9 percent of Texas births -- or 220,899 out of 388,447 total births -- were covered by Medicaid, at an average cost of $11,600. He provided a commission chart showing the share of births funded by Medicaid for each state fiscal year from 2004 through 2010. Wool said the state’s share of the $2.2 billion annually paid by Medicaid for Texas births and related services is about $900 million. We rate the Democrats’ claim about Medicaid paying for more than half of Texas births as True.	None	Elliott Naishtat	None	None	None	2012-03-24T06:00:00	2012-03-05	['Texas']
pomt-03552	Says, "In Oregon in 2010, 49 percent of all pregnancies were unintended."	/oregon/statements/2013/may/24/carolyn-tomei/were-half-all-pregnancies-oregon-unintended/	In honor of National Women’s Health Week, Oregon Rep. Carolyn Tomei, D-Milwaukie, talked up the benefits of a health initiative that encourages primary care providers to ask women whether they wish to get pregnant within the year or not. The goal is to provide prenatal care to women who want a baby and contraception options to those who do not. Unintended pregnancies stress out family finances as well as taxpayers, who pick up the cost for half of all births in Oregon, Tomei said on the floor of the Oregon House. "In Oregon in 2010, 49 percent of all pregnancies were unintended. Fifty-three percent of all deliveries were paid for by Medicaid," she said. PolitiFact Oregon was intrigued by the statistic that nearly half of all pregnancies in Oregon in 2010 were unintended. How would anyone track that? What does it mean? Plus, we wanted to know if Medicaid -- a portion of which is called the Oregon Health Plan in Oregon -- paid for 53 percent of all deliveries. PRAMS Tomei said she relied on information from the Oregon Health Authority’s Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Systemsurvey. The questions asked of a sampling of new mothers include alcohol consumption, child safety, breast feeding and family planning. Here’s the question Tomei said was relevant to this fact check: When you got pregnant with your new baby, were you trying to get pregnant? In 2010, 46.4 percent of new mothers surveyed said they were not trying to get pregnant. Nearly 53 percent of women said that the Oregon Health Plan or Medicaid helped pay for delivery, according to the survey. So part of what she said on the floor is backed up by the Oregon Health Authority, but the statement we’re checking is off by a few percentage points. At the same time, we found an analysis by PolitiFact Rhode Island, which checked a similar claim by a R.I. state representative who said in 2011 that "nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended." The representative received a True. The source was the Guttmacher Institute, a New York City-based group well known for its research on reproductive health. Researchers reported 49 percent of pregnancies in the United States were unintendedin 2006. In Oregon, 49 percent of pregnancies were unintended as well. So Tomei might be correct, albeit for a different year, based on Guttmacher. But bear with us, because the issue, we learned, is rather complicated. An unintended pregnancy is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Oregon Health Authority as one where the woman wanted to be pregnant later or not at all. An intended pregnancy is one where the woman wanted to be pregnant at that moment, or sooner. However, and this is important, the "pregnancy intendedness" question on the PRAMS survey is not the one that Tomei relied on to derive intention. In 2010, the percentage of new moms who wanted to be pregnant at that moment, or sooner, was 63.3. The percentage of new moms who wanted to be pregnant later or not at all was 36.6, and not 49 percent or 46.4 percent. A 2012 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds Oregon is the norm: about 37 percent of births in the United States in 2006-10 stemmed from unintended pregnancies. So why are Guttmacher numbers higher? The group based its analysis on all pregnancies, including those resulting in births, abortions and miscarriages. We can see how that would increase the percentage of mistimed or unwanted pregnancies. The question relied on by Tomei has to do with family planning. The other question has to do with "pregnancy intendedness." We honestly doubt the average person -- even a lawmaker -- could tell the difference without explanatory assistance from public health officials. The ruling If you accept Tomei’s interpretation of intended as meaning "trying to get pregnant," 49 percent is just a few points shy of 46. 4 percent. We’d give that a Mostly True since the numbers are so close. If you want to stick to a more rigid definition of unintended pregnancy, she would also be largely correct, albeit for the year 2006, based on the Guttmacher statistic. Remember, Guttmacher includes a broader universe of pregnancies, including not only births but abortions and miscarriages as well. Tomei would not be correct, however, based on the intendedness question in the PRAMS survey, which limits results to new moms who gave birth in 2010. And, according to a state epidemiologist with whom we spoke, this question is perhaps not the best way to gauge intention. PolitiFact Oregon rates the accuracy of the statement, not the ins and outs of the survey from which the statement comes. In the colloquial sense, Tomei is off by a few points. In the survey sense, she is backed up by a national study, although for a different year. We find those two factors are enough to find her statement accurate, but needing both clarification and additional information. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11523	Says he’s a "retired U.S. Navy officer."	/texas/statements/2018/feb/16/george-p-bush/george-p-bush-falsely-describes-himself-retired-na/	George P. Bush, seeking a second term as state land commissioner, touts his time in the Navy in a voter mailer brought to our attention by his predecessor. "Did you know there are 1.7 million veterans in Texas alone?" Bush’s mailer opens. His message continues: "Retired U.S. Navy officer George P. Bush is committed to protecting our veterans who have served this great nation." Hold on. Did Bush, who turns 42 in April 2018, retire from the Navy? Jerry Patterson, the former land commissioner challenging Bush in this year’s Republican primary, questioned that after telling us he’d received Bush’s mailer at his home after hearing about it from other veterans. Patterson asserted by phone: "It takes 20 years to retire from the armed forces." He himself, Patterson said, retired from the Marines as a lieutenant colonel after more than 20 years of service. "If this mailing goes out to military veterans, essentially he’s saying I know what you went through, I served for 20 years--and that’s not true," Patterson said. We decided to check the facts. For starters, Bush was a Navy Reserve officer. By email, Navy spokeswoman Katie Suich gave us a document confirming that George Prescott Bush was commissioned as a Navy Reserve officer on May 21, 2007, and left the Navy Reserve as a lieutenant on May 9, 2017. Bush's biographical entry on his campaign website says Bush served in "Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan as an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve." In a 2011 article for USA Today, Bush wrote: "Earlier this year, I returned to Texas from Afghanistan, where I was deployed as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve." Bush noted then that he’d been inspired to enlist in his thirties after a ceremony honoring his grandfather, President George H.W. Bush, who served during World War II. Bush campaign spokesman, Lee Spieckerman, told us that Bush was honorably discharged from the Navy in 2017, "having achieved the rank of Lieutenant." Spieckerman also passed along documents and photos including a May 15, 2007, letter congratulating Bush on his selection as an intelligence officer and a certificate showing Bush was honorably discharged as a lieutenant on May 9, 2017. Another provided document, dated Feb. 4, 2011, discharges Bush from active duty. The form says Bush served one year, four months and 15 days on active duty from June 8, 2010, through Feb. 4, 2011, following on 26 days of active duty before that. (Spieckerman showed in another document that Bush was assigned to Afghanistan from August 2010 to January 2011.) The discharge form credits Bush with previously racking up two years, 11 months and five days of inactive duty. Navy confirmation of service dates, retirement requirements We also reached out to the Navy which says on a web page: "If you decide to pursue your Navy career for at least 20 years, you’ll qualify for generous retirement pay – and even more if you serve longer." Another Navy web page says that by serving in the Navy Reserve, a person earns "points toward retirement benefits every time you drill." Suich also pointed out a Defense Finance and Accounting Service web page listing types of military retirement, most of them requiring 15 or 20 years of service. According to the page, reservists can retire at age 60 with 20 years of active service. For our part, we spotted a Defense Department website devoted to military compensation including this statement: "Service members who remain on active duty or serve in the Reserves or Guard for a sufficient period of time (usually a minimum of 20 years) may retire and receive retired pay. Members who become disabled while on duty may be medically retired and receive a disability retirement." Spieckerman says 'retired' used in colloquial sense We asked Bush’s campaign if he’s indeed a retired officer given the general requirement that a retiree serve 20 years and be age 60. By email, Spieckerman replied that Bush "was honorably discharged but is not technically ‘retired’ under Department of Defense regulations. I think that the campaign used the term ‘retired’ in campaign materials in the civilian, colloquial sense," meaning, Spieckerman wrote, that Bush "is no longer active in the military. There was no intent to imply that he was receiving retirement pay and benefits, etc." Our ruling In a voter mailer, Bush says he’s a "retired U.S. Navy officer." Bush served nearly a decade as an officer in the Navy Reserve. But that doesn’t make him a retired officer, we find. At minimum, Bush would need to have served longer to call himself that.

pomt-01359	The CDC is "spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy" that could be redirected to Ebola.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/20/cory-gardner/amid-ebola-cases-cory-gardner-blasts-cdc-spending-/	As fears over Ebola reached a crescendo, Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., took a shot at the federal government’s handling of the disease during a debate with Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Gardner has been gaining ground in the closely watched Colorado Senate race, and that contest is just one of many around the country in which Ebola has become an issue. Gardner, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, "Perhaps the CDC should quit spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy and direct that money to where it's appropriate in protecting the health of the American people." We wondered if it was true that the government is spending money on jazzercise, urban gardening and the like at the expense of funding for Ebola. We thought this claim deserved a closer look, so we’ll break it down into a few parts. Is the CDC spending money on jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy? We couldn’t nail that down for sure, but it’s plausible. We asked both Gardner’s staff and the CDC for documentation of this claim, but neither got back to us with evidence either way. However, we found an unsigned column from the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page -- a leading source of conservative commentary -- that makes that claim. Here’s an excerpt from that editorial, published on Oct. 9, 2014, which focuses on the Prevention and Public Health Fund, or PPHF: "The PPHF automatically hands the Health and Human Services bureaucracy $15 billion this decade and after that $2 billion a year, with no earmarks, in perpetuity. HHS (of which the CDC is a part) can dip into this honey pot for whatever it pleases. "In 2013 HHS raided the PPHF of $453.8 million, or 48 percent of that year’s appropriation, to fund the Obamacare insurance exchanges. Those PPHF dollars that have flowed to public health are an insult to this once august field. The PPHF sponsors liberal pressure groups to lobby states and cities for higher tobacco taxes and zoning laws that restrict fast food, and its other urgent causes include dance fitness, massage therapy, painting bike lanes, salad bars in school cafeterias, pet neutering and urban gardening. "The core of public health used to be society’s interest in securing the conditions necessary for human survival—mainly meaning epidemiology and combating communicable diseases. The pity is that all too often the current CDC has diluted its mission and budget by funding political causes that the doctors and troops in West Africa (and Texas) don’t need. The list extends to anti-bullying, trans fats, prescription opiate abuse, college rape prevention, workplace wellness, ‘racial and ethnic approaches to community health,’ and promoting breast feeding." We’ll set aside the editorial’s belittling tone toward efforts to combat bullying, drug abuse and rape, and instead investigate the questions it raises about the fund and how it allocates funding. The fund was established with the passage of the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) in 2010. Initially, it was supposed to be funded by $15 billion over its first 10 years; legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama in 2012 cut that amount by $5 billion over 10 years. The purpose of the fund is "to provide expanded and sustained national investments in prevention and public health, to improve health outcomes, and to enhance health care quality." In practice, CDC provides grants to local governments and nonprofits, who then decide how to spend the money to meet public health goals. However, the fund has proved to be "a tempting target for policy makers of both parties," according to an analysis of the fund published in the journal Health Affairs. The authors of the Health Affairs analysis wrote that it "got off to a rocky start," due to complaints by both liberals and conservatives. Liberals expressed concern that Obama was gutting the fund by agreeing to the cuts, which supported the continuation of payroll tax breaks, an extension of unemployment benefits and a "fix" to prevent cuts to physician reimbursement under Medicare -- items that had little if anything to do with preventing disease. Conservatives, for their part, questioned whether the fund needed to exist at all, particularly in a time of growing federal debt. Some Republicans proposed eliminating the fund and using some of the proceeds to pay for repeal of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that small-business owners file 1099 tax reporting forms, Health Affairs reported. Meanwhile, Republicans also questioned whether the government should be paying for things that people can do for free, like exercise. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, dismissed it as a "slush fund ... to build sidewalks, jungle gyms, and swing sets." We were only able to document broad categories of spending from the fund; once we drilled down into online disclosure forms for grants, they didn’t cite such specific details as "jazzercise," "urban gardening" or "massage therapy." But when we asked public-health experts whether such categories could have been spent on the kinds of activities Gardner criticized, they said it’s likely. The fund’s mission is to "improve health and prevent chronic illnesses by expanding preventive care and supporting proven community-based programs that reduce obesity, tobacco use and other preventable conditions, and I would think that healthy food and physical activity efforts would fit right in," said Elizabeth Rigby, an associate professor of public policy and public administration at George Washington University. Glen Mays, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health, agreed. "Are there scientifically proven prevention strategies that involve helping people reach recommended levels of daily exercise through organized group activities like ‘jazzercise, urban gardening, or other forms of physical activity? Absolutely," Mays said, citing CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program and WISEWOMAN program. "Beyond their exercise benefits, gardening programs also have been shown to increase knowledge of and access to healthy food choices, especially in urban and rural food deserts," Mays said, and in certain contexts, massage therapy could fit as well. Bottom line: We aren’t 100 percent sure that CDC dollars have been spent on jazzercise, urban gardens or massage therapy, but it’s quite possible they have been. Does Gardner’s focus accurately describe what the fund does? No, it’s pretty misleading. Here’s a flavor of how CDC plans to spend money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund in fiscal year 2014. (CDC is only one of several federal agencies that’s able to spend money from the fund, though we’ll limit our analysis to CDC because of how Gardner framed his claim.) • Immunization: $160 million; • Smoking prevention: $105 million; • Cancer prevention and control: $104 million; • Heart disease and stroke prevention: $77 million; • Diabetes prevention: $73 million; • Epidemiology and laboratory capacity: $40 million; • Nutrition, physical activity, and obesity: $39 million; • Racial and ethnic approaches to community health: $30 million; • Lead poisoning prevention: $13 million; • Infection prevention in health care facilities: $12 million; • Workplace wellness: $10 million; • Breastfeeding promotion and support: $8 million; • Miscellaneous prevention efforts: $160 million; The total for all these activities: $831 million. More than half went for categories that would be irrelevant for the items Gardner cites. And even within the $300 million-plus spent on items such as preventing obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer, experts are certain that items such as jazzercise represent a tiny fraction of what CDC is spending. The plan’s critics have chosen the silliest-sounding items -- an effective rhetorical tactic, but not a very honest one. (As for the Wall Street Journal editorial’s complaint that CDC has abandoned its traditional role in "combating communicable diseases," we’ll note that the single biggest spending item from the fund is for immunizations.) How solid is the argument that prevention funding should be shifted to Ebola? When the preventive fund was created, lawmakers explicitly tilted the authority for disbursing the funds toward the executive branch, rather than Congress, so there shouldn’t be insurmountable roadblocks to shifting money around. So CDC -- or the agency it reports to, the Department of Health and Human Services -- could probably switch dollars around if it wished. But as it happens, there’s really no need to switch money out of the fund, since the fund can be used directly to pay for Ebola expenses. Remember that $12 million we noted above that’s targeted for "infection prevention in health care facilities" for 2014? That’s relevant because, "right now in the United States, Ebola is exclusively a hospital-acquired infection," Mays said. Indeed, Mays added, the prevention fund is already funding the CDC’s Epidemiology, Laboratory Capacity, and Emerging Infections program, which "supports exactly the types of testing, contact tracing, and remediation activities that are underway by state and local health departments in Texas and Ohio in response to Ebola." So Gardner is confusing matters by making it prevention vs. Ebola. It doesn’t have to be. There’s also another issue to consider. We can see why people might chuckle at the thought of federal money going to jazzercise, but it’s important not to lose sight of the fund’s purpose -- prevention. "Prevention" has been part of the official name of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1992, when George H.W. Bush was president. The "P" never made it into the agency’s common acronym -- and prevention is not as swashbuckling a sector as some divisions of CDC -- but it’s an important part of the agency’s mission nonetheless. Why? Take a look at the death statistics for diseases covered by grants from the fund. (The figures cover 2010, the most recent year available). • Heart disease: 596,577 deaths; • Cancer: 576,691 deaths; • Stroke: 128,932 deaths; • Diabetes: 73,831 deaths; • Influenza and Pneumonia: 53,826 deaths. That’s more than 1.4 million deaths annually from what medical experts, including the CDC, consider preventable diseases -- compared to (so far) just one from Ebola in the United States. This doesn’t mean we should be spending zero on Ebola; nor does it mean the fund can prevent anything approaching to 1.4 million deaths a year. It doesn’t even mean that the fund is spending the right amount of money, or for the right things. What it does mean is that Gardner’s flip dismissal of preventive-health efforts obscures the imbalance in the number of lives at stake every year. Our ruling Gardner said the CDC is "spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy" that could be redirected Ebola. We weren’t able to document such expenditures, but given the agency’s spending parameters, it’s certainly possible they’ve been made. However, by cherry-picking three chuckle- (or outrage-) inducing spending items, Gardner presents a misleading description of what the fund does. Those efforts almost certainly represent a tiny fraction of spending from the prevention fund, which is dominated by efforts to attack diseases that kill more than 1.4 million people every year, rather than one so far with Ebola. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10957	Says the Steele dossier "was responsible for starting" Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-says-new-carter-page-document/	President Donald Trump claimed newly released documents underlying the FBI’s surveillance of a former campaign adviser show the controversial Steele dossier was responsible for triggering the investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. On July 21, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Justice Department released the warrant application used to obtain a wiretap on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page starting in October 2016, a month after he parted ways with Trump’s team. Intelligence officials feared Page was a potential Russian agent, or the target of Moscow's recruiting efforts. On Twitter, Trump claimed the surveillance application proves the Steele dossier launched the Russia probe. "So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!" Trump tweeted July 23. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Put simply, Trump is wrong about the triggering event. The Steele dossier did not launch the FBI’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The dossier was used, to some extent, to persuade a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court to authorize surveillance of Page. But it was the actions of another Trump campaign adviser — George Papadopoulos — that actually started the investigation. Trump adviser George Papadopoulos triggered investigation The federal government started looking into Russian election involvement in July 2016 based on information from Papadopoulos. This was confirmed by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee. "The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok," the House Intelligence Committee’s GOP members wrote in a Feb. 2 memo. House Intelligence Committee Republicans confirmed in an April report it was Papadopoulos who set the FBI investigation in motion. So, what was the "Papadopoulos information"? According to the New York Times, Papadopoulos told a high-ranking Australian diplomat at an upscale London bar in May 2016 that Moscow had "political dirt" on Hillary Clinton. Australian officials relayed this information to their American counterparts. Mueller appointed later Trump also confused the timeline of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s involvement. The Papadopoulos discussion of Clinton dirt that triggered the investigation took place in May 2016. Yet an entire year would pass before Mueller entered the picture. The Justice Department did not appoint Mueller to take over the FBI investigation until May 2017, roughly a week after Trump fired FBI director James Comey. Our ruling Trump said the Steele dossier "was responsible for starting" Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Steele dossier did not trigger Mueller’s investigation. It was information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that set the probe in motion. Also, Mueller did not take up the investigation until roughly a year after the triggering event. We rate this False.

pomt-08052	Says "there is a plan formulated by Chair (Lynn) Peterson and the cities in Clackamas County to further increase this fee in three years and split it up on projects between the county and cities."	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/31/mary-olson/does-clackamas-county-plan-turn-5-year-vehicle-reg/	People opposed to the new $5 vehicle registration fee in Clackamas County are buzzing over an under-the-radar plan that would increase the fee to $40 to fund more than the Sellwood Bridge in a few years. Lake Oswego City Councilwoman Mary Olson is one of them. In her testimony before the Clackamas County Board of Commissioners, she said: "This is not about the Sellwood Bridge. This is about a new revenue stream for Clackamas County by means of what is essentially a new tax without a vote. There is a plan formulated by (County) Chair (Lynn) Peterson and the cities in Clackamas County to further increase this fee in three years and split it up on projects between the county and cities." The Clackamas County branch of the state Republican Party has also posted an opinion on its site warning against the fee: "In an earlier meeting held on September 20th, 2010, between the cities and the county, it was stated that the Sellwood Bridge was only a part of the county’s vehicle registration fee plan, and that the fee could be as high as $40 per vehicle per year." PolitiFact Oregon hates when fees for one thing balloon into larger fees for other things. So we decided to check out the claim. Olson points to a Sept. 20 meeting hosted by Clackamas County, where city and county bureaucrats were invited to start talking about transportation funding needs and the availability of a new county-only vehicle registration fee. Eugene Schoenheit was the only member of the public present. But first we need to back up to 2009. That year the Oregon Legislature approved House Bill 2001 as a way to update Oregon’s highways and roads, including the Sellwood Bridge. The proposal included a provision allowing counties with more than 350,000 people -- that would be Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties -- to pass their own vehicle registration fees without a vote to pay for the bridge. The law also allows for those counties to implement another registration fee after July 2013 to pay for non-bridge projects. Multnomah County drivers this year started paying an extra $19 a year, or $38 for the two-year period of a vehicle tag. On Dec. 9, Clackamas County commissioners approved a fee that is $5 a year, or $10 for the two-year period. A county press release stated the additional fee would start in 2012 and end as soon the county had collected $22 million for its share of the bridge. The funds would be used only for bridge work. But what about a so-called plan to increase the registration fee and split the goods among cities and the county? Did people at the Sept. 20 meeting agree to such a thing more or less? "Heavens to Betsy, no," said Ellen Rogalin, community relations specialist for Clackamas County transportation and development. Tim Heider, spokesman for Clackamas County, added, "There is no plan. Its was just a discussion. It was a discussion about how to meet future transportation needs." About two dozen people attended the meeting, including the mayors of Molalla and Oregon City and the city managers of Canby, Happy Valley, Lake Oswego, Sandy, West Linn and Tualatin, according to a meeting summary provided by the county. The meeting was not advertised. Peterson welcomed people and led some of the discussion. "It was an initial informational discussion among cities and the county on this new law," Rogalin said. But there were specific questions, and general consensus on those specific questions that point to more than mere discussion of a new law: 1. Do you have a way to pay for unmet transportation needs in your city? General consensus: No. 2. Is there interest among the cities to have the Board of County Commissioners consider enactment of a vehicle registration fee as a source of revenue to address transportation needs? General consensus: Yes. 3. If there is agreement that a vehicle registration fee should be looked at, what are your thoughts about entering into a memorandum of understanding with the county to record this agreement? General consensus: Yes, jurisdictions would like to explore this further. Oh, and there was a handout charting how much money would be raised at $5, $10, $15, and so on, to $40 a year per vehicle. Sample memorandums were to be drafted and sent out by early November. No memorandums have been drafted and there is no date for a next meeting, Rogalin said. Again, none of this adds up to a definitive plan. But it’s fair to say that there was a definite agenda and definite movement toward tackling new fees at this meeting. The $10 two-year county bridge fee does not mean an automatic pass to ever-higher tag fees and a host of expensive new projects. According to state law, county commissioners would have to vote again on any vehicle fee increase after July 2013 for projects other than the Sellwood Bridge. While there isn’t "a plan," there clearly is planning. We find the claim Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Mary Olson	None	None	None	2010-12-31T17:57:30	2010-12-08	['None']
pomt-08941	On debating.	/texas/statements/2010/jul/24/rick-perry/perry-debated-2002-even-though-his-opponent-didnt-/	Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee for governor, issued a press release July 21 calling Gov. Rick Perry's campaign approach to debating "dramatically different from what it was in 2002," when he ran for governor against Laredo businessman Tony Sanchez. "If two debates are good, 12 will be great," Perry said in a Sept. 9, 2002, press release titled "Texans deserve more than two urban debates." "Voters in East and West Texas deserve to have their voices heard and their questions answered at gubernatorial debates," he said. At that point, Sanchez had committed to two debates in October in Dallas and Houston. According to the press release, Perry had accepted a dozen invitations to debate. Has Perry changed his tune? "Not at all," said Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign. "Gov. Perry looks forward to the opportunity to debate Bill White as soon as he releases his tax returns from his years in public service." In April, Perry said he wouldn't debate White until the Democrat released returns for the six years he served as Houston's mayor and the two years he served as a deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration. "Once he releases his income taxes and tells the public how he made his money in public service and as a business person, we'll be more than happy to discuss debates," Perry spokesman Mark Miner said, according to an April 26 story on WFAA.com. In the same story, White countered: "We'll take in consideration releasing tax returns or parts of those tax returns. We've been providing information from them to journalists as time goes on. I just want there to be a standard that's applicable to all candidates." White had already released his 2009 returns, and said he'd release returns for the years he runs for or holds statewide office. On June 8, he released his returns dating back to 2004, when he took office as Houston's mayor. But Perry's campaign said it wasn't enough, and pushed White to release more records. "By withholding tax returns for his years in public service dating back to the 1990s, Bill White has not matched Governor Perry’s level of transparency," said Perry spokesman Mark Miner in statement. "Questions remain concerning income Bill White received while Deputy Secretary of Energy under President Clinton and as chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, and how he has profited from those positions." Leaving aside the question of whether an unpaid partisan political post constitutes "public service," we found that White's Washington service was from 1993 to 1995, and he led the party from 1995 to 1998. Perry has made public his own returns going back to 1991, when he first became a statewide officeholder. The documents don't reveal everything because he's placed many of his assets in a blind trust, which means the details of those assets are unavailable. In 2001, Perry's tax return showed that the trust earned $14,790 in interest and $2,958 in dividends. In September 2009, his spokeswoman told The Associated Press his trust was worth about $896,000. What do tax returns have to do with debates? Nothing that we can think of — and Perry has not linked them in his previous gubernatorial campaigns. Which is not to say he hasn't talked about them. Flashback: In December 2001, both Perry and Sanchez released information about their 2000 income taxes. While Perry released the accompanying tax schedules that detailed how he made his money, Sanchez only revealed what he made ($6.4 million) and paid ($852,000 in income taxes), according to a Dec. 14, 2001, Austin American-Statesman report. By March 2002, when Sanchez had secured the Democratic nomination, Perry was calling on him to release the rest of his tax information, plus "his complete tax returns for the years that he served on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission (1985-91) and the University of Texas System Board of Regents (1997-present)," according to a March 30, 2002, Statesman article. After Sanchez released a limited amount of information dating back to 1991, Perry was still pushing Sanchez to release his complete income tax returns so voters could know whether his financial holdings posed a conflict of interest. At the time, Sanchez's campaign manager, Glenn Smith, sounded a lot like the White campaign when he said that "it's very easy for a career politician who has always been on the public payroll to do what Perry's doing." Sanchez, a wealthy oilman and banker from Laredo, had never held an elected office. For many years, White was a private practice attorney in Houston. But for all of the candidates' huffing and puffing about income tax returns during the 2002 election, we couldn't find any evidence that Perry had made a debate conditional upon a full release of Sanchez's financial information. We also found no evidence that the Sanchez campaign ever complied with Perry's request to provide more details, and Smith told us that he didn't recall ever releasing the in-depth returns. Meanwhile, the two debates between Perry and Sanchez were held as planned. Instead of financial transparency, the sticking point for the two candidates was whether to sit (Sanchez) or stand (Perry) during the debates, according to an Oct. 9, 2002, Fort Worth Star-Telegram article. Perry, 6 feet tall, said he thought Sanchez, 5 feet seven inches, was insecure about his height. Sanchez said he just wanted to be comfortable. (They agreed to sit at one, stand at the other.) In his last run for election in 2006, Perry seemed less enthusiastic to debate his challengers, including Democrat Chris Bell and independents Kinky Friedman and Carole Keeton Strayhorn. The four faced off only once, in October. A month before, Perry told the Houston Chronicle editorial board that one debate was enough because the scheduled event, with its multiple participants, would be a "circus." Apparently height was still an issue, though. The campaigns decided that the 5-foot, 1-inch Strayhorn could stand on a riser for the event. Where do we stand? In 2002, Perry pushed Sanchez to release his complete income tax returns for the years he was on the UT board of regents and on the Parks and Wildlife Commission, but never made it a condition to debate. Indeed, Perry not only debated him twice, but goaded him to participate in 12 debates. To date, Perry has refused to debate White until he releases all of his income tax returns for the years he served the Clinton administration in Washington and the state Democratic party chairman. We didn't hear back from the Perry campaign when we asked whether he has ever set a precondition on a debate before. Since we found no evidence that Perry has ever made a debate conditional upon his opponent's release of tax returns, we call that a Full Flop.

pomt-01212	On immigration, what reports say President Barack Obama "plans to do is roughly on the same scale" as what President George H.W. Bush did.	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/24/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-obamas-proposed-immigration-act/	Editor’s note: After reviewing new information about differing estimates of the scale of President George H.W. Bush’s 1990 immigration order, we have changed the rating of this fact-check from True to Mostly True. Our original fact-check is archived here. President Barack Obama’s unilateral move to lift the risk of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants has so incensed rank-and-file Republicans, their leaders are actively tamping down potential cries for impeachment. MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said that sort of outrage is "bogus," and she went to the history of the immigration debate to prove it. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush, a Republican, by executive action forestalled deportations for about 1.5 million illegal immigrants -- or, at least, that was a widely reported estimate at the time of the announcement. Maddow said that represented about 40 percent of the total undocumented population in 1990. "The executive action that president Obama is contemplating would also apply to about 40 percent of the undocumented population in this country," Maddow said on Nov. 17, 2014. "So it’s roughly on the same scale." (The quotation used in our initial fact-check had slightly different wording but the same meaning.) We know there’s a vigorous debate about whether the current move has the same legal standing as the executive actions taken by Bush, and by President Ronald Reagan, for that matter. Our focus here is simply on the numbers that shaped the debate at the time the two policies were announced. (A hat tip here to Vox for their work on this.) The count for Obama According to reports at the time Maddow made her claim, Obama planned to announce plans to stop deporting the parents of children who are U.S. citizens. We saw a couple of estimates of how many people that would affect. The Pew Research Center said about 3.5 million. The New York Times put the figure at 4 million. Citing White House sources, the New York Times said an additional 1 million people would be touched by other facets of the new policy, giving a total of 5 million. That’s very close to the Migration Policy Institute’s estimate of 5.2 million. Since there are about 11.4 million undocumented immigrants, Obama’s order was expected to change the rules for between 30 and 40 percent of total population. Again, this is based on reports. But that’s all that Maddow would have had to go on when she made her comments. The count for Bush For an apples-to-apples comparison, we wanted to look at the number of immigrants who were expected to benefit from Bush’s action. Bush’s order aimed to ease a predicament created by a 1986 immigration reform law. The law took people who had been in the country for at least five years and put them on a path to legal status. But it did nothing for parents, children or spouses who didn’t qualify, even if someone else in the immediate family did. That created a scenario where families could be split up. When Congress failed to change the law, Bush did it on his own in 1990 under the banner of "family fairness." A few days after this fact-check initially appeared, the Washington Post Fact Checker cast doubt on the 1.5 million figure, to the claim by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest that Bush "expanded the family fairness program to cover more than 1.5 million unauthorized spouses and children. This represented about 40 percent of the undocumented population at the time." (See the Fact Checker’s article here.) To recap what the Fact Checker reported, on the day of the policy announcement Feb. 1, 1990, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said it could affect as many as 100,000 people. The article then noted how the estimate grew over the ensuing weeks. This suggested the 1.5 million figure was wildly inflated. However, on Feb. 21, 1990, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Gene McNary testified before a House committee that the number could reach and even exceed 1.5 million Here’s the exchange between McNary and then-Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn. Morrison: Mr. McNary, you used the 1.5 million IRCA relatives who are undocumented but who would be covered by your family fairness policy. Do I have that number right? McNary: Yes Morrison: Under your recent administrative order, these people essentially are here to stay, with work and travel privileges. Isn’t that right? McNary: We think you are right as to the 1.5 million being here. There’s an estimate of another 1.5 million that would come as a result of this change in definition. The New York Times, quoting McNary, reported that the move would affect about 1.5 million people. In 1990, there were about 3.5 million undocumented immigrants. By these numbers, being bruited about in the popular press, Bush’s policy would potentially touch the lives of about 40 percent of the total. It’s important to note that the Fact Checker was looking at a different question than we were. The Fact Checker looked solely at the numbers for Bush, not a comparison of scale between Bush and Obama. What we see when we look at these reported estimates is a range, from 100,000 to 1.5 million. Marc Rosenblum is deputy director for immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute. Rosenblum said that while there was some confusion about the projected impact, the larger figure carried a great deal of weight. "Administration officials at the time testified that the 1.5 million number was in play at the time the family fairness policy was implemented," Rosenblum said. He noted that the actual number never reached that level because Congress later changed the law, which made it unnecessary for people to apply for special treatment. By the way, Reagan also used executive action to address the same problem, but it wasn’t as far-reaching as Bush’s. To be clear, Obama’s proposal would affect more people overall, but Maddow was clearly talking about scale. Also, Maddow was comparing the political response to the numbers that appeared in the mainstream press at the time. Those numbers may have been wrong in retrospect, but they were what politicians back then were likely to read. Our ruling Maddow said Obama’s proposed executive action on immigration policy is roughly on the same scale as one taken by Bush. Both measures unilaterally lifted or would lift the risk of deportation for certain undocumented immigrants. Current estimates of the impact of Obama’s policy are that it would touch about 40 percent of the undocumented population. In 1990, administration estimates of how many people might be affected by Bush’s policy were also in the neighborhood of 40 percent. Estimates at the low end of the scale would have pushed it well below 40 percent. There is some uncertainty here because the 1.5 million number, though widely reported at the time, did bounce around. But the Bush administration seemed to think it was offering a significant, wide-scale program at the time. So we rate Maddow’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-15020	Says Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards was "forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood’s revenue is from abortion."	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/05/dana-loesch/Planned-parenthood-86-percent-abortion-revenue/	Conservative talk radio host Dana Loesch got Twitter fired up recently by tossing out another statistic in the ongoing debate over Planned Parenthood and abortion. In her post, Loesch claimed that Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards was "forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood’s revenue is from abortion." Loesch’s post was retweeted more than 1,500 times and served as a foil to somewhat misleading claims that 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is preventative health. But is it right? Did Planned Parenthood’s chief executive admit that 86 percent of its revenues come from abortions? Both the figure and Loesch’s description of the events surrounding it are flawed. We’ll explain why. The House hearing Loesch is describing the Sept. 29 meeting of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which included some tough questioning of Richards. At one point, Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., asked Richards a series of questions about the number of Planned Parenthood’s clinics, whether it conducts mammograms (Planned Parenthood typically refers women to outside clinics for those), and the claim that just 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services are abortion-related. Lummis asked Roberts about Planned Parenthood’s 2013-14 annual report, which she said included statistics that abortions "would have been over 86 percent of your non-government revenue." "How do you explain this massive disparity between the amount of revenue you collect from abortion, and the fact that you only report 3 percent of your services being abortion?" Lummis asked. We have to stop and make clear that Lummis asked about non-government revenue, which is not what Loesch tweeted. (Loesch could have made that distinction and kept within her 140-character limit, in case you were wondering.) Dropping the words "non-government" make a major difference, which we will discuss in a moment. But first back to Richards’ answer. Richards at first responded by saying those numbers are not connected because federal money doesn’t cover abortions. (That’s correct, except in cases of Medicaid funds in instances of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother). Lummis then pressed for how many Planned Parenthood affiliates receive the majority of their revenue from abortion, and Richards said she didn’t know but would talk to her team about getting the answer. Then Richards went back to Lummis’ original question and said, "But I do think it's important to understand that abortion procedures are probably more expensive than some other procedures that we — that we provide, which might, you know, might explain what you're trying to get at." You can read the complete transcript here. But what’s clear in our reading is that Richards conceded nothing other than that abortions are relatively expensive procedures compared to Planned Parenthood’s other works. A different line of inquiry came up on this point in the third hour of the hearing. Rep. Steve Russell, R-Okla., tried to ask Richards how much revenue comes from abortion services, but she said she couldn’t give him a ballpark. Then Russell walked through an estimate for how he extrapolated the revenue that abortion brings in. He used Planned Parenthood’s own estimates for a surgical abortion (up to $1,500) and the abortion pill (up to $800), and then multiplied each by the number of reported abortions (over 327,000) to get a range of $261 million to $491 million in ballpark revenue from those procedures. Depending on the cost used, the ballpark abortion revenues "would come to 40 percent or 22 percent" of total revenue reported by Planned Parenthood affiliates of $1.145 billion in 2013-14, Russell said. (This method has been used by anti-abortion groups over the years.) Now we’re from 86 percent to 40 or 22 percent. Either way, Richards interrupted, saying that was inaccurate. "What was inaccurate is, I think, what you reported in terms of what the cost of an abortion," Richards said. "Obviously, it varies state to state. So I can't say. But I think your, I think your number was high." Unpacking the 86 percent The major problem with all the figures and statistics about what Planned Parenthood does and doesn’t do is that Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide much detail for fact-checkers and observers to analyze. That gets critics in trouble when they exaggerate the available data, as in this case with Loesch. Here’s how Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s 2013-14 annual report presents its revenues: Revenue Affiliates Non-Government Health Services Revenue $305.3 million Government Health Services Grants & Reimbursements $528.4 million Private Contributions and Bequests $257.4 million Other Operating Revenue $54.7 million Total Revenue $1.15 billion This doesn’t tell us much, specifically if you’re trying to answer how much revenue is generated by abortion services. The first column of numbers represents money brought in from Planned Parenthood’s network of affiliates around the country. The top line is for non-government health services revenue, $305.3 million (which would include abortions, as well as STD testing, pregnancy tests, etc.). Of course, there are more sources of revenue than that. The lines below describe $528.4 million in federal reimbursements for services from low-income patients on Medicaid, as well as $257.4 million raised in private contributions and bequests. The only possible way to get to 86 percent is to ignore those other sources of revenues, which account for more than 70 percent of everything Planned Parenthood takes in. The figure Lummis quoted is based on the assumption that of the $305 million in non-government health services revenue, $262.1 million comes from abortion procedures (Planned Parenthood’s $800 top-end estimate for an abortion pill multiplied by 327,653 abortions performed). That’s not a precise way of measuring things because abortion costs vary by state and provider. Average costs reported to members of the National Abortion Federation, the professional association of abortion providers which counts some Planned Parenthood affiliates among its members, put the costs of an abortion lower, in some cases, at $500 for pregnancies 12 weeks and earlier (a mix of medication and in-clinic abortions at that stage), $1,000 between 16-18 weeks, and $2,000 after 20 weeks. As we pointed out, Loesch’s dropping of the words "non-government" makes some of this analysis academic. Loesch significantly overplays any validity to Lummis’ estimate by simply referring to revenue. A Florida legislator in 2011 made the same mistake. Applying Lummis’ estimate of $262.1 million from abortions to Planned Parenthood’s total $1.3 billion in revenue shows a lower estimated figure for the share of profits from abortions at 20 percent. (Even Russell’s statement in the hearing, which Richards said was wrong without saying why, put the share of abortion services toward revenue at 22-40 percent.) We’d be remiss if we didn’t note that the people who could shed the most light on these figures, Planned Parenthood, haven’t provided any clarifying information. Loesch provided no additional evidence to support her claim. Our ruling Loesch said Richards was "forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood’s revenue is from abortion." At a U.S. House hearing, Richards said abortions are expensive compared to other health services offered by Planned Parenthood. But we found no evidence of her saying, or conceding, that 86 percent of revenue is from abortion. At one point in the same meeting, she said an even lower estimate for abortion revenues was "too high." On top of that, Loesch describes the reported statistic incorrectly by dropping "non-government." That phrase makes all the difference. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11083	"Senate report admits Clinton ‘gifted’ children to human traffickers"	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/18/yournewswirecom/false-headline-wrongly-links-hillary-clinton-forme/	One conspiratorial news website recycled a years-old Senate report in an effort to link former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to negligence by the Department of Health and Human Services between 2013 and 2015 that led to the abuse of migrant children. "Senate report admits Clinton ‘gifted’ children to human traffickers," read a June 17, 2018, headline from Your News Wire, a website with a history of peddling falsehoods online. The Your News Wire story cited 2016 articles from The New York Times and New York magazine, as well as a Jan. 28, 2016, Senate report based on an inquiry into the role of HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement in protecting unaccompanied migrant children from human trafficking and other abuses. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story said: "Hillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an ‘unknown number’ of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called ‘caregivers,’ according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media." This statement is wrong or misleading in several ways — starting with its attempt to frame a Senate report from 2016 as a new and shocking release that the media ignored. Casual readers could have thought the Your News Wire story related to the recent FBI Inspector General’s report, which concerned Clinton’s use of personal emails and was released Thursday, June 14, 2018. In reality, the Senate’s findings were widely reported in 2016, and the many contemporary news stories — including an Associated Press investigation that overlapped with the Senate report — made our fact-checking job easy. The Senate report said that HHS placed more than a dozen migrant children in homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced into labor. The report did not say anything about Clinton playing a role in that process. Both the Senate report and AP investigation discovered that HHS, which is responsible for finding adult sponsors to temporarily house and care for unaccompanied immigrant children pending the resolution of their immigration proceedings, neglected to comply with federal law requiring that the children be protected from human trafficking and other forms of abuse. As unaccompanied children surged across the southern border toward the beginning of the decade, the department slashed several safety standards in order to quickly transfer the new arrivals from government shelters to sponsors’ homes. Caseworkers who had previously followed strict guidelines for placing children with sponsors — guidelines that required background checks, fingerprints, home studies and signed agreements to bring the children to immigration court — were instructed by agency officials in November 2013 to stop fingerprinting. Shortly after that, they were also instructed to stop requesting original copies of birth certificates, seeking personal and identifying information, or checking criminal history. The hastened process saw several children placed in households with sponsors who forced them into labor or otherwise abused them, according to the Senate and AP reports. It is unknown exactly how many of the approximately 90,000 migrant children placed into sponsor custody between 2013 and 2015 experienced trafficking or other abuse. But neither report mentioned Clinton or used the term "gift" in reference to the placement of children with human traffickers. We could not find any evidence that Clinton, who led the Department of State during President Barack Obama’s first term in office, played a part in the rollback of the safety standards governing the protection of migrant children. Not only are the State Department and HHS separate executive agencies, but Clinton also stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, months before HHS decided to stop fingerprinting in the first of many decisions that led to the children’s mistreatment. Your News Wire tried implicating Clinton in an old but otherwise real Senate report. The website did not respond to a request for comment. We rate this statement False.

pomt-00542	"After the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax rate cuts ... there was more money coming into the treasury."	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/17/ron-christie/gop-strategist-christie-tax-revenues-rose-after-bu/	Bill Maher, the bawdy and generally liberal HBO comedian, recently wondered aloud why the current roster of Republican presidential hopefuls has been selective in their criticism of the last Republican president. "I noticed that the Republicans have not been shy about throwing George W. Bush under the bus on Iraq," Maher said. "They're all saying the Iraq War was a big mistake now, but none of them say the Bush tax cuts were a big mistake." Maher targeted one of his guests, Republican strategist Ron Christie. "Were the tax cuts a good idea?" Maher asked. Christie, a former special assistant to Bush and deputy assistant to Vice President Dick Cheney, said they were. "If you look at the revenue that came in after the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax rate cuts, yes, there was more money coming into the treasury," Christie said. "That’s a fact." A reader questioned whether that really is a fact. Christie’s source of information Christie filled in some of the numbers for PunditFact that he left out on television. "Total revenue climbed from $793.7 billion in 2003 to $1.16 trillion in 2007," Christie said. "A 47 percent increase." Christie directed us to an article in Forbes that had exactly those amounts. Those figures differ widely from numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, though the bottom line is about the same. CBO says federal government revenues rose from $1.782 trillion in 2003 to $2.568 trillion in 2007 (using fiscal years). That’s a 44 percent increase. Case closed? Not really. What we found is Christie is carefully picking his starting and end points to make the most dramatic comparison. Changing the timeframe makes all the difference, as we’ll show you. Including the 2001 tax cuts While Christie touted the 2001 tax cuts, he didn’t include federal revenues collected for either 2001 or 2002. If he had, the trend line would not be as clean as the picture he painted. The Tax Policy Center, a joint project of two academic centers the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, summarized the CBO numbers. This chart based on the center’s table shows revenues initially falling, not rising. Reasonable people can use different years as a starting point for comparison. Bush didn’t take office until early 2001 and the tax cuts didn’t take full effect until the start of 2002. Plus, economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California-Berkeley reminded us that there was a recession between March 2001 and November 2001. "The effects of the recession on revenue are likely to swamp any effects of tax policy," Auerbach said. Economist William Gale at the Tax Policy Center said for those reasons, 2000 could be a fair benchmark, untouched by both recession and tax cuts. Doing so presents a very different picture. In short, federal revenues were below 2000 levels (after adjusting for inflation) until 2006. They outpaced fiscal year 2000 collections for a bit, then fell again in 2008. The same pattern roughly holds if you use 2001 as the starting point. What’s that all mean? When you adjust for inflation, the 47 percent revenue growth from 2003 to 2007 becomes 28 percent. And if you start the clock in 2001, revenue growth drops to 4 percent. By 2009, of course, the numbers look even worse. Here’s another way to look at it, using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Over Bush’s two full terms, federal revenues dropped 13 percent. Accounting for economic growth Not adjusting for inflation and cherry-picking the time period are two problems in Christie’s calculation. So is not factoring in a rising population (more people, means more taxpayers, more goods and services sold, etc.). Economists such as Gale say a better way to put federal revenues into context is by comparing them to the Gross Domestic Product. Through that lens, federal revenues as a share of the economy fell and never reached their 2001 level through Bush’s two terms. FY Percent of GDP 2000 20 2001 18.8 2002 17 2003 15.7 2004 15.6 2005 16.7 2006 17.6 2007 17.9 2008 17.1 2009 14.6 Source: Tax Policy Center/CBO Our ruling Christie said that government revenues increased after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Christie is cherry-picking his start and end dates and making flawed calculations to support his point. Data shows, and experts agree, that a complete picture of the Bush tax cuts shows that revenues initially went down, then up, then down again. Measured against the size of the economy, federal revenues at the end of Bush’s term were smaller than when he took office. Christie’s statement has some superficial accuracy but a more complete picture shows that he has omitted many details that would lead to a different conclusion. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-02632	"In some of the states in the U.S., homosexuality remains a felony."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/19/vladimir-putin/putin-some-places-united-states-homosexuality-rema/	Americans should take a look at the superpower in the mirror before judging Russia for its anti-gay laws, says Russia President Vladimir Putin. Putin spoke to a few reporters, including ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos, ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi in February. Stephanopoulos asked if gay and lesbian athletes who "wear a rainbow pin" or something like it to protest the law will be protected from prosecution. Legally speaking, Putin said, "protesting a law does not amount to propaganda of sexuality or sexual abuse of children." He added: "I'd like to ask our colleagues, my colleagues and friends, that as they try to criticize us, they would do well to set their own house in order first," he said. "I did say, after all, and this is public knowledge, that in some of the states in the U.S., homosexuality remains a felony." Putin’s statement is misleading. Several states do, in fact, have anti-sodomy laws. Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma specifically ban sodomy for gay Americans, and Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina and Utah have criminal sodomy laws that apply to everyone (see this 2011 Mother Jones map). (Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli unsuccessfully tried to reinstate Virginia’s sodomy ban, which he said would have protected minors. Montana repealed its law banning gay sex in 2013.) Some, such as "buggery" in South Carolina, carry the weight of a felony, but most are misdemeanors. That part is nearly irrelevant. The key thing to know, as Stephanopoulos tried to point out, is these laws were ruled unconstitutional in the landmark Supreme Court case Lawrence vs. Texas. The case stemmed from the 1998 arrest of a gay Houston couple accused of having sex in violation of state law. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 the Texas law is an unconstitutional privacy invasion under the country’s equal protection clause and invalidated these laws. Even though prosecutions under the state’s sodomy law were rare, the court noted, the law did not serve a "legitimate state interest." The decision did not erase the laws from each state’s books -- it just knocked out their teeth. State legislatures would have to pass repeals to get them out of state statutes, and some conservative states have ignored bills that call for repealing them. The country’s sodomy laws that only applied to homosexuals are "not ancient in origin" and only started to appear in the late 1960s, said Dale Carpenter, a University of Minnesota constitutional law professor and author of the book Flagrant Conduct: The Story of Lawrence v. Texas: How a Bedroom Arrest Decriminalized Gay Americans. The country’s early sodomy laws drew from the teachings of the King James Version of the Bible and applied to heterosexuals and homosexuals, he said. The laws were more often used not as arrest-generators but as "permission slips to discriminate against gays and lesbians" in accommodations, child custody and adoption, jobs and education, Carpenter said. In practice, prosecutors usually invoked sodomy laws on top of other charges, such as rape or prostitution. Many states started to repeal their sodomy laws in the 1960s. The laws that remain exist despite being "absolutely unenforceable," said Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, the gay rights group that represented the couple arrested in Texas. "That is not to say that it’s not stigmatizing and sometimes potentially misleading to have them on the books, and they should be erased from history," Gorenberg said. The decade-old Lawrence vs. Texas ruling has not stopped some local law enforcement officials from using the laws, including against a gay couple who kissed at a restaurant in Texas or a sheriff’s office arresting a dozen men for sodomy in Louisiana (the Texas couple was never cited and charges in the Louisiana cases were dropped). The penalty for violating Texas’ law is a Class C misdemeanor, on par with a speeding ticket if it could really be enforced, Carpenter said. Putin’s comment misrepresents the reality in the United States, where many states have legalized gay marriage or passed anti-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation, Carpenter said. "It’s much bigger than just sodomy laws," he said. "But if you want to focus on just that, it’s a whole lot more complicated than saying the states have felony laws. That just hardly scratches the surface." Our ruling Deflecting criticism of his country’s anti-gay propaganda law, Putin said, "In some of the states in the U.S., homosexuality remains a felony." Several states still have sodomy laws on the books, and a few specifically prohibit gay sodomy. But the laws are unenforceable and have been for a decade after a Supreme Court ruling. That makes Putin’s statement that "homosexuality remains a felony" inaccurate. We rate it False.	None	Vladimir Putin	None	None	None	2014-01-19T16:37:30	2014-01-19	['United_States']
pomt-11193	Says Austin is "creating more jobs than any other city in the country."	/texas/statements/2018/may/16/steve-adler/steve-adler-incorrectly-says-austin-creating-more-/	Austin’s mayor made a best-in-the-nation claim about local job gains that made us wonder. Steve Adler, who seeks a second term in November 2018, was asked on KLBJ-AM’s morning May 8, 2018, "Todd and Don Show" about ending "the red tape and paperwork that businesses have to go through just to expand in this city." Adler replied: "You ought to minimize the bureaucracy as much as you can. But we’re doing something right in this city, you guys have to admit, right? We’re creating more jobs than any other city in the country. We have an economy that’s on fire. I mean, we’re doing something right," Adler said, going on to agree that he also wasn’t trying to take personal credit for the gains. Some background: We recently found accurate an Adler tout of Austin’s jobless rate. From January through March 2018, Austin’s unemployment rate ran shy of 3 percent; the rate had mostly stayed under 3 percent since the start of 2017. So, we wondered, is Austin flat-out growing more jobs than any other city in the country? Mayor cites local sort of federal data By email, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford told us the mayor made his job growth claim by drawing on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Stanford included in his reply a chart from the Austin Chamber of Commerce indicating that between March 2017 and March 2018, the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan area--which takes in five Austin-area counties--saw greater percentage gains in nonfarm payroll jobs than nine other high-growth areas: SOURCE: Web post, "APRIL 24, 2018 - JOB GROWTH & UNEMPLOYMENT," Austin Chamber of Commerce, April 24, 2018 The Austin area was home to 1,060,200 jobs in March 2018, the chart says, and that count was up 36,800 jobs, or 3.6 percent, from March 2017. Listed as metro areas with the next-most percentage gains: Orlando (3.5 percent); Phoenix, Seattle and Riverside, Calif. (3.2 percent each); Jacksonville and Dallas (3.1 percent each). We noticed, though, that the Austin area ranked sixth among the selected regions in raw jobs gained. According to the chart, the Dallas area had 78,400 more jobs in March 2018 than in March 2017; the Phoenix area had 65,600 more jobs than before; the Seattle area had 53,200 more jobs than before; the Riverside area had 45,900 more jobs than before; and the Orlando area had 43,700 more jobs than before. To our inquiry, a chamber expert, Beverly Kerr, pointed out the chamber’s April 2018 web post showing Austin’s No. 1 rank. Kerr also commented: "The mayor might better have said Austin is creating jobs faster than any other major metro, rather than creating more jobs, since some slower growing much larger metros are bound to actually be creating a larger number of jobs." Job gains in more metro areas We sought to look over the figures. So Kerr emailed us what she described as her full fetch of job changes within 426 U.S. metro areas for the selected months, enabling us to conduct our own shake-outs. We sorted all the figures by percentage gains in jobs--finding that Austin’s 3.6 percent growth placed the area in a national tie with the Idaho metros of Idaho Falls and Pocatello and behind 28 similarly less populous areas, including three in Texas. From March 2017 to March 2018, the Midland area saw a nationally leading 9.9 percent bump, gaining 8,900 jobs; the adjoining Odessa area had a gain of 6.6 percent, 4,700 jobs; and the College Station-Bryan area saw an increase of 4.3 percent with 5,100 jobs gained, the figures indicate. We also sorted the provided figures by limiting our focus to the nation’s 49 metro areas that were home to 1 million jobs or more in March 2017. Among those areas, the Austin area’s 3.6 percent growth rate as of March 2018 placed it No. 1, we found, though 14 other areas recorded greater raw job gains. Next, we queried the BLS directly about the mayor’s claim and backup information. By email, Dallas-based economist Cheryl Abbot confirmed that the figures behind Adler’s claim were rooted in the bureau’s supplemental table posted online gauging over-the-year job changes from March 2017 to March 2018 in total nonfarm employment in metro areas with a population of 1 million residents or more as of 2010. Among the 51 areas clearing the declared population hurdle, Abbot wrote, the Austin area ranked No. 1 in percentage job growth. "And even on a net change basis, Austin ranked 11th on our table (jobs up by 36,800), competing with the likes of NYC, LA, DFW, and Atlanta, among others," Abbot said. A national analysis We also consulted Aaron M. Renn, an economist with the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. Asked to provide a long perspective on the Austin area’s job gains, Renn emailed us a chart based on BLS figures showing that the Austin area topped 52 other metro areas--leaving out many--with a 51 percent uptick in nonfarm jobs from 2000 to 2017; California’s Riverside area placed second with a 46 percent increase. But among the selected metro areas, the Austin area’s raw gain of nearly 350,000 jobs over those years placed the area 10th nationally behind the metro areas of New York, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Houston, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, Riverside, Phoenix and Atlanta, according to the chart. Our ruling Adler told the morning radio hosts that Austin is creating more jobs than any other U.S. city. To the contrary, federal figures show the five-county Austin metropolitan area (not Austin alone) trails some other U.S. metros including the No. 1 Midland area for its pace of jobs gained and it lags more than 25 metro areas in raw jobs gained. It would be accurate to say the Austin area lately has enjoyed greater percentage job gains than other metro areas of 1 million residents or more. We rate this Adler claim False.

pomt-05572	Says when New Jersey adopted guaranteed coverage and cost provisions without a mandate individual health insurance market rates "doubled or tripled" and enrollment dropped from 180,000 people to 80,000 people.	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/04/donald-verrilli/donald-verrilli-says-enrollment-declined-and-rates/	A mandate for individuals to buy health insurance acts as a foundation for the national health care law, according to the federal government. Without it, the entire structure weakens. During last week’s U.S. Supreme Court hearings on the law, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli cited New Jersey to support that argument. Justice Antonin Scalia, in an exchange with Verrilli, said when people "have a substantial risk of incurring high medical bills, they'll buy insurance, like the rest of us." Verrilli said: "That's the problem, Justice Scalia. That's -- and that's exactly the experience that the states had that made the imposition of guaranteed issue and community rating not only be ineffectual but be highly counterproductive. Rates, for example, in New Jersey doubled or tripled, went from 180,000 people covered in this market down to 80,000 people covered in this market." PolitiFact New Jersey found the solicitor general is largely right. Verrilli was referring to the individual market, a health insurance exchange that serves people who don’t have access to health insurance through their employer or through government programs such as Medicare. In the early 1990s New Jersey implemented guaranteed issue -- a ban on insurers rejecting applicants -- and community rating -- a requirement prohibiting insurers from charging different rates regardless of risk -- in its individual market. The federal law includes similar measures. But unlike the federal government, New Jersey didn’t require residents to purchase health insurance. And, experts said, without a mechanism to push healthier people into buying coverage the state’s individual market nearly collapsed. Data shows an initial spike then a steep decline in enrollment following the reforms. A 2004 article in the journal Health Affairs found the "current situation points to a market that is heading for collapse. Enrollment has declined from a peak of 186,130 lives at the end of 1995 to 84,968 at the end of 2001. In addition, premiums have increased two- to threefold above their early levels." Enrollment in New Jersey’s market has rebounded since that report, but participation in a plan that allows for adjustment in rates based on age, gender and location is driving growth. The market’s standard plan also now allows for rate adjustment based on age. Experts said New Jersey’s early experience with reforms was the most appropriate time frame for assessing Verrilli’s statement. By that account, his figures are roughly correct. But is Verrilli right to claim the guaranteed coverage and cost provisions sparked enrollment decline and rate increases? Health care experts acknowledged that other factors, such as a vibrant economy and loss of subsidies, may be involved, but said Verrilli’s overall point is strong. "Without a coverage mandate the guaranteed issue and modified community rating provisions had the effect of encouraging sick people to purchase insurance and discouraging well people from purchasing insurance," which led to the rate increases, said John Jacobi, a professor of health law and policy at Seton Hall Law School It’s worth noting that the average age and percentage of people who reported fair or poor health in the market increased for new enrollees from 1996 to 2002, according to a 2004 brief from Rutgers University’s Center for State Health Policy. Alan Monheit, director of the Center for Health Economics and Health Policy at UMDNJ said, "the statement is generally correct that without a mandate and with guaranteed issue and community rating that is certainly going to contribute to a potential unraveling of specific health plans within a marketplace and perhaps even the market itself." Our ruling The solicitor general said after New Jersey adopted provisions guaranteeing health insurance coverage and controlling rates in the individual market without a mandate rates "doubled or tripled" and enrollment dropped from 180,000 people to 80,000 people. Verrilli’s figures are roughly correct in the years before a modified plan was introduced that has since boosted total enrollment in the market. Experts agree it’s fair for Verrilli to point to guaranteed issue and community rating as sources of the enrollment decline and rate increase, but acknowledged there may be other factors involved. Overall, we rate Verrilli’s claim Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Donald Verrilli	None	None	None	2012-04-04T07:30:00	2012-03-27	['None']
pomt-10916	"Satanic leader confesses to sacrificing 675 children 'gifted' to him by doctors."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/01/blog-posting/no-evidence-so-called-satanic-leader-sacrificed-60/	A viral video shows a masked man who claims he sacrificed 675 people, many of them children, to maintain his demonic powers. The confession, which originally aired on a Ghanaian talk show, and its translations have been shared across the discredited Neon Nettle, as well as the Daily Mail. "Satanic leader confesses to sacrificing 675 children ‘gifted’ to him by doctors," read the Neon Nettle headline on July 19. We decided to investigate the so-called confession. Is it real, or another online hoax? The interview The story features screenshots from a video clip from a Ghanaian television show aired on Royal Television Ghana, also known as RTV. The man claiming to be a Satanic leader speaks with a deep voice, and hides his face with a children’s mask of Bumblebee from the Transformers movie franchise. The interviewer, a well-known television and radio presenter known as Otwinoko, does not identify the man. The original interview with the so-called Satanic leader is nearly 30 minutes long, and is part two of a series entitled "DARKNESS IN CHURCHES." The interview is conducted in Akan, a language native to Ghana. It has been summarized in English by Ghanaian news site Yen. According to the translation, the man claimed he lived with Satan for 17 years, and would conduct routine sacrifices to sustain his power. Evil doctors gave him these sacrifices, he said, many of whom were children. He also said that he was in control of over 600 demonic spirits. While there have been multiple local reports about the show itself, none have mentioned any police investigation into the issue. More widely, there have been no news reports of human sacrifice or doctors kidnapping children in Ghana. The Otwinoko Show Otwinoko, whose real name is Kwabena Asare, specializes in spiritual outrage. He vigorously questions his guests, supposed anti-Christian magicians, but doesn’t release their identities. He has dozens of other videos online, many of which follow a similar style to the interview with this Satanic leader. In one video, titled "PASTOR’S EVIL DEEDS EXPOSED," the thumbnail is a fiery 666. In another, he discusses the signs of the Antichrist. Debunking false prophets appears to be a routine feature on the show. As an individual, Otwinoko maintains a mystical persona. He is visually impaired, and he claims that jealous fellow journalists used voodoo to cause his blindness. Our ruling The article by Neon Nettle claimed that "a Satanic cult leader has confessed to carrying out more than 600 child sacrifices." A man did confess this on a Ghanaian television show. The article does acknowledge that there have been no reports of mass child killings in Ghana, Satanic or otherwise. But, Neon Nettle fails to mention that this show has a long sensationalist history of interviewing supposed spiritual deviants and granting them anonymity. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00317	Says Democratic congressional candidate Tom Malinowski "supports a full repeal of the 2017 tax law, which includes vital tax incentives" for New Jersey communities.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/21/leonard-lance/malinowski-lance-tax-bill-fight/	What do you call it when both candidates were against the sweeping 2017 tax bill in Congress, yet one now criticizes the other for wanting to get rid of parts of it? Let’s call it New Jersey. This spat involves the method with which either candidate in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District would change the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and whether one of them would get rid of the parts that people like. U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance, a Republican, says Democratic challenger Tom Malinowski wants to repeal the 2017 tax law, which despite some distasteful parts also "includes vital tax incentives" for distressed areas of New Jersey communities. Lance made the claim on Sept. 10, issuing a statement that "while Malinowski speaks in glowing terms of ‘facilitating economic revitalization,’ he fails to tell voters he supports a full repeal of the 2017 tax law, which includes vital tax incentives to revitalize the city of Phillipsburg." Phillipsburg, with a riverfront corridor on the border with Pennsylvania that city officials have long wanted to improve, is among the communities hoping to benefit from an economic development provision in the tax law. Phillipsburg "will benefit greatly from the Opportunity Zones law," town Council President Robert Fulper is quoted as saying in Lance’s statement. Malinowski, Fulper says in the statement, "wants to throw the baby out with the bath water and eliminate a program that is truly doing good for our community." Does he? The campaign of Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor in President Barack Obama’s administration, says this is patently false. So what do Lance and his supporters base the claim on? New Jersey doesn’t love the entire law Before we get to the basis for the claim, it’s worth noting a bit of irony. Lance voted against this very piece of tax legislation, one of only 12 Republican House members to do so. At the time, he said he voted no "because it significantly reduces the ability of New Jerseyans to deduct state and local taxes, a provision that has been in the code since 1913." This new cap on "SALT," a popular acronym for the taxes, is making some homeowners angry in states with high real estate prices and high property taxes. In the past, they could deduct all their local property taxes from their incomes when figuring out their federal income tax obligation. Now, they can only deduct up to $10,000 for all state and local taxes, or $5,000 apiece if married but filing separately. "Also, as a deficit hawk, I do not favor adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt," Lance said when voting no. Every House Democrat voted no, too, with many saying the tax cuts in the legislation tilted too heavily to wealthy Americans. But Lance was pleased with parts of the bill, nonetheless. These included a new preferential tax treatment on investment in economically distressed areas known as Opportunity Zones. As a result, New Jersey designated and the federal government in the spring approved 169 census tracts as Opportunity Zones. Despite Lance’s vote on the overall tax bill, he was an original cosponsor of an earlier measure to create Opportunity Zones, and it got folded into the final tax package. It is not unusual to oppose a multi-part bill while liking some components. But if Congress were to repeal the entire tax package now, the Opportunity Zone program, important to New Jersey communities, could end, Lance says. Yet he claimed in his Sept. 10 statement that his challenger would do just that: repeal the entire bill. "Leonard isn't advocating for the repeal of the tax bill (and therefore opportunity zones)," Lance’s campaign manager, Jim Hilk, told us in an email. "Tom Malinowski is." One set of quotes Asked for support for that claim, Hilk sent PolitiFact three pieces of information. One was to a tweet from the Communications Workers of America, or CWA, New Jersey organization, posted from the union’s leadership conference in July. The tweet quoted Malinowski saying, "I want to be part of a majority that will fight for workers, for a $15/hr minimum wage, and will fight to repeal the GOP tax law." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Another link was to a statement issued by Malinowski’s campaign on Aug. 24. In it, the Democrat said, "In New Jersey we’ve chosen to invest in the things that matter to us, like good schools and affordable healthcare, and Congressional Republicans designed their tax bill to hurt us for making those choices. The only way to repeal that tax bill and restore the SALT deduction is to replace the Republican majority in the Congress." Note the word "repeal," Lance’s campaign points out. The third link was to a story in Insider NJ, a website that covers political news. The story was on the opening of Malinowski’s campaign headquarters in May and noted that he was surrounded by well-wishers including U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, a Democrat from New Jersey’s 6th Congressional District. At the office opening, Malinowski said he would fight back Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He said he would fight to preserve Social Security and Medicare. And he said, according to the article, "Congressman Pallone, I will fight to repeal that tax bill." The other quotes Malinowski’s campaign says it can’t account for what others may have reported or tweeted, including what may have been partial quotes or quotes lacking a fuller context. Campaign spokesman Benji Schwartz noted a number of instances in which Malinowski said clearly that he wants to get rid of parts of the tax bill but make sure other parts, including Opportunity Zone provisions, stay or get replaced. In a joint April 13 appearance on New Jersey Public Media with two other Democrats running in the June primary, Malinowski said his experience in government made him the right candidate to "deal with the tax bill that needs to be repealed and replaced in the interest of the people in our state." NJ7 Forward, a progressive coalition, quoted Malinowski in its own description of the tax bill: "I will work to repeal the Republican tax bill and replace it with tax reform that simplifies and lowers rates for everyone, that cuts special interest loopholes rather than deductions that help the middle class." In another pre-primary piece, NJ Spotlight, which covers political and public policy news and analysis, presented various positions of the Democratic candidates. The story said Malinowski "wants to repeal the tax bill and replace it with ‘more fiscally responsible tax reform’ legislation that lowers rates, cuts special interest loopholes and ‘doesn’t explode national debt.’" On July 18, Malinowski used Twitter to link to a Bloomberg Opinion piece criticizing the tax cuts. Malinowski wrote his own opinion in the tweet: "Repeal and Replace." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com On his campaign website, Malinowski used those words again: repeal and replace. "I will work to repeal the GOP tax law and replace it with fiscally responsible tax reform," he says in a section dedicated to issues. "New tax legislation must preserve middle class tax deductions like the State and Local Tax deduction (SALT), which prevented us from being double-taxed on our state payments, close corporate and special interest loopholes, bring home money stashed in foreign tax shelters, and avoid ballooning the deficit." Our ruling Lance says his opponent wants to repeal the entire Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It is true that there was a tweet, a news story and a candidate statement in which the word "repeal" appeared without the addition of "replace." Malinowski’s spokesman said that in the single instance in which Lance linked the word "repeal" directly to his opponent, and not to a third party’s characterization, it was when Malinowski was talking solely about the SALT deduction. Malinowski wants to get the full SALT deduction back. "Replacing" it would make no sense, the spokesman said. That may be. But Malinowski has used the word "repeal" and been described by others including the CWA in New Jersey, which endorsed him, as supporting repeal. He and Lance disagree on other portions of the tax bill, but they both say they want to keep the Opportunity Zone tax incentives. Perhaps eventually there will be legislation that one of them -- the winner in November -- can vote on. Until then, there are words, and Lance was able to point to the word "repeal" several times. That doesn't mean he is totally correct on his opponent's intentions, however. For these reasons, we rate Lance’s claim Half True.

pomt-14599	"I am the only candidate that has endorsed Bernie Sanders for President. In PA, I've got Bernie's back."	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/feb/04/john-fetterman/fetterman-says-he-only-senate-candidate-backing-sa/	Who’s got love for Bernie? Braddock Mayor and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman boasts that he’s the only Pennsylvania candidate to endorse Bernie Sanders so far. In a Reddit AMA Tuesday, one user praised Fetterman and fellow Democratic senate candidate Joe Sestak, retired Navy admiral and former U.S. congressman, for campaigns resembling Sanders’ grassroots feel. "I'm a fan of yours, but also a long time supporter of Admiral Joe. I see you as two Bernies against the one corporate party machine candidate. I wish you could team up somehow," wrote the Redditor. "We already have teamed up, as I am the only candidate that has endorsed Bernie Sanders for President," Fetterman replied. " In PA, I've got Bernie's back." A Fetterman spokesperson furthered this in email, adding that his endorsement was unique not just for the state, but nationally: A January Philadelphia Inquirer article named the Braddock mayor as "the only statewide candidate nationally to endorse the Vermont senator." Was that so? We were intrigued and decided to check it out. Among Pennsylvania Democratic candidates for U.S. Senator, four people have declared for the April primary so far, and only Fetterman has endorsed Sanders. Katie McGinty, Gov. Tom Wolf’s former chief of staff, is endorsing Hillary Clinton. Sestak has declined to throw support officially behind Sanders or Clinton. In response to our inquiry, a Sestak spokesman repeated a statement previously given to other press: "Joe just focuses on the people of Pennsylvania so that he can continue to serve them." Wire and springs manufacturer Joseph Vodvarka from Clinton, Pa., told PolitiFact Pennsylvania that he’s yet to endorse anyone. We looked for other Pennsylvania statewide candidates who endorsed Sanders and were unable to find any. So Fetterman’s comments on Reddit are accurate. His spokesperson added that there are no other statewide candidates nationally who support Sanders, but we were able to find a few. In Sanders’ home state of Vermont, for example, he has at least three such endorsers: former State Senator Matt Dunne, a gubernatorial candidate; State Senator David Zuckerman, a candidate for lieutenant governor, and State Auditor Doug Hoffer, who is running to keep his office. In Iowa, Sanders supporter Tom Fiegen is running for U.S. Senate. Still, Sanders has a notably low number of endorsements. Only two representatives in the U.S. Congress have endorsed Sanders, according to FiveThirtyEight, and no U.S. senators or governors have. Bertram Johnson, a political science professor at Middlebury College and expert in Vermont politics, said people endorse based on three factors: probability to win, their constituents’ leanings and political connections. "Endorsers are interested in someone who can support them and has supported them in the past, who’s been an insider for decades," Johnson explained. "This is obviously something that Bernie Sanders hasn’t done, because he hasn’t really been a Democrat until he entered this race." "I don’t know that he has a longstanding national network among politicians," he continued. "I think what he’s done a good job of is using national media, like MSNBC, to cultivate support among liberal activists." Sanders’ high tally of small contributions and a long list of Hollywood endorsements reflects this, Johnson said. Our ruling What answering questions about the Pennsylvania senate race, Fetterman said, "I am the only candidate that has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. In PA, I've got Bernie's back." We found he is the only statewide candidate in Pennsylvania who has endorsed Sanders. His office later claimed he was the only statewide candidate anywhere to endorse Sanders. That’s an exaggeration; statewide candidates in Vermont and Iowa have also endorsed Sanders. We’re fact-checking Fetterman’s original claim, however, and that statement is accurate. We rate his statement True.	None	John Fetterman	None	None	None	2016-02-04T13:45:00	2016-02-01	['Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-10473	"Obama voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill that put $6-billion in the pocket of big oil."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/17/hillary-clinton/slippery-math-loaded-words/	In the battle to win Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are each claiming they'd be tougher on "Big Oil" than their opponent. The oil companies are a convenient bogeyman because gasoline is averaging $3.42 per gallon in the state, and the high fuel cost is driving up prices on food and many other products. In a new TV ad, Clinton says Obama has made an empty boast by saying he doesn't take money from oil companies. "No candidate does," the announcer says, adding that it's against federal law. "But Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies." The screen then lists names and amounts from some of Obama's oil-affiliated contributors. The announcer continues: "Every gallon of gas takes over three bucks from your pocket, but Obama voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill that put $6-billion in the pocket of big oil. Hillary voted against it." We checked the contribution claim with this item, so here we'll address Clinton's claim that Obama voted for the bill. She is referring to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a major priority for the Bush administration. She is correct that Obama voted for it, one of of 25 Democrats who did. (Clinton voted against it.) Obama said he voted for it "reluctantly." He said he wanted it to do more to reduce reliance on foreign oil, but he liked the bill's incentives for ethanol and clean coal. "This bill, while far from a solution, is a first step toward decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil," he said. "It requires that 7.5-billion gallons of ethanol be mixed with gasoline by 2012. That's 7.5-billion gallons of fuel that will be grown in the corn fields of Illinois, and not imported from the deserts of the Middle East." The bill's title said its purpose was "to ensure jobs for our future with secure, affordable, and reliable energy." As you might expect, there are differing interpretations about whether the bill provided so much for the energy industry that it was a "giveaway." While Clinton is correct that the legislation included plenty of tax breaks for oil companies, the companies also had to pay a $3-billion extension of taxes on crude oil to help offset costs associated with oil spills. As we've noted with this prior item on a Clinton attack against Obama, a large share of of the $14.6-billion in tax incentives in the law actually went to "renewable" sources of energy, to accelerate the development of wind, clean-coal and nuclear power, and hybrid vehicles. (There is debate over whether coal and nuclear power should be considered renewable.) And then there's the matter of Clinton's math. She claims in the ad that the bill "put $6-billion in the pocket of big oil." That number is not accurate. The Clinton campaign said it comes from Public Citizen, one of many environmental and consumer organizations to oppose the bill. A Public Citizen report titled "The Best Energy Bill Corporations Could Buy: Summary of Industry Giveaways in the 2005 Energy Bill," had a headline that said the oil and gas subsidies totaled $6-billion. But when PolitiFact compared the group's numbers with the official estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional panel that calculates the cost of tax legislation, they didn't match. The Public Citizen report was considerably higher. We spoke with Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen's energy program, who explained why: The group had produced a higher number by including all of the tax breaks for oil companies that would reduce revenue to the federal government, but did not include other tax changes that would actually cost the companies additional money and bring new revenue to the government. For example, Public Citizen estimated a provision for oil refineries was an $842-million "giveaway" over the first six years, but it neglected to include the $436-million in new taxes that the companies would pay over the next four years. So when we included the additional taxes the oil and gas companies would pay, the actual number is about $5.3-billion over 10 years. Slocum acknowledged that the $6-billion cost was "a little misleading." But he said the conclusion remained the same, that "it was just egregious to have that level of a giveaway." And so we find that Clinton is right that Obama voted for the bill, but she's using incorrect numbers about the bill that exaggerate the benefit for oil companies, and her description of the bill fails to reflect its incentives for alternative energy. Overall, we'd say that makes her statement Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-04-17T00:00:00	2008-04-15	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-07605	"Since President Obama took office, gas prices have gone up 67 percent."	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/23/johnny-isakson/isakson-obama-policies-fuel-higher-gas-prices/	Some Republicans have repeated an interesting claim about rising gas prices. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., joined them in a Twitter post. "Just the Facts: Since President Obama took office, gas prices have gone up 67 percent," the senator wrote. Isakson included a link to an article with a chart from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundationthat found gas prices rose 7 percent during the first two years and two months of Republican George W. Bush’s presidency as compared with prices during a similar time span under Barack Obama, a Democrat who took office in January 2009. We figured Isakson was trying to make a case that Obama is not doing enough to cap rising gas prices. Isakson’s spokeswoman, Lauren Culbertson, told us her boss was indeed making that argument. She said the Obama administration has "contributed to the increase in gas prices" by: Restricting domestic energy production. Pushing for expanded cap-and-trade regulations through the Environmental Protection Agency. Proposing increased energy taxes of up to $90 billion over the next 10 years in his budget. Some experts dispute the argument that the president can do much about gas prices, saying they are a combination of many factors, such as demand from motorists and nations such as China, along with the rising cost per barrel for crude oil. The United States gets most of its crude oil from Canada, Mexico and OPEC nations such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela. "[The president] has limited control over gas prices," said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst for GasBuddy.com, an organization aimed at helping motorists find the best gas prices. First, let’s look at whether the Heritage Foundation got its numbers right. Crude oil accounts for two-thirds of the price of a gallon of gasoline, according to the federal government. About 10 percent of the cost comes from refining it. About another 10 percent goes toward distribution and marketing. About one-eighth of the cost of gasoline is for taxes. The foundation’s chart (exact numbers weren’t on the article) shows that average gas prices were slightly below $2 when Bush took office in January 2001. The chart shows prices rose slightly, but were still below $2 in February 2003. Their chart shows gas prices were just below $2 when Obama became president in January 2009 and were $3.10 in February 2011. The Heritage Foundation adjusted its figures for inflation. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $1.51 the week Bush took office, according to the federal government’s Energy Information Administration. Prices were $1.74 for regular during the last week of February 2003, the EIA reported. That’s a 15.2 percent increase. By contrast, EIA figures show the average price for a gallon of regular the week Obama took office was $1.83 and has risen steadily since he moved into the White House. During the last week of February, it was $3.34. That is an 82.5 percent increase. Isakson’s math, courtesy of the Heritage Foundation, is actually lower than the federal government’s totals. Now, is the context Isakson used to present these numbers on target? Isakson believes the president should allow more deepwater offshore oil drilling. Obama ordered a moratorium after the disastrous BP oil spill in 2010. The Obama administration approved its first permit since the oil spill, The Associated Press reported last month. Obama has said domestic oil production rose to a seven-year high in 2010, but others contend that is a result of policies set in place under Bush. The president has threatened to open the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to control prices. DeHaan compared that tactic to a classic children’s story. "That typically cools the market off," DeHaan said. "But we’ve seen so many claims that the traders also discard it. It’s like the boy who cries wolf." Gas price analysts such as DeHaan and H. Rao Unnava, a marketing professor at Ohio State University, say market speculation and concerns about political unrest in the Middle East have resulted in a rise in crude oil prices in recent months. In general, they say, gas prices are largely a result of supply and demand. Federal government data shows fuel consumption rose each year between 2001 and 2007. The average price for regular gasoline also rose in each of those years. The average price rose again in 2008, when the entire nation was feeling the recession, but consumption fell. Consumption has remained steady since while gas prices have risen since the end of 2008. "I don’t think [rising gas prices] would have much to do with President Bush or President Obama," said Unnava, associate dean of undergraduate programs at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business. Unnava said when gas prices shot past $3 a gallon in the summer of 2006, some conservatives blamed it on increasing demand, particularly in other countries such as China and India. Twenty years ago, China was not among the top five oil consumers. Today, China is second to the U.S. So where does this leave us? There are two elements to Isakson’s claim: the actual statistics and his implication that Obama is to blame for rising gas prices. Isakson’s precise statement about gas prices is accurate. They have increased. But the overall statement, intended as a political broadside, leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06868	"Social Security didn’t cause the debt crisis. Social Security had nothing to do with the debt crisis."	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/02/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucincih-says-social-security-didnt-cau/	As talks on the federal debt ceiling turned into a standoff, President Obama pressed congressional leaders to consider a debt-reduction plan that would include changes in Social Security to reduce costs. The plan, intended as a trade to win Republican support for increases in tax revenue, drew criticism from Democrats that included Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland. Kucinich said on the House floor July 15, 2011, that Social Security was being falsely thrown into the debate, and that reducing benefits or raising the retirement age would only "give government more money for tax cuts, spending or repaying the debt." "Social Security didn’t cause the debt crisis. Social Security had nothing to do with the debt crisis," he said. PolitiFact Ohio asked Kucinich's office how he backed up his statement. They referred us to "Social Security: The Trust Fund," a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. We also discovered that similar statements about Social Security and the debt crisis were previously checked by PolitiFact, and by our colleagues at Factcheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker. Unfortunately, we found that they rated the statements true, not true and "true but false" -- and that their stories were followed by notes about "our angry readers" and stepping on a live wire. Let's take deep breath and walk through it. Social Security is a government program funded primarily by dedicated payroll taxes. It's called a pay-as-you-go system because current revenues are used to pay current costs. For most of the past 30 years, because of reforms designed by the Greenspan Commission in 1982 to protect Social Security’s solvency, collected revenues have exceeded benefit payments to retirees, survivors and the disabled. Those surplus funds were credited to the Social Security trust fund. By the end of 2010, the trust fund totaled $2.6 trillion. Last year, Social Security began to run a cash flow deficit. Costs exceeded tax revenues, for reasons that included the recession and its high unemployment. Social Security dipped into the trust fund to make up the difference. Social Security's trustees projected that the fund would fully cover benefits through 2035, the Congressional Research Service notes, and that it would cover about 77 percent of benefits after that until 2085. Taking action like increasing the payroll tax or lifting the level of income subject to the tax above its current limit of $106,800 would keep the fund fully solvent for the entire 75 years. And this is where money meets myth, cash flow meets credit and true meets false. The trust fund is not a savings account or "lock box" into which cash is deposited. Social Security is required by law to put its entire surplus into interest-bearing government bonds -- Treasury securities backed by the U.S. government. They are IOUs -- assets to Social Security but liabilities to the rest of government. They're one part of government promising to pay back another. Once invested, the trust fund money is mingled with money from other sources of revenue in the U.S. Treasury general fund, and it is used for other government purposes that include spending, repaying debts or cutting taxes. For years, the infusion of Social Security's surplus revenue held down the federal deficit -- and, some say, encouraged spending. When Social Security operates with a negative cash flow -- that is, when benefits exceed revenues -- it draws on interest from the trust fund securities. To pay that interest and honor its IOUs to the trust fund, when the rest of the federal budget is operating at a deficit, the government has to borrow money. That contributes to the deficit -- even though Social Security is legally drawing on the surplus that was collected from its dedicated tax, and even though the Congressional Research Service says that "government borrowing from the public is not clearly linked to any particular aspect of what the government does." Kucinich was accurate in saying that Social Security didn’t cause the debt crisis. If anything, Social Security delayed it by subsidizing other spending and reducing the need to borrow money elsewhere. On the books, the Social Security trust fund has credits approaching $2.6 trillion. Social Security’s negative cash flow has begun to contribute a relatively small amount to the federal deficit, however, because Treasury has to borrow to cover the trust fund money that has been spent elsewhere. That is a recent development, and that information provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich’s claim Mostly True. Editor's note: PolitiFact Texas checked a slightly different claim about Social Security, finding it Mostly False.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-08-02T06:00:00	2011-07-15	['None']
pomt-09776	Goldman Sachs was Barack Obama's "No. 1 private contributor."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/25/michael-moore/barack-obama-goldman-sachs-campaign-contributions/	Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore has a new film coming out — Capitalism: A Love Story — and he appeared on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report to promote it. The show's ironically conservative host, Stephen Colbert, defended capitalism and the bailouts of late 2008, which led to a mock debate between them. At first, Wall Street was actually angry about the bailouts, Colbert claimed. "Because it might come with strings attached," he explained. "But they forgave Obama when he didn't add any. Now all is forgiven." "That's why you like Obama so much now?" Moore asked. "I don't like Obama so much," Colbert said. "On this, I do. And your film is helping me like Obama, because you're a critic of his. You think he's in the pocket of guys like Goldman Sachs." "I point out in the film that Goldman Sachs is his No. 1 private contributor," Moore answered. "But I voted for the guy. I'm still hopeful that he's going to do the right thing and side with us, and not Wall Street. But the jury's out on that." We'll let you draw your own conclusions on their debate. We wanted to check Moore's statement about Obama's contributors and the financial services firm Goldman Sachs. Obama made a big deal during the election that he didn't accept money from federal political action committees or lobbyists. But laws require individuals to disclose their occupation and their employer when they donate to federal political candidates. We checked with the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonpartisan group that specializes in analyzing campaign data. Their numbers include contributions from employees and their immediate families. Their analysis of the 2008 presidential campaign found that University of California employees were Obama's top donor, giving a collective $1.6 million. That system is run by the state of California, and hence is a public employer. No. 2 was Goldman Sachs. Goldman employees gave Obama $994,795. Obama's next biggest donors were the employees of Harvard University, Microsoft, Google, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Time Warner, the law firm Sidley Austin, and Stanford University. View Obama's complete list and amounts here. Incidentally, Goldman Sachs ranked No.4 on John McCain's list of employee contributions, at $230,095. Moore said that Goldman Sachs is Obama's "No. 1 private contributor." The data shows that is correct. We rate his statement True.

pomt-12659	"Since the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the southern border by 61 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/22/donald-trump/trump-says-illegal-immigration-down-61-percent-ele/	President Donald Trump told supporters in Kentucky to focus on their basketball team and let him take care of the rest, such as securing the borders and kicking out immigrants in the country illegally. "We will build, that's right, a great, great border wall … And we will stop the drugs that are pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and plenty of others. We're going to stop the drugs," Trump said March 20. "A lot of them are coming in from the southern border. Since the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the southern border by 61 percent, think of that, 61 percent, and we haven't started." Trump has boasted about a 40 percent decline in illegal immigration in his first month in office. We rated that Mostly True. He is now extending the comparison to November to show even more significant cuts. Border patrol apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border declined 60 percent from November 2016 to February 2017, but immigration experts caution against assuming that declines have been a sole result of Trump’s policies. Border apprehension data The Department of Homeland Security on March 8 released illegal border crossing data that show that in the month of the presidential election, November 2016, border patrol made 47,210 apprehensions. In February 2017, there were 18,762 apprehensions, a 60 percent decline. Total southwest border apprehensions declined about 63 percent from November 2016 to February 2017. DHS defined total apprehensions as those made by border patrol between ports of entry and inadmissibility at ports of entry determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Field Operations. We asked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol for apprehension data from Election Day to the day before Trump’s Kentucky speech, but the agency said it provides statistics by month, not by specific dates and timeframes. It’s worth noting that this past fall there was an unseasonal increase of unauthorized border crossings, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. People rushed to the border before Trump took over and implemented new policies, he said. "After that rush to the border, it’s natural to expect a decline," Wilson said. "What we cannot still answer is whether this is a temporary or permanent decline." DHS Secretary John Kelly in a March 8 statement said illegal crossings typically rise between March and May. While Trump’s rhetoric against illegal immigration has played a role in recent apprehension decreases, apprehension levels are typically lower in the winter months and on-the-ground changes in response to policies can take longer, experts have told us. "It is almost always necessary to look at trends over a longer period, usually at least six months, to get a better sense of changes," said Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. "It seems likely that the numbers of border crossers will go back up again before long given that the human rights situation in Central America is still incredibly problematic, and Central American asylum seekers are one of the main sources of migration in recent years." Other factors worth considering, according to Gilman are that Mexico may have stepped up its enforcement efforts so that migrants don’t reach the U.S.-Mexico border, and that smugglers may be waiting to decide on new routes for bringing people across the border Our ruling Trump said, "Since the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the Southern border by 61 percent." While U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not provide border apprehension statistics for specific dates, monthly data show a 60 percent decline from the month of the presidential election, November 2016, to February 2017. Experts said other factors should be considered in the decline and that it’s too early to tell whether low apprehensions will become the new norm or if they will increase in coming months, as they typically do.

pomt-03187	"Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa already have 70 mph" speed limits on rural interstates, and "we see that they’ve been able to do it safely."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/01/robin-vos/robin-vos-says-higher-speed-limit-rural-interstate/	Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, gunned into the fast lane after a colleague proposed raising the speed limit on Wisconsin’s rural interstate highways from 65 to 70 mph. Vos embraced the idea as an overdue time-saver for drivers -- and he sought to head off criticism that higher speeds could kill. "We see all the states around us, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa already have 70, and just this last week Democrat Gov. Quinn signed the bill into law in Illinois," Vos said Aug. 22, 2013, on Wisconsin Public Television’s "Here and Now" program. "So it makes no sense not to have Wisconsin join this group." Vos added: "And certainly as we’ve driven in other states, we see that they’ve been able to do it safely. Most of the interstates were designed for 75 miles an hour anyway because they were done a long time ago and they were reduced just for fuel economy. So I think the safety standards are in place, and we can do it in a way that makes sense for all of us." Vos was more emphatic in other comments to reporters, as quoted in the Journal Sentinel, saying that in the three states he cited: "We haven't seen any issues there." We’ll examine his safety claim here and tackle the historical statement in a separate item. Where things stand For starters, most states are already at 70 or 75 mph. There are 13 at 65 mph, according to tracking by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Of those, Wisconsin is the only state outside the northeast, west coast and Alaska where 65 is the limit on rural interstates. Only Hawaii is lower, with a speed limit of 60. As more and more states have raised their limits, a flurry of sometimes-conflicting studies has tried to tease out the role of speed in vehicle-crash trends. In reviewing the research in 2013, the Council of State Governments noted that most policy makers and researchers agree that physics means higher speeds can cause more and more deadly accidents. But the council noted, "Intense debate still surrounds the idea that speed-limit hikes alone make roadways more dangerous." The challenge, an Indiana study said, is "unraveling the effects of speed-limit changes from factors such as speed enforcement; vehicle miles traveled; vehicle occupancy; seat-belt usage; alcohol use; proportions of passenger cars, minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles; and vehicle safety features, such as airbags and antilock brakes." With that in mind, let’s look specifically at the three states Vos cited. Iowa: The Department of Transportation in Iowa, where 70 became law in 2005, surveyed crash trends elsewhere and reported its findings in early 2006. "The evidence in this study and the previous seven annual comparison studies indicates that raising the speed limit in Midwestern states in the United States has resulted in an increase in traffic fatalities in the years following that increase," the department said. Iowa saw the same in the short-term aftermath of its change, according to a study that examined the 2.5 years before and after the change. Fatal and major-injury crashes increased on average from 78.8 to 90.8 per year, resulting in a 15.2 percent increase, an Iowa State study found. The study showed that early in Iowa’s own experience with 70, crashes at all severity levels increased compared to the same period before the change. And compared to a much longer period before the change, fatal and other serious across-the-median crashes rose faster than random variations in the annual data, the Iowa State researchers found in 2009. But the same Iowa State study -- also cited by Vos -- casts doubt on the significance of the simple numerical findings. More rigorous statistical testing found "no statistically significant increase in crashes," the study said. It concluded: "While it is likely changes were due to the speed-limit change (as the only significant highway safety–related public policy change in Iowa since 2004 has been the change to 70 mph on rural Interstates), the findings presented herein are necessarily observations of correlation only." The study acknowledged that looking at only 2.5 years "may not provide an adequate base of data for a reliable statistical analysis." In addition, other factors such as changing economic conditions and high fuel prices may have impacts that mask any speed limit–related changes, it said. More recently, the Des Moines Register reported in Sept. 4, 2012 that 10 percent more people had died on Iowa's interstate highways since the state raised the speed limit to 70 mph -- even though fatalities on all Iowa roads in 2011 were at the lowest level since World War II. The paper quoted Col. Patrick Hoye of the Iowa State Patrol, who said the Iowa statistics bore out warnings by traffic safety planners. "Any time you raise speeds, an accident has a greater risk for injury and death. The other thing that we see quite often on the interstates is that people are just following too closely, and at higher speeds that just makes the situation that much worse," Hoye said. We asked Iowa’s top traffic safety official, Steve Gent, about the speed limit change. Gent didn’t like the idea of the speed-limit hike, but has tempered his feelings. He told us that safety problems from 70 mph were "not as bad as we thought." More people are driving near average speeds, and fewer at very high or low speeds. That scenario is associated with safer driving. In fact, the study found that speeding was reduced, and that speeds -- on average -- increased only about 2 mph. Still, Gent said, the statistics suggest some negative safety aspects. Michigan: Michigan went to 70 in 1996 and 1997. Truck speed limits are lower. A 2000 study by Michigan State University found that total traffic crashes increased in the three years after the change -- but traffic volume increased faster. Fatal crashes went up 4.5 percent, but the combination of fatals and major-injury crashes actually fell, presumably due to increased seat belt use and airbags, the report said. Travel speeds rose only about 1 to 2 mph over three years, considering all vehicles. Overall, the study concluded: "Raising the speed limit appears to have had little effect" on speed or crash frequency. "Nothing really happened" in those three years, the author of the study, MSU engineering professor William C. Taylor, told us. "The signs changed. A few of the slower people drove a little faster. But (driving at faster speeds) didn’t change at all." Vos cited no studies on Michigan accident statistics, but did cite comments in the media by a Michigan State Patrol traffic safety official that slower is not necessarily safer on interstates. Minnesota: The state raised the speed limit on rural interstates from 65 to 70 mph in 1997. A Minnesota DOT study found that during the five years immediately following the increase (1998-2002) there was a 24 percent increase in all crashes on interstates where speed limits were increased, Kevin Gutknecht, the department’s communications director told us. There was a 70 percent increase in fatal crashes in the same locations, a DOT spokesman said. The comparison period was 1992-96. The situation was much improved when DOT compared 2007-2011 to pre-change time period. For the same locations, there was a 1 percent increase in all interstate crashes and a 19 percent increase in fatal crashes. During the 2007-2011 period, roadway engineering safety improvements, vehicle safety enhancements and changes in laws have contributed to a downturn in fatal and serious crashes, Gutknecht said. The agency’s website, we noted, advises motorists that lowering speed limits will not necessarily reduce speeds or cut crash frequencies. The comments are not specific to interstates. "The driver is much more influenced by the roadway conditions," the DOT site says. "Although lowering the speed limit is often seen as a cure-all in preventing crashes, this is not the case. Crashes are most often the result of driver inattention and driver error. However, if a posted speed limit is unrealistically low, it creates a greater speed variance (i.e. some drivers follow the speed limit while most drive the reasonable speed). This speed variance can contribute to crashes." Vos cited no Minnesota studies. Our rating Vos said "Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa already have 70 mph" speed limits on rural interstates, and "we see that they’ve been able to do it safely." Vos goes too far with the blanket statement. We found numbers suggesting otherwise in two states, and a key Iowa official attributes some negative safety impact to the change. But the Michigan experience fits his description, and researchers in Iowa cast doubt on the significance of the speed-limit change in the uptick in fatalities there. So there’s some gas in his claim’s tank. Half True.	None	Robin Vos	None	None	None	2013-09-01T05:00:00	2013-08-22	['Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Iowa']
pomt-09837	"If we went back to the obesity rates that existed back in the 1980s, the Medicare system over several years could save as much as a trillion dollars."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/24/barack-obama/obama-says-lower-obesity-rates-would-save-medicare/	We don't expect President Barack Obama to remember everything we write about him, but when he repeats a claim we had earlier found to be False, we think it's worth calling him out. On Aug. 20, 2009, President Obama held a discussion and conference call at a national health care forum sponsored by Organizing for America, the successor to Obama for America, his campaign organization. In response to a question about how food and lifestyle affect health care, the president responded, "Well, this is a great question. Look, this is an interesting statistic. If we went back to the obesity rates that existed back in the 1980s, the Medicare system over several years could save as much as a trillion dollars. I mean, that's how much our obesity rate has made a difference in terms of diabetes and heart failure and all sorts of preventable diseases." It wasn't the first time Obama had talked about the cost of obesity. The earlier instance came at a Des Moines Register presidential debate among Democratic primary contenders on Dec. 13, 2007. "Well, just to emphasize how important prevention and cost savings can be in the Medicare system, it's estimated if we went back to the obesity rates that existed in 1980, that would save the Medicare system $1 trillion," Obama said. But there's a problem. When we reviewed his claim in 2007, we found it False. We noted that he was accurately quoting that number from a report issued by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. The report states, "If we were able to reduce obesity to 1980s levels, Medicare would save $1-trillion." It attributes the number to the Commonwealth Fund and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that study — and his claim — are not supported by the data. At issue is the increased prevalence of obesity. The percent of the U.S. population considered to be obese has roughly doubled since the 1980s. Researchers have documented that these people need more health care due to complications from obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancers and other illnesses. Researchers have also developed models to calculate costs for obesity-related health care. And it's true that obesity does drive up health costs, but you can't get to $1 trillion, according to our estimates. (Our friends at Factcheck.org reached the same conclusion; check out their analysis here .) The Centers for Disease Control cited a study on health spending due to people who are overweight or obese that shows numbers significantly less than $1 trillion. We also verified our assessment with Eric Finkelstein, a health economist with the research group RTI International who has studied the issue extensively and written several papers on the topic. Finkelstein said obesity accounts for excess health spending of about $90 billion a year. About half of that — about $45 billion — is billed to Medicare and Medicaid together. Medicare's share of obesity spending therefore is between $20 billion and $25 billion. If obesity rates rolled back to 1980s levels, Medicare spending would be about half that, or about $12 billion a year. That's a far cry from $1 trillion. From the perspective of 2009, we can offer two additional developments — and neither improves the accuracy of Obama's assertion. The first is that Finkelstein and his colleagues published an updated paper on July 27, 2009, in the online version of the journal Health Affairs. In it, they said, "We estimate that the medical costs of obesity could have risen to $147 billion per year by 2008." That estimate is about 63 percent higher than it was in the previous paper. So if we increase all of our previous calculations by 63 percent, the number goes up — but not by enough to push the total cost to $1 trillion any time soon. Even the most generous estimate, factoring in inflation and other factors, would mean that $1 trillion would be reached in perhaps 30 years. And that's where the second new development comes in. Unlike in his comment in 2007, Obama actually gave a time frame the second time he cited the statistic -- specifically, "over several years." And 30 years doesn't sound like "several" to us. We contacted Finkelstein to see whether he agreed with our logic, and we reached his co-author on the paper instead. Justin Trogdon, a research economist at RTI International, said he agreed that the increase in the cost burden from obesity, while a substantial jump in a relatively short time, did not get Obama much closer to the mark. "It's a little higher today, but I don't think it's increased enough to get there," he said. "It would be tough to get to $1 trillion." Medical research supports Obama's broad point that obesity is a serious health issue that imposes significant financial, as well as physical, costs on the American public. However, obesity doesn't cost anywhere near as much as the president has said it does. Once again, we rate his claim False.

pomt-04465	Says Romney invested in a firm that made goods in China that "could have been made here in America."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/09/barack-obama/obama-ties-romney-chinese-exporter/	President Barack Obama continues to go after Mitt Romney for investing in companies that sent jobs overseas. A recent Obama ad combines the outsourcing charge with an attack on Romney’s claim that he would take a tougher line than the president on trade with China. It features grainy photos of Chinese factory workers in assembly plants. An announcer says: "These appliances could have been made here in America. But a company called Global-Tech maximized profits by paying its workers next to nothing under sweatshop conditions in China. When Mitt Romney led Bain, they saw Global-Tech as a good investment even knowing that the firm promoted its practice of exploiting low-wage labor to its investors. Mitt Romney, tough on China? Since when?" We have done other fact checks on claims related to Romney’s investments in firms that engaged in outsourcing. This time, we decided to examine whether it is accurate to say that Global-Tech's appliances "could have been made here in America." Romney and Global-Tech Of course, any product could be made in the U.S. if a manufacturer built a plant. For this fact-check, though, we'll explore whether Global-Tech's small appliances could reasonably have been made here. Romney’s investment company, Bain Capital, bought a 10.3 percent share in Global-Tech Appliances through a subsidiary in 1998, according to a July article in Mother Jones. In a prospectus that year, Global-Tech described that it had two factories in China that produced coffee makers, bread makers, and other small appliances for some of the best known brands, such as Sunbeam, Hamilton Beach, Mr. Coffee, Oster and others. It boasted that the combination of retail trends, superior manufacturing technology and low wage rates had fueled a three-fold rise in sales from $31 million in 1995 to $96 million in 1998. The Romney campaign rebutted the ad’s claims saying, "This is another 'overboard' ad from a president who is trying to distract from his failure to stand up to China." However, the campaign did not correct any of the ad’s details about Bain and Global-Tech. What was brewing with small appliances The ad’s larger point is that Romney boosted the trend toward low-cost overseas production at the expense of American jobs. The ad sets that up by saying "these appliances" -- meaning those coffee makers and hair dryers made by Global-Tech -- could in fact have been made in the U.S. But is that a fair assumption? We tried to get a picture of what was going on with the business of small home appliances in 1998, the year Romney invested in the Hong Kong based company. Coffee makers are a good example. According to the United Nations Commodity Trade database, in 1993, China exported about $23 million worth of coffee makers to the U.S. By 1998, business had doubled to $46 million. Add in the exports from Hong Kong to America and the total reached over $100 million. Goods made in China destined for the U.S. often flowed through Hong Kong. Americans seemed to have an almost insatiable demand for imported coffee makers and Chinese/Hong Kong imports satisfied over a third of it. At the time, the U.S. share of total world exports of coffee makers was about 3 percent, or $30 million. Gary Hamilton, a professor of international studies and sociology at the University of Washington who focuses on consumer goods, says the situation with coffee makers was typical. "The manufacture of most such consumer goods had already left the U.S." before Bain bought its stake in Global-Tech, Hamilton said. "Some as many as 10 to 15 years earlier." Hamilton said this was the result of forces that had begun to take shape in the 1970s. It wasn’t just low wages in China and other countries. Western companies invested in technology like barcodes and scanners that allowed them to manage inventory and supply chains across the globe. Container ships got bigger, which made transport much cheaper. The companies that made goods, such as Sunbeam, bought out similar brands and consolidated, while the on the retail side, firms such as Wal-Mart built enormous buying power. The end result made American production of these goods increasingly less competitive. "There is every reason to think that the manufacture of these items would not then and would not now return to the U.S.," Hamilton said. The remaining manufacturers There are still U.S. companies making things such as coffee makers and blenders but they occupy a tiny sliver of the market. David Riley runs Americans Working, a website that lists goods made in the U.S.. Riley noted that Bunn, an iconic coffee machine brand, is still operating in Illinois. But, "I think only high end personal units and commercial," he said. A similar website, Still Made in USA, said the same thing. We called Bunn and never heard back. There are exceptions, but in general, the more expensive the item, the better the odds it can be made profitably in the U.S. KitchenAid makes mixers and blenders at its plant in Greenville, Ohio, according to the website Still Made in USA. But its coffee grinders are largely made in India with final assembly in the U.S. It is not uncommon for manufacturers to outsource their more affordable lines while keeping the costlier versions domestic. We took a look at companies in Germany, Switzerland and Italy where exports of coffee makers remain robust. In recent years, Italy favored the world with some $500 million a year in espresso and latte makers. But there too, those countries succeeded at the high-end of marketplace and some firms outsourced their more garden variety products to low-wage nations. We should note that some big ticket products such as refrigerators and stoves retain a sizable footprint in America. General Electric told Consumer Reports it is investing $1 billion to expand its line of washing machines and dryers in Louisville, Ky..Frigidaire, owned by Sweden’s Electrolux, produces dishwashers in Kinston, N.C. If the Obama ad had referred to a broader set of home goods than just the ones made by Global Tech, then there is some basis to find that the appliances could have been produced in the U.S. But the ad was fairly specific about what products it had in mind. And in 1998, as now, those products were overwhelmingly made in other countries. Our ruling The Obama campaign ad said, "These appliances could have been made here in America." For the coffee makers and other items that Global-Tech produced, that is conceivable but unlikely. The U.S. had the technology and the trained people to do the work. But the economics of global trade made that unworkable well before Romney and Bain invested in the firm. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02136	In some states, African-Americans are three times more likely to be sentenced to death than whites for the same crime.	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/07/van-jones/van-jones-some-states-black-defendants-are-three-t/	Oklahoma’s botched execution revived national concerns over the death penalty, with pundits highlighting who is more likely to pay the ultimate price for the most serious crimes. CNN Crossfire host and liberal pundit Van Jones connected death penalty sentences with race during a May 4 roundtable discussion on ABC’s This Week. Jones claimed that African-Americans are three times more likely than whites to be sentenced to death for the same crime, saying, "In some states, people for the same crime, three times more likely to sentence an African-American defendant to death. I think that's very, very troubling." PunditFact wondered: Is that true? Jones’ evidence The death penalty is not allowed everywhere, but 32 states have some form of capital punishment. Jones pointed to a study from the state of Washington as evidence of his claim. University of Washington researchers released a 2014 report examining the role of race in death penalty cases in that state from 1981 to 2012. The team examined trial reports of 285 adult convictions for aggravated murder during that period, controlling for many variables and probing the reports for details. The report was commissioned by attorneys for a Death Row inmate appealing his sentence to the Washington Supreme Court. The team’s most relevant finding to this fact-check: Juries were three times more likely to hand down a death sentence against a black defendant than in cases against white defendants whose cases had similar characteristics. This report is specific to the jury-sentencing stage, which is one stop in the death penalty process. For instance, prosecutors must also decide whether to pursue capital punishment, and there may be plea agreements after they make that decision. Jones sent us more information that we will discuss in the next section. What other studies say The Washington study was the only recent state-centric look at Death Row defendants’ race that experts could name. More often, research shows the victim’s race, not the defendant’s, to be a factor in death penalty cases, they said. Specifically, capital punishment is sought and imposed much more often in cases in which the murder victim is white than in comparable murders involving black victims, said James Acker, a University at Albany-SUNY School of Criminal Justice professor. This has been proven in several jurisdictions, he said, pointing to North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois and Maryland. In other words, it’s who you kill that has a more proven effect in death penalty sentencing, experts say. Other studies have linked defendants’ race and death penalty sentencing, though not always on a state level and not recently. An analysis by researchers including University of Iowa law professor David Baldus, who is cited as one of the foremost researchers addressing questions about race and capital punishment, examined a sampling of death penalty cases in Philadelphia from 1983 to 1993. The analysis found average death sentencing rates were 38 percent higher for black defendants than for other defendants. Baldus, who died in 2011, played a role in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1987 McCleskey vs. Kemp decision, in which the court determined Baldus’ research showing statistical evidence of racial discrimination in Georgia death penalty cases did not make the death penalty unconstitutional. Defendants accused of killing white victims were four times more likely to get the death penalty than those who killed black victims, his research showed. Baldus found then that race-of-defendant disparities existed in several other states, too, though ratios were not available or the studies were not always deemed well-controlled. The vast majority of death penalty cases are decided in state courts. But federal courts also decide some death penalty cases, and a 2000 analysis showed from 1995-2000, 45 percent of capital-crime cases approved for death penalty prosecution by U.S. attorneys involved black defendants, compared to 28 percent involving white defendants (a ratio of 1.6:1). Just because Washington is the only state with a reported 3:1 ratio for death penalty sentencing does not mean there are not more, experts told us. The problem is the data is very time-consuming to collect and analyze. "This is a very difficult question to pursue in research," said Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminology professor, "because you want to compare race of defendant/victim outcomes in comparable cases." That’s a lot of information from which to sift, including how the murder was committed and characteristics of the victims and offenders. "Having conducted such studies in two states (Maryland and South Carolina), it takes years to collect all the data," Paternoster said, noting the studies in Maryland and South Carolina did not show much of a disparity depending on the race of the defendant. Jones pointed to a study of racial disparities in inmates facing the death penalty in Harris County, Texas. Paternoster, who conducted the research after being commissioned by a Death Row inmate’s attorneys, found, "The probability that the district attorney will advance a case to a (death) penalty trial is more than three times as high when the defendant is African-American than for white defendants." But Paternoster told us his research isn’t necessarily representative of prosecutors’ decisions in Texas or Harris County (nor does it speak to sentences). Paternoster was examining 21 cases -- a subgroup whittled from 504 capital murder cases from 1992 to 1999 -- in which defendants’ crimes matched up with the circumstances of inmate Duane Buck’s double killing. Our ruling Jones said African-American defendants are three times more likely to receive a death penalty sentence than white defendants found guilty of the same crime in some states. We found racial disparities permeate cases surrounding the death penalty. The more proven factor is that the victim’s race affects a defendant’s sentence. Jones pointed us to a 2014 study of jury verdicts in death penalty cases in Washington, as well as other studies of metro jurisdictions. The situation in other states, however, is not as clear. Jones’ claim is partially accurate, as researchers have shown sentencing disparities by race do exist, but the state data to prove a pattern beyond Washington is either old or not exactly in line with the specific ratio Jones cited. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Van Jones	None	None	None	2014-05-07T16:06:45	2014-05-04	['None']
pomt-07635	A proposed revenue smart cap "gives Floridians a voice, requiring a 60 percent vote by citizens in order to impose a new tax, fee, license, fine, charge or assessment."	/florida/statements/2011/mar/16/andy-gardiner/majority-leader-andy-gardiner-says-smart-cap-bill-/	Florida's fiscally conservative Senate wants to leave its mark in the Constitution by more tightly capping the amount of taxes the state could collect in any given year. On March 15, 2011, the Senate passed what it calls a "smart cap," which would limit increases in future state spending to a formula based on annual growth of population and cost of living. The proposal still needs the approval of the House before it could be placed on the fall 2012 ballot. If it makes it to the ballot, 60 percent of voters would have to approve the amendment before it became law. Proponents say the measure makes it more difficult to raise taxes. But opponents argue the cap could harm the state during economic downturns, and that the state already has a revenue cap that is calculated by state personal income. In voicing support for a more restrictive cap, Senate Majority Leader Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said the proposal will prevent the overuse of taxpayer dollars and will give Floridians a direct voice in charting the state's fiscal course. "It also gives Floridians a voice, requiring a 60 percent vote by citizens in order to impose a new tax, fee, license, fine, charge or assessment on Floridians," Gardiner said in a press release distributed moments after the bill, SJR 958, passed the Senate 27-13. Our fact-check: Would the cap as proposed by the Senate require voter approval for new taxes or fees? Background on cap If enacted, the revenue cap would become effective starting with the 2014-15 budget year. In that year, the state would be allowed to collect an amount equal to the state revenues collected during the 2013-14 budget year plus an adjustment for inflation and population growth. The 2015-16 budget would be created based on revenues from 2014-15 -- with another adjustment for inflation and population growth. And so on. There are several ways to break the cap, according to lawmakers. The Legislature, by a two-thirds vote of each chamber, may increase the revenue limitation for any fiscal year, and use that new figure to determine the revenue guidelines by future years. The Legislature, by a three-fifths vote, may increase the allowable state revenue for any one fiscal year. But those additional revenues would not be counted in future years. Voters also could be asked to raise the revenue cap, according to analysis of the bill. To do that, two-thirds of the Legislature would have to agree to put the question before voters. Sixty percent of voters would have to agree to raise the revenue cap for the change to be adopted. Voter say on new taxes? So the Legislature could raise the revenue cap by itself, or it could ask voters to raise the revenue cap. But Gardiner was much more specific -- saying that voters would be required to not just raise the revenue cap, but to approve a new tax or fee. It turns out, nothing like that is in the proposal. Gardiner spokeswoman Allison Fogt said he was "discussing a tax, fee, license, fine, charge or assessment on Floridians that would 'bust the cap.' " But even still, any new tax or fee that would break the revenue cap could be passed without voter approval. At a press conference on March 16, Senate President Mike Haridopolos talked about how the revenue cap doesn't necessarily tie the hands of future Legislatures because they can always override it. "With a super-majority vote, the Legislature can spend more money," he said. Our ruling In prepared remarks praising the passage of a Senate bill that would tighten a cap on the amount of revenues the state could collect, Gardiner tried to suggest the legislation also requires 60 percent of voters to approve any new tax or fee. It doesn't. Voters could be asked to raise the revenue cap, or lawmakers could do it on their own. And the proposal talks about revenue collections in general, not specific taxes or fees.

pomt-10982	"The Russian state has never interfered ... into internal American affairs including election process."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/16/vladimir-putin/vladimir-putin-falsely-claims-russia-never-interfe/	Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Russia has never interfered in American politics during a joint press conference with President Donald Trump, despite all evidence to the contrary. Putin’s assertion came on July 16, just days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a dozen Russian intelligence officials for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. "The Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs including election process," Putin said following a one-on-one meeting with Trump in Helsinki, Finland. Trump, for his part, appeared to take his Russian counterpart at his word. "President Putin says it's not Russia," Trump said. "I don't see any reason why it would be." But the U.S. intelligence community, House and Senate panels led by Republicans, the special counsel’s team and members of Trump’s own administration have endorsed the view that Russia has interfered in American politics, in a practice that dates as far back as the Soviet era. Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election As we wrote in our story naming the 2017 Lie of the Year — Trump’s claim that Russian election interference is a "made-up story" — a mountain of evidence points to the fact that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In a January 2017 assessment, the CIA, FBI, NSA and Director of National Intelligence — referred to as the the intelligence community — concluded that Russia intervened to help Trump’s election chances while hurting those of Hillary Clinton. Intelligence agencies have said the Kremlin directed the cyber-theft of private data, the placement of propaganda against particular candidates, and an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process. A Senate panel that independently reviewed the intelligence community’s assessment backed up its findings, concluding July 3 that the agencies’ joint assessment was a "sound intelligence product." The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also said Russia conducted cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions during the 2016 campaign. Fresh evidence of Moscow’s election interference emerged in indictments stemming from the special counsel’s investigation. On July 13, Mueller charged 12 Russian intelligence officers for their role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign, and subsequently leaking stolen emails and documents. In this latest indictment, the special counsel alleged that units operating under Moscow’s military intelligence agency conducted cyber operations that involved "the staged releases of documents" obtained through targeted computer hacking. "These units conducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election," the indictment states. Previously, the special counsel charged 13 Russians and three Russian entities with conspiring to defraud the United States and interfere with the 2016 presidential election. Members of Trump’s own administration have endorsed a view at odds with the president. Then-CIA director Mike Pompeo — now secretary of state — said in November 2017 that he stands by the intelligence community’s January 2017 findings that Russian cyber-meddling sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton. Following Mueller’s first indictment against Russian hackers in February, Trump’s then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster called the evidence of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election "incontrovertible." Dan Coats, Trump’s top intelligence official, told lawmakers in February, "There should be no doubt that (Putin) views the past effort as successful." Coats, the director of National Intelligence, also issued a stern warning days before Trump’s meeting with Putin in Helsinki. He compared the current threat of more Russian cyberattacks to warning signs before the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000. "It was in the months prior to September 2001 when, according to then-CIA Director George Tenet, the system is blinking red," Coats said. "And here we are nearly two decades later, and I'm here to say, the warning lights are blinking red again." The history of Russian meddling In light of Putin’s blanket denial, we took a fresh look at Russia’s election-meddling past. Historians said the 2016 election was the first known example of a Russian attempt to sway a U.S. election in favor of a specific candidate, though there could have been additional attempts that remain classified or undiscovered. "If by ‘Russia’ one means post-1991 Russia, that statement (from Putin) appears to be correct based on publicly available information," said Lucan Way, a University of Toronto professor specializing in democratization and authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union. But that does not mean the 2016 meddling was unprecedented. Way noted that Russia has frequently interfered in the elections of post-Soviet countries since the fall of the Soviet Union. Further, the Soviet Union worked in secret to help or hurt U.S. candidates at least four times during the Cold War era. "What we are seeing with Russia's active measures today are ‘unprecedented’ in that they use new tools and technologies … but the ends are very much older, and are straight from the KGB playbook," said Calder Walton, an expert in intelligence history and international relations at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. "One can't understand Russian active measures to interfere in the 2016 election without understanding the long KGB history." In 1960, for example, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev offered Adlai Stevenson assistance from a secret propaganda campaign. Stevenson declined the offer and ultimately lost in the Democratic primary to John F. Kennedy. In 1968, Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, offered to secretly fund for Hubert Humphrey’s campaign against Richard Nixon, but Humphrey rejected the bribe. In 1976, the KGB opened a smear campaign against anti-communist Democrat Henry "Scoop" Jackson, forging FBI paperwork to make it seem that Jackson was gay and distributing the fake reports to U.S. newspapers both during and after the election. But Walton said Soviet interference efforts became most active in the 1980s against Ronald Reagan, pointing to a now-public cache of top-secret KGB records called the Mitrokhin Archive. The KGB sought compromising material on Reagan in 1976 and planted some anti-Reagan articles in foreign newspapers. Ahead of the 1984 election, the KGB also worked to discredit Reagan’s policies and popularize the slogan "Reagan Means War" around the world. "There is a long history of the Kremlin interfering in internal U.S. affairs, including elections," Walton said. "This included gathering compromising material on U.S. politicians, supporting Kremlin-favored candidates in U.S. elections, spreading forgeries and disinformation campaigns to inculcate distrust among the U.S. population in their government and Western allies." Walton added that Putin’s claim is "nonsense." We've reached out to the Russian embassy and will update the fact-check if we hear back. Our ruling Putin said, "The Russian state has never interfered ... into internal American affairs including election process." A mountain of evidence testifies to the fact that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. intelligence community and a Republican-led Senate panel concluded independently of each other that Kremlin-directed operatives stole private data, used propaganda against particular candidates, and engaged in an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process. A Republican-led House panel found in its own investigation that Russia conducted cyberattacks during the 2016 campaign. These findings are supported by indictments stemming from the special counsel’s investigation. There is no public evidence to suggest that the post-Cold War Russian government had previously interfered in a U.S. election at levels near the 2016 meddling, but the Soviet Union made several attempts to do so prior to its collapse in 1991.

pomt-08095	"On the question on the DREAM Act, no -- no to granting lower tuition to illegals."	/florida/statements/2010/dec/14/john-mica/florida-congressman-says-dream-act-means-lower-tui/	A controversial plan to provide a path to permanent legal residency for children brought to the United States illegally continues to rise toward the top of the agenda in the final days of the 111th Congress. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would allow children brought to the United States illegally to obtain permanent legal status if they complete two years of college or in the military and meet other obligations. But opponents have been raising several objections about the proposed legislation, saying it could create a path for family members to citizenship, that the measure means amnesty for more than 2 million illegal immigrants and that the costs of illegal immigration already are ginormous. PolitiFact already has dealt with several of these claims, which you can read about here, but we found another one from Florida Republican U.S. Rep. John Mica that we wanted to consider. Back on Nov. 18, 2010, Mica appeared on the MSNBC show The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell to talk about several of the Democrats top end-of-the-year priorities, including the DREAM Act. At one point, Mica, O'Donnell and Democratic U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York, debated whether the DREAM Act would grant lower state university tuition to illegal immigrants who qualified. "Well first of all, on the question on the DREAM Act, no -- no to granting lower tuition to illegals," Mica said, who was first elected to the U.S. House in 1993 and is the incoming Transportation Committee chairman. "It does not do that, Congressman. It does not do that," O'Donnell jumped back in. "You can vote against it for another reason, but not that one." We wanted to see who's right? The DREAM Act explained One of the problems when talking about the "DREAM Act" has been that there have in fact been several different versions of the legislation floating around Congress. The versions all have the same general goal -- providing a path to legal residency for illegal immigrants brought here by their parents or someone else -- but the terms of each piece of legislation were different. Congress finally set the boundaries of the legislation on Dec. 7, when the House passed a version of the DREAM Act 216-198. The legislation actually was tucked in as an amendment to an innocuous bill already approved by the U.S. Senate. But the bill must still return to the Senate for a second vote. Under the bill, H.R. 5281, illegal immigrants would be able to apply for conditional nonimmigrant status for an initial period of five years if: 1.) They are under 30; 2.) Arrived in the United States before the age of 16; 3.) Have lived here at least the last five years; 4.) Received a U.S. high school diploma or GED; 5.) And have largely avoided run-ins with the law (you can get all the details by reading the bill text). Those immigrants could then apply for a second five-year period if they serve in the U.S. military or complete at least two years of a community college or undergraduate program. And after 10 years, immigrants could then become legal permanent residents. As part of the program, immigrants could receive certain federal student loans, but not federal Pell grants, food stamps or Medicaid. They must also pay application fees totaling up to $2,525. How many people are we talking about? In July, a nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute analysis of the DREAM Act concluded there are about 2.1 million people who would be potentially eligible under the DREAM Act. But the number crunching arm of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that only about 700,000 people would have conditional nonimmigrant status in 2020 -- the year before anyone could become a permanent legal resident. CBO estimated that less than half of the individuals who would initially apply for conditional nonimmigrant status would qualify to apply for a five-year extension. Tuition breaks for illegals Mica isn't saying there's some type of DREAM Act tuition discount for people taking advantage of the legislation (there isn't). He's talking about DREAM Act participants being able to qualify for in-state tuition, because they would be legal residents of a state just like other U.S. citizens. So, they'd be paying less in tuition than someone who attends an out-of-state university or a foreign national attending a U.S. university with a student visa, Mica claims. Answering whether Mica is right or not is not as simple as saying "Yes" or "No." Let's take it a step at a time. First, 11 states already allow for in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The policies in those states -- California, Texas, New York, Utah, Washington, Oklahoma, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Wisconsin -- won't be affected by the DREAM Act. (The California Supreme Court ruled unanimously last month that illegal immigrant students may pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities). Second, the legislation that passed the House on Dec. 7 does not mention in-state tuition, and no version ever considered would mandate or force states to offer DREAM Act participants in-state rates. That's an opinion shared by Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, and by Steve Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that opposes the DREAM Act. So where's the rub? One version of the bill -- a version that never came to a vote -- sought to repeal a section of a 1996 immigration law that seemingly pertains to the issue at hand. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act included language attempting to prevent state universities from giving benefits to in-state illegal immigrants that they didn't offer to out-of-state U.S. citizens. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said there is disagreement about the meaning of the provision, whether it applies to tuition and whether Congress exceeded its powers in crafting the language. Also, states have effectively ignored the rule, or at least have agreed to interpret it differently. The repeal of the 1996 language is not included in the version of the DREAM Act that passed the House. More importantly, and more germane to this fact check, however, is debate over the impact of enacting the DREAM Act. While granting DREAM Act participants in-state tuition is not part of the federal legislation, it may happen as a result of the legislation, Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies argues. The scenario, he said, is clear. An illegal immigrant in Florida, say, applies for and is granted a conditional nonimmigrant status for five years. That person then is a legal resident of Florida. If so, why would he or she not be able to receive in-state tuition, Camarota asks. And if somehow denied in-state tuition, wouldn't the applicant have a valid legal challenge? "The law isn't intended per se to do it, but it can't help but happen," he says. Others argue that universities could simply ask prospective students if they are DREAM Act participants to separate the two sets of state residents. "The House-passed legislation is silent on in-state tuition, leaving in place existing rules and approaches undertaken by different states with respect to allowing in-state tuition for unauthorized students," Mittelstadt said. Our rating Appearing on MSNBC, Mica said that passing the DREAM Act would mean "granting lower tuition to illegals." But we think he's really stretching to get there. The version of the DREAM Act that passed in the House -- as well as prior versions that were debated -- did not include language requiring states to offer DREAM Act participants in-state tuition. The closest a version of the DREAM Act came was to propose repealing a federal rule that some have interpreted as preventing states from offering in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. But that version never came to a vote. Moreover, 11 states already offer in-state tuition, so rates in those places -- including California and Texas -- couldn't go lower. As for the other states, the only real argument is that passing the DREAM Act could have the consequence of forcing them to offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrants as well. And we guess it could. But there's no definitive evidence that it would, just conjecture and speculation. And it certainly isn't expressed in the bill language. So we rate this claim False.

pomt-04423	Says "when I voted against [an increase in the minimum wage], it was in the 80s."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/15/joseph-kyrillos/joe-kyrillos-said-when-he-voted-against-minimum-wa/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos said he thinks the state’s lowest-paid workers deserve a raise. But incumbent U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, accused Kyrillos of reversing course on that position. The two will face off in the Nov. 6 election. "Listen, you had the opportunity, you know, you just can't flip back and forth. You've become the biggest flip flopper. Now it's that you want to vote for the minimum wage increase but you voted against it when you had the opportunity. Why'd you vote against it?" Menendez said during a heated debate on New Jersey 101.5-FM on Wednesday night. "I already said. You look at -- I think when I voted against it, it was in the 80s. It was a long time. You were in the Assembly then," Kyrillos said, adding that "you look at things in the context of their times. You look at the legislation as it’s proposed." Let’s refresh Kyrillos’ memory here, because PolitiFact New Jersey didn’t have to go back to the 1980s to find a time when he voted against increasing the minimum wage. Kyrillos, a state senator from Monmouth County, voted against a 2005 proposal that boosted the minimum wage in two steps, eventually increasing it to $7.15 per hour in 2006. That rate didn’t change until 2009, when the federal minimum wage jumped to $7.25 per hour. When federal and state minimum wages conflict, the higher one applies, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. When we pointed out the 2005 vote to Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin she said Kyrillos "has supported increasing the minimum wage" and cited another 2005 bill that he sponsored. Two weeks after Kyrillos voted against the proposal that became law he introduced legislation that increased the minimum wage more, but at a slower pace. Under his bill, the minimum wage would increase in four stages, reaching $7.25 per hour on Aug. 1, 2008. That bill was referred to committee but never came to a vote. Still, Kyrillos is wrong to claim his vote against the minimum wage happened more than two decades ago, because he voted against it again less than 10 years ago. In fact, Kyrillos wasn’t even in office for much of the 1980s. He joined the Assembly in 1988 before winning a seat in the state Senate, where he has served since 1992. Then-assemblyman Kyrillos voted against a 1990 bill that hiked the minimum wage -- then set at $3.35 per hour -- in three phases, ultimately increasing it to an hourly rate of $5.05 in 1992. Menendez, who also served in the assembly at the time, voted in favor of the bill, according to assembly minutes. The assembly later voted again on the same measure after the senate amended the bill. On that second vote, Menendez again voted yes, while Kyrillos is not listed in the minutes as voting. By 1992 both Kyrillos and Menendez had joined the state senate. That year a bill was introduced to delay half of the final increase in the minimum wage hike approved two years earlier. Kyrillos voted in favor of that legislation, while Menendez opposed it. The governor vetoed the bill. Our ruling Kyrillos said, "when I voted against [an increase in the minimum wage], it was in the 80s." Actually the state senator and Republican U.S. Senate hopeful voted against a bill in 2005 that eventually increased the minimum wage to $7.15 per hour. We rate this statement False.

pomt-00401	Says Minnesota is "imprisoning half as many people as Wisconsin, and yet our states have virtually identical crime rates."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/05/mike-mccabe/mike-mccabe-says-minnesota-imprisoning-half-many-p/	As this year’s governor race takes off, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made crime and state prisons a hot topic. In an Aug. 7, 2018 tweet -- a week ahead of the primary election -- Walker claimed Democrats in the race wanted to cut the state prison population in half, which would "require the release of thousands of violent felons." We rated the claim Half True. The main problem: While a short time frame might require that, a longer time frame — and reducing incoming inmates as well as releasing some others — would not. What’s more, not every one of the Democrats made the 50 percent reduction a promise. (Tony Evers, Walker’s opponent in November, has said cutting the inmate population by half is "a goal that’s worth accomplishing.") As we cleaned out our files after the Aug. 14 primary, we came across an interesting claim we didn’t get to that remains relevant. It was from Mike McCabe, who was at the time running in a wide field of Democrats vying to replace Walker. He’s a former executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign and founder of the the activist group Blue Jean Nation. In a July 6, 2018 interview on Wisconsin Public Television’s "Here & Now," McCabe stated that Minnesota is "imprisoning half as many people as Wisconsin, and yet our states have virtually identical crime rates." Is he right? Prison populations When asked to provide backup for his claim, McCabe pointed to 2016 U.S. Department of Justice data compiled into a map by The Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy center that aims to reduce incarceration nationwide. According to the data, 22,144 people were imprisoned in the state of Wisconsin, while 10,592 were imprisoned in Minnesota. That puts Minnesota’s prison population at 47.8 percent of Wisconsin’s -- not quite at half, as McCabe said. Since the states differ in size, the prison rate provides a better perspective. According to the justice department’s 2015 data, Minnesota has one of the lowest rates in the country -- 196 prisoners per 100,000 people. Wisconsin’s rate is 377 prisoners per 100,000, or nearly twice that of Minnesota. Crime rates As for the state crime rates, McCabe pointed to FBI statistics from 2016 that showed Minnesota with a rate 2,376 crimes per 100,000 residents. That is slightly higher than Wisconsin’s crime rate, which was 2,239 crimes per 100,000 residents. But it’s not quite that simple. According to Michael Tonry, director of the Institute on Crime and Public Policy at the University of Minnesota, prison rate comparisons are more reliable than crime rate comparisons. That’s because prison data is all kept by the state. Crime data, in contrast, is kept and reported by local police departments, then transmitted to the state and sent to the FBI. And, though the FBI provides definitions on how to classify various crimes, in practice it can vary widely among local law enforcement agencies. Still, Tonry said if crime rates are within 20 to 25 percent, they are "for all practical purposes, the same." This would also support McCabe’s claim. Probation All of that said, there is something else to consider: In making the comparison, is McCabe missing the bigger picture? For instance, Minnesota ranks in the top five states for people on probation. As of 2015, Minnesota had a rate of 2,328 per 100,000 people, versus Wisconsin’s 1,028 per 100,000. So, more than double Wisconsin by that measure. In fact, if one examines all forms of correctional supervision -- which includes those in prison, jail, probation and supervised release -- it provides some more insight into what is really going on between the two states. Minnesota had 2,210 per 100,000 residents in some form of correctional control, according to 2015 U.S. Bureau of Justice statistics. That placed it in a tie for 14th place with Alabama. Meanwhile, Wisconsin was somewhat lower -- 1,740 per 100,000 residents, tied for 25th place with Missouri and Maryland. Policy differences Whether it is more effective to put more criminals in prison or to put them on probation is a near constant debate between Republicans and Democrats. The reason Minnesota imprisons fewer people, according to Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is because Minnesota saw in the 1970s how its prison population was projected to increase. The state established a bipartisan sentencing guidelines commission to prioritize how to use the existing prison beds. While the state did eventually have to build more beds when crime spiked in the 1980s and 90s, Streit said it was at a "far lower rate" than in Wisconsin. In addition, Streit said Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines, which are mandatory, offer "very, very limited" instances where sentences can be consecutive. In Wisconsin, sentencing guidelines are advisory, Streit said, so consecutive sentences are more common. Streit said he believes, to that degree, McCabe has "identified a major difference" between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Our rating McCabe stated that Minnesota is "imprisoning half as many people as Wisconsin, and yet our states have virtually identical crime rates." Minnesota and Wisconsin have nearly identical crime rates, and Minnesota does indeed imprison about half the amount of people as Wisconsin. McCabe’s claim, though, misses some important information: That is, Minnesota has a higher overall "correctional control rate," which provides more insight into how the states really compare. We rate McCabe’s claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Mike McCabe	None	None	None	2018-09-05T06:00:00	2018-07-06	['Wisconsin', 'Minnesota']
pomt-14224	"You’re in more trouble if you leave your pet in the car than if you leave your child in the car."	/rhode-island/statements/2016/apr/17/john-pagliarini/do-we-value-our-pets-more-our-children/	There are two unattended vehicles in a Rhode Island parking lot on a hot summer day. One has a child inside, and the other, an animal. Police are called. In the case of the pet, police or animal control can take "all steps that are reasonably necessary to remove an animal from a motor vehicle" if the animal is at risk. They are to leave a note for the motorist and bring the pet to an animal hospital for observation. The motorist must pay all costs associated with the rescue, and can face up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $1,000 or both, according to the state’s "Animal confinement in motor vehicles prohibited" law. In the case of a child, police can "provide a verbal warning" to the parent or caregiver about risks and dangers associated with leaving a kid in a car. No fines or sanctions can be imposed, according to the state’s "Child passenger protection" statute. Wait, what? Sen. John Pagliarini highlighted this discrepancy in a senate hearing in March. This seemed outrageous, so we called and asked him to explain. He told us if you look at the law for leaving a pet unattended in a car (§ 4-1-3.2) and compare it to the law for leaving a child unattended in a car (§ 31-22-22.1), the penalties for people who leave pets behind are more severe. "It looks as though you’re in more trouble if you leave your pet in the car than if you leave your child in the car," Pagliarini said in an interview with The Journal. "One would think we value our pets more than our children." Pagliarini said he wasn’t sure if existing child neglect laws would apply in this case, but he encouraged a further look. "I hope I’m wrong," Pagliarini said. Well, we’re going to find out. Looking only at the two laws outlined above, it seems Pagliarini is correct. For example, the pet law explicitly authorizes police to break into a car with a pet inside. For a child, there is no such language. We asked Sgt. Michael Wheeler in the Providence Police Department’s Youth Service Bureau what happens in practice. "If there's a child in the car and I need to break into the car, I’m breaking into the car," he said. "We deal with everything else later on." Wheeler told us that in cases like this, Providence police are to get the child out of the car first. Then they take the child to Hasbro Children’s Hospital for assessment and contact the Department of Children, Youth and Families. Providence’s police chief, Col. Hugh Clements, who serves as the president of the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association, said the same thing. Police would immediately contact EMTs and get the child help. They take the child to Hasbro even if the parent, or driver, shows up during this whole process. At the hospital DCYF caseworkers, along with the hospital staff, can assess whether the child is in imminent danger or needs to be held further, Wheeler said. Under § 40-11-5 police, social workers or doctors are allowed to take a child into custody for 72 hours without parental consent if the child has any injuries caused by "other than accidental means." Leaving your child in a hot car on a 99-degree day might fall into that category, Wheeler said. Kerri White, a public information officer for DCYF, said her department might open a Child Protective Services investigation after a report like this. If investigators find the child is in danger, DCYF is to place the child on a protective hold (explained earlier) and seek a child protective order from the Family Court and remove him or her from the home. Amy Kempe, a spokeswoman in the attorney general’s office, said authorities can use existing child abuse and child neglect statutes (like § 11-9-5) to bring criminal charges against parents or caregivers depending on "the facts and circumstances of a specific incident." "Please note, cruelty to or neglect of a child is a felony with a maximum penalty of three years, $1,000, or both," said Kempe in an emailed statement. Kempe pointed to the state’s "Brendan's Law," which protects kids from serious bodily injury — meaning things like creating a substantial threat of death, broken bones, impairment of organs, etc. — or any physical injury — which the law defines as an injury "which arises other than from the imposition of non excessive corporal punishment." With these standards, a parent or caregiver could face charges of first-degree child abuse, which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in jail and a fine of up to $10,000. Or they could be charged with second-degree child abuse and face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. Enter Sen. Lou Raptakis and his amendment to the "child passenger protection" law, which was introduced in the Senate on Jan.13. His problem with the way the current law stands is that Brendan’s Law and the other statutes Kempe mentions only apply if the child is injured, unlike in the animal-husbandry bill, where the motorist is culpable no matter what. "It’s kind of absurd that a child doesn’t have the same protection as an animal does," Raptakis said. In his amendment, which he hopes will be up for vote later this month, a parent or caregiver would face the similar penalties as in the animal bill if they leave a child under 7 unattended in a car for more than 5 minutes. Our ruling Sen. Pagliarini says "You’re in more trouble if you leave your pet in the car than if you leave your child in the car." We looked at the laws, and at face value, he’s right. But, through the power of the DCYF, police, hospital staff and child neglect statutes like Brendan’s Law, parents or caregivers can get in a heap of trouble if they leave a child in these circumstances. Because the statement leaves out important details about actual practice, we rate it: Half True.	None	John Pagliarini	None	None	None	2016-04-17T00:00:00	2016-04-11	['None']

Cicilline, in the WPRI-TV/Providence Journal debate, urged a swift return of U.S. troops from Afghanistan as one suggestion, noting that "We will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year, fixing roads, building bridges, training police officers, and more [and] cutting the same things in our own country." His message was clear: it is time for the United States to start redirecting that money toward improving America’s own crumbling infrastructure -- a theme Cicilline has been sounding for months. But we wondered if the United States was really spending $100 billion a year for Afghan infrastructure and other non-military aid. We called Cicilline campaign for its supporting evidence and while we waited for a response, did some research. PolitiFact National examined the subject of non-military aid to Afghanistan in May 2012 when it looked at whether President Obama had kept a campaign promise to increase that aid by another $1 billion to $3 billion. (PolitiFact rated it Promise Kept.) One source of information PolitiFact National cited was a May 2012 Congressional Research Service report,which found that during fiscal years 2001 through 2011-- a span of a decade -- "the Afghan intervention has cost about $443 billion, including all costs." For fiscal year 2012, which ends Sept. 30, the report says, the United States was expected to spend "about $90 billion" for military operations and another "$16 billion in aid," including training and equipment. That’s far different from $100 billion going to just to infrastructure and non-military projects in one year, as Cicilline seemed to be implying. According to a July quarterly report of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which keeps a running tab of the war’s costs for Congress, "the President’s FY 2013 budget request includes nearly $9.7 billion to strengthen the Afghan security forces during this critical transition period and to fund programs to build governing capacity, promote economic development, and counter the drug trade." The special inspector general’s report also includes a graphicwhich shows that between 2002 and March of 2012, "the United States had appropriated approximately $89.48 billion for relief and reconstruction in Afghanistan." The money had been allocated into five major areas: $52.15 billion for security $22.34 billion for governance and development $6 billion for counter narcotics efforts $2.37 billion for humanitarian aid $6.62 billion for oversight and operations In an e-mail, Michael O’Hanlon, director of research and a senior fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said the U.S. would spend "more than $100 billion" in Afghanistan this year "but it’s primarily for our own military forces and their military operations." Of that $100 billion about $15 billion "can be viewed as directly supporting the Afghan economy and Afghan institutions and infrastructure," O’Hanlon said. Ultimately the Cicilline camp responded. In an e-mail, spokeswoman Nicole Kayner told us the congressman’s quote was accurate because of two barely audible words that viewers likely missed last week and the four judges here at PolitiFact had to have replayed a half dozen times to actually pick up: "and more." Cicilline, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and should be able to articulate well the difference between military and non-military aid, said the United States "will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year fixing roads, building bridges, training police officers AND MORE [and] cutting the same things in our own country." Kayner said that statement is "factually accurate" because "Our country is spending over a 100 billion dollars a year on roads, bridges, training police officers AND MORE in Afghanistan." Our ruling The stress of debates can prompt a candidate to misspeak and mumble at times, especially when it becomes a slugfest of accusations like last week’s first televised Cicilline-Gemma get-together. But we believe anyone who watched the debate last week would have had the impression that Cicilline wasn’t talking about the cost of tanks and soldiers and running a war when he raised the $100 billion figure. He was talking specifically about redirecting money now spent on Afghanistan’s infrastructure and using it on things we’re cutting "in our own country" -- our own crumbling roads and bridges. But we are spending about $15 billion this year for that kind of non-military aid, not $100 billion.

pomt-03786	Says she has bipartisan support, including "53 sheriffs throughout the state, Democrats and Republicans."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/29/patience-roggensack/wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-patience-roggensac/	Conventional wisdom holds that there is a 4-3 conservative majority among the seven justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. That would indicate the balance of power is at stake in the April 2, 2013, election. Justice Patience Roggensack, who is seeking a second 10-year term, is considered to be one of the conservatives on the high court. She faces Marquette University law professor Edward Fallone, who is supported by labor unions and Democratic elected officials. The race is officially nonpartisan. Roggensack has resisted the conservative label and contends her support comes from both sides of the political aisle. In particular, she has emphasized her endorsements from Wisconsin sheriffs. In a candidates forum on March 26, 2013, in Madison, Roggensack said: "I run nonpartisan. But (in) this race, I have tried very hard to have bipartisan support. I'm supported by 53 sheriffs throughout the state, Democrats and Republicans; district attorneys throughout the state, again, Democrats and Republicans. I have strong law enforcement support. The Wisconsin Professional Police Association has just endorsed me; again, Democrats and Republicans." Roggensack made a similar statement several days earlier in an interview and has issued several news releases touting the endorsement from sheriffs. Given Roggensack’s reputation as a conservative, one would expect she has strong support from Republican sheriffs. But for her claim of bipartisan backing to be true, she’d also need to show significant support from Democratic sheriffs. Let’s see what there is. Roggensack lists the 53 sheriffs who have endorsed her on her campaign website. We ran our own check of the list, given that it doesn’t include party affiliations. We also consulted the 2011-2012 Wisconsin Blue Book. We did tallies in two ways: -- Of the 53 sheriffs listed as having endorsed Roggensack, 42 are Republican and 11 are Democrats. That’s a 79 percent to 21 percent Republican-Democrat split. The Republican sheriffs include Dan Trawicki of Waukesha County, Maury Straub of Ozaukee County and Dale Schmidt of Washington County. The Democratic sheriffs include David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, Sam Wollin of Adams County and David Kaminski of Rusk County, who is president of the Badger State Sheriffs’ Association. -- The 11 Democrats backing Roggensack make up 42 percent of the 26 sheriffs statewide who are Democrats, according to the Blue Book. Clarke is a conservative and frequent critic of policies favored by Democrats, but runs as a Democrat in a county that leans heavily in that direction. Fallone, meanwhile, lists two sheriffs among the officials who have endorsed him: Dave Mahoney of Dane County and Bob Spoden of Rock County. Both are Democrats. Our rating Roggensack said she has bipartisan support, including "53 sheriffs throughout the state, Democrats and Republicans." As expected, Roggensack has plenty of support from GOP sheriffs, but she has significant backing from Democratic sheriffs, as well. A little more than one-fifth of the sheriffs backing her are Democrats and those Democrats make up more than 40 percent of all the Democratic sheriffs in the state. We rate Roggensack’s statement True.	None	Patience Roggensack	None	None	None	2013-03-29T09:00:00	2013-03-26	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-02736	"Every dollar spent in the new Obamacare system ... goes to private-sector insurance companies."	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/18/chris-matthews/matthews-every-dollar-obamacare-goes-private-insur/	Like most MSNBC hosts, Chris Matthews has been using his show Hardball recently to both defend the health care law and criticize Republicans who attack it. On Dec. 16, 2013, Matthews played a video clip of former Pennsylvania senator and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum speaking at a young Republicans event. In the video Santorum refers to the health care law as "free health care" and says it would deny care to anyone who needed it. "It’s a pretty clever system," he said. "Take care of the people who can vote. The people who can’t vote, get rid of them as quickly as possible by not giving them care, (they die) so they can’t vote against you." Santorum also compared the Affordable Care Act to the United Kingdom's government-owned health care system. Matthews, in response, was keen to note that’s completely unlike what exists in America. "Every dollar spent in the new Obamacare system -- if you want to call it Obamacare -- goes to insurance companies," Matthews said. "All the money goes to private-sector insurance companies that already exist." We decided to check Matthews' retort that "Every dollar spent in the new Obamacare system ... goes to private-sector insurance companies." We reached out to MSNBC but did not hear back. The part of the Affordable Care Act that matches Matthews’ description is the insurance marketplaces run by the federal government and by individual states. These are the places where private insurance companies can sell their plans. People of any income can purchase insurance through one of these marketplaces and if they don’t make too much, they are eligible for subsidies to make their premiums more affordable. But what Matthews overlooked is the very large role that expanded Medicaid plays in Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act allows states to open that health care program to people making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. So far, only 25 states and the District of Columbia have agreed to do that. But in terms of the number of dollars and people, this side of the Affordable Care Act is roughly equal to the insurance marketplaces Matthews described. A few numbers The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers for Congress, projected that in 2014, the subsidies provided through the marketplaces would cost the government about $26 billion. The matching figure for Medicaid expansion? $21 billion. Looking at how many people will gain coverage in 2014, the budget office expects 6 million people will take advantage of subsidized policies through the marketplaces. The expansion of Medicaid, including the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, would add 9 million people, CBO says. (The Medicaid numbers are likely to be lower since states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion.) Health economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California-San Diego told PunditFact that looking forward, Medicaid expansion accounts for about 39 percent of the cost in the Affordable Care Act to get more people covered. Clemens and Thomas Getzen, professor at Temple University’s Fox School of Business and Management and executive director of the International Association of Health Economics, both said that regardless of who gets paid first, money in Obamacare continues to move through the health care industry. Some of it ends up with insurance companies, some of it ends up with doctors and other providers. Medicaid is a government-run program that pays doctors and hospitals for their services. So, those dollars also go back to the private sector, but they don’t pass through the hands of private insurance companies first. Our ruling Mathews said every dollar in the "new Obamacare system" goes to insurance companies. The use of "every" gets Matthews in trouble here. About half of the Affordable Care Act flows through marketplaces where private insurance companies sell policies. But the other half runs through the government’s Medicaid program. That expansion costs about the same as the subsidies offered through the marketplaces and at least in the near term, touches even more people. Matthews was drawing a contrast with government-owned health care systems and focused on the part of the Affordable Care Act that has dominated the news. But when he said "every dollar," he went too far. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Chris Matthews	None	None	None	2013-12-18T14:58:22	2013-12-16	['None']
pomt-13667	Russia and China are "doing naval exercises together someplace."	/ohio/statements/2016/aug/04/donald-trump/trump-china-and-russia-doing-naval-exercises-toget/	At a rally in Columbus, Ohio, Donald Trump again made the case for improved relations with Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Wouldn’t it be great if the United States and Russia got along, combined, knocked out ISIS, maybe did other positive things?" Trump said Aug. 1, 2016. "We forced them through stupidity into an alliance with China, you know why? Because China needs oil. We were driving them both crazy, they formed -- and from the time I was a young guy I always learned, don’t ever let China and Russia get together," Trump said. "We forced them together, Obama forced them together ... because you didn’t get along with either and then eventually China came in and said, ‘Let’s make a deal on oil.’ They’re together. In fact they’re doing naval exercises together someplace." For this fact-check, we’re evaluating Trump’s claim that Russia and China are "doing naval exercises together," and that Obama "forced them together." As neighbors, China and Russia have a complicated relationship. Relations were certainly cold while Russia was part of the Soviet Union, and a small skirmish broke out between the two war powers in 1969. The relationship improved dramatically when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Their symbiosis since the early 1990s has been largely weapons-related -- with China buying advanced Russian weaponry. The calculation changed in 2014, when Russia seized control of Crimea in Ukraine. The action led to crippling sanctions organized by the United States, European Union and Canada that led a buckling of the Russian economy and a need for Russia to advance its relationship with China. Joint naval exercises following the sanctions have "a new level of seriousness," according to Lyle J. Goldstein, associate professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I.. A 2014 exercise in the East China Sea choreographed two submarines and 14 surface ships. A year later in the Black Sea, nine ships practiced anti-submarine warfare. "Russia is trying to prove to the United States, and to the EU as well, that they have other options, that they can go to their other friend and make serious deals," said Laicie Heeley, an expert from the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank. This includes deals on oil, as Trump said. Russia shipped 4.65 million tons of oil to China last March, and such exports have more than doubled over the last five years. This, too, has to do with the sanctions that have limited Russia’s exporting options. "Unfortunately for Russia, the partnership is much more political than economic," Heeley said. "China still represents a rather small portion of their exports, and they haven’t really been able to make the big deals or encourage the private investments that would really help their economy. They haven’t been able to come to the kind of partnership that, rhetorically, they’d like to be able to say they have." In July, a tribunal in the Hague issued a rebuke of China, siding with the Philippines in the country’s dispute over territory in the South China Sea. China is salty over the ruling, and diplomatic leaders anticipated some response. But China’s naval drills with Russia are nothing more than fist-shaking, said Heeley. "China is trying to demonstrate that they are a responsible country, and they’re not just going and conducting military drills with Russia to make everyone angry," Heeley said. "This is a measured and careful response by the country. They could be doing something much more to truly anger the international community, but instead they’re not." Our ruling Trump was correct in his claim that Russia and China are "doing naval exercises together someplace." He was right, too, that the countries have increased their oil trading, though not because "China needs oil," as Trump said. It’s more because Russia needs another oil buyer, due to limitations from sanctions. Finally, Obama did not single-handedly force Russia and China together. Both the sanctions against Russia and the tribunal’s decision against China are the result of multinational diplomatic efforts.

pomt-03528	The Obama administration has put out "more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times."	/ohio/statements/2013/may/31/rob-portman/us-sen-rob-portman-says-obama-administration-has-p/	Because we deal with lots of loose rhetoric at PolitiFact Ohio, we’re attracted like a magnet to any claim that tries to actually quantify a political or ideological point. Ohio U.S. Sen. Rob Portman delivered such a tidbit during a conference call with Ohio reporters on May 23. Portman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama’s administration has put out "more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times." We won’t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety, healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these "major" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data. If all regulations were counted, Obama’s record would be nowhere near Portman’s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton’s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September. In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False. But Portman said "major" rules." "Major" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them "economically significant" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to "major" that there is no need to split hairs here. We looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data. One was provided by Portman’s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government. Portman’s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama’s tenure with the first three of Clinton’s and George W. Bush’s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president’s term. Portman’s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president. It found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton. A similar analysis by George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman’s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama’s first term. This made no substantive difference in terms of Portman’s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush’s second term. Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton’s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama’s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush’s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton’s. In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the "major" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton’s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama’s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obama’s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term. This doesn’t change the facts or statistics as stated by Portman: The Obama administration has put out "more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times." We rate his claim True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2013-05-31T06:00:00	2013-05-23	['Bill_Clinton', 'George_W._Bush', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-10579	Hillary Clinton "agrees with (John McCain) in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/01/barack-obama/clinton-endorses-diplomacy/	Barack Obama made his most direct case for the Democratic nomination at a speech on Jan. 30, 2008, in Denver. He criticized fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, arguing that he represents a more dramatic distinction with John McCain, the apparent Republican front-runner after winning Florida's primary. In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues, among other things. Among Obama's points: "It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who ... agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like." On this point, Obama seems to be drawing on a difference that arose between him and Clinton in a July 2007 debate hosted by CNN and YouTube. A YouTube questioner asked if the candidates would be "willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries." Obama said he would; Clinton said she wouldn't. Clinton explained her reasoning: "I will promise a very vigorous diplomatic effort because I think it is not that you promise a meeting at that high a level before you know what the intentions are. I don't want to be used for propaganda purposes. I don't want to make a situation even worse. But I certainly agree that we need to get back to diplomacy, which has been turned into a bad word by this administration." John McCain's public comments seem to reflect an openness to diplomacy while also putting restrictions on face-to-face meetings. "The most overrated aspect of our dialogue about international relations is direct face-to-face talks," he said in December 2007. "BlackBerrys work. Emissaries work. There's many thousands of ways to communicate. The question is, are you going to have direct talks, and does that enhance the prestige of the president of Iran?" It's not unreasonable to say that Clinton and McCain share a skepticism about having the president conduct face-to-face diplomatic meetings directly. But Obama strays badly in taking that shared view and equating it with what he calls "the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like." Clinton, who was asked about it directly, clearly says she would approach diplomacy differently than the Bush administration has. We find Obama's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08261	Says he's arrested more criminals, "including thousands of child predators and sex offenders," than any previous Texas attorney general.	/texas/statements/2010/nov/11/greg-abbott/texas-ag-greg-abbott-says-hes-arrested-more-crimin/	On his way to winning a third term as the state's attorney general, Republican Greg Abbott hit the airwaves with a TV ad that made him sound like a round-'em-up sheriff. "He’s arrested more criminals than any Texas attorney general, including thousands of child predators and sex offenders," the narrator says. This claim wrested the attention of reader Joyce Lynch, who suggested that we look into whether Abbott has been 'cuffing suspects while working as the state's top lawyer. First, we asked Jason Johnson, Abbott's campaign consultant for back-up evidence. He pointed to the office's criminal investigations division, "staffed by commissioned peace officers and crime analysts who undertake a wide range of investigations and activities to support detection, prevention, and prosecution of crime," according to the attorney general's website. In a document e-mailed to us, Johnson focused on two division units that Abbott created in 2003: * The Cyber Crimes Unit, which "arrests child predators who commit sex crimes against children using technology and the Internet," according to the attorney general's website. That includes people who contact youths online and try to set up a time, date and location to have sex with them. In some cases, undercover officers identify suspects by posing as children in chat rooms and on websites. The unit also makes child pornography arrests. * The Fugitive Unit, which seeks out and arrests people with histories of sex crimes who have violated their parole or sex offender registration requirements, the site says. According to an overview provided by Abbott's office, the unit has also arrested other kinds of fugitives, including "Louisiana criminals with outstanding warrants who fled to Texas during Hurricane Katrina," as well as gang members and other offenders rounded up under Falcon II, an initiative led by the U.S. Marshals Service that targeted sexual predators and violent offenders. The units work in conjunction with other law enforcement agencies, including local police and the FBI, according to the attorney general's website and news releases. However, Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the office, told us that the peace officers employed by the attorney general's office consistently make arrests on their own. Strickland also said that although Abbott is not a certified peace officer and cannot make arrests, he has been present during some apprehensions by his officers. According to information from Strickland, the cyber-crimes and fugitive units arrested 2,052 child predators and sex offenders from the teams' creation in 2003 through mid-October, when Abbott's TV ad began running. Of those arrests: * 1,806 were by the fugitive unit; the majority were arrests of sex offenders who had violated their parole or failed to register. * 246 were by the cyber-crimes unit and were related to child pornography or online solicitation of a child. Of those, 221 have led to convictions. Next, we wondered how Abbott's arrest record stacks up against those of his predecessors. Although Johnson didn't have data showing the number of arrests by the attorney general's office over the years, he said he was confident that the ad — claiming that Abbott has arrested more criminals than any Texas attorney general — was correct because of the surge in criminal division officers on Abbott's watch. Background: The 1991 Legislature gave the attorney general's office permission to employ up to five peace officers. Bill analyses from that time say that the office needed the extra staff to assist local prosecutors in investigations. In 1999, lawmakers removed the hiring limit, partly because of an expansion of the Medicaid fraud program within the attorney general's office. According to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education, which tracks the number of peace officers in the state, the number of officers appointed by the attorney general's office rose each year between 1999 and 2010, from five to more than 150. (The growing number of peace officers of all kinds has been a trend statewide. According to a 2009 Statesman story, there are three dozen types of agencies, institutions, boards, commissions and political subdivisions that can appoint their own law enforcement agents.) According to information from Johnson, in fiscal 2002, just before Abbott became attorney general, 36 peace officers were working for the attorney general's office and made 99 arrests. That compares to fiscal 2010, when the agency employed 141 officers (as of Sept. 9) and arrested 795 people. Summing up: Abbott's campaign ad stated that he had made "thousands" of arrests. Abbott hasn't personally arrested anyone, but he has put into place criminal investigation units that had taken into custody more than 2,000 "child predators and sex offenders" through mid-October. Legislative actions during the past 20 years lend credence to the claim that the arrests outnumber those of his predecessors, though his campaign didn't have data to prove it. By the same token, most earlier attorneys general didn't have the same manpower or authority to make arrests. We rate Abbott's statement Mostly True.

pomt-14288	"Most funding for tuberculosis research (is) provided by the U.S. National Institutes for Health."	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/05/marcus-low/us-dominates-global-tb-research-spending-one-key-w/	Tuberculosis stands second to AIDS as the world’s deadliest infectious disease, killing about 1.5 million people in 2014. Only a small percentage of those deaths took place in the United States, yet the American government is the pre-eminent funder of tuberculosis research. HIV/AIDS activist Marcus Low, policy head for the South African-based Treatment Action Campaign, drove home that point when a United Nations taskforce met in Johannesburg. Low’s group urged the panel to recommend a global research and development treaty that would have governments commit money to tuberculosis -- an infection most often in the lungs -- and other disease research. By the World Health Organization’s estimate, research spending worldwide falls about $1 billion short each year. South Africa’s Business Day cited Low on March 19, 2016, as saying, "Most funding for tuberculosis research was provided by the U.S. National Institutes for Health." We asked Low if the paper had quoted him accurately. He offered a clarification. "A better formulation of that line would have been, ‘the top contributor to TB research and development, according to a report published by Treatment Action Group, is the NIH’," Low told us. We’re not sure if that means the reporter got it wrong, or Low misspoke. Whichever it is, Low went on to tell us that the line in the news article is unclear. "If most is read as more than any other, then it is correct," Low said. "If most is read as more than 50 percent, then it is not correct." Let us make things crystal clear about the American research effort. The NIH is the single-largest source of TB research money. The best overview of global tuberculosis research comes from the Treatment Action Group, a New York advocacy organization. The group assembled information from over 100 government, foundation and drug company research efforts. It’s most recent report found that the U.S. National Institutes of Health spent over $200 million on tuberculosis research in 2014. That was more than any other single entity, and represented more than 30 percent of the global investment in TB research and development. A bit over $674 million was spent worldwide. The U.S. total grows to nearly a quarter of a billion dollars when you add in the money from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and assorted other agencies. In raw dollars, the United States government has no match. But the United States is a big country with the world’s largest economy. So we assessed where America stands when you factor in population and Gross Domestic Product. Do that and an unexpected nation earns some bragging rights -- Singapore. While the small Asian nation spends about 3 percent what America does, relative to its size, it comes out on top in both of the relative rankings. The United Kingdom and Switzerland also show up in the top three, depending on the measure. (Methodology note: We adjusted spending by European Union members according to their contributions to the EU. Population data came from the U.S. Census Bureau, and GDP data came from the World Bank.) Why Singapore? Mike Frick, project officer at the Treatment Action Group, said he’s not exactly sure. It might have its roots in the legacy of the multinational drug company Novartis. "Novartis's TB research used to be based in Singapore," Frick said. "That has ended, but suggests there is some institutional capacity for TB research already established there." Certainly, the National University of Singapore is eager to build support there for continued government funding. In a March 24, 2016, webpost, it touted that it is well placed to lead the fight against tuberculosis. "Singapore is located at the heart of the TB epidemic, being close to Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, China and India -- countries with the highest number of TB cases in the world," the posting said. A professor at the university’s school of public health wrote in an op-ed about TB research and "the breadth of Singapore's growing research infrastructure and human resources." All of which suggests that at least some Singaporeans see this as a competitive niche that ought be expanded. The drivers behind the spending in the United States are a combination of tradition and political activism tied to AIDS. Audrey Jackson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us the federal government has put money into health research for decades. "The U.S. has been a huge funder of science," Jackson said. "Through the National Institutes of Health, it has funded a great deal of basic science and early work to translate findings into clinical applications." Jackson noted that TB funding at the NIH itself has been flat for the past five years, "even declining if you factor in inflation," but that the latest White House budget calls for an increase. Dick Chaisson, director of the Center for TB Research at Johns Hopkins University, said the AIDS epidemic played a key role in reigniting the tuberculosis research effort in America. "Back in the 1970s, it was assumed that TB was a done deal, and all the scientific discoveries that were needed had been made, so science moved on to other issues." Chaisson said. "It turns out that the discoveries of the past were not good enough to result in TB elimination, and the advent of HIV and the emergence of drug-resistant TB made things even worse." Around 1990, New York City became ground-zero for the resurgence of tuberculosis. The New England Journal of Medicine reported that "with 3 percent of the country's population, New York City accounted for a remarkable 61 percent of cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the United States." Frick said that because the disease hit New York, and in particular, people with AIDS, there was ample political lobbying power to draw in the federal government. By 1992, Congress had made an emergency appropriation of $100 million to combat TB. Of that, $40 million went to New York City. "That was a time when an institutional will to engage with TB research came together," Frick said. "A lot of young doctors spent their formative years in that effort and now are making decisions." A ready example supports Frick’s generational point. In 1992, New York City used part of its $40 million to create the Bureau of Tuberculosis Control. The man it picked as founding director was a young CDC doctor named Tom Frieden. Today, Frieden leads the CDC where he makes the case for more federal funding for disease control and oversees the more than $14 million it spends on TB research. Our ruling Low said that most funding for tuberculosis research comes from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Whether he used those exact words is a bit unclear, but in the sense that the NIH is the single-largest funder of research, the statement is correct. The only caveat is that when we factor in the size of the economy, the United States as a whole falls to third and Singapore rises to the top. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-10283	Barack Obama "openly supported (opposition leader) Raila Odinga during his visit to Africa in 2006."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/20/jerome-corsi/obama-did-not-take-sides-in-kenya/	A new book — The Obama Nation by Jerome R. Corsi — attacks Barack Obama as a political extremist. Taken as a whole, the book's primary argument is that Obama is a likely communist sympathizer with ties to Islam who has skillfully hidden his true agenda as he ruthlessly pursues elected office. We found factual problems with Corsi's book and question its overall tone; read our extended story here. Corsi's description of Obama's role in Kenyan politics is filled with errors and innuendo. Corsi focuses on a 2006 trip Obama made to Africa as a U.S. senator. The visit included stops in South Africa, Kenya and Chad. Obama's trip came about a year before elections were scheduled in Kenya. On one side was incumbent President Mwai Kibaki; one of his main challengers was Raila Odinga. Corsi alleges in his book that Obama openly supported Odinga, because Obama wanted to avenge his father's tribe, the Luo, against rival tribes. Corsi also suggests that Odinga is a socialist and was part of an alliance with Muslims to expel Christians in Kenya. There are a number of problems here. First, we reported previously that Odinga is not a socialist . The alliance Corsi describes between Muslims and socialists seems conjecture at best. Corsi himself says his case hinges on a secret memo that he admits may or may not exist. Corsi then states that Odinga "professes to be an Anglican Christian" but adds that "concerns even today continue to circulate among Kenya's Christian leaders ... that Odinga intends to pursue an undeclared radical Islamic political agenda." His argument here is highly speculative. What we can confirm is that Obama has remained neutral in Kenyan politics, and did not support Odinga during his trip. Odinga attended some of Obama's events while Obama was in Kenya, and clearly wanted to associate himself with Obama, but there is no evidence to indicate that Obama "openly supported" Odinga. (We previously reported on a letter from missionaries that alleged Obama contributed to Odinga's campaign; we rated it Pants on Fire! wrong.) For this statement, we decided to scour the public record for evidence that Obama supported Odinga. We looked to contemporary accounts of the 2006 trip and found a transcript from an interview Obama gave to a Kenyan newspaper that directly contradicts Corsi's allegation. Question: "As you prepared to travel to Kenya you were obviously conscious of two things. One was about being drawn into local politics. The other was the high expectations of what you could do for Kenya now that you are a senator. How did you handle both?" Obama: "One of the things we try to do is meet with all parties. I met President Kibaki, I met Uhuru Kenyatta, I was with Raila Odinga. We met the government, met the opposition and met other groups such as human rights activists. What I try to do is give a consistent message on what I think U.S.-Kenya relations should be, but not to suggest somehow that I think one party is better than the other. That's for the Kenyan people to decide." Also, Obama's gave a high-profile speech the need for the country to move beyond corruption and tribal rivalries. This undercuts Corsi's theory that Obama was motivated by his Luo tribal heritage. "Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop," Obama said in his speech at the University of Nairobi on Aug. 28, 2006. "It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good. It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society. Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing. Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor." Corsi states that Obama "openly supported" Raila Odinga. We found public statements from Obama during the trip saying the exact opposite. We found no other evidence to support Corsi's statement, so we rate his statement False.	None	Jerome R.

pomt-03243	Says "President Obama just granted all of Congress an exception" to Obamacare.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/14/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-obama-just-granted-all-congress-/	Sen. Ted Cruz wants Congress to refuse to fund Obamacare. The law’s such a mess, says the Texas Republican, that the president let lawmakers themselves off the hook. "Look, the wheels are coming off this," he told the audience at the conservative Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 10, 2013. "The Teamsters are abandoning it. President Obama just granted all of Congress an exception. And he did it because Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats who passed this thing came begging and said, ‘Please, please, please let us out of Obamacare.’ This thing ain't working." The audience let out a long "Boooo" at the mention of President Barack Obama’s action on behalf of Congress. But did he just grant lawmakers an exception to Obamacare? ‘Congress should get the same coverage’ For many years, Congress chose from a variety of insurance plans offered by the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which serves more than 8 million federal and retired workers and their dependents. That stops in January, when lawmakers and some staff will be required instead to pick from plans on the health care law’s new exchanges — now known as marketplaces. That’s because Congress faces a specific Obamacare provision forcing lawmakers from their current plans into new marketplaces — something that doesn’t apply to other Americans. (Most people with health care through large employers won’t see significant changes under the law. They’re not required to use the marketplaces, which were designed to offer more options for small businesses and the uninsured.) Back in 2009, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley argued that "members of Congress should get the same coverage that we are coming up with for everyone else." He offered an amendment that required lawmakers to get their health care through the marketplaces created by the bill. It was accepted by the Senate Finance Committee without objection. Members of Congress and their staff would have to use the hefty employer contribution they used for federal plans to buy marketplace plans, instead, his amendment said. "My interest in having members of Congress participate in the exchange is consistent with my long-held view that Congress should live under the same laws it passes for the rest of the country," Grassley said. "The more that Congress experiences the laws it passes, the better." A version of the amendment made it into the law passed by Democrats, but it lacked the clarity of Grassley’s language, raising a question: Would the government’s contribution to lawmakers’ health insurance premiums follow them? (In fact, it lacked specifics on lots of issues, such as: When would the provision kick in? Which federal agency would implement it? Which lawmakers and staffers did it cover? Could lawmakers keep their existing coverage as "grandfathered plans"?) Mass confusion ensued — along with fear that the law’s ambiguity meant lawmakers and their staffers would lose an employer contribution worth thousands toward their health care plans. They urged the administration for clarification. On Aug. 7, 2013, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management did clear things up, proposing a rule that lawmakers’ purchase of health coverage from the exchanges — now called marketplaces — would indeed be eligible for an employer contribution. (It answered some of those other questions, too.) When Obamacare’s health care marketplaces launch in January 2014, members of Congress will use them right alongside the uninsured. ‘An exception’ Did the administration's decision constitute an "exception" to Obamacare? Here's what the law said: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law … the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are — (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)." All it did was require lawmakers to use new marketplaces. They're doing that. Beyond that, the wording of the law left lots of questions. Or, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service described it, several "legal and practical issues." To implement it, administrators had to make choices about what it meant. As a New York Times report noted last year, "In writing the legislation, members of Congress apparently assumed that the federal contribution to their premiums would continue, but the law is silent on the question." Grassley himself insisted last year that the provision made "no changes to the employer contribution to federal employee health care coverage." A Congressional Research Service analysis found some room in the law for employer contributions. Timothy Jost, an expert in health care law who supports the Affordable Care Act, told PolitiFact the government clearly acted within its regulatory authority. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which Cruz’s office pointed to, argues the opposite. Heritage, whose lobbying arm Heritage Action has launched a "Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour," says that the administration disregarded the law to give a "special Obamacare deal to Congress." The special deal: letting lawmakers keep the employer contribution toward health plans on new Obamacare marketplaces that Grassley assumed they would keep. Our ruling Cruz, reeling off signs Obamacare’s "wheels are coming off," said the president "just granted all of Congress an exception." That sounds like lawmakers get to opt out of health care under the law. Quite the opposite — they'll use new marketplaces alongside the uninsured and small businesses, just as it required. And it's not even accurate to say they were excepted from some provision of the law: the law itself wasn't clear. Instead, they got a clarification about the law’s effect on contributions toward their health insurance — which they will purchase on Obamacare’s marketplaces. We rate Cruz’s claim False.

pomt-05079	Says he "passed" eight measures, including ones to prevent groping at airport security checks and to bar "sanctuary" cities in Texas.	/texas/statements/2012/jul/03/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-he-passed-eight-notable-measur/	David Dewhurst pitched his U.S. Senate candidacy at the Republican Party of Texas convention by casting himself as an ace lawmaker. "You know some people are all about talk. I'm about results," Dewhurst told delegates June 9, adding a moment later: "Every victory, every conservative victory, I've had, I've had to bleed and fight to accomplish it, ...always adhering to our conservative principles, and refusing to take no for an answer." Dewhurst, who faces Ted Cruz, a lawyer and former Texas solicitor general, in a July 31, 2012, runoff for his party’s nomination, then said: "Over the last several years, I’ve passed defunding Planned Parenthood, the sonogram bill, voter ID. I passed the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) anti-groping bill, sanctuary cities, loser pay, border security, and the toughest Jessica’s law in the entire nation against sexual predators." As the state’s lieutenant governor, Dewhurst presides over the Texas Senate. Was he really 8-for-8 in advancing those measures into law? Most of them made it. Lawmakers in 2011 agreed on measures defunding Planned Parenthood clinics, requiring pregnant women to view a sonogram before receiving an abortion and mandating that voters present photo IDs at the polls. With Gov. Rick Perry’s approval, the 2011 Legislature also passed "loser pays," a measure intended to make it easier for judges to dismiss lawsuits, and agreed to a two-year, $70-million increase in border security funding to the Department of Public Safety, as we noted in checking a Perry campaign promise. Earlier, the 2007 Legislature approved Jessica’s Law; it permitted the death penalty for offenders twice-convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child under 14. However, the death penalty element was struck down by a 2008 Supreme Court ruling against Louisiana’s similar law; the court held that capital punishment for such offenders was cruel and excessive, according to a June 26, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news article. However, high-profile proposals to bar airport security officers from groping passengers and to keep cities from discouraging police officers from checking the immigration status of residents did not make it into law -- and news articles and legislative records indicate that the only way the proposals "passed" on Dewhurst’s watch is that versions cleared the Senate before dying in the House. Let’s recap. State Rep. David Simpson, R-Longview, proposed his anti-groping measure on March 7, 2011, about three months into the year’s regular legislative session, records show. Simpson’s House Bill 1937, which aimed to limit where airport security could touch an individual during pat-down checks by making inappropriate contact a state crime, cleared the House, but died in the Senate after sponsoring Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, withdrew it, according to a May 26, 2011, El Paso Times news article. According to a May 24, 2011, Statesman blog post, the proposal had lost momentum, and much of its support, after John Murphy of San Antonio, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, wrote lawmakers, saying that the legislation would "criminalize searches that are required under federal regulations." According to the blog post, Murphy advised, too, that the federal government would pursue legal action to prevent its enforcement. This, Murphy’s letter said, would likely require the government "to cancel any flight or series of flights for which it could not ensure the safety of the passengers and crew," the Statesman reported. Perry brought the topic back to life by adding it, on June 20, 2011, to the agenda of a summer special legislative session. A week later, two days before the session’s end, the Senate passed its bill, Senate Bill 29, according to a June 27, 2011, Statesman news article. On the session’s final day, House advocates fell short of the votes needed to send the measure to Perry, according to a June 29, 2011 Statesman news article. On the last day of the special session, Dewhurst, a vocal proponent of the measure during the special session, drew criticism from House members, who blamed the lieutenant governor for the bill’s demise, according to that June 29, 2011 Statesman article. They claimed that by adjourning the Senate before the House had even voted on the bill, Dewhurst had weakened its chances of passing into law. House critics said that by adjourning early, Dewhurst and the Senate had put the representatives in an uncomfortable position. Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas told the Tribune on June 28, 2011, that the Senate had left the House in a "take it or leave it" position, forcing representatives to either pass SB 29 as was or deny it outright, since the House wouldn’t have an opportunity to negotiate the bill’s terms with the Senate. One recap down, one to go. So-called sanctuary cities -- defined as places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally -- were central to Perry’s 2010 re-election. Perry ran against Democratic nominee Bill White, who Perry claimed had allowed Houston to become a sanctuary city during his tenure as mayor. On January 11, 2011, Perry declared sanctuary cities an "emergency" issue for lawmakers, according to a Statesman news article published that day. A proposal banning sanctuary cities cleared the House during the fifth and last month of the regular session, according to a May 10, 2011, Statesman blog post, as House Democrats said the ban would effectively make Hispanic Texans second-class citizens. Despite Democrats’ attempt to prevent the measure from advancing, the legislation passed out of a Senate committee on May 20, 2011, according to a Statesman news article posted that night. Still, the session ended without there being enough Senate support to bring it up for consideration. According to a May 26, 2011, Statesman news article, a vote to bring up the measure on the Senate floor was 19-12, along party lines. The proposal needed twenty-one votes, two-thirds of the Senate membership, to win consideration. Next, Perry resurrected the topic during the summer special session, according to his June 7, 2011, proclamation. The special session proceeded without the Senate observing the two-thirds’ hurdle, so SB 9 passed the Senate in mid-June, according to a June 15, 2011, Statesman news article. But, in a reverse of the regular session turns, the anti-sanctuary-city measure died in the House. According to a June 30, 2011, news article posted by the Texas Tribune, both SB 9 and the House’s version of the bill, House Bill 9, languished in the House State Affairs Committee through the end of session. Dewhurst fumed, saying two days before the session ended: "I don't pretend to understand the House... I have enough challenges with running the Senate that I'm not going to get into the House business, but I would love to see the House come together and take that legislation so we can send it directly to the governor," according to a June 27, 2011, news article in the Tribune. When we pointed out that these two proposals, unlike the others cited by Dewhurst, did not make it into law, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch said we were "picking at word choices." Our ruling In his speech, Dewhurst listed the unsuccessful sanctuary and anti-groping proposals with other proposals, saying he "passed" each of them -- a characterization leaving the impression that every one of them became a statute. That's correct for six of them. But the fact that the sanctuary and anti-groping measures fell short amounts to vital missing detail, making his statement Half True.

pomt-09053	"In Florida alone, more than $3.5 billion a year is spent on health care and criminal justice for illegal immigrants."	/florida/statements/2010/jun/30/ritch-workman/workman-misquotes-immigration-report/	As Florida lawmakers prepare to introduce their own version of Arizona's strict immigration law, Republican state Rep. Ritch Workman has been championing the cause by painting the state's illegal immigrant population as the scourge of fiscal conservatism, business owners and taxpayers. "All businesses and taxpayers face the unfair burden of providing federally mandated services to illegal immigrants, and putting the brakes on this noncitizen entitlement program will save Arizona a considerable amount of money," wrote Workman in a Florida Today opinion page article on June 6, 2010. "In Florida alone, more than $3.5 billion a year is spent on health care and criminal justice for illegal immigrants. Given this, I think it is time for Florida to follow Arizona’s lead." $3.5 billion and change is a lot of money in a state that had to close a $6 billion budget gap in 2010, so PolitiFact Florida decided to take this claim on a ride through the Truth-O-Meter. Workman's district office directed us to the Florida House Majority Office, which distributes talking points to its Republican members. Staff director Todd Reid told us Workman was slightly off. He gave us a $3.8 billion figure culled from a February 2009 report, "The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Floridians," published by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The report, which looks at projected government spending on education, health and incarceration, is one of many fiscal analyses distributed by FAIR, an anti-illegal-immigration group based in Washington, D.C. To determine Florida's illegal immigration tab, FAIR's special projects director Jack Martin singled out the average cost of government services according to, in many instances, other private studies, and then multiplied those figures by the group's estimated immigration population. To be sure, pinpointing the size of a demographic that doesn't want to be tracked is not an exact science, but it is worth noting that FAIR's conclusions are based on inexact estimates. For example, FAIR ranked Florida's illegal immigration population fourth in the nation, with an estimated 950,000 immigrants in 2008. In contrast, the Department of Homeland Security ranks Florida third in the nation, with 720,000 illegal immigrants in 2009. Some of FAIR's other conclusions raise questions. To start, FAIR's education costs are based on the assumption that nearly every student enrolled in English learning classes is the child of illegal immigrants, since, "the children of immigrants legally admitted for permanent residence are likely to already speak English because the parents lived in the United States as nonimmigrants, prepared for years to immigrate to the United States, or arrived from countries where English is taught in the schools," according to the report. That explanation of the students is not a fact, which casts doubts on FAIR's final education tally. Here's another example. FAIR bases its health care costs on a 2002 Florida Hospital Association survey that found unreimbursed emergency medical care for illegal immigrants toppled $40 million. But the survey includes responses from private hospitals that are not funded by the state. How about one more? FAIR produces the state's incarceration costs for illegal immigrants based on the state Department of Corrections' "illegal alien" count of inmates. However, no such count exists. Instead, the state keeps tabs on all inmates who are not U.S. citizens, whether they're in the country legally or illegally. While many of those inmates are eventually released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further immigration processing, including possible deportation, the state does not track whether its inmates are legal U.S. residents. "I would take FAIR's numbers with a big shaker of salt," said Daniel Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington, D.C., policy group. "The organization exists to portray immigrants in a bad light." Still, even if FAIR's math passed muster, the report's findings would not validate Workman's claim. FAIR concludes the bulk of state expenses related to illegal immigrants, or $3.4 billion, is spent on educating the children of illegal immigrants, including children who were born here and thus are U.S. citizens. Only $380 million was spent on uncompensated medical care and incarceration, a far cry from Workman's $3.5 billion-claim, a seemingly impossible figure, acknowledged FAIR. "The magnitude of the fiscal cost estimate would require the inclusion of the educational costs," said Martin, who wrote the FAIR report. Just to be sure, we checked with state health and criminal justice officials. The state budget cites six criminal justice branches: the Department of Corrections, the Justice Administration, the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Department of Legal Affairs/Attorney General and the Parole Commission. Representatives for each of those departments said they do not track how many illegal immigrants receive services each year. Consequently, any related costs were unknown, they said. The state's health agencies also said they don't count illegal immigrants. Nor do state courts. "The Office of the State Courts Administrator tells me that they are not required to keep such data, so they do not," said spokesman Craig Waters. Or state auditors. "We haven't been told to do that," said Kathy McGuire, deputy director of the Florida Legislature's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, when asked for state fiscal projections related to illegal immigration. "I think it is an emerging issue. It hasn't been a concern in past sessions." Time for some math of our own. It seems Workman grossly misquoted numbers pushed by an anti-illegal-immigration group to bolster his argument against illegal immigration. But, the group's conclusions are suspect because they are based on assumptions and estimates, not facts, which multiple state agencies confirmed. None of this adds up. We rate Workman's claim False. Correction: The Cato Institute is a libertarian Washington, D.C., policy group. As originally published, we mistakenly described the Cato Institute's political leaning.

pomt-00637	"Every year we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance. That is roughly the budget of our entire military, entirely wasted on tax compliance."	/texas/statements/2015/may/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-americans-spend-500-billion-complying-tax/	A reader questioned Sen. Ted Cruz’s comparison of military spending to how much it costs Americans to get their taxes done. According to a blog post on txwinelover.com, Cruz toured Becker Vineyards in July 2014 before holding a roundtable with wine industry representatives during which he agreed the tax system should be simplified. "Every year," Cruz elaborated, "we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance. That is roughly the budget of our entire military, entirely wasted on tax compliance. I agree with you we should move to a simple flat tax where everyone can fill out their taxes on a postcard and that we should shut down the IRS." Cruz, a Texas lawyer elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, has since declared his candidacy for president. But he’d already called for a flat-rate income tax and abolishing the IRS. And was he right that about the same $500 billion a year getting spent on complying with tax laws and funding the military? Both figures need explaining. Military spending Per military spending, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said by email that Cruz drew on a chart posted by The Washington Post in 2012 indicating that adjusted for inflation, defense spending has exceeded $500 billion a year since 2007 or so: SOURCE: Blog post, "Defense spending in the U.S., in four charts," Wonkblog, The Washington Post, Aug. 28, 2012, chart citing Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (noted in an email from Rick Tyler, chief national spokesperson, Ted Cruz presidential campaign, May 5, 2015) The Post relied on the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments where by email, analyst Todd Harrison told us the military’s 2014 base budget, meaning the cost of maintaining a standing military in peacetime, totaled $496 billion. So far so good, except, Harrison advised, that figure did not reflect all military spending. Generally, he said, the base budget "does not include the cost of using the military to fight a conflict, nor does it include legacy costs, such as unfunded pensions and veterans benefits, or military activities conducted outside of (the Department of Defense) such as the maintenance and upgrade of nuclear weapons. All of those things are extra," he said. If you count those other expenses, Harrison said, the U.S. spent $866 billion on the military in 2014. By email, Tyler stressed the military’s base budget doesn’t include overseas contingencies. But it’s "your rigged game, you make up any facts you want," Tyler said by email. Next, we turned to what it costs Americans to fulfill federal tax requirements. Tax compliance costs To get our arms around "compliance costs," we reached out to certified public accountant Connie Weaver, a Texas A&M University professor, who guided us to June 2011 testimony on compliance costs by tax expert Michael Brostek of the investigative arm of Congress, the General Accountability Office. Broadly, Brostek said that complying with IRS regulations "costs taxpayers time and money," at least $107 billion in 2005, the GAO estimated, with other studies estimating costs 1.5 times as large. Beyond compliance costs, Bostek noted even larger estimated "economic efficiency costs, which are reductions in economic well-being caused by changes in behavior due to taxes." Previous fact checks Even before Cruz commented at the roundtable, the FactChecker at The Washington Post awarded two Pinocchios to House Speaker John Boehner’s claim that it was costing Americans $500 billion a year to comply with federal tax demands. Cost estimates varied, the Post wrote, with the "safest bet" at the time being $163 billion as estimated by the IRS’s Taxpayer Advocate Service, entrusted with helping taxpayers resolve problems and recommending changes. Adjusting for inflation, that cost would have been nearly $172 billion a year around the time Cruz spoke in 2014. More recently, the FactChecker weighed in again after noticing Cruz made his $500 billion military-tax compliance spending comparison at a May 2015 South Carolina stop. Like Boehner, Cruz drew a couple Pinocchios. Weaver told us that because Cruz didn’t say what he meant by compliance costs — where he’d draw the boundaries — an observer could explore three possibilities: a taxpayer’s basic liability as in how much he or she sends the government in taxes; the costs associated with pulling together information and submitting it to the government; or efficiency costs as in "lost outputs, time taken from other productive activities or from missing out on other consumption activities." For an individual, she said, it’s easy to calculate compliance costs by gauging how long it takes to fill out the required forms and multiplying that by an hourly dollar figure for how the individual values their time. "When you try to aggregate that nationally," she said, "it’s very difficult." She said she wouldn’t be comfortable specifying a national compliance-costs figure. But all in all, Weaver said, it looks like Cruz’s figure was high. Cruz aide: Senator relied on two studies Tyler told us Cruz got his tax-compliance costs from an April 2011 analysis by supply-side economist Arthur B. Laffer and others indicating $431.1 billion in combined annual costs incurred by taxpayers to pay federal taxes and a May 2013 study by researchers at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University stating the annual "hidden costs" of U.S. tax compliance ranged from $215 billion to $987 billion. Laffer study The Laffer-led study said researchers created a "comprehensive estimate of the total administrative costs, time costs, and direct tax compliance costs created by the complex U.S. federal income tax code." The $431.1 billion in estimated annual spending, the report said, reflects money spent "to comply with and administer the U.S. income tax system.* Its estimate, relying on 2010 figures, broke out to approximately $31.5 billion in direct outlays (paying a professional tax preparer or purchasing tax software), total IRS administrative costs of $12.4 billion; and nearly $378 billion for the "time value costs taxpayers must bear to pay their taxes," filling out and submitting forms. In 2011, the Post’s FactChecker called the Laffer study "dubious," noting it took a figure from the Internal Revenue Service’s Tax Advocate — that individuals and businesses spent 6.1 billion hours complying with tax filing requirements — and got to its cost estimate by multiplying "it against an absurd hourly income of $68.42 on the theory that the wealthy pay most of the income taxes." Mercatus Center study The Mercatus Center’s study, led by Jason J. Fichtner, a senior research fellow, similarly noted the high wage costs applied in the Laffer study, stating that in the study, the "average income used to monetize taxpayers’ time is significantly greater than the average income used in other estimates." For its part, the center suggested a range of hidden costs connected to paying taxes including "time and money spent submitting tax forms, foregone economic growth, lobbying expenditures, and gaps in revenue collection" though the authors said they couldn’t pin a figure for lobbying by interests trying to reduce taxes paid. As far as compliance costs, what Cruz singled out, the center study estimated $67 billion to $378 billion a year in accounting costs associated with filing taxes, a range based on IRS information suggesting 60 percent of individual taxpayers and 71 percent of unincorporated business taxpayers pay someone--an accountant, lawyer or tax professional--to prepare their taxes, with 32 percent of individual taxpayers relying on software. Significantly, Fichtner told us, his paper, based on a review of relevant studies, was intended to cover far more than simple compliance costs. "I chose to give a range based on the different methodologies that I found in the research literature. It’s not that one method is better than another–or right versus wrong," Fichtner said. "All the measures have different assumptions for the time value of an hour of lost work/productivity as well as time spent." Here’s a chart from the study summarizing a range of cost studies dating back to 2003: Other analyses Next, we asked the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation about Cruz’s figure. Spokesman Richard Borean said by email it had no analysis to confirm or refute the $500 billion figure. But he noted the Mercatus Center study and suggested we consider annual reports on tax compliance costs put out by the National Taxpayers Union, a non-partisan research and educational organization that says it’s devoted to showing Americans how taxes, government spending and regulations affect them. The union’s April 2014 report, which would have been the the latest one available before Cruz spoke, noted the IRS’s National Taxpayer Advocate had most recently estimated the annual paperwork burden generated by the federal personal and corporate tax system at 6.1 billion hours — the equivalent of about 3.05 million employees working 40-hour weeks year-round with two weeks off each. The group said: "The value of the labor behind the 6.1 billion hours amounts to a jaw-dropping $192.6 billion, when calculated with the most recently reported average employer cost for non-federal civilian workers by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: $31.57 per hour. Add in the $31.7 billion spent on tax software and other out-of-pocket costs for individuals and the total is $224.3 billion a year." (The union’s latest look at compliance costs, released in April 2015, said compliance with the federal income tax cost the economy $233.8 billion in productivity in 2014.) Our ruling Cruz said: "Every year we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance. That is roughly the budget of our entire military, entirely wasted on tax compliance." This claim proved squishy at both ends. It looks like depending on how you value time, you can get to almost any total for what it costs Americans to prepare and file tax returns. However, most estimates run short of Cruz’s figure. Meantime, military spending exceeded $800 billion when he spoke though the senator’s spokesman indicated he meant to not count spending on conflicts abroad and other items not in the military’s nearly $500 billion base budget.

pomt-01204	Austin is "burdened by the fastest-growing tax increases of any major city in the nation."	/texas/statements/2014/nov/28/jim-skaggs/austin-area-activist-says-austin-has-fastest-growi/	An activist expressed elation after Austin voters rejected a $1 billion rail-and-roads proposition, going on to say the rail part of the plan would have been a financial headache. Jim Skaggs, founder of Citizens Against Rail Taxes, told the Austin Monitor for a Nov. 5, 2014, news story, that the rail costs would have been imposed "on a community already burdened by the fastest-growing tax increases of any major city in the nation." Mark Nathan, a consultant to Let’s Go Austin, which advocated for the proposition, asked us to check Skaggs’ claim. All aboard! To our inquiry, Skaggs said by email he believes he learned of Austin’s dubious status from an Austin Business Journal story. "I do not have time to research it at the moment," Skaggs wrote Nov. 5, 2014. City spokeswoman: Mild rate changes We hunted unsuccessfully for such a story while to our nudge, a city spokeswoman, Melissa Alvarado, said by email the city does not track taxes in other jurisdictions. Alvarado also pointed us to a city chart showing its property tax rate mostly sliding from 1993 through 2009 and increasing or holding steady since: Source: "Austin, Texas, Approved Budget 2013-14, Volume 1," page 19 (downloaded Nov. 24, 2014) Alvarado continued: "Please keep in mind the city is only one taxing jurisdiction. There’s also the county, school district, health district and then more, depending on where exactly someone lives." Also, she said, appraisals "are a factor for taxes, not just the tax rate." (She noted the 2015 tax rate is the same as the 2014 rate.) Indeed, surging property values are a driver in local government revenues, the Austin American-Statesman has noted; of late, an April 2014 news story quoted Travis County’s chief appraiser, Marya Crigler, saying taxable residential values — a home’s market value minus property-tax exemptions — were up an average of 8 percent for 2014. Changes in those values, the story said, influence government spending plans. Austin versus other big Texas cities Our search for a breakdown of changes in taxes among U.S. cities led us to analyst James Quintero of the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, who pointed out by email that since 2008, according to a graph in the city of Austin’s proposed fiscal 2015 budget, Austin residents have experienced a bigger burst in their share of income paid in city property taxes than residents of Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio or Houston. Specifically, Quintero said, the percentage of median family income spent on property tax bills for median-value homes in the Austin area represented a little less than 1.1 percent in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2014, that figure had increased to just under 1.5 percent, representing an increase of 0.4 percent. The other big Texas cities demonstrated smaller increases over the period. National comparisons Then again, Skaggs said Austin’s tax increases were No. 1 among major cities nationally. We turned to Beverly Kerr, lead researcher for the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, who sifted information compiled by the Cambridge, Mass.-based Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. The institute, which focuses on property valuation and taxation policy, urban planning and development, land economics and property rights, annually issues a 50-state property-tax comparison study. Kerr, drawing from the latest study, issued in March 2014 by the center and the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, emailed us charts indicating numerous cities had significant property tax hikes in recent years and also that by one gauge, Austin ranked close to No. 1 nationally in its increases compared with the most-populous cities. One institute analysis looked at how much revenue per resident different cities have taken in. Our takeaways: From 2006 to 2011, per-person property tax revenue collected in Austin by all local government units (including school districts, the city and the county) decreased 4 percent, as measured in constant 2011 dollars. Then again, per-person revenue from city property taxes alone went up 6 percent; Austin ranked 35th among the 50 largest cities for that rate of increase. Higher rates of increase were recorded by cities including Philadelphia, Houston, Dallas, New York, San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and Chicago, which had a 60 percent spike in per-person property tax revenue. Over a longer span, 2001 to 2011, Austin ranked 27th nationally for its 26 percent increase in per-person revenue from city property taxes. The Texas capital was outpaced in percentage growth by cities including San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, New York and Los Angeles. Austin experienced a 2 percent increase in per-person revenue from all taxes from 2006 to 2011, ranking 25th in this way. Its increase trailed hikes occurring in the more populous cities of San Jose, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Another institute breakdown highlighted by Kerr shows Austin ranking among cities with the greatest increases in taxes on a median-valued home. Our snapshots: From 2009 to 2013, Austin’s effective tax rate on a median-priced home increased from 1.93 percent to 2.22 percent; that bump amounted to the 11th-greatest increase (0.29 points) in the 50 biggest cities. As of that year, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Jacksonville and Chicago were the cities more populous than Austin that ranked higher by this indicator. In this instance, the effective rate is not the rate by which a government unit can generate the revenue it raised the year before. Rather, the study defines the effective rate as the total tax on a median-priced home divided by its total value, which takes into account variations in assessment rates and value exemptions across localities. While Austin’s effective tax rate in 2013 was ahead of its rate in 2009, it was less than the 2.44 percent rate of 2005. In 2013, property taxes on a median-value Austin home ran $1,049 ahead of those taxes on such a home in 2005, up nearly 26 percent. That percentage increase placed Austin 10th nationally in this way behind Portland, San Jose, Denver, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Albuquerque, Columbus and Cleveland -- and only San Jose, Portland and Philadelphia had greater dollar increases than Austin. Among, say, the 15 largest cities as of that time, Austin ranked third behind San Jose and Philadelphia for the percent change in net tax 2005-2013. Over a shorter period, 2009-2013, Phoenix, San Jose, San Francisco, San Diego, New York and Jacksonville experienced greater increases in net property tax on a median-value home. (Dallas, Chicago, San Antonio, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Houston and Indianapolis had smaller increases.) Our ruling Skaggs said Austin has the fastest-growing tax increases of any major U.S. city. Among the nation’s largest cities, Austin appears to have had the third-fastest growth in its property-tax bite on a median-valued home from 2005 to 2013. It seems reasonable to speculate local taxpayers feel the pinch. However, Skaggs didn’t provide nor did we find a sign of Austin ranking first in tax growth among the country’s major cities.

pomt-08295	Says Russ Feingold voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/01/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-us-sen-russ-feingold-voted-give-s/	For four years, Republican congressional candidates have attacked Democrats on a vote that combines two emotional issues -- Social Security and illegal immigration -- into one fat target. In the 2010 U.S. Senate race, Republican Ron Johnson continues the tradition, pointing to an obscure 2006 Senate vote to level the charge that Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold supported giving Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. Johnson has pounded away at the issue in a radio ad, automated phone calls and on his website. In the Oct. 11, 2010 debate, Feingold answered Johnson’s charge flatly: "Well, of course I don’t support Social Security benefits for undocumented people. That’s just absolutely false." Now, Johnson is denying Feingold’s denial, charging in a news release the three-term senator is lying about his own record. Got all that? Let’s put this one to the test -- and to rest. The vote in question is on an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006. The immigration reform bill -- which had Feingold’s support but never passed -- was designed to give most illegal immigrants a chance to become legal citizens. Feingold has said in campaign literature he backs requiring illegal workers to "come forward, pay hefty fines, pay taxes, learn English and civics, work, and wait in the back of the line – before earning the privilege of permanent resident status." Johnson has emphasized border security first and deporting criminals who are here illegally. He criticizes "blanket" amnesty but has backed "humane" treatment of hard-working illegals and some unspecified process involving employer penalties. At the time of the 2006 immigration reform debate, by longstanding practice, U.S. law broadly allowed immigrants who later get legal status to get credit for Social Security payments made while they were undocumented. It is common -- to the tune of billions of dollars each year -- for illegal workers to pay Social Security payroll taxes. During the 2006 debate, U.S. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nevada, pushed an amendment to block many of those former illegals from getting that credit. The issue was ripe because the immigration bill sought to legalize the status of millions of workers. Feingold joined the 50-49 majority -- 38 Democrats, 11 Republicans and 1 independent -- to kill the Ensign amendment. That single vote has spawned campaign ads in at least 29 races, according to our friends at FactCheck.org. So was that vote, as the most recent Johnson news release put it, a "vote to grant Social Security benefits for illegal immigrants?" No. Nearly all of Johnson’s statements on this leave out the important fact that the 2006 amendment dealt with the policy on payments to formerly illegal workers -- undocumented workers who later were made legal. Currently illegal immigrants are not eligible for Social Security benefits under U.S. law -- and that would not have changed even if Ensign’s amendment had passed. The Social Security Act requires noncitizens in the United State to be "lawfully present" to receive benefits, and also prohibits payments to aliens residing in the United States unlawfully, a 2006 Congressional Research Service report noted. In October 2007, Ensign brought back a much narrower amendment during another immigration debate. The amendment prohibited Social Security payments to persons who had been convicted of misuse of a Social Security number for their work while on illegal status. Feingold voted in favor of the amendment, which passed 92-2. Johnson isn’t the only GOP candidate to turn to the issue in this race. In the Nevada U.S. Senate race, PolitiFact National ruled as Barely True a claim that U.S. Sen. Harry Reid voted "to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally." If anything, Jonson’s claim is more off the mark: It implies currently illegal workers would have benefited. Where does that leave us? In just about every venue possible, Republican Ron Johnson is charging Democrat Russ Feingold supported giving Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. In truth, the 2006 amendment cited by Johnson, which Feingold did oppose, would not have prevented illegals from receiving Social Security benefits. They already were barred. In fact, Feingold wound up voting for a more modest version of the amendment the following year. This one isn’t a borderline call: False.

pomt-06963	Says the U.S. borrows "42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today and about half of that comes from countries like China."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/15/paul-ryan/gop-rep-paul-ryan-says-us-borrows-42-cents-each-do/	As an Aug. 2, 2011 deadline approaches, debate is intensifying over whether Congress should allow the federal government to go deeper in debt. The head of the nation’s central bank went so far as to say the borrowing limit must be raised in order to avert a "huge financial calamity." Seeking cuts in spending, many Republicans, including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, have resisted President Barack Obama’s call to raise the debt limit. In defending his position, Ryan made a pair of striking statistical claims during a Milwaukee radio interview on July 6, 2011. "We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today," he toldJay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM (1130), "and about half of that comes from countries like China." The first part of the statement has to do with the federal deficit, while the second has to do with the debt. As the U.S. Treasury Department points out, a deficit occurs when the government spends more money than it takes in (through taxes, fees and other income). When there’s a deficit, the government borrows money to cover the difference by selling treasury securities. Debt, meanwhile, is the net amount of accumulated deficits. Let’s look at the two halves of the statement. "We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today" Conor Sweeney, Ryan’s budget committee spokesman, cited two reports: A summary of the fiscal 2012 federal budget, which shows revenue of $2.17 trillion and spending of $3.82 trillion. Sweeney divided the first figure by the second to show that 57 cents of every dollar the government spends comes from revenue, which means the other 43 cents are borrowed. A June 2011 budget review by the Congressional Budget Office which, using the same math, indicates 41 cents of every dollar spent is borrowed. That puts Ryan’s claim of 42 cents smack in the middle. Our PolitiFact colleagues earlier in 2011 twice evaluated statements nearly identical to Ryan’s, using the same approach Sweeney used. They rated both statements True, even though they were off by 3 cents. To check the most recent data, we used the Treasury Department’s May 2011 revenue and spending report, the latest available when Ryan did the radio interview. It indicates that, for the fiscal year to that point in time, the government borrowed 39 cents for every dollar it spends. Ryan is also within 3 cents of that figure, so we’ll judge his first claim as essentially accurate. Now, to his second claim -- which is more complicated. "About half of (the borrowing) comes from countries like China" By saying "countries like China," Ryan meant borrowing the U.S. does from any foreign countries, according to Sweeney. So, for Ryan’s second claim to be accurate, roughly half of the U.S. debt would have to be foreign owned. There is no real dispute that the nation’s total debt exceeds $14 trillion. PolitiFact has twice used that figure in evaluating claims about the proportion of U.S. debt owned by China. In recent days, the New York Times cited the current debt as $14.3 trillion and the Los Angeles Times, in a primer on the debt-limit talks, noted that the debt had reached that level in May 2011. Moreover, the The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It, a daily debt tracking done by the Treasury Department, also shows the debt at $14.3 trillion. Indeed, that figure just about equals the nation’s debt limit -- which explains why there is urgency on the part of those who want to see the limit raised before what the Obama administration says is an Aug. 2, 2011 deadline. But according to Sweeney, Ryan wasn’t referring to that measure at all. Rather, he said, Ryan was pointing to a portion of the total debt, the far less known "debt held by the public." Citing a Congressional Budget Office study, Sweeney called that debt measure "the most significant measure for economic purposes" because it excludes treasury securities held by Social Security trust funds and other government accounts. He then pointed to the Treasury Department’s daily debt tracking, which shows total debt at $14.3 trillion, including $9.74 trillion held by the public. Sweeney also cited a Treasury Department report which said foreign investment accounted for $4.49 trillion of U.S. debt as of April 2011. (China, by the way, was the top foreign debt owner, with $1.15 trillion.) Using the $4.49 trillion figure would mean that foreign investors own 46 percent of the debt held by the public, which is the proportion Ryan claimed -- but only 31 percent of the total debt, which is debt measure most familiar to most people. So what’s the bottom line? In an interview about raising the federal government’s debt limit, Ryan made two claims in one statement: "We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today and about half of that comes from countries like China." The first claim is essentially on the money. But we believe Ryan owed his listeners more detail if he expected them to accept his second claim. It has long been widely reported that both the nation’s debt and its debt limit are $14.3 trillion. And that’s what the radio discussion was about. So when Ryan said that half of the nation’s borrowing comes from foreign countries -- singling out China for emphasis -- his listeners would assume he meant half of the $14.3 trillion in total debt, not the much smaller debt measure he now says he was referring to, even if that second measure has strong merit in the debt limit discussion. We rate Ryan’s statement Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2011-07-15T09:00:00	2011-07-06	['United_States', 'China', 'Washington,_D.C.']
pomt-06662	Says 600,000 to 700,000 government workers have been laid off in the last year and a half	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/12/bill-pascrell/congressman-bill-pascrell-says-more-600000-public-/	U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell says public-sector layoffs are dragging down the nation’s overall job growth. The country had no net job growth in August, a month where the private sector added 17,000 jobs and the public sector shed the same amount, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. WNYC host Brian Lehrer asked Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) in a recent radio interview about August’s stagnant employment numbers. Pascrell called the federal jobs report "disappointing" and highlighted the larger impact of decreasing government employment. "We’ve lost public jobs," Pascrell said in the Sept. 2 interview. "Whether it's policemen, firemen, sanitation people, we got to understand that there's six to seven hundred thousand of these folks who have been laid off [in the last] year and a half. If we continue to put our heads in the sand and don't recognize that that's part of the equation as well, then we're never going to address this." The nation didn’t lose as many government jobs in the time frame Pascrell mentioned, but his numbers aren’t far off. And while there’s debate on whether smaller government is better for the economy, we won’t be ruling on that issue in this Truth-O-Meter item. Pascrell’s spokesman, Paul Brubaker, told PolitiFact New Jersey the congressman was referring to local, state and federal government workers in his interview. Brubaker sent us an article from U.S. News & World Report that said, "Since the end of the recession, government employment -- including federal, state, and local jobs -- has fallen by roughly 600,000." The actual number is 595,000, according to seasonally-adjusted federal data. But Pascrell didn’t reference the end of the recession -- which the National Bureau of Economic Research says ended in June 2009 -- in the radio interview. Still, if we hold Pascrell strictly to the time frame he mentioned, he’s not wildly off from the range he cited. In the past 18 months -- from February 2010 to August, the most recent data available -- the nation lost 512,000 government jobs. During the same time frame, nearly 2.4 million private-sector jobs were created. The decrease in public-sector jobs offset the net total in those 18 months by nearly 21 percent, to about 1.9 million. We reached out to two experts from Washington, D.C. think tanks for their take on the role that decreasing public-sector employment has had on the current jobs situation. "Losses in government employment help account for the fact that overall job growth has been so slow," said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank. "Drops in government employment have worsened the nation’s employment picture and worsened the prospects of unemployed workers who are seeking to get re-employed or to get their first career jobs." James Sherk, senior policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said "public-sector job losses have had a relatively minor role in the U.S. employment situation thus far" and "government jobs will not play a constructive role in pulling the U.S. out of its current situation." It’s worth noting that state and local governments employ the vast majority of public workers. Of all government employees, 64 percent work for local governments, 23 percent work for state governments and 13 percent work for the federal government. In New Jersey, 30,500 public jobs were eliminated in the 18 months from January 2010 to July, the most recent state-level figures available. Of those jobs, 18,200 were in local government, 10,900 were in state government and 1,400 were in federal government. The ruling Pascrell said 600,000 to 700,000 public employees have been laid off in the last year and a half. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation has lost 512,000 government jobs at the federal, state and local level in the past 18 months. Pascrell’s numbers were off, but not wildly off. And his argument that public-sector job losses are having an impact on net job growth is valid. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00930	The potential Iran nuclear agreement would limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but too few for a nuclear power program.	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/	The deadline for an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program is something of a moving target, but right now negotiators need to wrap things up by June 2015. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States — along with Germany, have until then to strike a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Iran’s stock of enriched uranium and freezes the country’s capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. One element that’s fully expected in a long-term arrangement is a limit on the number and kinds of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uranium. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell said there’s an irony in that. "If you are going to have a nuclear weapons program, 5,000 is pretty much the number you need," Morell, now a CBS analyst, said on Charlie Rose. "If you have a power program, you need a lot more. By limiting them to a small number of centrifuges, we are limiting them to the number you need for a weapon." Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morell’s basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than you’d need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just one negotiating point out of many. The consensus among the experts we reached is that Morell is on the money. Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University told PunditFact the Morell is "is absolutely correct." Ditto for Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association and David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security. Matthew Bunn at Harvard agreed with his colleagues. "People think surely you must need a bigger enrichment system to make 90 percent enriched material for bombs than to make 4-5 percent enriched material for power reactors," Bunn said. "But exactly the opposite is true." Bunn said there are two reasons. First, you need tens of tons of material to fuel a power reactor for a year, but just tens of kilograms to make a bomb. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the threshold amount for a bomb is about 25 kilograms of the most highly enriched U-235. And while yes, it’s harder to make 90 percent enriched uranium (bomb) than 4-5 percent enriched uranium (power), it’s not that much harder, Bunn said. The toughest part in the process comes when you start with the raw uranium. By the time you’ve brought that to 4-5 percent, "you’ve already done more than 2/3 of the work of going all the way to 90 percent U-235 for weapons," Bunn said. "So the amount of work needed to make bomb material is only a modest amount more per kilogram, and the number of kilograms you need for bombs is 1,000 times less. Bottom line: Making bombs takes fewer centrifuges. And without a lot of centrifuges, it’s hard to make nuclear power. For the record, some centrifuge models are better than others, so that's also a factor. Today, Iran has just one nuclear power station, the plant at Bushehr that it bought from the Russians. To keep that facility running, Iran would need to increase its centrifuge capacity ten-fold. A steady supply of fuel from Russia is what keeps Bushehr online. Centrifuges and a nuclear deal This fact that bombs require fewer centrifuges than power is a source of frustration for Albright, a physicist with the Institute for Science and International Security. "I wish it were reversed," he told us. "Then we could easily tell if the program was for weapons." As the clock clicks down to reach an agreement, the number of centrifuges and their level of sophistication will draw a lot of scrutiny. Kimball, of the Arms Control Association, said the specific terms on this front will have to resolve a crucial question: "What are Iran’s practical needs, and how do you square that with international concern about the real purpose?" Ideally, Kimball said, Russia or another nation would continue to supply the fuel, but barring that, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany aim to put on cap on the number of centrifuges for as many years as possible. Allowing about 5,000 would help. "With that, it would take 12 months for Iran to produce enough material for one bomb," Kimball said. "That would give you enough time to detect that activity." But Bunn underscored that an agreement would have many moving parts and a key element would be the number of years that Iran agreed to rein in its centrifuge capacity. "Because the sides have already agreed in the (interim agreement) that after the agreement expires, Iran is to be treated like other parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That would mean it could build up its enrichment capacity to have enough to fuel Bushehr or even more reactors," Bunn said. The variables don’t stop there. If Iran ramped up production of fuel for nuclear power, it would need a ready supply of raw ore, which it might need to purchase on the international market. During his interview with Charlie Rose, Morell warned that the focus on declared centrifuges is misplaced, because he expects that if Iran were to try to build a bomb, it would do so in secret. The only protection against that, Morell said, is unannounced inspections at any place in the country at any time. Our ruling Morell said that it takes fewer centrifuges to make bomb-grade nuclear material than it does to supply fuel for a nuclear power plant and argued that the focus on centrifuges can go too far. That argument aside, experts agreed that Morrell has his facts right. A power plant requires tons of fuel each year. A bomb requires about 25 kilograms of U-235 enriched to the 90 percent level. If an agreement limits Iran to about 9,000 centrifuges, that would be sufficient to produce enough bomb-grade material but would leave Iran well short of the capacity to generate fuel to power nuclear power plants. We rate Morrell’s claim True.	None	Michael Morell	None	None	None	2015-02-25T16:41:01	2015-02-18	['Iran']
pomt-14993	"Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/13/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-voted-against-brady/	Hillary Clinton used the gun debate to try and attack Sen. Bernie Sanders from the left at the first Democratic debate. Sanders’ record on the issue has been the subject of much liberal ire. After CNN moderator Anderson Cooper grilled Sanders on his vote shielding firearms companies from lawsuits, Clinton brought up another time Sanders didn’t side with gun control advocates. "The majority of our country supports background, and even the majority of gun owners do," Clinton said on Oct. 13. "Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady Bill." Clinton is correct that most Americans (90 percent) support background checks. But did Sanders vote against the landmark Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which mandated a five-day waiting period for background checks for gun purchases? Five nays from the Vermont congressman The Clinton campaign pointed to our July fact-check of an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC. We rated a slightly more expansive claim — "Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, background checks and waiting periods" — Mostly True. (That statement that referred specifically to background checks, which Sanders had supported.) Before it became law in 1993, the Brady bill underwent many transformations. Sanders, then Vermont’s sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the bill in its entirety five times: 1. In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House. 2. The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In November 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992. 3. After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five-day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version twice in the same day, but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time). 4. He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why. 5. The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it. In July, when we first looked into the issue, Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. "He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down," Weaver said. "He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont." A mixed record overall Overall, Sanders is neither a gun nut nor an anti-gunner. He’s received lukewarm marks from the NRA, ranging from a C- to F in the last 15 years. "Throughout his time in public office, Sen. Sanders has consistently voted to outlaw the most dangerous weapons and keep guns out of the hands of criminals," Sanders spokesperson Michael Briggs told us. Briggs noted that Sanders has voted in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown massacre. On the flip side, Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains and in National Parks, though his most recent pro-gun vote was in 2009. "(Sanders’) gun control position is a reflection of living in Vermont for 40 years," Garrison Nelson, a professor of professor of political science at the University of Vermont, told us in July. "Vermonters use guns to shoot deer and moose, not one another." Our ruling Clinton said, "Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill." Sanders voted against the Brady bill five times from 1991 to 1993. Sanders’ campaign manager told us in July that he did so because he was against a national waiting period and had to answer to the people of Vermont, a rural state with high gun ownership. Overall, Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to guns. But he did indeed register five nays on the Brady bill. We rate Clinton’s claim True.

pomt-07354	Says close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas over the last decade was non-Anglo.	/texas/statements/2011/may/09/garnet-coleman/state-rep-garnet-coleman-says-nearly-90-percent-po/	Calling a Republican redraw of Texas House districts "retrogressive," Democratic Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston said it doesn’t reflect the state’s growing minority population. From 2000 to 2010, "close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas was non-Anglo, yet this map reduces the number of districts where communities of color can elect their candidate of choice," he said in an April 28 press release. That day, the GOP-dominant House approved the revisions, which Coleman says eliminates one district in which Hispanics make up the majority of registered voters, sending the plan to the Senate. We’re not going to weigh in on whether the map disenfranchises voters. But we wondered whether he correctly pegged the state’s non-Anglo population growth. In April 2010, the Democratic Lone Star Project similarly said the state was expected to gain congressional seats "almost entirely due to the growth of the African American and Hispanic populations in Texas in virtually every region of the state." We rated that Mostly True, finding that Hispanic growth seemed likely to deserve credit for Texas gaining seats, but that would be uncertain until the 2010 Census was complete. One year later, it is. And responding to our request for evidence to support Coleman’s claim, Joe Madden, Coleman’s chief of staff, pointed us to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the 2010 Census, Texas grew 20.6 percent in the decade. It was the fifth fastest-growing state behind Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Idaho. By raw numbers alone, Texas’ population increased by about 4.3 million people. California, which retained the largest population, increased by 3.4 million. How much of Texas’ population growth was due to non-Anglos? According to census data, in 2000, about 9.9 million minorities — people who reported their ethnicity and race as something other than non-Hispanic white — accounted for 47.6 percent of the state’s population. From 2000 to 2010, the minority population swelled by 3.8 million, accounting for 54.7 percent of the population — and also making minorities responsible for about 89 percent of the state’s growth through the decade. According to a Feb. 18 Austin American-Statesman news article analyzing the new census data, Latinos accounted for two-thirds of Texas' growth over the decade and made up 37.6 percent of the state's total population through 2010, while blacks made up 11.5 percent of the growth. Robert Bernstein, a Census Bureau spokesman, told us that Coleman was "pretty much on the mark." We rate Coleman’s statement as True.

pomt-03858	"Over the last 20 years, the world has changed. It used to be that one could make a career out of working for one company. Today, the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years."	/virginia/statements/2013/mar/12/eric-cantor/cantor-says-job-longevity-has-decreased-during-las/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, says Republicans must find ways to reduce economic insecurity in American families. "Over the last 20 years, the world has changed," he said during a Feb. 5 speech to the American Enterprise Institute. "It used to be that one could make a career out of working for one company. Today, the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years." It’s a common refrain that people don’t stay at jobs as long as they used to and we wondered whether it’s true. Checking Cantor’s statement required two determinations: 1) How long does the average worker of today keep a job and, 2) Has the duration become shorter in the last 20 years? Cantor’s staff directed us to numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The agency collects tenure data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which asks a sample of workers how long they have been with their current employer. The figures reflect the median responses, meaning that half of the workers have been with their employers a shorter time and half longer. Since 1996, the BLS has published tenure statistics every other year. Immediately before then, it was published every five years. So it’s impossible to find data that neatly compares the 20-year span Cantor referenced. But the figures do allow a 21-year comparison, from January 1991 to January 2012, the date of the last report. The median tenure for U.S. workers in 2012 was 4.6 years, longer than the 3.6 years recorded in 1991. So contrary to Cantor’s contention, the length of time employees stayed with companies increased. The problem with this data is that it includes all workers, starting at age 16. "Those people are in school, starting out doing part-time work and may have a first job in retail," said Craig Copeland, a senior research associate for the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. "When we get to 25, we’re seeing people who are starting their career … that’s the age where people begin to have a strong workforce attachment." In an article he wrote for the institute’s newsletter, Copeland singled out the figure for all workers 25 or older. The median tenure was 4.8 years in 1991 and 5.4 years in 2012. By this measure, too, the length of time employees stayed with companies increased. Copeland’s analysis of the data goes back to 1983, when workers 25 or older had a median tenure of 5.0 years with the same company. He noted that tenure figures sway with the economy, falling during boom years when companies are hiring and rising during tight years when workers have fewer job options. The 5.4-year median tenure for workers 25 and older in January 2012 was the highest recorded in BLS reports dating back to 1983. The increase over the last 21 years has been driven by women. In 1991, women 25 and older spent a median 4.3 years with the same company. That rose to 4.4 years in in 1992 and 5.4 years in 2012. There hasn’t been a sustained change for similarly aged men. They spent a median 5.4 years working for the same company in 1991, 4.9 years in 2002 and 5.5 years in 2012. Putting all the numbers together, Copeland wrote, "Overall, employee tenure has been remarkably stable since 1983." He also noted that the number the number of workers staying in what could be considered career jobs has slowly increased. In 1983, 8.9 percent of workers had been with the same company 20 years or more. That rose to 9.5 percent in 1991, and 11 percent in 2012. Robert Topel, a University of Chicago labor economist, told us in an email that the median tenure statistics Cantor referred to are an imperfect measure of workers’ longevity with employers. The problem, he said, is that it records workers during the middle of employment stints that could last much longer. "The average completed duration of jobs in progress is roughly double the mean," he wrote. Topel said that in measuring worker longevity, "career jobs are pretty important and not materially different from the past." The BLS figures show that in 1991, 32.2 percent of workers 25 or older worked for the same company for 10 years or more. That increased to 33.7 percent in 2012. In 1991 and 2012, slightly more than half of full time workers 55 or older had been with the same company for 10 years or longer. Our ruling Cantor said job longevity has diminished over the last 20 years. "It used to be that one could make a career out of working for one company," he said. "Today, the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years." The majority leader was referring to 2012 BLS figures that show the median length of time U.S. workers 16 and older had spent with their employer was 4.6 years. The problem with this statistic is that young workers don’t stay at jobs very long and don’t view their labor as careers. The mean tenure of workers 25 and older was 5.4 years. In either case, tenure has actually increased over the last two decades. It has actually risen by one year if we consider workers 16 and older, and by more than half a year if we consider workers 25 and older. The bottom line: There’s some accuracy in Cantor’s estimate of how many years workers stay at their jobs. But he’s off target on his his major point -- that longevity at companies has decreased over the last 20 years. All told, we rate Cantor’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-10829	"He has never voted for a federal restriction on gun ownership."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/17/ron-paul/a-consistent-supporter-of-gun-rights/	According to the Second Amendment of the Constitution, the "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Ron Paul has voted consistently to keep that right from being limited in any way. In fact, he has repeatedly introduced the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act that would repeal most federal gun laws. During his tenure in the House, various measures limiting gun ownership have been considered. Here is a sampling: In 1999, the Columbine massacre instigated gun-control legislation. Amendments to gun show background check legislation would have limited ownership. He voted against prohibiting violent juvenile offenders from ever owning a gun. He also opposed keeping semiautomatic assault weapons from the hands of juveniles. The background check legislation did not pass the House at that time, but new background-check legislation did pass by voice vote this summer in the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre. Ron Paul was the only lawmaker to speak in opposition, calling it "flagrantly unconstitutional." In 2004, Paul voted to repeal the District of Columbia gun ban. The legislation passed the House but was not taken up in the Senate. Then in 2005, he voted to prevent D.C. from spending money to enforce one of its provisions.

pomt-09903	A new Rasmussen poll shows people "oppose (Sotomayor's) confirmation. Only 37 percent support it."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/13/jon-kyl/poll-sonia-sonia-sotomayor-support-shows-divide/	The day before the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Sonia Sotomayor began, Sen. Jon Kyl said President Barack Obama's nominee was losing the support of the American public. "It's interesting that I just reviewed the Rasmussen poll, most recent poll about American public opinion about Judge Sotomayor. They oppose her confirmation. Only 37 percent support it," the Arizona Republican said during an appearance on This Week with George Stephanopolous. Stephanopolous seemed surprised by that, and said he wasn't familiar with the poll. We wanted to check the poll for ourselves and see what it said. The Rasmussen Reports poll was conducted June 29-30, 2009, and was a national survey of 1,000 likely voters. The poll asked this question: "The United States Senate has the constitutional authority to confirm all Supreme Court nominees. Based upon what you know at this time, should the United States confirm Sonia Sotomayor as a Supreme Court Justice?" The results were very close. Thirty-seven percent said yes, the Senate should confirm, 39 percent said no, and 23 percent said "not sure." And it's important to note that the margin of error on the poll was 3 percentage points. So the 37-39 split is within the margin of error, and could be considered a statistical tie. As a side note, the same poll showed that most respondents expected Sotomayor to be confirmed, with 58 percent saying it was "very likely" and another 26 percent saying it was "somewhat likely." And a Gallup poll, conducted after the Rasmussen poll but released the day after Kyl made his remarks, found that 53 percent favored Sotomayor's nomination, with 33 percent opposed and 13 percent having no opinion. Kyl specifically cited the Rasmussen poll, though, and he got the number who favored confirmation right. But his comment leaves the impression that a solid majority opposes Sotomayor's nomination. Sotomayor fans could use the same data to say that "only" 39 percent oppose her nomination. In fact, the polling data reads more like a tie, with a significant percentage of people not having a firm opinion. We rate Kyl's statement Half True.

pomt-03316	"U.S. Department of Homeland Security has told banks -- in writing -- it may inspect safe deposit boxes without warrant and seize any gold, silver, guns or other valuables it finds inside those boxes!"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/26/chain-email/homeland-security-can-seize-safe-deposit-boxes-wit/	Nothing screams Internet credibility quite like an entire paragraph in all caps, alternating text background colors and no fewer than five question marks in an email subject line. We recently received such a chain email insisting that bank safe deposit boxes merely let people "entertain the illusion of safety." (If anyone can persuade you to take your valuables out of the bank and stuff them in your mattress, please don’t let it be a stranger who just can’t figure out that caps lock key.) Different versions of a chain email about the U.S. Department of Homeland Security seizing safe deposit box contents have been circulating through inboxes and on websites since 2006, and as recently as this month. The message sent to PolitiFact read: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HAS TOLD BANKS -- IN WRITING -- IT MAY INSPECT SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES WITHOUT WARRANT AND SEIZE ANY GOLD, SILVER, GUNS OR OTHER VALUABLES IT FINDS INSIDE THOSE BOXES! According to in-house memos now circulating, the DHS has issued orders to banks across America which announce to them that "under the Patriot Act" the DHS has the absolute right to seize, without any warrant whatsoever, any and all customer bank accounts, to make "periodic and unannounced" visits to any bank to open and inspect the contents of "selected safe deposit boxes." Further, the DHS "shall, at the discretion of the agent supervising the search, remove, photograph or seize as evidence" any of the following items "bar gold, gold coins, firearms of any kind unless manufactured prior to 1878, documents such as passports or foreign bank account records, pornography or any material that, in the opinion of the agent, shall be deemed of to be of a contraband nature. This raises the question: Who keeps their porn in a bank safe deposit box? But porn aside, there was a lot to check out here. We contacted David McGuinn, president of Safe Deposit Specialists, a financial consulting firm that offers training, products and services to the financial industry. He told us he was flooded with phone calls when this claim resurfaced in 2013. He attributes it to the Cyprus financial crisis earlier this year. The small Mediterranean country had been in severe recession since 2009, and a banking crisis led to a rescue package from the European Central Bank. The terms of the bailout left the government desperate for cash, so officials announced in March that they would seize a portion of savers’ assets. That’s when people started warning that something similar could happen in the United States, and the chain email started circulating again, McGuinn told us. "There’s no truth to that at all," he said. The Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs are groups McGuinn listed as potential officials who could force open a box with a search and seizure notice. McGuinn said this process doesn’t occur frequently. And when officials do open safe deposit boxes, there are safeguards in place. Rob Rowe, vice president with the American Bankers Association, explained that good cause must be proven in order for the Patriot Act to be used to open a safe deposit box, which is private property. The email in question cited the Patriot Act as the reason the DHS can seize this property, but Rowe said that isn’t the case. Also, DHS officials wouldn’t be able to open up boxes without bank officials present, he said. "The only way to open the box without the renter’s key is to drill the lock. If and when a box is drilled, standard bank operating procedures require dual control – the presence of two officers – and many jurisdictions also require that the locksmith who drills the box to be specially licensed or certified," Rowe said. When we contacted Homeland Security about the issue, an official cited the Fourth Amendment, explaining that searches and seizures by the department may only take place with probable cause and a court-ordered warrant. Our ruling Various chain emails over the past seven years have warned readers about the possibility of Homeland Security seizing items like gold, silver and guns from their safe deposit boxes at the bank. This isn’t possible without first obtaining a search warrant, since those boxes are private property. And banking officials told us random seizures just aren’t happening.

pomt-09073	Gov. Rick Perry broke his promise that he would not accept a $40,000 pay increase.	/texas/statements/2010/jun/27/bill-white/bill-white-says-perry-said-he-wouldnt-take-pay-rai/	Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, lashed out at his GOP rival, Gov. Rick Perry, over his state-paid salary during a June 17 news conference, suggesting Perry had gone back on his word not to accept a five-figure raise. “Several years ago, he signed a law giving himself a $40,000 pay increase,” White said. “He told you, the people in the press, that he wasn’t going to take that pay increase. I don’t think he kept that promise.” We decided to review White’s left-right-left combination. In response to our inquiry, White’s campaign pointed us to Perry’s tax returns, newspaper articles and actions taken by the Texas Legislature in 2007. That year, lawmakers included raises for eight top officials, including the governor, in the budget bill for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, according to a Dallas Morning News article published June 7, 2007. Perry signed the legislation into law June 15, 2007, according to information from the Legislature’s Web site. In the law, the governor’s annual salary was set to jump 30 percent, from $115,345 to $150,000 -- an increase of $34,655, which is less than the $40,000 that White quoted. Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, told us when we inquired that White overstated the size of the raise at his recent press conference and “should have said about $35,000.” White’s campaign pointed us to news articles indicating Perry wouldn’t take the raise. Robert Black, then a spokesman for the governor, was quoted in the June 2007 Morning News article saying Perry would not accept the pay raise when it kicked in that September, the start of the state’s fiscal year: “He hasn’t taken a pay raise and doesn’t think it’s necessary.” A Fort Worth Star Telegram news article published June 8, 2007, quoted Black as saying that “we asked them [lawmakers] to give the governor an opt-out provision, and they did that.” A clause in the 2008-09 budget titled “Governor’s Salary Authorization” says the governor can set his salary “at any amount below the listed authorization” — in this case, $150,000. Perry’s office confirmed that he has not exercised the opt-out provision since his raise became law. We didn’t find statements from Perry or his aides to the effect that instead of refusing the pay increase, the governor would donate it to charity. Yet Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger wrote us in an e-mail: “The governor did not seek a pay raise, but the Texas Legislature authorized an increase from $115,000 to $150,000 in 2007 and 2009. Since that time, he has only taken home about $115,000 each fiscal year and has donated the rest to charity.” Perry’s take-home state pay -- meaning wages subject to federal income taxes -- increased from $103,320 in 2006 to $111,361 in 2007 and $135,925 in 2008, according to his tax returns for those years, which he has made public. Bob Martin, a Houston accountant who studied Perry’s tax returns at the request of an Associated Press reporter, told us the amount of taxes that were withheld from Perry’s pay in 2008 indicated that his gross salary was $150,000. He speculated that the difference between Perry’s taxable wages and his gross salary could be explained by pre-tax deductions such as retirement contributions; such deductions would be on Perry’s W-2 form. We found no sign of Perry making his W-2s public. In an Aug. 27, 2009 article, the Morning News reported that in 2008, Perry took “the almost $30,000 raise provided to him by the Legislature” and spread it among the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, the March of Dimes and “a foundation that provides aid to families of fallen veterans.” Perry’s 2008 tax return shows gifts of $9,996 each to the March of Dimes, the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, and the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, where Perry’s wife, Anita, works. The governor filed an extension on his 2009 tax return, so details on more recent charitable donations and take-home pay are not yet available. The White campaign says its examination of Perry’s available tax returns for the years he’s been governor found that Perry has not yet given the full amount of his pay increase to charity. The campaign did two different calculations: First, it compared the increase in Perry’s taxable state-paid income in 2007 and 2008 (about $40,000) with his total charitable gifts during the same time ($38,399). Second, it compared the increase in Perry’s gross state salary ($46,206) with the donations ($38,399). Cesinger later said the governor had “contributed an additional $8,668 in 2008 to the State Employee Charitable Campaign that was not claimed as a deduction on his tax return.” A gift of that amount would close the gap cited by the White campaign. All in all, does White land his three-part punch? He errs on the size of the raise. While Perry didn’t personally tell the media he wouldn’t take the raise, a gubernatorial spokesman speaking on his behalf was quoted in newspaper articles as saying so. Perry’s spokeswoman told us he’s made charitable donations exceeding the additional dollars that came his way in the raise. But that’s not the same as not accepting the raise in the first place. Nor has Perry used the opt-out provision put into the law to allow him to do so. We rate White’s statement as Mostly True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-06-27T06:00:00	2010-06-17	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-05690	Says Wisconsin Assembly Republicans voted to repeal a law that ensures "that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/12/cory-mason/wisconsin-gop-bill-would-repeal-law-ensuring-pay-e/	A bill awaiting action by Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker would take away the right of discriminated workers to sue employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. The GOP-sponsored bill would reverse a right to sue granted in a 2009 law approved when Democrats controlled state government. It covers many types of discrimination, including age and race. But in criticizing his Republican colleagues for approving the new bill, state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, issued a news release on Feb. 23, 2012 that focused on women. He said the bill would repeal a law that ensures "that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job." There’s no debate that the bill would repeal the right to sue contained in the 2009 law. But would it also affect working women the way Mason says? To explore how employment discrimination cases work, we spoke with two employment law experts, Milwaukee lawyers Jeff Hynes, who represents workers, and Scott Beightol, who defends employers. There are two routes to filing an employment discrimination complaint: the state Equal Rights Division and the federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. If workers prove discrimination using the state system, an administrative law judge can "make them whole" by ordering the employer to pay back pay with interest, legal fees and job reinstatement, if there was a termination. If the discrimination is proved in the federal system, often a "make whole" settlement is reached through mediation. In either system, discriminated workers can collect larger sums of money from an employer -- compensatory and punitive damages -- only by suing. A federal lawsuit has long been an option, but suing employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages only became possible with the 2009 law adopted by the Democrats. That law is new enough, and discrimination cases take long enough to process, that no such state lawsuits have yet been filed. Under the current law, if such lawsuits are brought in state court, workers could collect as much as $300,000 in damages, depending on the employer’s size. (The employer must have at least 15 employees.) Supporters of the 2009 law said at the time it was needed to enforce laws that require men and women to be paid equally and to deter employers from committing discrimination. Opponents said the law creates an unnecessary burden on businesses when workers already had legal avenues to collect damages for suffering discrimination. Fast-forward to the GOP bill, promoted as a pro-business measure, that Walker’s spokesman said the governor is reviewing. Would it, as Mason claims, repeal a law that ensures "that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job"? Mason argues the law ensures equal pay for women because filing lawsuits is the major way of enforcing civil rights laws. The threat of being sued in state court makes employers less likely to discriminate against workers, which also helps ensure pay equity, he added. But ensuring the right to sue in state court, as the law does, is not the same as ensuring pay equity. Mason also said there is an indication the "pay gap" between men and women in Wisconsin has decreased since the 2009 law took effect. He cited a 2009 study and a 2010 study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equity for women and girls. Using median annual earnings for full-time workers, the studies found that Wisconsin women earned 75 percent of what men did in 2009, ranking the state 37th; and 78 percent in 2010, ranking the state 25th. Mason acknowledged, however, that the studies aren’t proof that the law caused the decrease in the pay gap. More importantly, the studies were an overview of pay -- they didn’t examine pay for women and men who do the same job, which is what Mason’s claim addressed. What about the experts? Hynes said the 2009 law deters discrimination because it is easier and less expensive to bring a workplace discrimination suit in state court than in federal court. If the GOP bill becomes law, he said, it would be harder for discriminated workers to collect damages and therefore harder to enforce laws prohibiting unequal pay. Beightol disagreed that the federal system is more onerous and argued that discriminated workers have the same remedies available through federal court that they do in state court. He also made the point that no lawsuits have been filed in state court since the 2009 law took effect. Our rating Mason said Wisconsin Assembly Republicans approved a bill to repeal a law that ensures "that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job." The law does not ensure pay equity, but rather gives discriminated workers the right to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. So, if the GOP-backed bill is signed into law, that right to sue would be lost. But discriminated workers would still be able to seek back pay and other "make whole" payments through government agencies, and they could still sue for compensatory and punitive damages in federal court. Mason’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-05091	As Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney used a line-item veto to cut "millions of dollars for firefighting equipment," including firefighters' "coats, pants, helmets and boots."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/01/mahlon-mitchell/romney-cut-millions-firefighter-gear-wisconsin-dem/	A political product of the mass demonstrations against Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in early 2011, Democrat Mahlon Mitchell lost his electoral debut in the state’s historic recall elections on June 5, 2012. But three days later, Mitchell -- defeated 53 percent to 47 percent by GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch -- was hailed as a rising star at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention. So it wasn’t surprising that Mitchell was among those chosen to criticize Republican Mitt Romney ahead of the presumptive presidential nominee’s June 18, 2012 visit to Wisconsin. Mitchell’s line of attack: As Massachusetts governor, Romney cut millions for firefighters’ equipment. It carried extra weight because Mitchell is head of the Wisconsin firefighter union. On June 12, 2012, Romney claimed that President Barack Obama wants to add more government jobs and said the nation doesn’t "need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers." The same day, the Wisconsin Democratic Party issued a news release in response, quoting Mitchell and a national Democratic Party spokesman. Mitchell claimed in the release that Romney used a line-item veto to cut "millions of dollars for firefighting equipment," including firefighters' "coats, pants, helmets and boots." His claim was similar to one made a day earlier by an Obama campaign official and another made days later by Vice President Joe Biden. Is Mitchell right? Mitchell’s evidence Asked for evidence, Mitchell referred us to Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama's re-election campaign in Wisconsin. She cited a July 2006 veto Romney issued for line item 8000-0050 in Massachusetts’ 2007 budget, his last during his single four-year term as governor. The item, which was restored by the legislature, provided for $2.5 million in grants to local fire departments for firefighting equipment that would "include, but is not limited to, turnout gear." Turnout gear, said Edward Kelly, Mitchell’s counterpart with the Massachusetts firefighters union, generally includes a firefighter’s coat and pants. That’s also how turnout gear is described by the National Fire Protection Association. But Kelly said turnout gear could also be interpreted to include a helmet and boots. And in any case, the line item allowed local governments to spend the grant money on any type of fire safety equipment. Other views For context, we wondered whether Romney’s veto was indicative of his treatment of fire departments and firefighters when he was governor. Kelly said Romney cut aid to local governments, which resulted in cuts in fire department funding and led to firefighter layoffs. A February 2012 Boston Globe article also mentioned the aid cuts in recounting how, as governor, "Romney fiercely protected a costly and controversial perk for police officers after seeking and receiving the endorsement of the politically influential police unions." We also contacted Jim Stergios, executive director of the Pioneer Institute, a Boston think tank that values "free market principles, individual liberty and responsibility, and the ideal of effective, limited and accountable government." He said the Romney administration generally "limited grant programs to municipalities because their view was that such programs represented a relatively unaccountable entry into local affairs." "There was also a political principle at work," Stergios said in an email. "Resist the usual small, targeted grants to local constituencies because they opened up all kinds of political fights among those constituencies (the firefighters got a grant, so shouldn't the police officers?) and localities (Bourne, Lawrence, and Worcester all wanted grants for fire stations, why shouldn't other communities?)." We asked Romney’s campaign for a response to Mitchell’s claim. Spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger provided a video clip of comments Romney gave in response to an interview question about his statement that the nation didn’t need more firefighters. That had nothing to do with Mitchell’s claim, so we emailed Brandenburger again, but got no reply. Our rating Mitchell said that as Massachusetts governor, Romney used a line-item veto to cut "millions of dollars for firefighting equipment," including firefighters' "coats, pants, helmets and boots." In 2006, Romney vetoed $2.5 million in grants for all types of fire safety equipment, including those Mitchell cited. We rate Mitchell’s statement True.

pomt-08736	"When career politician Daniel Webster became speaker of the House, he wasted $32,000 of our money on a spiral staircase for his office."	/florida/statements/2010/aug/31/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-attacks-daniel-websters-stairway-nowh/	Central Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is digging on some 1970s Led Zeppelin in his first ad attacking Republican opponent Daniel Webster. The ad is called "Dan Webster's Stairway to Nowhere." See where this is going, Zeppelin fans? It opens with someone ripping off Jimmy Page's recognizable guitar introduction to "Stairway to Heaven." A narrator talks over a black-and-white image of Webster, a longtime state legislator and former House speaker. "When career politician Daniel Webster became speaker of the House, he wasted $32,000 of our money on a spiral staircase for his office," the narrator says, before moving on to a claim that he used tax money for private flights. The ad then finishes with a spin off of Robert Plant's vocals. "And he's charged us for a stairway to nowhere." To be honest, it's a pretty poor rendition. But we're PolitiFact Florida, not American Idol, so we'll stick to the factual claims in the ad -- specifically about the stairwell. Stepping stones to the staircase Webster was elected to the state House in 1980. In 1996, he became the first Republican state House speaker in more than 100 years after the GOP seized power. That also put him in charge of improvements and renovations to House offices and facilities. Each new speaker traditionally has made changes, upgrades, or renovations. In 1999, Speaker John Thrasher, now a state senator and chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, approved nearly $7 million for the House chamber -- now adorned in mahogany -- the Speaker's Office, and House office building. In 2002, leaders of the House and Senate spent about $1.5 million on furniture, structural changes, even a private bathroom. On the other hand, former Speaker Allan Bense spent only about $1,500 on changes in 2004, according to the St. Petersburg Times. According to newspaper accounts Webster spent about $100,000 in taxpayer dollars on improvements to House facilities in his first months as speaker, including $31,983 on a spiral staircase. The staircase connected the Republican Majority Office on the Capitol's third floor with the Speaker's Office above it on the fourth floor. The staircase was intended to make it easier to move back and forth between the two offices -- namely, it allowed legislators and Webster as speaker to avoid walking through the public hallways filled with lobbyists, reporters and members of the public. The staircase "will allow us to better coordinate things between the Speaker's Office and the Majority Office," Webster said at the time. He also noted that he took the idea from Democrats, who previously had drawn up plans for a spiral staircase of their own. It was built in a spiral style because it was the only way it could work given the space. The Grayson ad includes an image of an elaborate white spiral staircase to help make its point about Webster. But that's not the Webster staircase, said Todd Reid, staff director for the Florida House Majority Office. The staircase was closed off in 2006 during more than $500,000 of renovations ordered by then-Speaker Marco Rubio. The stairway's fourth-floor landing became the new offices of the speaker's chief of staff. "It was a standard black metal staircase," Reid said. "It certainly wasn't heavy on the accouterments." Reid described the staircase as noisy and said whenever someone walked up or down it, people could hear the staircase rattling from both offices. He said the bottom half of the staircase remains in place; a closet was built around it. "If you were in Tallahassee, I'd take you in to see it," Reid told PolitiFact Florida. Your humble fact-checker didn't have time to jump in a car for the five-hour trip to Tallahassee, but we were able to send the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald's Lee Logan for an exclusive tour. Cribs: Staircase to Nowhere-edition Logan filed the following report, complete with a picture. Behind a door labeled "No Entry" in the House Majority Office is the famed Webster staircase. The small closet without lights is used so rarely that Reid had to hunt down someone in the House Sergeant at Arms office to get a key to the door. The bottom half of the black spiral staircase is still bolted to the floor. (Stairs are simple black metal, with a black metal railing.) Pieces of the top half are also in the closet, including a large piece that rests on top of the lower portion. The ceiling of the closet is now covered over with concrete, forming the floor of the chief of staff's office on the fourth floor. Reid says it's unlikely the stairway would be re-installed because the fourth floor spot is "prime real estate" -- now the House speaker and his chief of staff have direct access to one another through a door. Before Rubio made the space into the chief of staff's office, the staircase came up through a hole in the floor and emptied into a common area that also housed a few supplies. Reid said the closet could be used for supplies if the stairs were removed. But he speculated that they weren't taken out because they're simply too big. Also, a speaker sometime in the future might find a use for the stairs. The stairs were used "irregularly," Reid said, usually on peak days when the Capitol was crowded. He also recalled former Gov. Jeb Bush occasionally using the stairs. Currently, if a staffer (not Joe Public) wanted to go from the Majority Office to the Speaker's Office, he or she could go up a back stairwell and cut through the Member's Lounge, which requires a key card and is reserved for lawmakers. Speaker Larry Cretul has said staffers can cut through the area if they don't loiter or disturb the lawmakers. Our ruling Grayson's ad is unintentionally ironic in that Webster's "stairway to nowhere" actually now is a stairway to nowhere, as it's bolted to the ground of a seldom-used closet. The stairway leads to a concrete ceiling, which now serves as the floor of an office above. Those changes were made by Marco Rubio in 2006. The stairs haven't been used since then. But that's not how Webster left it. When he became speaker in 1996, Webster did what most every speaker has done in recent times -- he spent taxpayer money on House renovations. The amount has varied wildly over the years depending on the size of the renovation. Among the $100,000 or so Webster spent, he allocated just under $32,000 for a plain spiral staircase to internally link the Speaker's Office with the House Republican Offices below. While Grayson's ad is correct on the reported dollar amount and the type of staircase, we think it's slightly misleading for two reasons. First, the imagery displayed suggests an ornate staircase when the staircase is far from ornate and only a spiral staircase by necessity. Second, it fails to provide the context that most every speaker spends taxpayer dollars on renovations, and several spent more than Webster. We rate the claim Mostly True. Now cue the Led Zeppelin ... (Update Sept. 1: We reached out to the Webster campaign before publishing this story via phone and e-mail, but did not hear back. After publication, Webster spokesman Brian Graham said in an e-mail that the staircase actually cost less than published reports. The original construction contract was for $28,126. The state paid even less, $22,242, Graham said). (Update Sept. 3: We noticed that the Grayson ad has been removed from his You Tube web page. We're not sure why).

pomt-14355	Superdelegates "have never been a determining factor in who our nominee is since they've been in place since 1984."	/florida/statements/2016/mar/22/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-superdelegates-never/	Bernie Sanders is far behind Hillary Clinton in the delegate count toward the Democratic presidential nomination, but part of his strategy is to hold out hope that superdelegates will back him at the convention. What are superdelegates? They’re roughly 700 party officials and other high-profile Democrats who get to vote on nominees at the convention. In theory, they could swing a tight race to one candidate or another. The vast majority of superdelegates have said they will back Clinton, according to news reports. But Sanders has suggested that in states where he won by double-digit margins, superdelegates should vote according to the wishes of people in their states. That led to Fox Business News’ Maria Bartiromo asking Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her take on superdelegates. Wasserman Schultz countered that superdelegates aren’t so powerful, according to history. "The purpose of superdelegates -- which by the way, have never been a determining factor in who our nominee is since they've been in place since 1984 -- is to make sure that party activists who want to be delegates to the convention don’t have to run against much better-known and well-established people at the district level," said the South Florida congresswoman. Have superdelegates not mattered since they were introduced in 1984? It’s clear that in elections after 1984 they were never needed to settle a nomination. However, they did play a role in 1984, although experts are conflicted about the extent of their power. Superdelegates started in 1984 Under the Democratic Party’s system, slightly more than 700 party officials and big shots get a vote as a superdelegate. That’s about one-third of the 2,383 delegates needed to secure the nomination, or about 15 percent of the total delegates. While pledged delegates vote for the candidate they were elected on behalf of, the superdelegates can vote for whomever they want at the convention. The superdelegate system was added in the 1980s after the Democratic party suffered huge losses with George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter’s failed re-election bid in 1980. The party wanted to come up with new ideas, with hopes of primaries resulting in candidates who were more likely to win general elections. A commission was formed and proposed a few reforms, including the superdelegates. The best example of when superdelegates played a role was the first year they started: former Vice President Walter Mondale’s nomination in 1984. (Ironically, the superdelegate system didn’t guarantee the results the party hoped for, because Mondale got crushed by Ronald Reagan in the general election.) Experts disagree how much credit superdelegates should get toward Mondale winning the nomination. Here is a quick snapshot: Entering the final handful primaries on June 5, 1984, Mondale was leading Sen. Gary Hart in the delegate count, with Jesse Jackson far behind. The battle for delegates became more dramatic that night when Hart won three primaries -- including the big prize of California in a cliffhanger. The Mondale campaign said -- and some news reports agreed -- that Mondale secured the needed 1,967 delegates that night in spite of losing California. But the Associated Press concluded he was "barely short of the magic majority." Mondale wanted to make it indisputable that he had enough votes -- and his campaign set a deadline of one minute before noon. So he made 50 calls in three hours to nail down an additional 40 superdelegates and declared at a press conference that he had 2,008 votes. At the convention in July, Mondale won on the first ballot. Sean Bartlett, a spokesman for the DNC, argued that Mondale won the nomination with pledged delegates, although he said that "superdelegates came close to being decisive." Bartlett pointed to a February 2016 article in The New Republic which stated that while superdelegates preferred Mondale, he "ultimately won a plurality of delegates. So while superdelegates put him over the top, he was also the narrow choice of the voters." Priscilla Southwell -- a professor at the University of Oregon who wrote an article about the 1984 Democratic nomination -- told PolitiFact Florida that she disagreed with Wasserman Schultz’s conclusion that superdelegates have never been a determining factor. "I agree that Mondale had a plurality of pledged delegates, but he did not have enough delegates to clinch the nomination on the first round without the superdelegates. So, if the superdelegates had not been there in 1984, there would have had to be a second roll call of the states, and who knows who would emerged as the nominee?" But Elaine C. Kamarck, who was in charge of counting delegates for Mondale, told PolitiFact Florida that Mondale could have won on pledged delegates alone. "It wasn’t that there weren’t enough -- the California primary came up short for him, so he didn’t get the magic number. There were plenty of delegates without the superdelegates to go over the top," she said. "I’d say they were very helpful in helping him get the nomination, but he would have gotten the nomination even without that burst in the end, because there were enough random uncommitted delegates that he could have done it." (Uncommitted delegates are similar to superdelegates in that they can make up their mind at the convention. But superdelegates hold that position by virtue of their office -- for example, the president is one.) Kamarck, who worked in Bill Clinton’s White House, is a superdelegate who plans to vote for Hillary Clinton and is a lecturer at Harvard. In subsequent elections, a Democratic candidate had enough delegates early on so that the superdelegates were essentially irrelevant. In 2008, Clinton led Barack Obama in the superdelegate count in January but he overtook her by May. She suspended her campaign in June a couple months before the convention. Super delegates in 2016 So could superdelegates make a difference this year? It’s too soon to say for certain, but it appears unlikely. The blog fivethirtyeight determined in February that "superdelegates are mathematically relevant when a candidate has 41.2 percent to 58.8 percent of elected delegates." As of March 22, if we count pledged delegates Clinton has about 48 percent of the needed 2,383 delegates to win, while Sanders has 35 percent. Julia Azari, professor of political science at Marquette University, told NPR that superdelegates would only make a difference if it’s close. "I think the only chance a superdelegate will make a difference is if there isn’t really an obvious preference coming out of the electorate part of the process." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz says superdelegates "have never been a determining factor in who our nominee is since they've been in place since 1984." The first election where Democrats used superdelegates was in 1984, where they helped Mondale secure the nomination on the first ballot at the convention. It’s not clear that they were the "determining" factor. Some say Mondale would have won without them. Since that time, a Democrat has won the nomination early enough where the superdelegates haven’t mattered. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e8147839-ca9d-483d-8aaa-408bc24a627a	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2016-03-22T17:37:52	2016-03-21	['None']
pomt-03010	"Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/15/louise-slaughter/rep-louise-slaughter-says-80-antibiotics-are-fed-l/	A salmonella outbreak traced to California chicken processing plants recently prompted Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., to raise a pet issue on MSNBC: antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The federal shutdown was limiting government’s ability to track infection, she said. But then she pointed to a deeper issue: "the overuse and ruination of antibiotics." An advocate for tougher requirements for farm use of such drugs, Slaughter told host Joy-Ann Reid that she’s been "trying to save antibiotics for persons — for human beings." "Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock every single day, and it's creating a terrible problem of resistant bacteria," she said. Eighty percent is an awfully big number, and we were curious: Do livestock consume the bulk of the nation’s antimicrobial drugs? It’s an important question, because according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wide use of antibiotics in food-producing animals "contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food-producing animals." Emergence of resistant bacteria means if you get infected with bacteria from the food you eat, it might be harder to fight that infection with antibiotics. Drug resistance may be contributing to higher hospitalization rates in the recent salmonella outbreak, for example, the Los Angeles Times reported. Here’s how it works, according to the CDC: Ranchers give animals antibiotics, which kills off or suppresses susceptible bacteria, but allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to thrive. Those resistant bacteria may be transmitted to people through the food supply, such as by eating undercooked salmonella-tainted chicken. Since the bacteria are resistant to some antibiotics, the infections may be harder to fight, causing "adverse human health consequences." So CDC "encourages and supports efforts to minimize inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans and animals." You’re probably aware of this effort in humans — it’s why doctors are discouraged from giving their patients antibiotics to treat nonbacterial infections such as cold and flu. Widespread use of antibiotics when they’re not required helps bacteria develop defenses to the drugs in a sort of microscopic arms race. It’s also the reason the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asked farmers to phase out certain antibiotics important to human medicine when used merely to promote growth in animals. (The industry says this accounts for a small amount of antibiotic use. The FDA says it’s hard to say.) So, back to the 80 percent number. It turns out it has been a popular talking point since 2010 among those who advocate for restricting use of antibiotics on farms. That’s the year the FDA released newly required data on sales of antibiotics by manufacturers for food-producing animals. The FDA didn’t release sales information on antibiotics for human use, but pointed to national projections from IMS Health, a Connecticut company that compiles proprietary health data. The numbers let folks compare the millions of kilograms of drugs sold by manufacturers for use by food-producing animals (13.1 million kilograms) in 2009 with those sold for use by people (3.3 million kilograms). The 13.1 million kilograms of antibiotics sold for animals was 80 percent of the total amount of drugs sold for both humans and animals, which was 16.4 million kilograms. We should note this comparison doesn’t account for all antibiotics sold in the United States. For example, it doesn’t count antibiotics sold for household pets. A researcher with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health’s Center for a Livable Future first did the math for a 2010 blog post that’s been widely cited. (The most recent reports reveal a similar proportion, as calculated by the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming.) Pharmaceutical company lobby groups such as the Animal Health Institute, though, have cried foul. It says the number is "wrong and misleading, for several reasons," and cites the FDA. The FDA has indeed offered a "caution regarding comparisons of human and animal antibacterial drug sales data." It repeated some of those cautions in a 2012 letter to Slaughter herself. But while it offers a series of caveats about drawing "definite conclusions" from "direct comparisons" about the drug sales data — such as differences in dosages between different drugs and in the sizes of human and animal populations — it confirms both sets of sales data essentially measure the same thing. Both show the volume of antibacterial drugs, by weight, being sold to various outlets from the manufacturer. So, while they don’t offer a direct estimate of human or animal use, they do offer a comparison of sales by manufacturers for both groups. In 2011, the FDA provided the IMS Health sales estimates directly to Slaughter, describing the sales numbers as "a surrogate for human use to compare to antibacterial drug use in animals." We should note that about a third of the antibiotics used in food-producing animals are ionophores, a type not used in humans. (The agriculture industry argues this means they have nothing to do with antibiotic resistance in humans; Lawrence at Johns Hopkins says they may still contribute.) If you remove ionophores from the sales data comparison, the proportion of antibiotics that go to food-producing animals vs. humans drops to around 70 percent. There are also also plenty of limits, as the FDA points out, on the usefulness of the publicly released sales data to inform public policy on antibiotics on farms. They don’t illuminate the reasons animals get the drugs (to promote growth? to treat infection? both?). They don’t specify how the antibiotics are administered (injection? food?). The FDA’s asking for comments on how it might release more of the information it collects from animal drug companies, and says it will update reports from previous years with that new data. That might include, for example, a detail it confirmed to Slaughter’s office in a 2011 letter — that nearly all antibiotics reported for animal use to the FDA were delivered in food and water, as opposed to by injection. Meanwhile, the industry uses the current lack of detail to downplay the usefulness of the statistic, even as it fights efforts to gather and release more information. Sales data is "not at all useful for understanding the benefits or the risks of using antibiotics to keep animals healthy," Ron Phillips of the Animal Health Institute told PolitiFact. Others disagree and argue that the data is actually quite revealing. "There is some uncertainty in these data, but not enough to escape the fact that the vast majority of antibiotics in this country are used in food animals, not to treat sick people," wrote Robert Lawrence, a doctor who directs the Center for a Livable Future at Johns Hopkins. Slaughter, meanwhile, is sponsoring two bills, the Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act and the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, to require more detailed monitoring and to limit the use of antibiotics to sick animals. Among those lobbying against both: the Animal Health Institute. Our ruling Slaughter said "80 percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock." The statistic comes from a comparison of FDA sales data for food-producing animals and private sales data for humans since 2009 — not all antibiotics sold in the United States. A letter from the FDA to the congresswoman confirms that most of the drugs for livestock are consumed in food and water. That means the percentage "fed" to animals may not be quite as high as 80 percent, though it would be close. Slaughter could have said more clearly that of all the antibiotics sold for use by people and livestock, 80 percent are for animals. But she was close. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-09631	"President Obama has broken his pledge to the American people to be transparent throughout (health care reform negotiations)."	/florida/statements/2010/jan/05/charlie-crist/gov-charlie-crist-says-obama-breaks-transparency-p/	Don't mess with Charlie Crist when it comes to open government. It was Crist, as Florida governor, who created something called the Office for Open Government. And we've heard stories of the governor himself ordering agency heads to hand over public records requested by nosy reporters. Now Crist is taking up the cause of the nation's people in a debate over transparency when it comes to the health care reform bill. "It seems that a bill that was crafted in a closed-door, backroom meeting in the White House will end the same way," Crist, who is running for U.S. Senate, said in a statement released Jan. 5, 2010. "President Obama has broken his pledge to the American people to be transparent throughout this process, and (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid and (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi have only aided in the secrecy with sweetheart deals and dead of the night votes." Crist is claiming that Obama broke a promise when it comes to transparency and health care reform. Lucky for us, we have this thing at PolitiFact called the Obameter , where we are tracking Obama's more than 500 campaign promises. If you'll now turn to Promise No. 517 . To achieve health care reform, Obama said in August 2008, "I'm going to have all the negotiations around a big table. We'll have doctors and nurses and hospital administrators. Insurance companies, drug companies -- they'll get a seat at the table, they just won't be able to buy every chair. But what we will do is, we'll have the negotiations televised on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is making arguments on behalf of their constituents, and who are making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies. And so, that approach, I think is what is going to allow people to stay involved in this process." If it only happened ... While the Senate and House floor debates have been televised on C-SPAN, negotiations have almost always been away from television cameras. ABC's Jake Tapper put the discrepancy in front of White House press secretary Robert Gibbs this week, to see if the final negotiations between the House, the Senate and the president would be televised. "There have been a countless number of public hearings," Gibbs said. "The Senate did a lot of their voting at 1 and 2 in the morning on C-SPAN ... I think what the president promised and pledged was so that you could see who was fighting for their constituents and who was fighting for drug and insurance companies." But, Tapper pressed, the president was talking about negotiations, not votes -- which would hardly be a campaign promise since they would have been televised regardless. "Well, but the bill gets put together on the floor of the Senate," Gibbs said. "That's where the bill got augmented. And I think if you watched that debate ... you'd have seen quite a bit of public hearing and public airing." Despite the action on the House and Senate floors, most of the serious negotiations on the health care bill have been done in the same fashion as other major initiatives in the past -- behind closed doors. From negotiations with the drug companies and health care interests to final assembly of the delicate compromise on abortion, the bulk of the big deliberations and discussions have occurred out of the public eye. The debate over the resulting bill may have been on C-SPAN as Gibbs claims, but the real sausagemaking took place in a private kitchen. That's why we rated No. 517 a Promise Broken. On top of that, C-SPAN CEO Brian Lamb wrote to House and Senate leaders last week inviting negotiations on the channel. "President Obama, Senate and House leaders, many of your rank-and-file members, and the nation’s editorial pages have all talked about the value of transparent discussions on reforming the nation’s health care system," Lamb wrote. "Now that the process moves to the critical stage of reconciliation between the Chambers, we respectfully request that you allow the public full access, through television, to legislation that will affect the lives of every single American." Obama promised an end to closed-door negotiations and complete openness for the health care talks. But he has failed to deliver. When Crist says "President Obama has broken his pledge to the American people to be transparent throughout this process," he's right. We rate Crist's claim True.

pomt-02178	Dan Patrick "got caught not paying his taxes" and "pocketed his employees’ payroll taxes."	/texas/statements/2014/apr/28/david-dewhurst/ad-distorts-dan-patricks-unpaid-taxes-1980s/	David Dewhurst says the Republican who led him in the March 2014 primary for the party’s lieutenant governor nomination has a financially shaky background. Dewhurst, lieutenant governor since 2003, faces challenger Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, in a May 27, 2014, primary runoff. In Dewhurst's video ad that came public April 16, 2014, the narrator said Patrick "got caught not paying his taxes" and "pocketed his employees’ payroll taxes." In the ad, those claims are prefaced by an excerpt from a lieutenant governor debate in which a reporter said Patrick had walked away from more than $800,000 in debts when he declared personal bankruptcy. Patrick’s bankruptcy filing has been covered before. But did he get caught not paying taxes and also pocket employee payroll taxes? Backup from news story, tax liens Via the Quorum Report, a Capitol newsletter, we came to a Dewhurst web page on his ad attributing most of what he said to a Sept. 19, 2013, Dallas Morning News story on Patrick’s financial troubles. According to the News' story, Patrick filed for bankruptcy in October 1986 under his birth name, Dannie Scott Goeb, and "walked away from about $800,000 in debts." The story said that years later, he legally changed his name to Dan Patrick. The bankruptcy was connected to a failed business venture. According to a January 2007 Texas Monthly story, Patrick and others in the 1980s had "opened Dan and Nick’s Sportsmarket, one of the first sports bars in the U.S. Located in tony Rice Village, the combination bar and restaurant was all polished brass and fine woods, full of local jocks and celebrities, TVs tuned constantly to sporting events. (Too constantly: The NFL would sue Patrick and five other bar owners in 1987 for showing blacked-out games.) For a while the business thrived, largely on the strength of Patrick’s personality," the story said, "but he soon fell prey to the same financial lunacy that infected so many Houstonians in the early eighties. He bought another bar and restaurant, and then another, expanding, finally, to five. Then the oil bust hit, and in short order the man who had made $100,000 as a sportscaster closed four of his businesses, declared bankruptcy, and watched his annual income plummet to $10,000." Payroll taxes unpaid When Patrick filed for bankruptcy, the News’ story said, he listed more than $816,000 in debts and just over $104,000 in assets. "Among his debtors," the story said, "was the Internal Revenue Service, which Patrick owed $13,186 in federal income taxes withheld from his restaurant employees’ paychecks." By email, Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma sent us information indicating that from April 1986 into November 1988, Patrick’s companies were hit with five federal tax liens totaling $18,272.26--with unpaid employee payroll taxes comprising the bulk of that total. Vielma pointed out too that Patrick’s online response to the Dewhurst claim concedes he filed for personal bankruptcy and once owed payroll taxes. Patrick’s ad response states his bankruptcy filing doesn’t prove he collected and pocketed the taxes, adding: "This is not a defense; however, it is a technical distinction. According to Patrick, these taxes were ultimately paid and the debt to the federal government was settled." Generally, employers collect half of each employee’s payroll taxes and pony up the other half, with the resulting money going to the federal government for Medicare and Social Security. The essence of Dewhurst’s charge appears to be that Patrick pocketed payroll taxes paid by workers in failing to forward it to the IRS. The News’ story said Patrick "also owed smaller amounts in property taxes to two Houston-area school districts, who later sued his companies for nonpayment. And his businesses were slapped with more than two dozen tax liens by federal, state and local governments. "Patrick said he worked extra jobs and eventually paid off the IRS," the newspaper said, also quoting Patrick as saying he couldn’t recall details of his bankruptcy case’s closing in 1992. "More than a decade later, as he got ready for his first bid for the Senate," the story said, Patrick "cleared up all the tax liens through the secretary of state’s office." Patrick: Taxes paid up We asked Patrick’s campaign for relevant documentation. Logan Spence, his campaign manager, emailed us state and federal documents showing that in April 1986, an IRS administrator signed off on a lien against Patrick’s company of $15,356.68 for unpaid employee payroll taxes. Another document showed an IRS official approving a lien of $4,297.22 for unpaid federal income taxes. At our inquiry, the Morning News emailed us excerpts from Patrick’s bankruptcy case file. The provided 10 pages show Patrick’s bankruptcy filing was initiated Oct. 27, 1986 and was closed Oct. 22, 1992. Also, a document indicates, Patrick (whose legal name was then Goeb) was "released from all dischargeable debts" on May 4, 1987. But 941 taxes incurred by Watchbear, Inc., in 1985 and 1986 were still owed to the federal government, another document indicates, totaling $13,186.29--a figure that matches what the News story described as taxes withheld from restaurant employees’ pay checks. By phone, Spence noted the $13,186 figure on the bankruptcy filing was accompanied by the words "less recent payment," which Spence described as referring to Patrick already paying some unpaid taxes. Saying all of Patrick’s debts associated with the bankruptcy of his restaurants "have been settled," Spence also emailed a photo of a Nov. 5, 1990, letter from an IRS official to Patrick, whose legal last name remained Goeb, stating that $13,186.29 had been paid in full on Nov. 6, 1989. Spence also emailed documents indicating that in January and February 2006, then-State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn cleared Patrick of liens for sales taxes previously unpaid to the City of Houston and Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County totaling $11,717.73. At the time, Patrick was making his first run for the Senate. Experts say records inconclusive about 'pocketing' By email and telephone, a couple tax and accounting experts who looked over the News-provided documents at our request said they indicate Patrick’s company failed to submit payroll taxes to the government, though both said the documents did not demonstrate Patrick pocketed the employee shares of payroll taxes--or otherwise. Arthur Agulnek, who teaches accounting at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the 941 liens show Patrick failed to pay the payroll taxes to the IRS; "he didn’t pay it where it was supposed to go." Michael Harris, a professor of accounting at St. Edward’s University, speculated: "The money was very likely spent on other bills." Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick got caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees’ payroll taxes. The first part of this claim is backed up by records showing the IRS filed liens because Patrick’s company didn’t submit payroll taxes in parts of 1985 and 1986. Patrick also had liens filed against him for unpaid state and local sales taxes. Documents indicate Patrick caught up on his federal tax tab in 1989 and met his sales tax obligations in 2006, the year he ran for the Senate. We see no confirmation, though, that Patrick "pocketed" employees’ payroll taxes, though such taxes did go unpaid to the government at times. On balance, we rate Dewhurst’s statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-04856	Says Tommy Thompson favors Obama's health care mandate, was publicly thanked by Obama for health reform support and that Thompson "says we can't repeal 'Obamacare.'"	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/10/eric-hovde/senate-rival-tommy-thompson-backs-obamacare-says-i/	With days remaining before the four-way Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat, Eric Hovde released a radio ad that hits Tommy Thompson on federal health reform -- or in partisan parlance, "Obamacare." The July 26, 2012 radio ad, similar to a TV ad Hovde released Aug. 6, 2012, complains that Thompson is "slinging mud," distorting Hovde’s record and "hiding some things." It then addresses President Barack Obama's federal health care reform law, using sound bites from Thompson and Obama to back a three-part claim: "Thompson says he favors Obama’s health care mandate." "Obama thanked Thompson for supporting ‘Obamacare.’" "Thompson says we can't repeal ‘Obamacare.’" Candidates often use their opponents’ "own words" to make claims against them. So, how do the three parts of Hovde’s claim score out? Mandate Hovde uses the present tense to claim Thompson favors a key provision of the reform law: a mandate requiring nearly all individuals to have health insurance. But the Thompson comment used in the ad -- and cited by Hovde campaign spokesman Sean Lansing as evidence -- was made during a University of Texas speech Thompson gave in 2007. Asked about states requiring residents to have health insurance, Thompson said: "I, for one, believe the mandate for health insurance is all right." That’s the sound bite Hovde uses in his ad. But in 2007, Obama wasn’t even in office, so Thompson couldn’t have been referring to "Obamacare." Moreover, Thompson is campaigning now against the mandate and calling for the repeal Obama’s reform law in total. (A note: We did rate as False a claim by Thompson that he never supported an individual mandate. As we noted, Thompson made the 2007 comment in favor of the concept and a similar one in 2006. But those statements don’t reflect his current position.) Thanks On the second part of Hovde’s claim -- that Obama thanked Thompson for supporting "Obamacare" -- Hovde implies that Thompson endorsed Obama’s reform law. But the picture isn’t that clear. Lansing cited an address the president made to the nation in October 2009 as health care reform legislation was moving through Congress. We touched on it in rating Half True an August 2011 claim by Club for Growth, a national anti-tax group, that Thompson supported "Obamacare." As we noted in that item, Thompson expressed both support and opposition to the health care reform legislation that eventually became law. In his address, Obama said the U.S. Senate Finance Committee’s version of health care reform would soon be merged with reform bills produced by other congressional committees. He also said Thompson was among Republicans who "came out in support of reform." That’s part of the Obama sound bite Hovde uses in his ad. But Obama didn’t thank Thompson for anything, as Hovde’s ad states, much less thank him for backing his particular reform plan. He cited Thompson’s general support for health care reform, a position Thompson has reiterated during the campaign. Repeal In stating that Thompson "says we can't repeal 'Obamacare,'" Hovde again uses the present tense. But for evidence, Lansing cited a TV interview Thompson did in November 2010, which we also touched on in rating the Club for Growth claim. The Thompson sound bite Hovde uses is: "When it's all said and done, you're not going to be able to repeal health care." The full Thompson statement was: "When it's all said and done, you're not going to be able to repeal health care because President Obama is not going to sign it and they don't have enough votes to override a veto. So why push a cart up hill when you know it's not going to be able to get to the top?" Like the individual mandate part of Hovde's claim, this piece is highly misleading because it relies on an outdated statement from Thompson. Indeed, the 2010 statement was an assessment on the political realities of the time, not whether the reform law could ever be repealed. Thompson is campaigning by saying that if elected, he would be the "51st vote" in the Senate to do so. Our rating In claiming Thomson supports "Obama’s health care mandate" and that Thompson "says we can't repeal "Obamacare," Hovde uses outdated statements that falsely portray Thompson’s current positions. And Hovde falsely claims that Obama thanked Thompson for supporting "Obamacare," when the president was citing Thompson’s support of reform in general. By our math, False + False + False = False.

pomt-13212	Says Rob Portman was a registered foreign agent whose "client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people."	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/20/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-revives-baby-doc-attack-against-por/	Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland tied Sen. Rob Portman to the notorious former president of Haiti, Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier, during the final Ohio Senate debate. "There's only one of the two of us standing before this audience that's ever been a registered lobbyist, and that's you, senator," Strickland said. "Your first job as a lobbyist was with the Chinese-based firm. You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people." Strickland’s charge is a mixed bag of accuracy. After losing his re-election bid to Republican Gov. John Kasich, Strickland oversaw the lobbying and activism arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, but he was not a lobbyist himself. There’s no doubt that Portman, however, was a registered foreign agent, a title that can involve lobbying. As PolitiFact Ohio has previously reported, Portman started working with the law firm Patton, Boggs & Blow after graduating from University of Michigan's law school in 1984. The Strickland campaign sent us a Buzzfeed article showing Portman’s 1985 foreign agent registration form. He was listed as a foreign agent on behalf of the Republic of Haiti, which was ruled by Duvalier at the time. Duvalier, who inherited the "president for life" post from his father, "Papa Doc," headed what human rights workers called one of the most oppressive governments in the Western Hemisphere, according to the New York Times. His regime, known for the murder and torture of of tens of thousands, was toppled in 1986. But it’s not entirely fair to imply that Portman was Duvalier’s lackey. He never lobbied on behalf of Haiti or any other foreign government. In 2005, Portman was named by President George W. Bush as his U.S. Trade Representative, a position that can’t be held by anyone who’s ever lobbied for foreign governments. Being tapped for the position prompted an affidavit from Stuart Pape, a former managing partner of Portman's law firm dated April 12, 2005. Pape said Portman filed the foreign agent registration form because he was working for the Hong Kong-based Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., the "Chinese-based firm" Strickland referred to. But Pape said he reviewed the records and confirmed that Portman did no work for Haiti or any foreign government. On Portman’s campaign website, the Haiti registration is explained as "standard procedure" at the lobbying firm, and required of all of its attorneys. The firm, the record shows, did travel to Haiti to meet with Baby Doc. Our ruling Strickland said of Portman, "You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people." Portman was a registered foreign agent who worked on behalf of a company based in Hong Kong. His firm’s clients included "Baby Doc" Duvalier’s government. But Portman himself did no work for the Haitian regime, according to a sworn statement by the firm’s managing partner. We rate Strickland's statement Mostly False. Correction: The original version of this fact-check incorrectly called Rob Portman a registered lobbyist. He was a registered foreign agent, a classification that included lobbying under the law at that time.

pomt-11577	About 1.1 million people legally enter the U.S. each year as permanent residents -- "65 percent of that is some kind of chain migration; 22 percent is diversity lottery, ‘asyling,’ refugees; only about 14, 15 percent has anything to do with work."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/02/ron-johnson/how-legal-immigrants-us-break-down-chain-migration/	President Donald Trump drew boos when he said during his first State of the Union address that under what Republicans call "chain migration" -- and Democrats refer to as family reunification -- a "single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives." PolitiFact National rated his claim Mostly False. Lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can petition for a spouse and unmarried children to come to the United States; and U.S. citizens can also petition for married children, parents and siblings. But neither permanent residents nor citizens can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent. Nevertheless, Trump’s remark underscores a broader claim made by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on the ways in which legal immigrants enter the United States. Johnson’s claim is different than Trump’s, but helps provide a clearer picture of the sources of legal immigration. Johnson’s claim On Jan. 12, 2018, more than two weeks before the State of the Union, Johnson was interviewed about immigration on Wisconsin Public Television’s "Here and Now" show. He said he wants to limit "the abuse of chain migration" and then made a four-part statistical claim, telling host Frederica Freyberg: From my standpoint, we have got to start closing the loopholes created by bad law, bad legal precedent that incentivize people to come to this country illegally. We have to limit "chain migration" to a common-sense level. Right now, Frederica, we let about 1.1 million people in this country legally -- in terms of permanent, legal residence -- every year. Sixty-five percent of that is some kind of "chain migration"; 22 percent is diversity lottery, "asyling" and refugees. Only about 14, 15 percent has anything to do with work. That is a crazy system, when you have literally millions -- probably hundreds of millions of people want to come to this country -- we can’t assimilate all those people. We’ve got to limit and we’ve got to limit it on a merit-based system. So, we’ve got to fix our system. Chain migration, Johnson continued, "allows an immigrant to allow in their parents, their children -- but what ends up happening is, it does chain, where those people can bring in their children, their parents; and all of a sudden, one individual and you’ve got cousins and adult children and adult siblings -- that’s what we need to limit to something that just makes common sense." As we’ll see, three parts of Johnson’s four-part claim are essentially on target. But a major part of his claim -- saying that 65 percent of legal immigration is through "chain migration" -- is misleading. Johnson’s breakdown To back Johnson’s claim, his office cited data from from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security yearbook of immigration statistics. The first part of his claim, on the total number of legal immigrants -- 1.18 million in 2016 -- is correct. As for the other three parts, here are figures for 2016, the latest year available, based on how Johnson breaks down legal immigrants: "Chain migration" 804,793 -- 68% Diversity lottery, refugees, asylees and other 240,819 -- 20% Work-related 137,893 -- 12% (Diversity lottery allocates visas to individuals from countries with historically low rates of immigration to U.S.; a refugee is a person outside his or her country of nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution; an asylee is a person who meets the definition of refugee and is already present in the United States or is seeking admission at a port of entry.) So, Johnson’s claim -- based on the way he breaks down immigration groups -- is within several percentage points on the second and third categories for 2016. Moreover, those two percentages have been roughly stable for years, experts told us. But his reference to "chain migration" -- a relatively new term in the Washington lexicon that the New York Times says has been "weaponized" to sway public opinion -- is misleading in alluding to the immigration of extended-family members. Individuals in that category are admitted to the United States based on family relationships, as opposed to the other two categories Johnson cites. But in round numbers, only 120,000 of the 800,000 immigrants that Johnson lists as "chain migration" were not the spouses, children or parents, according to Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University law professor emeritus and immigration law specialist. That means extended-family members, based on Johnson’s categories, make up only 10 percent of the 1.18 million total legal immigrants. Syracuse University political science professor Elizabeth Cohen, whose specialties include immigration, told us: This idea that an immigrant receives a visa and all of a sudden five or 10 close and distant relatives are being pulled in on a chain is completely unrepresentative of how our immigration system actually works. Our rating Johnson says about 1.1 million people legally enter the U.S. each year as permanent residents -- "65 percent of that is some kind of chain migration; 22 percent is diversity lottery, ‘asyling,’ refugees; only about 14, 15 percent has anything to do with work." He’s correct on the total number, and his breakdown of two of the categories is essentially on target. But to say that 65 percent come through "chain migration" -- which typically refers to the extended-family members of an immigrant in the United States -- is misleading. The vast majority of individuals in that group are spouses, children or parents, not more distant relatives. Johnson’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-03585	Says nearly 1 million people are "coming to town" in the next 20 years.	/texas/statements/2013/may/16/lee-leffingwell/leffingwell-spelman-says-nearly-million-people-are/	Austin’s city-owned utility, Austin Energy, needs more expert oversight than the Austin City Council can provide, Mayor Lee Leffingwell suggested in an opinion article he wrote with Council Member Bill Spelman. "We’ve got 20-odd departments to watch over and — with nearly a million people coming to town in the next 20 years — incredible housing, land use, and transportation problems," the pair said in the piece placed online by the Austin American-Statesman on May 5, 2013. A million people on the way? Pack. The. Bags. Leffingwell spokeswoman Amy Everhart guided us to a Spelman aide, Ashley Fisher, who said by phone that the 1 million figure reflected what the city projects to be the metropolitan region’s population gain within 20 years. Fisher said the reference to all those people "coming to town" was in keeping with how people think of Austin. Her point: "We’re part of a region growing really fast," she said. Separately, Ryan Robinson, the city’s demographer, told us he has estimated the city’s population at 824,750 as of April 1, 2013, which he said closely tracks the U.S. Census Bureau’s estimate of 820,611 as the city’s population as of July 2011. Robinson said he projects the city to gain 330,000 residents, reaching a population of nearly 1.2 million, by April 2035. That’s not a gain of nearly 1 million. But Robinson, who also pointed out that Austin Energy has customers outside the city limits in Travis County burgs including Pflugerville, Manor, Manchaca and Westlake Hills, said he projects the population of the counties immediately around Austin--Travis, Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays and Williamson--to increase by about 1.6 million by April 2035. As of April 2013, he said, the same metropolitan area was home to an estimated 1.87 million residents. About one third of the increase, Robinson said, is expected to come from area births outpacing deaths, what demographers call the natural increase. The remaining margin would trace to more people moving into the counties than moving out, he said. Robinson’s projections, dated January 2013, indicate the city’s population, which was under 500,000 in 1990, will crest 1 million by 2025. Hunting other population projections, we touched base with Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, who said the agency does not project the population of individual cities. Next, we consulted Rafael Gonzalez of the Texas State Data Center in San Antonio, who said similarly that the center does not project city population changes. But Gonzalez helped us download a projection suggesting that the five-county Austin region’s population, estimated at 1.8 million in 2013, would total nearly 2.6 million in 2033, assuming that migration occurs at half the pace of the first decade of this century--which Robinson, the city demographer, described as too conservative a rate for projecting Austin-area changes. Under the slower growth scenario, the Austin region would see an increase of about 800,000 residents in 20 years. Using the center's interface, we also checked population projections assuming the same migration into the counties that the region experienced during the century's first decade. Under this scenario, the counties would have more than 3.3 million residents in 2033, a nearly 1.5 million increase from 2013. Finally, we inquired into Travis County’s estimated population on the interface. If the county experiences the same in-migration levels as the first decade of the century, its population would total nearly 1.6 million in 2033, up nearly 480,000 from 2013, according to the results. Spelman, elaborating on the 1-million statement, told us by email: "If you want to split hairs and define ‘town’ as ‘the current Austin city limits,’" then it’s correct that the city’s population is expected to increase by 332,244 by 2035. "But please consider that our statement wasn’t about residency; it was about demand for city services and the scope of the problems we need to solve," Spelman said in a footnoted statement. He added that according to a 2007 economic census by the Census Bureau, some 70 percent of jobs in the five-county Austin region were in Austin, an indication, he said, that the vast majority of more than 1 million additional residents of the region will depend, at least in part, on the city for their livelihoods. "Even if new residents of San Marcos, Georgetown, Luling or Bastrop don’t work in Austin," Spelman said, "many of them will visit Austin regularly to shop, find health care or have a good time. While they’re here, these people will depend on the" city "for public safety, water and sewer, solid waste, flood control, parks and, of course, electricity." Spelman added that Austin also will share stresses on the region’s housing and transportation infrastructure. Our ruling Leffingwell and Spelman wrote that nearly a million people are "coming to town" in the next 20 years. Don’t pack those bags just yet; the city projects Austin’s population to increase by about 330,000--far short of a million--by 2035. The claim retains an element of truth, though, in that the city stands to confront pressures related to many more additional residents expected in the region. Regardless, all those newbies are not predicted to be moving to town, making the published statement Mostly False.	None	Lee Leffingwell	None	None	None	2013-05-16T06:00:00	2013-05-05	['None']
pomt-08418	"We refused to balance the budget on the backs of our children."	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/20/casey-cagle/cagle-ad-says/	The television ad begins with the smiling faces of several children. The next image is of Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle standing in a classroom. "Children are our priority," Cagle says. "That's why we refused to balance the budget on the backs of our children." "Cut!" some said. Didn't Georgia cut education funding this fiscal year? Aren't many school districts furloughing teachers? Didn't former Georgia Schools Superintendent Kathy Cox say the cuts are so deep that the state is now paying for only 147 of the 180 mandated days in the school year? Cagle's camp directed us to his campaign website, which has a point-by-point defense of virtually each sentence in the ad. Its explanation for saying state leaders refused to "balance the budget on the backs of our children" includes a bill passed earlier this year that gives school districts greater spending flexibility. As lieutenant governor, Cagle presides over the Georgia Senate and is one of the most powerful politicians under the Gold Dome. Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint was among those who didn't buy Cagle's argument. Cagle's main opponent in the Nov. 2 primary, Democrat Carol Porter, posted the professor's beef on her campaign website. "To say you preserved education funding is pretty hollow," Swint told AJC PolitiFact Georgia. Over two years, state spending has dropped from $21 billion to $18 billion. State leaders blame the Great Recession. "We don't have a choice," Cox said in May during a discussion on lifting the limits on classroom sizes. "We didn't give them enough money." Cagle's campaign argues the cuts could have been worse, which is partly why it put together the ad. The lieutenant governor notes the Legislature's effort to restore funding for the school nurse program. In the fiscal year 2010 budget, which was adopted in 2009, Gov. Sonny Perdue proposed removing all $30 million the state provides for the program. The Legislature kept $29.1 million in the budget for the nurse program. In the fiscal year 2011 budget adopted earlier this year, Perdue proposed cutting the school nurse budget again, to about $27.5 million. The Senate proposed cutting the budget to about $26.8 million but eventually kept it at $27.5 million. Cagle pointed to the state's Regional Educational Service Agency as another example of the Legislature's resistance to balancing the budget on the backs of children. The RESA allows local school systems and colleges to share resources for planning, staff development, curriculum and other categories. Perdue proposed cutting all $12.1 million from the budget for that program. The Legislature kept $9.3 million. The lieutenant governor also mentioned House Bill 908, which gives school systems the flexibility to spend more money on some instructional programs, media centers and professional development. School systems can also increase class sizes. Cagle campaign manager Ryan Cassin said education spending was cut by a smaller percentage than other departments. Some state education experts say what Cagle mentioned on his website pales in comparison with the overall state cuts. "Flexibility is no substitute when you lose $1 billion," said Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association. Garrett said the cuts have resulted in some districts delaying buying new textbooks. Another consequence is larger class sizes, which many experts believe hurts students because the pupils get less attention from their teacher. Tim Callahan, a spokesman for the nonpartisan, 80,000-member Professional Association of Georgia Educators, said some schools are operating four days a week, there's less time for teachers to prepare lesson plans and they have fewer supplies. "I've really got to scratch my head when they say they shielded education and [are] not balancing the budget on the backs of our children," he said. Cagle correctly points out that the Legislature did restore education funding in some areas and the school systems have more spending flexibility. However, the state cuts have been, as Garrett told us, some of the largest in recent memory. The cuts have had an impact on children and instruction. Cagle's statement has some element of truth, but it ignores critical facts such as overall state budget cuts and their impact on the classroom. That rates as Barely True in our book. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07651	A bill that would halt the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases would help "stop rising gas prices."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/14/fred-upton/fred-upton-says-pending-bill-block-epa-curbs-green/	To hear Reps. Fred Upton and Ed Whitfield talk about their new energy bill, you'd think it will prevent gas prices from increasing before your next fill-up. Upton, the Michigan Republican who chairs the influential Energy and Commerce Committee, and Ed Whitfield, the Kentucky Republican who heads the Energy and Power subcommittee, recently argued in a letter to fellow lawmakers that one way to stop rising gas prices would be to pass the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011 (H.R. 910). The bill grows out of longstanding frustration by industry groups and lawmakers who believe that Environmental Protection Agency regulations unnecessarily burden many companies. The measure -- which Whitfield’s subcommittee approved on March 10, 2011, and which now heads to the full committee -- would prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases for the purpose of addressing climate change. Here’s a portion of what Upton and Whitfield wrote to their colleagues in the March 8, 2011, letter, which is headlined, "Concerned About High Gas Prices? Cosponsor H.R. 910 and Make a Difference Today!" "Whether through greenhouse gas regulation, permit delays, or permanent moratoriums, the White House takes every opportunity to decrease access to safe and secure sources of oil and natural gas," the lawmakers wrote. "Gasoline prices have climbed dramatically over the past three months. American consumers deal with this hardship every day, and as this poll indicates, the majority of respondents do not see the pain subsiding anytime soon. Americans also understand the realities of supply and demand as it relates to oil prices. Unfortunately the White House does not. ... "H.R. 910, the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, is the first in this legislative series to stop rising gas prices by halting EPA’s Clean Air Act greenhouse gas regulations. As one small refiner testifying before the Committee on Energy and Commerce put it: ‘EPA’s proposed [greenhouse gas] regulations for both refinery expansions and existing facilities will likely have a devastating effect on … all of our nation’s fuels producers…. If small refiners are forced out of business, competition will suffer and American motorists, truckers and farmers will be increasingly reliant on foreign refiners to supply our nation’s gasoline and diesel fuel.’ "We … have taken the first steps in attempting to restrain this regulatory overreach that will restrict oil supplies and cause gasoline prices to rise." But can the bill really stop gas prices from going up, as the letter says? We’ll look at two key questions. Could the proposed EPA regulations on oil refineries actually increase prices at the pump? And when would the impact of the regulations be felt? As to the first question, experts had different opinions. The oil industry argues that regulations imposing new costs on refiners could force U.S. refineries to charge more. (The proposed regulations are supposed to shield smaller operations from regulatory impacts, but experts said that a significant proportion of U.S. refineries would indeed be affected.) "It’s Economics 101," said John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute. "The refinery business is a very low-margin business. They have no margin for error and face tough competition internationally." Others argue the refining industry could adapt to new regulations. "Looking at past public claims when the Clean Air Act was passed would show that U.S. refining capacity still managed to increase over time, despite the high expense refiners had to put out to comply with the Clean Air act," said Amy Myers Jaffe, a fellow in energy studies at Rice University. "So one might imagine, depending on the details on how carbon regulation would be implemented, U.S. industry could likely similarly adjust," Jaffe said. "It depends on the specifics of how a policy is implemented. There are no doubt some small refineries in the United States that might be really inefficient, so maybe some of them would close if they had to increase their costs substantially, but tiny, uncompetitive, regional refineries are not the main thing that makes the US refining and marketing industry ‘competitive.’" Indeed, while a shift to overseas refiners could have negative consequences for the nation -- it could weaken the United States’ industrial base, threaten U.S. jobs and pose problems for national security -- it’s not a foregone conclusion that prices at the pump would rise. If U.S. refiners become less competitive and more oil is instead imported from overseas refiners, it will be because the cost of refining overseas becomes more competitive. That’s the essence of a free market. And even if the cost of refining did go up, the cost of gasoline is volatile and affected by many factors such as global demand and supply disruptions. So there's no certainty that a bump in refining costs would necessarily translate into higher prices at the pump. As for the second question -- when any impact might be felt -- the rules wouldn't take affect for months or years. The EPA won't even propose the first-ever greenhouse-gas standards for refineries until December 2011 and doesn't plan to issue final standards until November 2012. Those standards would govern emissions for new and significantly overhauled refineries. Rules for existing refineries are expected to be unveiled in July 2011. Based on the past history of EPA regulations, the new rules aren't likely to take effect until a few years after that, experts said. So, if the bill were to pass, it would prevent EPA regulations that would otherwise take effect in 2013, 2014 or 2015. That’s a long way away. Another factor: the regulations targeted by the House bill are new ones. So if the House bill passes, it would essentially protect the status quo -- not take any explicit action to stop price hikes. So where does this leave us? While Upton and Whitfield's letter is carefully worded, it frames the argument for the bill in the context of today’s trend of rising gasoline prices. Yet the impact of the bill -- if there is an one -- would be years away. And there's no proof that the law would actually stop gas prices from rising. The added regulations now being planned may hamper U.S. refiners, but the international free market could just as easily end up keeping refining costs low. And it’s hardly assured that any changes in refining costs -- up or down -- will influence gasoline prices, which are subject to a wide array of influenes. We find their claim False.

pomt-09527	"Taxpayers even footed the bill for Perry’s trip to a bachelor party in Las Vegas."	/texas/statements/2010/feb/11/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-public-money-paid-vegas-trip/	An unlikely voice has been injected into the political struggle over the Republican gubernatorial nomination: Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas. The pop/hip-hop singer’s "Glamorous" serves as the soundtrack for dueling videos from the Perry and Hutchison campaigns, each accusing the other of expensive travel habits. We dealt with Gov. Rick Perry's video in a previous PolitiFact Texas item; now comes Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's video portraying the governor’s travel expenditures as contributing to "a life of luxury." The Web ad includes at least five claims about Perry's travel history. The one that immediately grabbed our attention was: "Taxpayers even footed the bill for Perry’s trip to a bachelor party in Las Vegas." Did the governor experience Sin City on the taxpayers’ dime? To support the statement in the video, the Hutchison campaign referred us to a Dallas Morning News item about a visit that Perry paid to Las Vegas in October. The Perry campaign confirmed that the governor made the trip to meet with a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Nevada and to attend a bachelor party dinner for his son, Griffin. But it disputes the Hutchison claim that taxpayers paid Perry's bills. According to Perry’s office, the governor can use state funds to pay for state travel. The Nevada journey did not fit that bill, however, and Perry paid for it with a mix of campaign donations and money from the Republican Governors Association. Mark Miner, a spokesman for Perry, said the governor arrived in Las Vegas on Oct. 24. He ate lunch with gubernatorial hopeful Brian Sandoval, had dinner with his son and others at the Venetian resort and casino, and then spent the night there. Miner said that the governors group paid for the lunch and the hotel room but that he did not know what they cost. He also said he didn't know who paid for the dinner. It appears that the Perry campaign paid for the commercial flight that the governor took to Las Vegas. A campaign finance report filed last month said Perry took a Southwest Airlines flight to Las Vegas on Oct. 24 and showed a $137.60 payment to the airline on the same date. But the fact that others paid for Perry's flight, hotel and meals doesn't mean that public funds weren't spent. Taxpayers pick up the tab for the security detail that accompanies the governor when he travels. And according to the Department of Public Safety, which staffs the detail, the Las Vegas trip cost taxpayers $12,321. That includes overtime, car rentals, hotel, airfare and meals. And so, there is an element of truth to Hutchison's statement. Taxpayers paid a large portion of the cost of the governor’s trip to Las Vegas — the security detail that always travels with him. And while there, Perry attended a dinner for his son. But Hutchison's statement in the video suggests that state money paid for Perry's personal travel and that his sole purpose of visiting Sin City was to party — neither of which is accurate. We rate Hutchison's claim as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10947	Says Congressman Tom McClintock, R-Calif., "has authored three laws since he’s been in office; two renamed post offices."	/california/statements/2018/jul/24/jessica-morse/has-republican-congressman-tom-mcclintock-authored/	Jessica Morse, the Democratic challenger in California’s 4th Congressional district race, describes incumbent Republican Rep. Tom McClintock as "a career politician" whose done next-to-nothing in Congress. Morse, 36, is a former State Department employee and first-time candidate. McClintock, 62, is seeking a fifth term representing the largely rural district east of Sacramento. Before his time in Congress, he spent 22 years as a state lawmaker. Morse made another claim about McClintock that caught our attention on Twitter: "I believe McClintock is beatable. Word is getting out that, like Trump, he is shamelessly dishonest and utterly ineffective; he has authored three laws since he’s been in office; two renamed post offices." I’m standing up to McClintock’s abysmal leadership, join me! We decided to fact-check the portion about McClintock authoring just three laws. Was Morse right? Our research Asked about the claim, Morse’s campaign said it "was simply quoting Eric Johnson, the author of the article linked in the tweet." Johnson is the editor of the Sacramento News & Review. Morse’s tweet links to his July 19 column in the publication, titled Defeat Trump’s local ally. Morse does use quotation marks in her tweet. But she doesn’t explicitly attribute it to Johnson. The impression left is that the words are hers or, at the very least, that she stands by the claim. Her tweet gives it a stamp of approval and perpetuates questionable information. In the past, PolitiFact has called out politicians, including President Trump, for quoting and retweeting inaccurate information on Twitter. In November 2015, for example, Trump tweeted an image packed with racially loaded and incorrect murder statistics. PolitiFact rated it Pants On Fire. We’ll take the same approach in our examination of Morse. Number of bills Starting with the number of bills McClintock has authored that became law, Morse’s statement is off. Websites Govtrack.us and Congress.gov show McClintock has authored four bills that were signed into law. Morse is right that two of McClintock’s bills were to rename post offices. But does the number of bills passed truly measure a politician’s effectiveness? Not necessarily, said Jack Pitney, professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College. "Bill authorship is only one dimension of effectiveness," Pitney wrote in an email. "A lawmaker can have a huge impact without being prime sponsor of a major bill. "A great deal of legislating takes place in the amending process," he added. "The amending may take place in committee, or on the floor, as part of an informal negotiation. A member of the House may not pass a measure as a freestanding bill but then be able to attach it as a part of a larger bill." Claims about members of Congress passing a small number of bills, some to rename post offices, aren’t new. In 2016, we rated Half True now Sen. Kamala Harris’ claim during a debate in the race for U.S. Senate that Rep. Lorretta Sanchez had "passed one bill in her 20 years in Congress, and that was to rename a post office." We found that was technically correct. But it ignored the fact that relatively few stand-alone bills introduced by members of Congress are passed on their own. Many are added as amendments to larger bills. Longtime Democratic House members Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, at that time, had sponsored a combined 10 stand-alone bills that became law during their careers. Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego, agreed the number of laws passed isn’t the only measurement of effectiveness. Still, it’s "a reasonable way to go" when examining a politician, he said. For some conservative lawmakers, passing laws isn’t necessarily the goal, Kousser added. "Tom McClintock is not a guy who believes you need a law for everything," Kousser said. "He doesn’t necessarily view a law as an accomplishment." Our ruling Democratic challenger Jessica Morse claimed on Twitter that GOP Rep. Tom McClintock "has authored three laws since he’s been in office; two renamed post offices." Websites Govtrack.us and Congress.gov show McClintock has authored four bills that were signed into law. Two were to rename post offices. Morse’s claim is wrong on the number signed into law. But her tweet is also misleading because members of Congress rarely author stand-alone bills. Most are added as amendments to larger bills. Additionally, the number of bills authored is not necessarily the best measurement of a politician’s effectiveness. There are many other ways they can shape legislation.

pomt-08723	John Boozman supports "privatizing Social Security"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/02/blanche-lincoln/sen-lincoln-says-boozman-wants-privatize-social-se/	Democrats used it to defeat President Bush's plans to change Social Security, and they're using it now to try to hold on to legislative majorities in the House and the Senate. We are, of course, talking about "privatization." In her latest TV ad, Senate incumbent Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., says that there are "serious differences" between her and her opponent, Rep. John Boozman. First on the list, "unlike John, I am against privatizing Social Security and Medicare." History has shown that accusing your opponent of wanting to privatize Social Security is a good political strategy. President Barack Obama has certainly taken notice. During the 2008 campaign, then candidate Obama accused Sen. John McCain of wanting to revitalize Bush's plan to "privatize" Social Security. We rated that Barely True. And during his weekly address in August, Obama said that some Republican leaders in Congress" are "pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall." We rated it Barely True once again. So how does the evidence stack up in this case? When Boozman ran for Congress in 2001, he said that he supported President Bush's proposal to allow individuals under 55 to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into a personal investment account. "The future of Social Security is dependent on creating a vehicle for private investment," Boozman said. And again in 2004, "Boozman said he likes the idea of transferring a small percentage of the federal (Social Security) trust fund to 'very safe' investments," reported the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Lincoln also pointed to Boozman's statement on the "Roadmap for America’s Future," a bill from Rep. Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. The plan includes a proposal to allow people under 55 to steer a portion of their payroll taxes toward personal accounts, through which they can invest in funds chosen and managed by a federal government board. Asked by the Arkansas Times whether he supports the proposal, Boozman said that he "appreciates" Ryan's "commitment to putting our country on the road to fiscal responsibility." He added that the plan is not perfect, "but I think he is making a thoughtful and serious effort to prevent Congress from driving our country into financial ruin." But even if Boozman had said that he fully supports Ryan's proposal, whether one can rightly call that or the Bush plan "privatization" of Social Security is debatable. Consider that in both cases, current retirees or those near the retirement age would not have been directly affected -- the plans are completely voluntary and only for workers under 55. One could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as promised. That's important, because the term "privatization" is often used to scare seniors into thinking that their lifetime savings will be transferred into the stock market -- the same one that took a plunge in 2008 and is still recovering. Ryan told PolitiFact in an e-mail that it would be incorrect to call even the personal retirement account portion "privatized." "In the personal-accounts system, the accounts are owned by the individual, and managed and overseen by Social Security -- not a stockbroker or private investment firm," Ryan stated. "People choosing the reformed system select from a handful of government-regulated options -- just as Members of Congress and federal employees do." Even Lincoln's own website says that Ryan's plan would only "partially privatize" Social Security, though not everyone agrees. An analysis of Ryan's "Roadmap" plan from the left-leaning Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, argues that, "what makes these accounts private is their ownership, not their oversight or management." We contacted Boozman's office to get a clarification on his proposal to transfer a small percentage of the trust fund to "very safe investments." His communications director, Patrick Creamer, sent us the following statement: "Congressman Boozman’s number one priority is making sure no benefits are cut to current and future enrollees. However, he understands the current system is unsustainable and in need of reform to ensure that future generations also receive benefits. One option he is open to is allowing younger workers to put a portion of their payroll taxes into safe investments –- but this is a decision individuals would have to make, not the government, and any proposal must have the support of the people of Arkansas to get his vote." So let's review. Lincoln says that Boozman supports privatizing Social Security. It is true that Rep. Boozman stated on more than one occasion that he supports allowing -- not requiring -- younger workers to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts. But even Lincoln's website admits that such a proposal only constitutes "partial privatization." In 2004, Boozman said that he would support transferring a portion of the trust fund into private investments. We are not entirely sure what that would have entailed, but when we asked him whether he supports the government putting money into the stock market, he told us that that decision lies solely with the individual workers. In short, Lincoln's ad makes it seem as though Boozman has consistently advocated handing the entire program over to Wall Street bankers, which is a significant stretch. We rate this Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08506	"O’Shaughnessy even voted for her own personal stimulus package -- a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself."	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/07/jon-husted/ohio-secretary-state-candidate-jon-husted-raps-opp/	Republican Ohio Secretary of State candidate Jon Husted slammed opponent Maryellen O’Shaughnessy in a recent television advertisement as a career politician who once passed legislation to increase her own pay. O’Shaughnessy, of Columbus, has heard the criticisms before. But that didn’t stop Husted from recycling them within a more current anti-Democrat framework. "O’Shaughnessy even voted for her own personal stimulus package – a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself," the commercial’s narrator says. It’s an accusation O’Shaughnessy has heard before. Her opponent in a 2002 race for Franklin County Commissioner, Dewey Stokes, also produced a TV commercial that ripped O’Shaughnessy for raising her own pay, according to the Columbus Dispatch. O’Shaughnessy’s campaign said she couldn’t be blamed for boosting her pay because she was ineligible for the raise after she and the rest of Columbus City Council approved it. So what’s the truth here. PolitiFact Ohio asked Husted’s camp to back up its statement. It pointed to an ordinance Columbus City Council passed in December 1998 to increase the salaries of council members, the council president and the mayor. The ordinance, which passed unanimously 7 to 0, increased the pay of council members and the council president 34 percent in 2000, with annual bumps of 3 percent in the next three years. That meant pay for City Council members jumped from $25,000 in 1999 to $36,607 in 2003. The pay for council president jumped from $30,000 to $44,037 over the same time. All seven members of council, including O’Shaughnessy, declined the pay raise in 2003. The Columbus city charter discourages officeholders from voting to increase their own pay with language that says a member of council must first be elected before collecting the higher pay. "The salary of any officer, employee, or member of a board or commission in the unclassified service of the city who was elected or appointed for a definite term shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which the individual was elected or appointed…" the charter reads. So while the pay increases council approved at the end of 1998 kicked in beginning in 2000, O’Shaughnessy was ineligible for the pay hikes in 2000 and 2001, the last two years of her first term. She didn’t qualify for a higher salary until after re-elected in 2001. She qualified for a higher salary of $35,541 when she started her new term in the beginning of 2002. What all this means is that when O’Shaughnessy voted in favor of the 1998 ordinance to increase pay, there was no guarantee she would ever get the higher pay. She had to win re-election first. That’s an important caveat that Husted’s ad doesn’t mention, and the point where Hustad’s attack comes unraveled. She didn’t approve a pay raise for herself. She voted to increase pay for whomever was elected to take that council seat. The voters decided she should get the pay raise by re-electing her in 2001. We rate Husted’s statement False.

pomt-06761	The Dodd-Frank financial-reform law’s hundreds of new rules will force small banks and credit unions to burn up "an estimated 2,260,631 labor hours just for compliance."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/22/sean-duffy/rep-sean-duffy-says-small-banks-will-have-spend-22/	In 2010, Republicans denounced the sweeping financial-reform law that Democrats pushed after a financial crisis that has fueled America’s stubborn economic downturn. Job-killer, they called it. Failure. Budget buster. Regulatory overkill. Now, more than a year after President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the GOP is pushing for changes -- and trotting out some eye-popping numbers to back its claim that the measure is anti-business. Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a freshman from northern Wisconsin, is among the naysayers -- though not to the point of signing on to the repeal bill offered by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a GOP presidential candidate. Duffy is claiming the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau actually could hurt consumers and slow economic recovery by piling new regulations on local financial institutions. "For small community banks and credit unions, like those in Central and Northern Wisconsin, the hundreds of new rules will require an estimated 2,260,631 labor hours just for compliance," Duffy wrote in an op-ed piece published by The Washington Times on July 20, 2011. "Those are hours that your local bank or credit union will spend dealing with some Washington bureaucrat instead of focusing on the needs of customers like you." He added: "Just because Wall Street is in New York and has a bad reputation doesn’t mean it’s right or fair to lump the ‘little guys’ in Wausau, Hayward and Superior in with them." More than 2.2 million hours? That figure has become a talking point for various Republicans. The original source was apparently the House Financial Services Committee, of which Duffy is a member. "Banks tell us they are adding compliance people to their staffs," said Daryll Lund, president and CEO of the Community Bankers of Wisconsin, a nonprofit trade group. "The vast majority of them are talking about adding staff." But does anybody really estimate the time needed to do all the paperwork behind the new safeguards? The answer is yes. Under the federal Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, that figure is estimated by each federal agency that puts rules into effect -- and that’s where Duffy’s office pointed us when we asked for evidence to back the claim. The first batch of about 30-plus rules contains hundreds of pages of detailed estimates of the "burden hours" for each. The House Financial Services Committee totalled up the hours just for those rules, and came up with the 2.2 million hours referenced by Duffy, said Bryan Blom, Duffy’s legislative director. We sampled the calculations, and consulted several academics and lawyers involved in studying Dodd-Frank. The consensus is that the 2.2 million number is reasonable, if not low. Indeed, just one part of one rule had an estimate of 604,800 hours. But Duffy uses the number in a particular way, stretching its meaning in his claim. We noticed a couple of big discrepancies. First, Duffy’s claim attributed the 2.2 million hours to "hundreds" of new rules. The first batch of about 30 rule produced that many, so the real number will certainly be higher. More importantly, Duffy attributes the fallout from all that paperwork to small banks and credit unions. But some of the rules appear to have little to do with Main Street lenders. For example, several rules in the first batch -- including the one with the 600,000 hour paperwork burden -- regulate the transparency of activities by so-called "swap dealers." Remember swaps? Swaps transactions became famous -- or infamous -- in the financial crisis. Dodd-Frank tightened reporting of swaps "because of concerns that unregulated, poorly regulated and poorly managed swaps operations had contributed to the credit market freeze that started in 2007 and the ensuing financial crisis," Life and Health National Underwriter reported in May 2011. Most small banks don’t get involved in swaps and would not be directly affected by the rules on that, said Richard McGuigan, executive vice president of the Community Bankers of Wisconsin. A few might be indirectly affected. That makes Duffy’s use of the estimate problematic. A more cautious approach was taken in the House committee report that Duffy cited. It said Dodd-Frank will require small community and mid-sized regional banks to spend "thousands of man-hours" on regulatory compliance. It referenced the 2.2 million hours, but without so closely linking that number to small institutions. When we talked to experts, we heard over and over that nobody knows the impact yet of the law, which has been called one of the most complex bills ever. Small banks know they can’t afford to pay someone $100,000 to make sure they comply with everything, said Milwaukee attorney James Friedman, who heads the financial institutions practice group at the Quarles & Brady, which has a large national practice. And they know that Internet banking, the economy, new regulations could spell an end to many smaller institutions, said Friedman. But it’s just too early in the life of the law to know the ultimate effect on banks, credit unions or consumers, according to both Friedman and the Community Bankers of Wisconsin. Let’s cash this one in. Duffy used the sympathetic "Main Street" bankers to illustrate his concerns about the regulatory impact of the Dodd-Frank law. There’s no doubt it will create more work, and Duffy turns to an estimate from a credible source. But in dramatizing the burden, he misapplies a very precise number to one subset of the many institutions that will be affected by the law. No one knows how many of those hours will land on the small players. At the same time, he potentially underestimates the burden, attributing the paperwork load of the first batch of rules to the as-yet-uncalculated burden from the hundreds of rules to come. So there’s an element of truth in the estimates and it’s possible Duffy’s number could turn out to be low. This reminds us of the joke about two statisticians out hunting who spy a duck. The first fires a bullet -- six inches too high. The second statistician takes aim and fires -- six inches too low. The two statisticians celebrate and say, "Got him!", figuring that "on average" the two shots hit the duck. Duffy’s found the trail and is tracking his prey, but this is a blind shot at this point. We rate Duffy’s claim Mostly False.	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2011-08-22T09:00:00	2011-07-20	['None']
pomt-07580	The hour of sleep you lose during the change to daylight saving time might initially pose some health risks.	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/28/joel-keehn/daylight-saving-health-concerns-valid/	Ahhhhhhhh. Two weeks into that yearly adventure in springing forward and sleep deprivation -- better known as daylight saving time -- and most of you have probably caught up on your sleep. For all of those still grousing about the time change, take heart. You are not alone. Daylight saving time has inspired controversy for more than 100 years. Supporters tout the economic benefits. Detractors decry its effect on everything from religious worship to the natural rhythms of sleep cycles. A political party was created in Australia’s Queensland in 2008 to promote the formation of a dual time zone. One portion of the Australian state would stick with standard time, and the other would spring forward for a portion of the year. In the United States, the National PTA has lobbied Congress against daylight saving time. The PTA contends the time change presents a safety risk to children walking to school in the dark. Earlier this month, Joel Keehn, a senior editor at Consumer Reports Health Blog, said: "The hour of sleep you will likely lose ... might pose a few health risks, at least for a couple of days." Losing an hour of sleep is certainly annoying. But PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether these unnaturally early mornings were really putting people in harm’s way. Keehn said the article couches statements about health risks using careful wording, and he made sure to also cite the benefits of daylight saving time. He focused on the health effects caused by the sudden time change and potential loss of sleep, he said, because he knew other studies have determined there are benefits to having more sunlight in the evening. "What’s problematic is the switching back and forth all the time," Keehn said. On his blog, Keehn said most Americans are already sleep-deprived. The extra hour of sleep they miss in the leap forward to daylight saving time can lead to an increased chance of a car accident or heart attack. Keehn did not cite a study concerning the increased likelihood of car accidents. He did cite a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine concerning the increased chance of a heart attack following the switch to daylight saving time. Keehn also pointed out in his blog that the extra hour of sunlight in the evening may encourage more people to exercise outside and can help people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder, often referred to as the winter blues. There are many studies that support Keehn’s position. Two Michigan State University graduate students found the number of accidents and severity of accidents in mines increased on the Monday after daylight saving time begins, according to their analysis of a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health database. The study of mining accidents from 1983 through 2006 revealed that the number of accidents increased by 5.6 percent and the number of days lost to these accidents increased by 67 percent. The authors drew a correlation between the increased accidents and lost sleep, finding mine workers lost an average of 40 minutes of sleep during the switch. There was no such increase in the number of accidents during the switch back to standard time, the study found. Other industries probably experience a similar increase in worker accidents, said Christopher M. Barnes, one of the authors and now an assistant professor of character development and research at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Taken as a whole, Barnes said Keehn’s statement makes sense. "It’s accurate for a few reasons," he said. "As my study showed, there’s an increased risk of accidents, and as an article in the journal Science showed, there’s an increased risk for heart attacks." But there are also studies that show daylight saving time actually promotes safety in the long run. A study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an Arlington, Va.-based nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing the number of deaths and accidents on the nation’s highways, found the extra hour of daylight during the busier evening commute lowers the overall number of crashes. In fact, the study concludes that using daylight saving time year-round could eliminate 900 fatal crashes, including more than 700 fatal crashes involving pedestrians. The extra hour makes cars and pedestrians more visible when the most people are traveling, said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the institute. "The research on traffic safety is clear, and DST is a benefit, not a determent, to road safety, especially for pedestrians," Rader said. A study by Stanley Coren, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and author of the book "Sleep Thieves," however, came to a slightly more nuanced conclusion. Coren found disruptions of internal daily rhythms make people less attentive and prone to "micro sleeps," which can be especially dangerous during the commute following the switch to daylight saving time. Coren studied Canadian traffic data and determined there was a greater risk of traffic accidents on the Monday after daylight saving time begins. His analysis showed there was a lower risk of traffic accidents on the Monday after reverting to standard time. Even so, he agreed that over the long run the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has a point. "Ultimately, it’s for the good, but in the short term, because we’re chronically sleep-deprived, it’s not so hot," Coren said. Along with increasing the chances of accidents, there’s evidence that the switch to daylight saving time also presents negative effects to the human body. An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2008 stated that the stress from changing sleeping schedules during daylight saving time increases the chance of heart attacks. Dr. Imre Janszky and Dr. Rickard Ljung, both of Stockholm, Sweden, studied more than 20 years of Swedish data on heart attacks and found the number of heart attacks increased during the first three weekdays after daylight saving time begins. "The most plausible explanation for our findings is the adverse effect of sleep deprivation on cardiovascular health," the doctors said in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. "Our data suggest that vulnerable people might benefit from avoiding sudden changes in their biologic rhythms." So can Keehn sleep well after saying daylight saving time poses health risks? Keehn said the hours of sleep likely lost in the transition "might pose a few health risks" only in the few days after the transition. He made sure to point out the potential positives as well. Keehn cited one study to back up his positions, and there are others that do so as well. And while there is another study that shows how over the course of a year increased daylight prevents traffic accidents, these studies do not discount the temporary health effects caused by a sudden loss of sleep, nor do they attempt to. The blogger was precise in saying it was the loss of sleep that would cause health risks for a few days. We find Keehn’s statement True.

pomt-14549	Scott Fisher "tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare."	/texas/statements/2016/feb/12/jonathan-stickland/jonathan-stickland-makes-pants-fire-claim-about-sc/	A TV ad from state Rep. Jonathan Stickland of Bedford says his challenger in the March 2016 Republican primary, Scott Fisher, voted in favor of pushing a million Texans "into Obamacare." That’s war talk for Republicans. And is it so? The narrator of the ad, which was brought to our attention by Fisher consultant Craig Murphy, says Fisher, a Bedford church pastor, is running a negative campaign backed by liberals. Also, the narrator says, Fisher "tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare." The image presented with that claim: The Obamacare law, approved by Congress in 2010, requires most Americans to have health insurance and also permits states to widen access to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance, with Uncle Sam covering the costs for three years and picking up most costs after that. In Texas, we concluded in 2015, around 1 million adults could have qualified for coverage if the state expanded access. Nobody would have been forced in; beneficiaries would have to sign up. It’s an understatement to say expansion didn’t catch on in Texas. In 2012, Gov. Rick Perry rejected the option, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty. The next year, the Republican-led Legislature "shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid," a May 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story summed up. Stickland consultant cites board resolution We asked Stickland’s campaign consultant, Luke Macias, how Stickland concluded that Fisher voted to push a million Texans into Obamacare. By email and phone, Macias maintained that documents emailed to us by Murphy demonstrate that as a member of a board, Fisher in 2013 propelled approval of a "pro-Obamacare" resolution that mentioned the Texas effect of Medicaid expansion and urged lawmakers to consider all options to cover health care for indigent Texans which, Macias suggested, would have included Medicaid expansion. Macias said the resolution’s Medicaid element added up to Fisher trying to force Texans into Obamacare. Board action in 2013 The relevant documents concern the board of managers for the Tarrant County Hospital District, the county’s tax-supported health district. Fisher was a board member from May 2005 into January 2015, district spokeswoman J.R. Labbe told us by email. In April 2013, the board was scheduled to consider a resolution calling for Texas legislators to expand Medicaid. But during the board’s April 11, 2013, meeting, according to meeting minutes, Fisher offered an alternate proposal. That resolution opened by stating Medicaid could insure more than a million low-income adults. But it closed by urging the Texas Legislature to find "sustainable" ways to fund the care of individuals lacking health coverage -- without mention of Medicaid or the Obamacare law. The substitute resolution passed unanimously, according to the minutes, which don’t show a vote on the original resolution urging Medicaid expansion. Labbe put us in touch with the board chairman at the time, Fisher supporter Trent Petty, who said by phone he didn’t advocate the original resolution once it was offered for the agenda by district staff. Moreover, he said, "our board never voted for the resolution to expand Medicaid." Petty suggested we ask Robert Earley, the district’s president and CEO, how the resolution landed on the agenda. By phone, Earley said he couldn’t immediately recall; he speculated an association circulated the proposal to hospitals and other health care entities. Petty told us that at the critical 2013 meeting, board members adopted the call to support "uncompensated care" instead of the Medicaid expansion resolution after discussion and agreement among members not to support expansion. Petty said: "Our board was not comfortable with Medicaid expansion. That substituted language was necessary because we didn’t want... to simply be silent about uncompensated care being addressed in some form or fashion by the state." Labbe confirmed that board meetings weren’t recorded, leaving us no audio or video record to review. Hospital district resolutions Let’s peek at the resolutions. The original -- unadopted -- resolution notes the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled it optional for each state to expand Medicaid in accord with the Affordable Care Act, known as the Obamacare law, and also says expansion would qualify more than a million Texas adults in poverty for Medicaid. It closes: "Now, therefore, be it resolved that: Tarrant County Hospital District Board of Managers respectfully calls on the Texas Legislature to seek all possible options for an efficient and effective Medicaid expansion." The adopted resolution opens by mentioning the Texas effect of Medicaid expansion, stating: "Whereas, the Affordable Care Act would add more than a million adult Texans living near or below the poverty line to Medicaid coverage." It goes on to (inaccurately) attribute premium increases to increased costs of providing care to uninsured individuals and to say Texas has the highest rate of uninsured (which we confirmed in July 2015) and that the estimated number of uninsured served by the district was projected to increase, burdening taxpayers and "health delivery systems." Finally, the resolution asks state lawmakers to "seek all possible options to adequately fund uncompensated and uninsured care for indigent Texans that is feasible and sustainable." Fisher’s recap We sought Fisher’s recollections. By phone, he noted that at the time of the board moves, he was Perry’s appointed chairman of the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, which is responsible for housing and rehabilitating juvenile offenders. Significantly too, Fisher said, Perry had reiterated his opposition to expanding Medicaid 10 days before the board meeting. The governor said April 1, 2013: "Texas will not be held hostage by the Obama administration's attempt to force us into the fool's errand of adding more than a million Texans to a broken system." Fisher said he entered the meeting believing the board shouldn’t take a pro-expansion position, which would be "going totally opposite the recent statement of our governor." We asked Fisher why the adopted resolution opens by saying the Affordable Care Act would add more than a million impoverished adult Texans to Medicaid. He replied: "Unsustainability. Those were statements that were made that showed the unsustainability, ‘the fool’s errand’ of expanding Medicaid coverage." Murphy elaborated by email: "The Whereas statements" in the resolution "were meant, as in every resolution, as a statement of the current situation. The situation was bad." "We stripped out any call for Medicaid expansion," Fisher summed up. Macias, asked to elaborate on Stickland's claim, said by email: "Fact: The resolution discusses the benefits of Obamacare and Medicaid expansion and then asks the Legislature to keep ‘ALL possible options.’ How is Medicaid expansion not included in ‘all possible options?’" Our ruling Stickland says Fisher "tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare." At best, this claim misinterprets Fisher’s motion for the hospital district board to approve a resolution asking lawmakers to fund indigent health care. The adopted proposal urges consideration of all possible sustainable options. However, it doesn't call for forcing Texans into Obamacare. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-04080	Says Austin’s treated wastewater, put into the Colorado River, is of higher quality than water the city takes from the lake for public use.	/texas/statements/2013/jan/21/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-treated-wastewater-put-colora/	Austin get its water from the Colorado River and puts its treated wastewater into the river, Mayor Lee Leffingwell reminded colleagues at a Dec. 13, 2012, Austin City Council meeting. Yuck? "Actually, it’s not as bad as it sounds," Leffingwell said, "because it’s better quality than the water we take out of Lake Austin" for public use. "It’s treated to a high level." His comparison of upstream river water to what the Austin Water Utility pours in downstream came to our attention from a skeptical Bill Bunch, executive director of the Save Our Springs Alliance. Data analyzed by the utility, the Lower Colorado River Authority and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality delivered a mixed picture, also demonstrating there are myriad ways to gauge water quality. The utility treats lake water to drinking-water quality at two upstream plants and has two major downstream wastewater treatment plants, Walnut Creek and South Austin Regional. At the plants, screens and other devices help remove large objects and separate out significant amounts of sludge, the utility says, with the remaining wastewater passing through aeration basins where microorganisms convert pollutants into solids that get treated as sludge at the Hornsby Bend Biosolids Management Plant. The liquid that remains gets passed to chlorine basins for disinfection, the utility says, and more filtration. Ultimately, a small amount of sulfur dioxide is added to remove the chlorine before much of the treated water is put into the river. By email, Leffingwell aide Amy Everhart advised us that the mayor drew on the utility’s assessment that water downstream of its wastewater plants is of higher quality than water upstream, "meaning the discharge is of better quality than the water upriver," she said. By email and in telephone interviews, utility officials pointed us to how the state rates the quality of sections of the river, which is broken into a chain of lakes by dams. According to a chart starting on Page 80 of the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards, Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake in the city are rated as "high" quality segments for aquatic life, a utility assistant director, Daryl Slusher, noted, while the section below Lady Bird Lake where Austin discharges most of its wastewater is rated more highly, as "exceptional." "This is one of the very rare instances where the overall water quality in a river segment downstream of a major urban area is classified as better than that of the upstream segment," Slusher said. Not so fast, an Austin environmental engineer said. Lauren Ross, recommended to us by Bunch, pointed out by email that monitoring by the Lower Colorado River Authority indicates distinct nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the river. In August 2012, for instance, the level of nitrogen at the Lake Austin dam upstream was rated "low," at 0.008 milligrams per liter, while the river below Austin was rated "high/critical" from Webberville to La Grange, with concentrations of 2.7 mg./liter to 6.4 mg./liter. Phosphorus levels tested "normal" at Lake Austin but were "high/critical" from Webberville to Smithville and "high" at La Grange, according to the authority. By telephone, Raj Bhattarai, who manages the utility’s division of environmental and regulatory services, said it’s understandable that water downstream would have higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, given the Austin region’s population and that nitrogen and phosphorus are components of human waste byproducts. Ross also suggested a look at differing levels of heavy metals upstream and downstream, which she said would indicate deterioration. The utility provided a chart showing average concentrations of 11 metals in Lake Austin and near the major treatment plants. Levels of arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, silver and zinc were the same or higher downstream. Levels of cadmium, nickel and mercury were the same, while levels of barium were lower downstream. We weren’t sure what to make of these measurements. Ross said she wasn’t prepared to say there were health effects. We asked the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for its analysis of differences between the water upstream and water returned to the river after wastewater treatment. By email, spokeswoman Andrea Morrow responded that agency experts consider six indicators directly comparable between water checked by the commission every few months at monitoring stations on Lady Bird Lake and Lake Austin and wastewater effluent as gauged by the Austin utility at treatment plants including the Walnut Creek and South Austin Regional facilities. According to a chart prepared by commission staff, both the water upstream and the effluent have similar, reasonable acidity/alkalinity and dissolved levels of oxygen. The utility’s effluent is of greater clarity, the chart suggests, and has lower E. coli levels, which can indicate fecal contamination and the potential for waterborne disease. However, the effluent has higher levels of phosphorus (as measured at two smaller plants, Morrow said) and ammonia-nitrogen, the latter of which can be toxic to aquatic life in overly high concentrations, though it typically nourishes plants and algae, Morrow said. Among six plants where effluent has been checked for ammonia-nitrogen, average levels ranged from 0.2 milligrams per liter to 0.9 milligrams per liter compared with permitted levels of 2 or 3 milligrams per liter, varying by location. Raw lake water, upstream, averaged 0.04 milligrams per liter for ammonia-nitrogen, the chart says. Morrow wrote: "These are only a fraction of water quality parameters that could potentially be compared between the two water types, but the reality is that available data allows only a handful to be evaluated." By the indicators, she summarized, "the effluent tends to be clearer and lower in bacteria levels, while the lake water" before it is taken in by the utility "is generally lower in nutrient concentrations. Dissolved oxygen and pH were comparable between the two types. So with respect to the statement that the effluent quality is higher than the source water, for some things it’s true, for others it’s not." Ross, speaking to the commission’s chart, said the utility does not check nitrogen levels of its effluent and "failing to monitor for wastewater effluent’s most significant contributions to stream degradation hides the true impact of Austin’s wastewater effluent on downstream water quality." Bhattarai said the utility measures what’s required to be measured under its state-granted permit. By email, Slusher said the utility doesn’t disagree with the commission analysis of individual elements in the wastewater effluent, though the big picture remains, he said, that the river downstream has judged of higher quality for aquatic life than Lake Austin. In contrast, Ross said the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus downstream signal the effluent is not of higher quality, though she also said she’s not saying that the utility is not doing a good job. We gathered more detail. In the last three months of 2012, the utility said by email, the effluent from the major treatment plants had about nine times the level of ammonia that Lake Austin had in late 2010, the last time the utility checked in that stretch, and more than 850 times the amount of nitrogen that Lake Austin had in 2010. Generally, Bhattarai said, the effluent can be of better quality than Lake Austin upstream, by certain parameters at certain times, but the utility doesn’t say that is always the case. Our ruling Leffingwell said Austin’s treated wastewater, put into the river, is of higher quality than water the city removes upstream for public use. Some indicators suggest the river below Austin is of higher quality for aquatic life than the water in Lake Austin, but other measurements suggest higher downstream levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. Besides, the mayor specified that the wastewater effluent is of higher quality than water in Lake Austin. The state’s analysis was that some elements of the effluent are better, some worse, with which the utility seemed to concur. This claim ultimately strikes us as oversimplifying a judgment that depends on which of many possible quality indicators is considered most significant. We rate it as Half True.

pomt-09768	White House Political Director Patrick Gaspard once served as the "right-hand man" for Bertha Lewis, who heads up ACORN.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/30/steve-doocy/beck-and-others-repeat-claim-white-house-political/	A throwaway line in a blog posting in May — which turns out to be wrong — provided just enough fodder to allow political pundits to brand a top White House official with the political scarlet letter A, for ACORN. Under the spotlight is Patrick Gaspard, director of the White House Office of Political Affairs. It's a high-level position. In fact, that's the title Karl Rove held in President George W. Bush's White House (though senior adviser David Axelrod is probably closer to Rove's role for President Barack Obama). Gaspard had kept a very low media profile until this week, when some political pundits began calling him ACORN's man in the White House. The hosts of Fox and Friends ran with the claim about Gaspard's alleged ties to ACORN in a Sept. 29, 2009, interview with Fox News commentator Glenn Beck. "The White House political director is a fellow by the name of Patrick Gaspard," said host Steve Doocy. "And he apparently has been in bed with ACORN and, in fact, Bertha Lewis, who heads up ACORN. He, Mr. Gaspard, was her right-hand man. "So does ACORN have somebody in the White House in one way or another?" Doocy asked. "The answer to that is yes," said Beck. "You know what's really weird is he was also one of the top guys at SEIU (Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, United Healthcare Workers East, the largest local union in America). SEIU and ACORN, the same organization . . . The president has zero credibility when he says, 'I haven't been following this ACORN thing.' This is his army, SEIU and ACORN." Fox News host Sean Hannity also ran with the story. "And now questions are being raised about a top White House adviser's connections to the group," Hannity said on his Sept. 28 show. "Now the director of the White House Office of Political Affairs, Patrick Gaspard, is said to be closely affiliated with ACORN and, according to the American Spectator, he previously worked as the political director for none other than Bertha Lewis, who is now the chief organizer of ACORN. "Sounds like ACORN has somebody on the inside of the White House. Now there's a real comforting thought." The accusations about Gaspard's employment at ACORN have their roots in an article written by Matthew Vadum for the American Spectator on Sept. 28 under the headline, "ACORN's Man in the White House." Vadum is a senior editor at Capital Research Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank that studies the politics of philanthropy. "Newly discovered evidence shows the radical advocacy group ACORN has a man in the Obama White House," Vadum's article begins. "This power behind the throne is longtime ACORN operative Patrick Gaspard." "Evidence shows that years before he joined the Obama administration, Gaspard was ACORN boss Bertha Lewis's political director in New York." So what is the evidence? Vadum cites a May 16, 2009, posting from ACORN founder Wade Rathke's "Chief Organizer" blog. Rathke resigned last year as "chief organizer" for ACORN amid speculation about his role in helping to conceal from the full board almost $1 million embezzeled from ACORN by his brother. Bertha Lewis, then head of New York ACORN, took Rathke's place. In May, Rathke wrote this on his blog: "Tell me that 1199's former political director, Patrick Gaspard (who was ACORN New York's political director before that) didn't reach out from the White House and help make that happen, and I'll tell you to take some remedial classes in 'politics 101.'" The part in parenthases comes from Rathke. But current ACORN officials say Rathke was wrong. "He (Gaspard) never worked for us," said Brian Kettenring, a spokesman for ACORN. It's a case of mistaken identity, Kettenring said. Rathke worked for ACORN national and not ACORN in New York. He clearly confused Gaspard with someone else, Kettenring said. Scott Levenson with the Advance Group, which does PR work for ACORN, echoed that in an e-mail saying, "There is NO accuracy to the fact that Patrick Gaspard ever worked for ACORN." And so we e-mailed Rathke. "I misspoke," Rathke responded. Rathke also addressed the issue in a postscript to a blog posting on Sept. 29. "Patrick was never on the staff of ACORN," Rathke wrote. "I double checked with people I still know there, and it appears that I dropped a stitch there. Hopefully my misstatement won’t lead to the White House throwing him in front of the bus in this rush to neo-McCarthyism that has become so prominent. In this case, my memory tricked me. I’m glad to carry the weight and simply say I made a mistake, and damned if I’m not sorry and hope no damage is done to a good man doing a hard job." Interestingly, Gaspard's brother, Michael Gaspard, works for the Advance Group. And again, the Advance Group in New York does communications work for ACORN. But Kettenring said he was not aware that Michael Gaspard has, himself, actually done any work for ACORN. But back to Patrick Gaspard. The White House provided a resume for him going back 20 years. It showed he worked for SEIU and the Howard Dean campaign, among other places, but had not worked for ACORN. We're not saying Gaspard has had no interaction with ACORN, or that he doesn't have ties to ACORN's Bertha Lewis. They both were involved in New York politics and SEIU and ACORN officials run in similar circles. In fact, in an April 28, 2009, story in Roll Call , Lewis is quoted as saying that while "we don't have our own special ACORN entrance at the White House or our own special hot line," she did say she has particularly good relationships with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Gaspard. The conservative Red State recently ran a story that Gaspard's contact info appears in Lewis' Rolodex, for whatever that's worth. But the claim here wasn't just that the two are friends. It's that Gaspard was employed by ACORN as Bertha Lewis' political director in New York. ACORN officials say he was not. And the source of that information, ACORN founder Wayne Rathke, said he misspoke when he made that claim in a blog posting. For their part, Doocy, Beck, Hannity and others are relying on the reporting of Vadum in the American Spectator . And Vadum relied on Rathke's blog posting. So the mistake is understandable. But in their zeal to paint an "A" on Gaspard's sweater, the pundits never made an effort to find out if it was right. And it wasn't. We rule the statement False.

pomt-06029	Rob Cornilles has disputed for two years a news story that said he said he would cut Social Security and Medicare programs before trimming the U.S. defense budget.	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/14/rob-cornilles/has-rob-cornilles-disputed-statement-daily-astoria/	A statement attributed to Rob Cornilles in an article in the Daily Astorian newspaper two years ago is inaccurate, and he has "disputed" it ever since. The article paraphrased Cornilles as saying he would cut Social Security and Medicare programs before trimming the U.S. defense budget. During the debate, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici brought up the article at last week’s debate and asked Cornilles what he would cut from Social Security and Medicare, and what criteria he would use. Cornilles responded: "Well, that quote that you reference in the Daily Astorian, I’ve disputed and have for two years. That’s not what I said." Say what? We talked to the reporter who wrote the story, Cassandra Profita, who now works for Oregon Public Broadcasting, and to Steve Forrester, the editor of the Daily Astorian. Profita stands by her story and said she never heard from Cornilles after it ran. Forrester said much the same thing: The story was accurate, he said, and "We heard nothing from Cornilles. He didn’t ask us for a correction." We asked the Cornilles campaign to provide evidence that the story was inaccurate at the time and that he disputed what it said. Cornilles doesn’t recall asking for a correction, or telling either the reporter or the editor that the story was wrong, according to his campaign manager Mary Anne Ostrom. But she provided videos from a September 2010 debate with David Wu, in which he denies saying he would cut entitlements, and a recent interview with KATU(2) in which Cornilles said he would cut defense spending before entitlements. However, it wasn’t until last week’s debate that Cornilles directly called the article into question. There is little to suggest the reporter got her story wrong. Cornilles has said in at least one previous debate and in a recent interview that he wouldn’t cut entitlements, but that doesn’t amount to disputing the story for two years. We rule the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13336	Says Donald Trump "never said that" more nations should get nuclear weapons.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/05/mike-pence/debate-mike-pence-claims-trump-never-said-more-nat/	Throughout the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate, Democratic candidate Tim Kaine repeatedly baited his Republican opponent Mike Pence to defend Donald Trump’s controversial remarks. In one instance, Kaine criticized Trump’s position on nuclear proliferation. Kaine claimed Trump said "more nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that." Pence responded, "Well, he never said that, senator." "He has absolutely said it," Kaine said. "Saudi Arabia. South Korea. Japan." Trump’s stated positions on nuclear proliferation are often contradictory, so we decided to lay them out for you here. But reading through these exchanges, it’s clear that Trump thinks it might not be such a bad thing if South Korea and Japan were to develop their own nuclear weapons, given the threat posed by North Korea. "Mr. Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have, but not that he supports them having those weapons," said Trump spokesman Steven Chung. Here are some of Trump’s key comments about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons. March 27, 2016 The New York Times asked Trump if he’d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. Trump responded, "At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that’s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem." He added later in the same interview: "If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us." March 29, 2016 CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, "If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?" As part of a winding response, Trump said that he both opposes nuclear proliferation ("No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any;" "I don't want more nuclear weapons") and supports some countries obtaining nuclear weapons for the first time. "Wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?" he asked Cooper. Cooper also asked Trump: "Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?" Trump: "Saudi Arabia, absolutely." Cooper: "You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?" Trump: "No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves, or they have to pay us." April 3, 2016 Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace asked Trump, "You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?" Trump: "In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes." Trump later added of Japan and South Korea, "Maybe they would be better off — including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." May 4, 2016 CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump, "You're ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers?" Trump responded, "I am prepared to, if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world." Our ruling Pence said Trump "never said" that more nations should get nuclear weapons. Trump has said some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be "better off" if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea.

pomt-10255	"Obama says Iran is a 'tiny' country, 'doesn't pose a serious threat.'"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/john-mccain/mccain-ad-repeats-error/	Republican John McCain has repeatedly questioned Democrat Barack Obama's familiarity with foreign affairs in the campaign for president. Because Iran threatens to become another hot spot, McCain launched a TV ad Wednesday challenging Obama as "dangerously unprepared to be president." What we're examining is the ad's claim, based on an Obama speech May 18 in Oregon, that Obama dismissed Iran as too "tiny" to represent a serious threat. The ad's announcer states: "Iran. Radical Islamic government. Known sponsors of terrorism. Developing nuclear capabilities to 'generate power' but threatening to eliminate Israel. Obama says Iran is a 'tiny' country, 'doesn't pose a serious threat.' Terrorism, destroying Israel, those aren't 'serious threats'? Obama – dangerously unprepared to be president." If this sounds familiar to you, it is. Back in May, McCain made this identical claim about this very same Obama speech when McCain gave an address to the National Restaurant Association in Chicago. If you remember all of that, then our ruling on this distortion will probably be familiar, too. Last time, we called McCain's claim False. While Obama did call Iran "tiny" and questioned whether it posed "a serious threat," we find that this new McCain ad mangles their context to the point of misrepresenting Obama's statement. Obama was speaking about whether to negotiate with Iran, which the Bush administration resisted. Obama noted that previous presidents had met with adversaries from the Soviet Union and China that were willing to destroy the United States, but that President Bush refused to meet directly with leaders of smaller global players such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. Rather than dismiss those countries as insignificant, Obama was urging direct talks to engage them. "Iran, Cuba, Venezuela -- these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union," Obama said. "They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying we're going to wipe you off the planet. And ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war, and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the Berlin Wall. Now, that has to be the kind of approach that we take. You know, Iran, they spend one-one hundredth of what we spend on the military. If Iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us, they wouldn't stand a chance. And we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen." We find the McCain ad, like the McCain speech before it, is grossly distorting Obama's remarks by suggesting that Obama was dismissing Iran as too small to be taken seriously as a threat. We find the claim in the McCain ad, like the McCain speech before it, to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-27T00:00:00	2008-08-27	['Iran', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-02500	Says North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis "supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/14/patriot-majority-usa/demcratic-group-says-nc-republican-senate-hopeful-/	A race in North Carolina has become one of the top battles in the war to control the U.S. Senate. Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., is trying to win a second term and help keep the Democrats in control of the chamber. But she is expected to face a tough race against one of several Republicans competing in the primary. One of the leading candidates is Thom Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House. Patriot Majority USA, a pro-Democratic group operating independently of the Hagan campaign, has begun to run ads against Tillis, who has already benefited from a blizzard of ads against Hagan that were paid for by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity. Here’s the narration of the ad: "In North Carolina, we put families first. But Senate candidate Thom Tillis sides with health insurance companies. He'd let them deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and raise rates for women needing mammograms. Tillis supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it, and force seniors to spend up to $1,700 more for prescriptions. He's with the special interests; hurting North Carolina families." We wondered whether it was true that Tillis "supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it." In making the claim, the ad cites articles from the Raleigh News & Observer and Reuters in 2012 about Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had just been tapped as Mitt Romney’s vice presidential nominee. The articles discussed how Ryan’s budget plan in 2011 would have made significant changes to the structure of Medicare. Under Ryan’s plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This proposal, known as "premium support," would have affected people who today are under 55 only. Democrats called it radical and argued that it shifted too much of Medicare’s financial burden to beneficiaries. It was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Democratic-controlled Senate. We should note that the ad’s characterization of Ryan’s plan is more measured than the version of the talking point used by many Democrats in 2011 that was our choice as that year’s Lie of the Year. That version was that Republicans would "end Medicare," period. We do wonder how many viewers would understand what the ad means by ending Medicare "as we know it," though Democrats use the phrase routinely to describe the Ryan plan. We’ve found the "as we know it" phrasing to be highly subjective. Since the original proposal from 2011 failed to be adopted by the Senate, Ryan has offered updated versions of the plan. The most recent iteration of Ryan’s plan is less far-reaching than the original. The current version offers seniors younger than 55 the opportunity to choose the premium support model, rather than a requirement. Even introducing the option of premium support would be a significant change to Medicare, but since beneficiaries would be able to remain on traditional Medicare without being penalized, it seems doubtful that, as the ad says, the Ryan plan "would end Medicare as we know it." The bigger issue, though, is whether Tillis supports the Ryan proposal's ideas on Medicare. Does he? We asked Tillis’ campaign manager and spokesman, Jordan Shaw, for Tillis’ position on the Ryan plan. "He has said that there are some good ideas in versions of the Ryan plan, but has never gone to this level of dedication to every aspect of a specific version," Shaw said. This is a pretty vague position. Still, it gives Tillis room to say that he might prefer the current version of the proposal, which, by virtue of being optional, doesn’t fit the ad’s underlying claim that Tillis definitively supports changing Medicare as we know it. We couldn't find any more specific evidence that Tillis supports or opposes Ryan's ideas for Medicare. Our ruling Patriot Majority USA said Tillis "supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it." Tillis has acknowledged supporting aspects of Paul Ryan’s budget plan, but he hasn’t specifically said whether or not he supports the original Medicare provision that would have made significant and mandatory changes to the program. Tillis could clear this up by more forthrightly stating his views on the matter. Still, the ad exaggerates by assigning a specific position to Tillis that he hasn't actually taken. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Patriot Majority USA	None	None	None	2014-02-14T11:47:17	2014-02-12	['None']
pomt-09248	Scott Maddox is a "lobbyist."	/florida/statements/2010/may/06/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-calls-scott-maddox-l-word-lobbyist/	U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam has taken to labeling his possible Democratic opponent for agriculture commissioner a lobbyist. [Insert shrieks and gasps here]. In fact, Putnam's campaign called Democrat and former Tallahassee Mayor Scott Maddox a "lobbyist bottom feeder," in a May 4, 2010, statement. Responding to news that Maddox's Tallahassee law firm had sued British Petroleum as a result of the oil spill growing in the Gulf of Mexico, Putnam campaign manager Trey McCarley said: “When in doubt, sue. As a result of his multiple losing campaigns for 3 of Florida’s 4 available Cabinet positions, Scott Maddox has confused job descriptions for the one he’s running for this time. While oil continues to pour out of the earth at a rate of 210,000 gallons per day, Scott Maddox runs to the courthouse to sue someone, anyone, in a desperate attempt to make money from misery. "The job of the Commissioner of Agriculture is to solve problems, to reduce our dependency on countries who hate us with homegrown crops that fuel our cars and power our homes and businesses. Once again Scott proves he’s a lobbyist bottom feeder running for a job he knows little about and cares for even less.” In a separate item, we're checking a claim that Maddox lost campaigns for three available Cabinet positions. In this item, we're going to see if Maddox is indeed a lobbyist, and if so, who he has represented. Putnam's campaign provided PolitiFact Florida with links to the state's online lobbyist registry. A lobbyist, for reference, is someone who attempts to influence the policy decisions of public officials on behalf of a client or interest. State lobbyists are required to register with the Florida Legislature each year and must file quarterly compensation reports listing clients and compensation ranges. Maddox registered as a lobbyist with the legislature in 2009, listing three clients -- the Leon County School Board, the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund and the Wakulla County Board of County Commissioners. Corresponding compensation reports from 2009 said those groups paid Maddox and his firm, Governance Inc. (it's also called Governance Services LLC), between $20,004 and $69,997 for lobbying services from Jan. 1-June 30. Maddox's name was removed as a Governance Inc. lobbyist in compensation reports starting July 1. Screven Watson, a Maddox adviser, said Maddox's work for the school board was to help get additional per-pupil funding while the police work was to protect police officer's pension plans. Watson said Maddox's work for Wakulla County was to fight proposed cuts in library funding to better Wakulla Springs. "If you want to call that bottom feeding, then have at it," Watson said. Maddox founded Governance, Watson said, but now is only a part owner in the consulting and lobbying business. Maddox's name and biography are listed on the Governance Inc. website. There are other instances of Maddox working as a lobbyist. In 2009, he visited several north Florida counties, asking elected officials to hire Governance to help counties fight for federal stimulus dollars. In 2008 and 2009, Maddox was registered as a lobbyist with Leon County. His lobbyist registration expired Sept. 30, 2009. His clients included Tallahassee apartment owner Arbor Properties, Inc., a Jacksonville energy company called Green Power Systems, developer Rockaway LLP and a company called M/A-COM Inc. And in 2004, Maddox received $10,000 to help a client win approval for a development proposal in Leon County that was reviled by many environmentalists. "We just hired Scott as a lobbyist to help us communicate to the government," Tallahassee developer Gordon Thames said at the time. "I thought maybe they'll listen to Scott and give him strong consideration -- maybe more so than if it was just Gordon up there." Maddox said he was a consultant for the project, not a lobbyist. Thames said he has hired Maddox on other projects. Watson said Maddox's primary income comes from work as a lawyer, but he also has lobbied for clients when needed. Maddox was not a registered state lobbyist during the 2010 session, state records show. And his Leon County lobbyist registration expired in September 2009. Putnam's campaign called Maddox a "lobbyist bottom feeder." We're not touching the bottom feeder part -- you can make up your own mind based on the clients we found that were represented by Maddox. But Maddox has made money as a lobbyist off and on for several years, representing a variety of clients. And though he's not currently registered as a lobbyist, Maddox is part owner in a firm that does state lobbying. That's enough in our minds to rate Putnam's claim that Maddox is a lobbyist True.

pomt-12513	"In the first two years and a couple months (as California treasurer), I have saved taxpayers and ratepayers over $5.2 billion."	/california/statements/2017/apr/26/john-chiang/has-treasurer-john-chiang-saved-california-taxpaye/	California Treasurer John Chiang is known as a fiscal watchdog. But has he saved state taxpayers more than $5 billion? Chiang made that claim on March 23, 2017 at a Sacramento forum for candidates in the 2018 California governor’s race. Here’s his full statement: "Today, as your state treasurer, I am your banker. And so, in the first two years and a couple months (as treasurer), I have saved taxpayers and ratepayers over $5.2 billion." Chiang’s office made a similar statement in a March 9, 2017 press release. It said a recent "refunding of existing bonds at a lower interest rate" had pushed the "total savings to the general public, including taxpayers, from bond refunding (to) approximately $5 billion since Treasurer Chiang took office in January 2015." That’s a lot of money, even in California where the state budget is nearly $180 billion. We wondered if Chiang’s claim at the forum was right, and whether there was more to this fiscal story? We set out on a fact check. Governor’s race Chiang is among several prominent Democrats vying to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include Antonio Villaraigosa, former Los Angeles mayor; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a former professional football player. PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims by candidates in the 2018 governor's race. Tracking the truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at politifactca@capradio.org, tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Our research At the forum, Chiang did not explain his claim or offer evidence that he’s saved taxpayers $5 billion. So, we asked his office. Deputy Treasurer Tim Schaefer told us that large figure represents future savings from refinanced state debt, not an existing pot of $5 billion. The total savings won’t materialize immediately, but rather will add up over decades as bonds are paid off at lower rates. Still, he said, Chiang "has been very aggressive since he was sworn into office in January 2015 to take advantage of a very favorable interest rate environment." The treasurer’s office also produced the chart below adding up the future savings, which it puts at $5.5 billion, based on action taken through mid April 2017. SOURCE: California Treasurer's Office Schaefer compared the treasurer’s efforts to homeowners refinancing a mortgage. "The fact that it’s over time doesn’t make it any less real," Schaefer continued. "The $5.5 billion that’s not being spent on interest costs and debt service to investors and to big Wall Street firms is $5.5 billion that will be available over time to Californians to provide the services and facilities and programs that they’ve said they need." Experts weigh in We spoke with several finance experts who said Chiang’s number is realistic, though his refinancing efforts aren’t unique. "Given the scale of California's financings and the continued low interest rate environment, it seems plausible that the state saved over $5 billion gross over many years into the future," Darien Shanske, a UC Davis law professor who has worked as a finance consultant to local governments, said by email. Jon Coupal, president of the fiscally-conservative Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, also said Chiang’s numbers are realistic, though he could not independently verify them. "Through refinancing, you can save substantial amounts of money just like when you’re refinancing your home mortgage," Coupal said, adding that Chiang has been "a good steward" of California’s tax dollars. At the same time, he said Chiang’s actions are no different from what any responsible treasurer would do. "It’s not out-of-the-box thinking," Coupal said. Bill Lockyer, who served as state treasurer from January 2007 through January 2015, also refinanced state debt resulting in 2.7 billion in future savings. Schaefer, the deputy treasurer, said Lockyer faced different financial conditions, including a spike in interest rates during the Great Recession that prevented additional refinancing. Our ruling California Treasurer John Chiang, a 2018 candidate for governor, recently claimed: "I have saved taxpayers and ratepayers over $5.2 billion," since being sworn into office in January 2015. Chiang’s eye-popping figure represents future savings from refinanced state bonds. And while experts say his number looks right, his timeline isn’t. He’s taken action that will pile up savings over future decades, a worthy accomplishment. Over time, that will free up money for other uses. Chiang is right about the total, but wrong to imply this huge amount of taxpayer money is already in the bank. We rate Chiang’s statement Half True.

pomt-04704	"By the time (Mitt Romney) left office, Massachusetts was 47th in the nation in job creation."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/04/deval-patrick/did-mitt-romneys-massachusetts-rank-47th-job-creat/	Repeating a favorite talking point, speakers at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., took aim at Mitt Romney’s job-creation record as governor of Massachusetts. "By the time he left office, Massachusetts was 47th in the nation in job creation," said Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, the Democrat who succeeded Romney in 2006. This claim has been an old chestnut on the campaign trail since last year; we first rated it when President Barack Obama’s campaign adviser, David Axelrod, made it in June 2011. We rated it Half True then, and Half True again a year later. It became such a common talking point for Democrats the Romney campaign came up with a counterattack -- that Massachusetts under Romney initially ranked last among states in job growth, but by the end of his governorship, "we were in the middle of the pack." We gave this claim a Half True as well. As usual, we will follow our usual approach of looking at the claim in two parts: First, are the numbers correct, and second, how much was the change because of Romney's policies? We used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. We used figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, we used the data for December of each year as a baseline. We found that from December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth. (We calculated that by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states.) Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse. So the number is correct. But does Romney deserve credit for the job situation? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy. For instance, the country was coming out of a recession when Romney took office. And it's likely that Massachusetts emerged more slowly from that recession because its pre-recession numbers were disproportionately inflated by the technology bubble, said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state. A lot of those tech jobs never came back. Widmer warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, echoed that point. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," he said. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Our rating It’s correct that Massachusetts ranked 47th of 50 in job creation on Romney’s watch. However, the Obama camp -- like the Romney camp in its rebuttal -- exaggerates Romney’s influence on the state job market. Governors simply don't have that much impact. We rated this claim Half True more than a year ago, and today, we still think it merits a Half True.	None	Deval Patrick	None	None	None	2012-09-04T22:45:17	2012-09-04	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-03967	"Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of (Medicare’s) health care costs."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/14/barack-obama/obama-says-health-care-law-already-slowing-down-me/	In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama warned those who love Medicare that changes to the program are needed, because rising health care costs for seniors are "the biggest driver of our long-term debt." If changes aren’t made, Obama warned, "our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations." Obama said he was open to changes such as asking wealthier seniors to pay more, and paying hospitals and doctors to be more efficient. But he also took credit for his signature health care law. "Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs," he said. From our previous fact-checking, we know that many of the major provisions of the 2010 health care law have yet to take effect. So how can the law already be slowing the growth of health care costs? We decided to check it out. Slowing spending As Obama made his speech, the White House posted slides on its website to back up Obama’s key points. For his health care comment, a chart showed Medicare spending projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, both before the passage of the Affordable Care Act and afterward. The chart shows the future growth noticeably slowing after the law’s passage. (View the chart here.) The numbers were part of the CBO's regular update on the country’s economic outlook and the federal budget. We reviewed the latest numbers, which were released on Feb. 5, 2013, as well as news coverage of the findings. In its report, the CBO says that health care spending has grown much more slowly in recent years, both for federal programs and overall, than it did in previous years. In response to that slowing growth, the CBO reduced its projections for future Medicare spending. Since March 2010, the CBO has lowered its projections for Medicare spending in 2020 by roughly 15 percent, the report said. However, the CBO did not specifically credit the Affordable Care Act as the reason for lowering the projections. Some aspects of the law, the report said, will slightly increase federal outlays in Medicare and Medicaid. But the CBO did say it was revising estimates based on actual reduced growth in health care spending since at least 2010. Health care law phasing in As we noted above, the health care law isn’t fully in effect yet. A new requirement for Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty won't take effect until 2014, for example. For the Medicare program, the law includes both spending and cost savings. Beneficiaries can now receive expanded prescription drug coverage and preventive care without co-pays under the law; but those benefits increase costs. On the other hand, the law has also put in place limits on payments to private insurance companies that operate the Medicare Advantage program, which saves money. Changes in payments to hospitals have also already started. That means financial incentives for hospitals that are more efficient and penalties for those that are not. When we asked White House staff for more evidence to support Obama’s comments, they pointed us to a January memo from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which specifically pointed to limits on Medicare Advantage and changes to hospital payments. Finally, a controversial Medicare payments commission -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- would make recommendations to make payments more efficient, reducing spending. But that board hasn’t yet convened, and it may never convene if Medicare meets pre-determined budget targets. Trends in health care spending Getting back to health care costs, it’s clear that the growth in spending is going down, both for overall health spending and Medicare. But what’s driving it? We found that experts consider it something of an interesting puzzle. Some blame the recession and the economy. When people feel poor, they don’t spend as much, even on health care. Under this scenario, health care spending will rebound when the economy is better. Others say the overall health care system is changing, moving away from payments for each procedure and test, and moving toward payments for better overall outcomes. The health care law includes provisions to encourage that switch. If this is the case, reduced spending growth should become permanent. We found a diversity of opinion on what’s going on here, and whether Obama’s comment was accurate. "Medicare spending slowed down in 2010-12, so this is not just a projection," said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. "Much of the law is not yet implemented, yet some Affordable Care Act provisions to control Medicare spending -- like changes in what Medicare Advantage plans are paid -- are already in effect, and were expected to produce savings during 2011-12." Other experts are dubious that the law is having much effect at all, such as Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health care issues for President George W. Bush. "The reduction in overall health costs has had above all to do with the weak economy, and while CBO does suggest that its projections of the effects of the Affordable Care Act have changed in a few ways since it passed in 2010 (causing both upward and downward revisions of the effects on costs), those are all projections for after 2014, when the key substantive provisions of the law will take effect," he said. "None of them could be used to suggest that ‘already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.’" The Obama administration argues that it’s more than a weak economy driving reductions in spending. "The economic recession may have contributed to the 2010-12 decrease in growth in per beneficiary spending as consumers use less care due to its cost," says the HHS memo. "However, as almost all Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage and thus face relatively low out-of-pocket costs, it seems unlikely that consumer behavior alone is responsible for the slow growth in Medicare spending." Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, said the health care system is responding to the new law already. Insurance companies and other payers know about the new payment methods the law supports, and they are planning accordingly, she said. "It’s really not at all a situation of the lights turning on Jan. 1, 2014. The lights have been on for the past six months," she said. Still, determining causes behind the spending slowdown is no easy task, warned Bradley Herring, professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. "I think most people think the slowdown we’ve seen in health care spending over the last three years has been due to the recession. But no one’s 100 percent sure why that happened," he said. Things will get even more complicated for health policy researchers as the law deploys changes to payments and other pilot programs. Researchers will have to hypothesize how much costs decline compared with if the law had not passed. "Those are going to be difficult things to measure," Herring said. We’ll close with comments from Douglas Elmendorf, head of the Congressional Budget Office. He spoke to reporters when the office released new numbers on Feb. 5: "So, health spending has grown slowly over the past few years, both in federal programs and in the rest of the health care systems. We think that part of that owes to the recession and the loss of income in wealth, but we think that a significant part of that probably does not stem from the recession, probably arises from structural changes in the health care system. "The critical question is, whether those structural changes are very transitory changes or whether they will persist. We're doing analysis to that question. We're talking with outside experts who are also investigating the same question. I think the short summary of that is that we don't know." Our ruling Obama said, "Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs." He’s right that health care costs are slowing, but there’s not conclusive evidence that the law is helping. The nonpartisan reports from the Congressional Budget Office don’t specifically say that, and some aspects of the health law translate to increased spending. Among health care experts, we found debate over how much the Affordable Care Act is contributing to an overall slowdown in health spending. Some argue that the recession is making people spend less on health care. Others say the health care system is changing to become more efficient. Many say that more study is needed. Obama’s taking credit for more than he can prove. Overall, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-02-14T16:25:27	2013-02-12	['None']
pomt-01485	Says Mark Warner told PolitiFact National's "Lie of the Year" in 2013.	/virginia/statements/2014/sep/28/ed-gillespie/gillespie/	A TV ad by Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, indicates incumbent Mark Warner has received PolitFact’s most ignoble rating: "The Lie of the Year." The commercial starts with footage from a videotape Warner posted on Aug. 10, 2009, laying out his qualified support for health care reform. At the time, Congress was considering Obamacare -- also known as the Affordable Care Act -- and there was loud debate over whether the bill would strip people of health insurance policies they liked and wanted to keep. "Let me make clear, I’m not going to support a health care reform plan that’s going to take away health care that you’ve got right now or a health care plan that you like," Warner said in the 2009 video. While Warner is saying this, the words "LIE OF THE YEAR" appear in red capital letters and, underneath them, in black caps, is the attribution to "POLITIFACT, 12/12/13." The Lie of the Year is awarded each December by our colleagues at PolitiFact National. Gillespie’s claim that Warner took the title last year was news to us because the dubious distinction went to President Barack Obama’s statements that under that ACA, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it." Obama had repeated that vow at least 37 times since 2009, including during his re-election campaign in 2012. Those promises unraveled last fall when insurers informed millions of Americans who buy their own coverage -- as opposed to getting it through work -- that their policies were being cancelled because they did not meet the ACA’s minimum standards. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, essentially told us the ad claim is fair because the promises by Warner and Obama were identical. Logan said the Lie of the Year was not directed specifically at the president, but to anyone who made the like-it, keep-it claim. PolitiFact National’s article announcing the Lie of the Year, however, only refers to the White House’s repetition of the false claim. It notes that when insurers started cancelling policies last fall, Obama’s first reaction was to deny he made a blanket promises that people could keep their pre-existing coverage. "For all those reasons, PolitiFact has named `If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,’ the Lie of the Year for 2013,’" our colleagues wrote. PolitiFact National also specified that the distinction went to Obama’s statements in a follow-up article -- which Logan also sent us -- detailing national reaction to the award. So it’s clear that Gillespie’s campaign took liberty in interpreting the PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year. There are important distinctions between Obama’s comments and Warner’s. Gillespie’s campaign is circulating tapes of two events where Warner pledged not to vote for a bill that would take away existing insurance plans: the video used in the ad and one from a September 2009 town hall meeting in Fredericksburg. Both of those recordings occurred when the ACA was being drafted. Warner was speaking about his conditions for supporting legislation; he was not offering a long-term guarantee on how the law would work. Warner wound up voting for a bill that contained language shielding existing policies from meeting the minimum ACA coverage standards, but leaving it to the White House to fill in the details. Obama subsequently imposed tough regulations that blocked insurers from adjusting the grandfathered plans to market conditions or selling them to new customers, all but assuring the death of substandard policies. Warner says he was surprised by the president’s actions. Obama repeated his like-it, keep-it line long after he imposed regulations that guaranteed the law wouldn’t work that way. The White House published the rules in June 2010 with a chart estimating between 39 percent and 69 percent of employers with grandfathered plans would relinquish them by 2013. Unlike Obama, we’ve come across no record of Warner making a like-it, keep-it statement past 2009. Our ruling Gillespie’s ad indicates PolitiFact National branded Warner with the "Lie of the Year" in 2013 for promising four years earlier that he wouldn’t vote for health care reforms that took away insurance plans people like. PolitiFact National never mentioned Warner in handing out the award. In articles and videos, our colleagues focused the award on Obama’s insistence over the years that under the ACA, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it." The statements and the circumstances behind them are not clones. The president had far greater power in shaping the law that bears his name than the senator. Warner didn’t repeat his pledge after he voted for the ACA in 2009. Obama continued to make his vow long after he added regulations to the law in mid-2010 that guaranteed the ACA would end some pre-existing insurance plans. The clear implication of Gillespie’s ad -- that PolitiFact cited Warner for telling the Lie of the Year -- is simply False.	None	Ed Gillespie	None	None	None	2014-09-28T00:00:00	2014-09-09	['None']
pomt-06642	Says "160,000 kids stay home every day because they are afraid to go to school because of bullying."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/15/valerie-vainieri-huttle/assemblywoman-valerie-vainieri-huttle-says-160000-/	Students dream up lots of reasons to skip school. But tens of thousands of children are staying out of the classroom every day to avoid bullying, according to Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle. The Bergen County Democrat, a primary sponsor of an anti-bullying law that is being put into practice in New Jersey this school year, said those students need to feel safe. "A hundred and sixty thousand kids stay home every day because they are afraid to go to school because of bullying," Vainieri Huttle said at a Sept. 6 news conference in Fort Lee. "These are the kids that we are concerned with this morning. These are the kids that we need to give that message to this morning, that they will be protected." Vainieri Huttle repeated the statistic in an interview on NJTV that aired the same day as the news conference, but applied the number to New Jersey. "And it certainly now is a mandate for all school districts to follow a course in anti-bullying and helping these kids get through those difficult years when, quite frankly, in New Jersey, there's like 160,000 kids that stay home from school each day because they're afraid to go to school," she said. "Because of bullying?" NJTV’s Joanna Caplan Gagis asked Vainieri Huttle. "Because of bullying," Vainieri Huttle replied. Vainieri Huttle’s spokeswoman, Andrea Katz, said the assemblywoman "misspoke" on NJTV. "She meant the United States," Katz said. Still, the statistic is questionable even on a national level. Katz sent us several sources to support Vainieri Huttle’s claim, including a 2010 fact sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and several other reports, news articles and websites. "It’s a really commonly cited number," she said. "It’s out there." And it is. A number of federal, state and local agencies have referenced the number, citing various organizations and individuals as the source. Katherine Cowan, a spokeswoman for the National Association of School Psychologists, confirmed the number came from her organization, "but nearly 20 years ago." "The statistic is extremely old and not valid in 2011," said Cowan. "It’s one of those things that the media really loved and grabbed onto and took on a life of its own." Cowan said researchers calculated the number in the early 1990s from an annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but did not have specifics on how the statistic was determined. The CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System survey, which has been conducted since 1991, asks high school students several health-related questions. One survey question asks students if they did not go to school in the last 30 days because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. A survey released in 2010 found 5 percent of high school students nationwide stayed home from school on at least one day for those reasons. But the question doesn’t ask why students felt unsafe, so the statistic could also apply to students who live in a high-crime neighborhood or fear crossing a dangerous intersection on their walk to school. Though the statistic on students staying home because of bullying is no longer valid, Cowan said the impetus behind the fact -- that bullying has widespread implications -- is validated by a lot of research. Deborah Temkin, research and policy coordinator for bullying prevention initiatives at the U.S. Department of Education, said her department recognizes the bullying statistic is "likely not up to date." But, she said, "there are quite a few students who stay home from school each and every day," because of bullying. We found no other statistic that quantified the number of students who stay home because of bullying. In response to our findings, Vainieri Huttle said, "There is no doubt that harassment, intimidation, and bullying have a serious impact on the ability of New Jersey students to thrive academically and socially." Our ruling Vainieri Huttle claimed that 160,000 students stay home every day because they are afraid of being bullied at school. A spokeswoman for the National Association of School Psychologists confirmed her organization is the source of the statistic, but said the number is "extremely old" and "not valid." Vainieri Huttle used the flawed -- though widely cited, even by the CDC in 2010 -- statistic to illustrate the impact of bullying. We don’t dispute that bullying is a serious concern, but Vainieri Huttle needs better numbers to prove her point. We rate Vainieri Huttle’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-03872	Says Jeb Bush "flip-flop-flip(ped) on immigration."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/08/debbie-wasserman-schultz/jeb-bush-flip-flop-immigration-pathway-citizenship/	Jeb Bush was for it before he was against it. And now he’s for it again? That’s the refrain these days on where the former Florida governor stands on creating a process for people in the U.S. illegally to eventually become American citizens -- or something secondary to that, such as legal residents. Since his new book Immigration Wars was released this week, Bush has been accused of changing position. "@JebBush a flip-flop-flip on immigration? Wow. I fashioned you more of a baseball player than a gymnast. My bad. #notsurprisedatall," Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz quipped in a tweet on March 5, 2013. Bush, 60, has enjoyed distinction as an elder statesman in the Republican party since leaving elected office in 2007. But with the release of his book, Bush has indicated he’s considering a future presidential run ("I’m not saying yes, I’m just not saying no," he told MSNBC). We found that Bush, now a definite maybe for 2016, has indeed said conflicting things over time about eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants. ‘Start deporting people’ Bush, a Texas native who calls Florida his adopted home state, plunged into politics in 1994 with a run to unseat Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles. Back then, there was virtually no talk of turning millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S. into citizens. When asked what to do with them, Bush had one word: deportation. In an interview with the Miami Herald, he was asked, "There are something like 4 million illegals in the United States . . . . What would you do with the ones that are here?" "Start deporting people," he answered. "We have an asylum process . . . . It shouldn't take five years. We need to reform our system. ... I don't blame them for wanting to come to our country, but I don't believe it's necessarily our responsibility to allow them to come in." But he also made it clear he was not in favor of closing the border. "I believe in open, legal immigration," Bush said. He lost that election, but stormed back four years later and won the governor’s race. By 2006, Bush was well-established as Florida’s chief executive, and he wasn’t afraid to criticize members of his own party. His views, it seems, had evolved beyond "start deporting people." In an email exchange with the Los Angeles Times that year, Bush weighed in with support for proposed federal immigration reform legislation, calling it "just plain wrong" to charge illegal immigrants with a felony and opposed "penalizing the children of illegal immigrants" by denying them U.S. citizenship. He endorsed the idea of a broad guest-worker program, but the Los Angeles Times noted then that he "offered no specificity on how to treat current immigrants and whether they should be granted a path to citizenship." In 2009, Bush co-chaired a bipartisan task force for the Council on Foreign Relations, which studied immigration challenges and came up with a set of proposals. In an interview about the group’s recommendations, Bush said that if reform doesn’t happen, "we ignore an issue that needs to be solved, which is what do we do with people who are here permanently, who have made contributions, who if given a path to citizenship would do what's right and take the necessary steps to achieve legalized status and citizenship." However, in a separate op-ed about the task force recommendations, Bush simply said reform should include "a fair and orderly way to allow many of those currently living here illegally to earn the right to remain legally." 2012: Bush stakes his position Last year, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declared that he would pursue an immigration policy so austere that illegal immigrants would self-deport -- a position later faulted for Republicans’ poor showing among Hispanic voters. Bush, meanwhile, continued his call for more welcoming rhetoric and a "broader approach" to legislation that dealt with issues beyond border security and cracking down on illegal migration. In an interview last summer with Charlie Rose, he made a clear declaration that he favored citizenship. "You have to deal with this issue. You can’t ignore it. And so, either a path to citizenship, which I would support and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives; Or a path to legalization, a path to residency of some kind," he said. Fast forward past the election. It’s now 2013, and Republicans are smarting from their losses and pledging to remake their platform into one that appeals more to Hispanics and other minorities. A bipartisan group of Senators is working on reform legislation that includes citizenship. But Bush’s book, which reportedly went to the printer in late 2012, split the concepts of citizenship and legal residency. And in print, Bush opposed citizenship and instead proposed "a path to permanent legal resident status." "Permanent residency in this context, however, should not lead to citizenship. It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences — in this case, that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship. ... A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage." Illegal immigrants, he and co-author Clint Bolick wrote, could return to their homeland and apply for citizenship through regular channels. After immediately catching heat over the book -- and how it conflicts with his past position -- Bush began softening up. "We wrote this book last year, not this year, and we proposed a path to legalization, so anybody that had come illegally would have immediately a path to legalization," Bush said on MSNBC. He added: "If you can craft that in law, where you can have a path to citizenship where there isn’t an incentive for people to come illegally, I’m for it. I don’t have a problem with that." He told CNN: "I have supported both — both a path to legalization or a path to citizenship — with the underlying principle being that there should be no incentive for people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally." Jaryn Emhof, Bush’s communications director, told PolitiFact in an email, "The book outlines a proposal by which immigrants -- whether they are coming to work temporarily, to go to school, to live and work as permanent residents or seeking citizenship -- can do so through an immigration process that would be much more open than before. So, it is talking about future immigrants, not those currently here illegally." We think it’s clear, however, that the book’s passages about legal status vs. citizenship very clearly refer to those already here. Our ruling Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- admittedly a bit player in this story but for her tweet -- said Bush has made a "flip-flop-flip" on immigration. Here’s a quick chronology: • Early in his political life, Bush expressed a hard-line, deportation-driven opinion and made no mention of granting citizenship or legal status to illegal immigrants. • Sometime between 2009 and 2012, he "flipped" to being in favor of a path to citizenship. He supported federal legislation in 2007 that allowed children of illegal immigrants to become citizens, and wrote frequently that Republicans should adopt a more welcoming approach. In June 2012, he clearly articulated support for a pathway to citizenship. • His "flop" came this month with the release of his book, in which he explicitly opposed citizenship, calling it an "undeserving reward" for people who came here illegally. • That was followed by a quick "flip" back to support of either citizenship or permanent legal status in the heat of television interviews. Over the years Bush has said he favored citizenship or legal residency, demonstrating openness to proposals that could be considered within a wider reform effort. So at times he has embraced both, or either one. There’s no doubt, though, that the Jeb Bush in the book had a different opinion from the Jeb Bush on the book tour.

pomt-04397	Says Bill Nelson voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare.	/florida/statements/2012/oct/17/connie-mack/mack-says-nelson-voted-cut-700-billion-medicare/	It is a favored line among Republican candidates to charge their Democratic opponents with cutting Medicare. U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, leveled the attack at least four times in the first half hour of Wednesday’s Florida U.S. Senate debate. Mack said incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson "voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare." PolitiFact has addressed this claim many times, in many ways, in many states. Obamacare refers to the Affordable Care Act. It does not literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. We should note that the Republican plan championed by GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan also trims Medicare spending by almost exactly the same amount. The spending reductions fall largely on insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. The overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program’s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. $716 billion The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $716 billion. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. One impact of the law is it extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by eight years to 2024. There is a connection between the Medicare cost savings and the health care law. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. Some of the new spending goes toward Medicare recipients. It increases coverage for prescription drugs and offers preventive care at no cost to the patient. More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending. The health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That, too, offsets the new spending. Our ruling Mack said Nelson voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare, to pay for Obamacare. Medicare spending increases under Obamacare, but over 10 years, it rises more slowly that it would without the law. The money comes from reducing payments to insurance companies and hospitals. Part of the savings go to reduce prescription drug payments for Medicare recipients, as well as to provide free preventive care. Overall, the lower spending extends the solvency of Medicare by eight years. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-03302	"Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area."	/florida/statements/2013/jul/30/dream-defenders/over-12000-school-kids-were-arrested-florida-it-ma/	Meet the Dream Defenders -- a group of young people camped out in front of the office of Gov. Rick Scott seeking to overturn Florida’s "stand your ground" law and draw attention to issues such as racial profiling and arrests of school children. The group has been attracting national attention in the wake of the July 13 acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighborhood watchman, in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012. Martin’s case has shined a spotlight on the intersection of race on the criminal justice system and school discipline. (Martin was serving an out-of-school suspension when he was shot while walking to his father’s home after buying Skittles and a drink.) On July 22, Florida’s Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Justice, Wansley Walters, met with the Dream Defenders to talk about how to keep children out of the criminal justice system. "Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida," said Monique Gillum, one of the leaders of Dream Defenders during the meeting. "It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area." Arrest data on Florida students To back up her claim, Gillum pointed to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice report that states that 12,520 youth were arrested for school-related arrests during the 2011-12 year. (School-related includes arrests at school, the bus or bus stop, and school-sponsored events.) About two-thirds were for misdemeanors. The department pointed us to the same report to show that the number of youth school-related arrests have declined 48 percent since the 2004-05 school year. One reason for the decline is that the majority of Florida school districts have started using civil citations for non-violent misdemeanors. The citations include penalties such as community service. If the student complies, no arrest goes on their record. Being arrested at school can be traumatic. Even if the arrest doesn’t ultimately lead to a conviction, it can still hurt students because they may have to disclose it on job or college applications. The Miami-Dade school district, the largest in the state and the one where Martin was a student, was the first to implement civil citations -- and that could be why it had far fewer arrests than several smaller districts. (Walters was at the Miami-Dade County Juvenile Services Department at the time and led the effort to push for civil citations.) The report shows school-related arrests by sheer numbers and by rate per 1,000 students in counties in 2011-12. We will cite a few examples: Miami-Dade: 552, three per 1,000 Broward: 1,062, eight per 1,000 Hillsborough: 1,046, 10 per 1,000 Pinellas: 846, 15 per 1,000 Pasco: 316, 9 per 1,000 Though the numbers of arrests statewide dropped in recent years after the state relaxed its "zero tolerance" policy, critics say schools have still gone too far in criminalizing typical youthful behavior. We found arrests for infractions such as throwing spitballs, hitting someone with a tootsie pop or even for repeatedly "passing gas." (The 13-year-old boy busted for flatulence never went before a judge; the Martin County school district told us the case was "diverted/dropped with no record for the student.") "The vast majority of children being arrested in schools are not committing criminal acts," Walters told the Orlando Sentinel earlier this year. National comparison data lacking So the 12,000 figure isn’t in dispute. But comparing Florida’s school-related arrests to the rest of the nation was far more complicated. National "data-keeping in this realm is indeed pretty awful," said Kevin G. Welner, professor and director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. That sentiment was echoed by multiple experts we interviewed. Also, Florida does a better job than most states at compiling the data. An expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center said the state has the most comprehensive data in the nation. The Dream Defenders sent us an article from Ebony, which stated, "While Florida is not alone in turning to police to discipline young people, it has the distinction of being the nation’s leader in school-based arrests." Ebony linked to a 2013 article in Color Lines, a magazine that focuses on issues pertaining to race. Its report stated: "Last year, Florida produced the highest documented number of school-based arrests in the country — and that number was an improvement over previous years." (One expert we interviewed noted the important qualifier in that sentence: documented. As we’ll see, little is documented in this area.) Gillum directed us to a 2011 report about Florida school arrests written by the Advancement Project, a national civil rights group, along with the ACLU in Florida and the NAACP. "Florida still has the highest documented number of school-based referrals to law enforcement in the country," states the report. A footnote had this to say: "Currently, this data is not collected nationwide. Many individual states report this information, but no other state reports as many school-based referrals to law enforcement as Florida." We couldn't get a definitive answer from the group about how many states actually did report data. "The report should have conveyed Florida’s data is the highest on record," Advancement Project spokeswoman Jennifer Farmer told PolitiFact Florida. "It may not be the highest in the country but it's highest on record." We found some data is collected at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. But that data appears to have significant gaps and inconsistencies. Daniel Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California, pointed out a few examples of questionable numbers, including Los Angeles, which had zero referrals or arrests in 2009. Broward County had 6,640 referrals to law enforcement, but 0 arrests, while Miami-Dade had 1,670 referrals to law enforcement and 10 arrests. No matter the ranking, "Florida has a very serious issue with overly punitive discipline and over-reliance on law enforcement that harms children and adolescents in the state, and is especially harmful to children of color," Losen said. Our ruling Dream Defenders said, "Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area." The number about Florida is correct: There were 12,520 students arrested at schools in 2011-12, according to the state Department of Juvenile Justice. But the Dream Defenders failed to prove that the number makes Florida the nation’s leader in school-related arrests. This appears to be a case of the state getting a bad rap because of its rare decision to publish comprehensive data. Multiple experts said that comprehensive data for state-by-state comparisons is lacking. That makes it difficult to declare Florida’s ranking for school-related arrests. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14996	Dan Gecker voted to "double vehicle registration fees, costing (Chesterfield) county residents over $6 million annually."	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/12/glen-sturtevant/glen-sturtevant-says-dan-gecker-voted-double-car-r/	Time and again, Republican Glen Sturtevant is telling Chesterfield County voters whom to blame for doubling their car registration fees. Democrat Dan Gecker "voted to double vehicle registration fees, costing county residents $6 million annually in additional fees," Sturtevant says in at least three campaign mailers in the state Senate’s 10th District. Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member, and Gecker, a Chesterfield supervisor, are squaring off in a key race that could determine which political party controls the state Senate, which now has a 21-19 GOP majority. They are seeking to replace longtime Republican incumbent John Watkins, who is not seeking re-election. A Sturtevant TV ad features a bike racer pedaling hard while the narrator says Gecker is in "a race to raise your taxes." Among the ensuing charges is that Gecker "voted" to "double vehicle registration fees, costing us $6 million in one year." We investigated whether Gecker really did vote to double the fee. Matt Brown, campaign manager for Sturtevant, told us the claim is based on Gecker’s actions last year, when the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors was considering the county’s 2014-15 capital improvement plan and its budget. Among the proposals was to increase the county’s $20 car registration fee to $40, to raise $7.5 million for local transportation needs that the state would match. The proposal was controversial and, at Gecker’s request during a supervisors meeting April 23, 2014, it was pulled from the capital improvement plan and voted on separately. The $20 increase passed, 3-2, with Gecker voting against it. A tape of the meeting shows Gecker offered no explanation at the time of his vote. But about 10 minutes later, he said it should be a higher priority for the county to dedicate long-term revenues for clean-water programs mandated by the federal government than to raise fees for transportation. Gecker did not push for the clean water funding, however, saying he realized his view was in the minority. Given Gecker’s clear vote against the fee increase, what evidence does Sturtevant offer that his opponent actually voted for it? Brown, in an email, replied that Gecker later that same April day voted for the entire capital improvement plan — which funds long-term construction projects — and then for the county’s operating budget. The two are connected, because revenues from the car registration fee flow into the county’s operating budget and then are allocated to the capital improvement plan. Brown said this counts as two Gecker votes for the raised fee. We should point out that the 134-page capital improvement plan was filled with line items for projects totaling $848 million over five years. The 208-page operating budget funded $766 million of services, including education, public safety and health programs. Gecker told us that while he didn’t agree with every line item, he supported the overall benefits of the spending plans. Brown cited a third vote, as well, that occurred Feb. 26, 2014 — almost two months before the budget was approved. Gecker concurred in the Chesterfield board’s unanimous vote to advertise all fee and tax rate increases being considered in the budget — including the car registration increase — and to set a public hearing on them March 26. It should be noted that this is a required step in budget deliberations and that the mere advertisement of possible tax rate increases doesn’t obligate local board or council members ultimately to support them. Our ruling Sturtevant says Gecker "voted to double vehicle registration fees, costing county residents $6 million annually in additional fees." The simple truth is just the opposite. When the $20 increase came up for a vote before the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors in April 2014, Gecker opposed it. Despite his opposition, it passed on a 3-2 vote. Sturtevant, in trying to justify his claim, dismisses this obvious vote. His campaign instead argues that Gecker subsequently voted to pass massive spending plans that fund all of the county’s public services and public improvement projects. The new registration fees were a tiny part of these plans. The Sturtevant camp also notes that Gecker, in 2014, voted to advertise that the board was considering the $20 increase. But that’s not tantamount to voting in support of the increase. Local governing boards are required to give notice for a public hearing whenever a fee or tax increase is on the table. Keep your eye on the ball. Again, the only time the fee increase came up for a direct vote, Gecker opposed it. We rate Sturtevant’s claim False.

pomt-07776	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in his budget repair bill "is showing that no stone goes unturned as he asks everyone to tighten their belts."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/22/reince-priebus/rnc-chairman-reince-priebus-says-wisconsin-gov-sco/	Under Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed budget repair bill, there is no question that teachers and many other public employees would pay more for their pensions and health care. The plan, especially provisions that would curtail collective bargaining rights for public employee unions, has drawn massive protests in Madison. As the debate was heating up, newly named Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus -- former leader of the Wisconsin GOP -- offered his support for Walker in a Feb. 18, 2011, e-mail statement. He argued sharing the cost in the face of a deficit was the least that state employees could do. "Gov. Walker is showing he, like so many Republicans across the country, has the courage to have the adult conversations our country wants and deserves," Priebus said. "He is showing that no stone goes unturned as he asks everyone to tighten their belts so we can get our fiscal train back on the tracks." The debate in Madison has many facets -- and we’ve been tracking statements from all sides. We rated as True a Walker statement from his January 2011 "state of the state" speech that state workers could pay twice as much for health care and it would still be half the national average. We rated as Pants on Fire Walker’s statement that his plan leaves collective bargaining rights "fully intact." This item is about a different piece of the debate. Is Priebus right when he says Walker is asking "everyone to tighten their belts"? Let’s start with the plan itself, which clearly treats some groups of public employees differently. For starters, the bill specifically does not apply to police, firefighters and state troopers. Those public safety unions would continue to bargain for benefits under current laws, while other unions would lose the right to bargain on benefits and working conditions. Critics say those unions are being rewarded for their support of Walker, but this PolitiFact item found the picture is more complicated. The governor says the differing treatment is necessary, to ensure government can function in an emergency. Priebus’ office didn’t respond to a request to discuss his statement or what he meant when he said "everyone" is being asked to tighten belts. Some may read it as meaning everyone in the state, not just state employees. That, too, clearly is not true. The bill does not directly affect pay, benefits or negotiating rights for anyone outside state and local government. Indeed, Walker has pledged not to raise taxes and has argued the changes are needed precisely so individual taxpayers do not pay more. It is too soon to say, though, what will happen when the next two-year budget -- for the period starting July 1, 2011 -- is in place. Cuts in aid to schools and local government could push some extra costs onto local taxpayers, if the governing bodies choose to raise taxes and fees to recoup any loss in state aid. Let’s return to the original statement: Priebus argued Walker is asking "everyone to tighten their belts." But the proposal clearly exempts some public employee unions from any changes. Walker himself has said the differing treatment is necessary and justifiable. We rate Priebus’ statement False.

pomt-06659	Takes credit for "reining in" state spending when he was governor.	/virginia/statements/2011/sep/12/george-allen/allen-says-he-reined-state-spending-governor/	Republican George Allen is promising his unrelenting effort to curb federal spending if he’s elected to the U.S. Senate next year. He says he’ll bring to Washington the same kind of "sweeping reform" he brought to Virginia as governor from 1994 to 1998. His campaign web site says that when Allen was governor, "He challenged critics and sentiment that suggested it couldn’t be done, reining in government spending and substantially reducing the size of the state workforce." Last week, we looked at Allen’s claim he "substantially reduced" the state workforce and rated it Mostly True. Although there was a 9 percent drop in the number of bureaucrats during Allen’s administration, the state’s reliance on private contractors grew. In this fact check, we’ll examine Allen’s assertion that he reined in state spending. The claim runs into instant trouble because, by any measure, overall state spending increased significantly during his administration. Allen’s major effort to slash the budget and offer a tax cut was thwarted by Democrats who controlled the General Assembly. When Allen took office in January 1994, he inherited an overall $14.7 billion budget for the state fiscal year that started the previous July 1. At the end of his term in January 1998, he left behind a $20.7 billion proposed budget for the fiscal year that started the following July 1. That means Allen endorsed $6 billion in additional spending when he was governor -- a 40.7 percent increase. But looking at overall spending may be unfair. Slightly more than half of outlays during Allen’s years came from the non-general fund, over which a governor has limited control. The fund consists of earmarked revenues such as college tuition and federal highway grants. A better gauge comes from examining the general fund, which supports public education, health programs and public safety. It’s mostly supported by state income and sales taxes. The general fund was almost $6.8 billion when Allen took office. At the end of his term, he proposed a $9.9 billion general fund budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1998. That means Allen endorsed $3.1 billion in additional general fund spending when he was governor -- a 45.6.percent rise. How does Allen square the increase with his claim that he reined in state spending? Allen’s advisers say the claim does not imply that bottom-line spending went down during his term or that the former governor even slowed an historic pattern of general fund budget growth. They say the statement simply means Allen streamlined specific parts of Virginia’s government. They point to his reduction of the workforce, his repeal of many regulations and his successful initiative to reduce welfare rolls by requiring recipients to find work. "When you look at spending, you can’t just look at the bottom line because the economy improved so much when he was governor," said Bill Riggs, Allen’s campaign spokesman. "What you need to do is look at specific reforms." Mike Thomas, Allen’s campaign manager, offered a similar view. "I can’t recall a single time when George Allen said he was going to cut the state budget," he said. "He said he was going to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending." Although 45.6 percent general fund growth under Allen may sound gigantic, in reality, it’s about average for a Virginia governor. The general fund budget has grown by 479 percent over the last 30 years, from almost $2.7 billion in 1981 to almost $15.5 billion this fiscal year. Many factors explain the expansion: population has grown, creating greater revenues and a greater demand for services; Medicaid costs have increased dramatically, often by 10 percent a year; and inflation. Allen tried to slow the growth by proposing a $2.1 billion tax cut in early 1995. The measure was opposed by the business community and defeated by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. After that point, Allen had little choice but to spend the revenues coming in. Thomas noted that a number of general fund expenditures during Allen’s administration did not expand the reach of Virginia’s government. For example: *A settlement with federal employees who were unfairly taxed by the state cost roughly $300 million. *The cost of the state’s mandated share of funding public education rose by more than $1 billion. *Medicaid costs rose by $244 million. *Allen was required to deposit $214 million in the state’s Rainy Day Fund. Thomas also pointed out that in Allen’s final budget proposal, he left a $260 million down payment to help his successor, Republican Jim Gilmore, keep a campaign pledge to phase out the car tax. Allen’s major spending initiative was a $400 million prison building program to keep his campaign promises to abolish parole and lengthen criminal sentencing. Our ruling: Allen takes credit for "reining in state spending" when he was governor. In fact, general fund spending grew by 46.8 percent from the budget Allen inherited when he was inaugurated in January 1994, and the budget he recommended before leaving office in January 1998. Even if you subtract about $1.75 billion in spending increases Allen aides say he was required to authorize, the general fund budget would have increased 20 percent under Allen’s watch. Allen’s advisers says the statement does not imply that the former governor reduced the budget’s bottom line or slowed its historic growth pattern. They say it simply means that Allen streamlined certain programs. Sure, Allen’s attempt to pass an historic tax cut in 1995 was thwarted by rival Democrats who controlled the General Assembly that year. Allen could accurately say he fought to curb spending. But Allen says he reined it in. That creates an impression the bottom line shrank or was stunted in growth. We rate the statement False.

pomt-03026	Says "(t)his 12 year council 'Seat-warmer' has never chaired, vice chaired, or led a single Council committee meeting."	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/11/bill-powell/council-candidate-errs-about-incumbents-resume/	An Atlanta City Council hopeful is attempting to raise his own profile by suggesting the incumbent is nowhere to be found at City Hall. Worse yet, she’s done little in her 12 years on the council. "Where’s CARLA? Everyone’s present at City Hall, except CARLA," read a glossy flier by Bill Powell, who’s running for the District 1 seat on the council, currently represented by three-term veteran Carla Smith. Powell criticized Smith’s actions on some issues in the district and included a claim that seemed ripe for a fact check. "This 12 year council ‘Seat-warmer’ has never chaired, vice chaired, or led a single Council committee meeting," Powell’s flier says. PolitiFact Georgia saw the flier earlier this week. The flier makes Smith appear to be a do-nothing councilwoman who needs to go, but the facts tell a vastly different story concerning whether or not she’s ever served as committee chair. The Atlanta City Council has seven committees to review legislation before it goes to a vote before the entire council. The committees typically meet twice a month at City Hall and listen to questions, concerns and criticism from residents about city services and pending legislation. The committees are community development/human resources, finance, public safety, transportation, utilities, zoning and the Committee on Council, which deals with council administrative issues. Each committee has a chair and a vice chair. The positions are appointed by the council’s president and serve throughout a calendar year. Committee chairs hold some power because they can allow or deny legislation to come up for a vote. In short, they’re important positions. Smith was first elected to the council in 2001. Her east Atlanta district includes neighborhoods such as Grant Park, Lakewood and Peoplestown as well as citywide attractions, Zoo Atlanta and the Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum. She’s seeking a fourth term on the council. Powell, a self-employed transportation consultant, is one of two candidates running against Smith. The third candidate in the race is Robert Welsh, budget manager for the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. In 2002, Smith said she was vice chair of the council’s transportation committee. In December of that year, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Council President Cathy Woolard appointed Smith to chair the Committee on Council. "I'm thrilled and excited," the AJC quoted Smith in December 2002. "I couldn't be more pleased. I'm going to do the best job I can. It will be a fun committee to chair." Smith held that post for two years, she said. In 2003, Smith was picked to lead a committee that looked into the city’s policy on street name changes, in response to the flurry of paperwork City Hall was receiving to honor civic and political leaders, such as the late Mayor Ivan Allen. In 2006, Smith was chair of the council’s zoning committee. The committee grappled with a temporary ban on some residential construction in four northeast Atlanta neighborhoods. The following year, Smith was chair of the council’s utilities committee, which primarily deals with water and sewer issues. Smith led that committee for three years. Smith was quoted in several AJC articles in her capacity as chairwoman. Clearly, Smith chaired some council committees. So how could Powell’s flier be so off-base? The candidate said he was given inaccurate information from someone at City Hall when he went there to research Smith’s positions. "I was informed that she did not ever chair or vice chair during her 12 years," Powell said in an email. "I find this most disturbing as it was never my intention to mislead the voters on the facts." Powell apologized and said he planned to issue a retraction. Smith, who said she had not heard from Powell, said the flier contained several inaccurate claims about herself as well as Welsh. "He is the candidate," she said. "He should check and double-check all of his information." Powell could have done more research, such as reading Smith’s biography on the City Council’s website. It has information about committees she has chaired. He admitted the error. This claim, obviously, is False.	None	Bill Powell	None	None	None	2013-10-11T06:00:00	2013-10-08	['None']
pomt-00774	Wisconsin’s attorney general and state treasurer ordered the daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson not to discuss climate change on state time.	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/10/next-generation-climate-action-committee/group-says-wisconsin-ordered-daughter-earth-day-fo/	Two weeks before the 45th anniversary of Earth Day, Tia Nelson, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, was again the topic of a contentious meeting of the agency’s board. It’s been that way for several months at the obscure public lands agency, which is overseen by three board members -- Attorney General Brad Schimel, state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Douglas La Follette, a Democrat. The 10-employee agency is in charge of managing some of the state's public land and operates a trust that provides funding for school libraries and makes loans to municipalities and school districts. The board has been suggested as a potential source of bonds to help finance a new Milwaukee Bucks arena. Since Adamczyk won election in November 2014, he has raised questions about Nelson’s performance and her background as an environmentalist. He requested years of her phone and travel records and unsuccessfully tried to get her fired at the March 3, 2015 meeting. Schimel and La Follette voted down a motion by Adamczyk to remove Nelson, daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson. Tia Nelson’s performance came up again at the April 7, 2015 board meeting, and not long after the meeting NextGen Climate, a group that says its aim is to bring "climate change to the forefront of American politics," posted an item on its blog saying Nelson had been muzzled by the public lands board. The group said Nelson had been banned from "engaging in global warming or climate change" work on state time and compared the action to a move in Florida to block state workers from using the term "climate change." Did the board really order Nelson -- and other agency employees -- not to talk about climate change on state time? Some background In 2007-’08, Nelson was tapped by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, to co-chair a state global warming task force. During that time she also held her position at the public lands agency. Not long after the global warming report was issued, Nelson traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify about climate change at a congressional hearing and discussed the report in other settings. Adamczyk has called her task force work theft of the state’s time and also criticized Nelson and La Follette for recently attending a land commissioners’ conference in Phoenix. At the April 7 meeting, Nelson defended herself and said she served on the task force at the request of Doyle. She said she hasn't actively worked on global warming since the task force disbanded. "I have never lobbied on climate change on state time in the entire 10 years I've been at the board of commissioners," she said. After her comments, Adamczyk asked for approval of a resolution to "prohibit staff from engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time." Adamczyk and Schimel voted in favor, La Follette voted no. We contacted Nelson and she declined to discuss the board’s action -- or climate change. She did note she was going to be on vacation April 22, which is Earth Day, giving a talk about her father at his alma mater, San Jose State University. Our rating The advocacy group NextGen Climate says Nelson, daughter of the founder of Earth Day, is under orders not to discuss global warming on state time. That’s indeed the wording of the resolution approved 2-1 by the agency’s board. We rate the statement True.

pomt-08244	"Social Security is indeed a Ponzi scheme."	/texas/statements/2010/nov/14/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-social-security-ponzi-scheme/	Touring behind his new book, Texas Gov. Rick Perry saluted Texas counties that opted out of the Social Security system and then echoed a Republican talking point likening the federal Social Security system to a deceptive criminal enterprise. On Nov. 8, Perry told host Greta Van Susteren of Fox News that back in 1982, two or three Texas counties happily bowed out of Social Security and are now "going to take care of their people in the future. You can't say that for Social Security. It is indeed a Ponzi scheme." Perry also called Social Security a Ponzi scheme at an Oct. 10 stop in San Antonio, according to a news article in the San Antonio Express-News. He circles the same idea in his book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington, writing that any proclaimed surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund is illusory because "Washington has already blown the money. You can think of it as an IOU that we're all going to have to pay... this means that our debt will increase all the faster as we pay out more than we take in... Ponzi schemes — like the one that sent Bernard Madoff to prison — are illegal in this country for a reason. They are fraudulent systems designed to take in a lot of money at the front and pay out none in the end... Deceptive accounting has hoodwinked the American public into thinking that Social Security is a retirement system and financially sound, when clearly it is not." Perry also writes that he pictures "an America ascendant" by 2026: "I see an entitlement system that has been totally and honestly revamped... There will be a retirement safety net that is no longer set up like an illegal Ponzi scheme, but rather will allow individuals to own and control their own retirement." Wondering what Social Security has to do with Ponzi schemes, we found that topic has been well covered, including in fact-checking articles by PolitiFact teams in Wisconsin and Rhode Island. We'll get to those. First, what's a Ponzi scheme? According to an online post by the Social Security Administration, the term originates with Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100 percent in 90 days on investments in foreign postal coupons. After first-round investors harvested those profits, others flocked to Ponzi, unaware his "profits" consisted of money paid in by other investors. "The reason that this is a scheme and not an investment strategy, is that the geometric progression it depends on is unsustainable," the government post says. "You must continually get more and more new people into the system to pay off the promises to the earlier members." In contrast, the administration says, Social Security is more like a "pay-as-you-go" system transferring payroll tax payments by American workers to American retirees. Its web post closes: "The first modern social insurance program began in Germany in 1889 and has been in continuous operation for more than 100 years. The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days." We asked Perry for back-up on his Ponzi scheme description. His campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, pointed us to his book, adding in an e-mail: "This year, Social Security is expected to pay out more in benefits than it collects in taxes. Americans today are being forced to pay for a program that they will no longer see any benefit from or return on their investment as it currently stands, similar to a Ponzi scheme." Earlier this year, we quoted the Congressional Budget Office's projection that this year Social Security would deliver more in benefit checks than it's projected to gather in taxes. But we also rated False a statement by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, that Social Security is out of money. In its latest annual report, issued in August, the Trustees of Social Security and Medicare trust funds confirms that tax income is running short of benefits paid. Regardless, the report says, benefit payments will not be exhausted until 2037 because until then the administration can cover the expected difference with investments made via the Social Security trust fund. News and opinion articles gauging Social Security as a Ponzi scheme date back at least to the mid-1990s. In a December 1995 op-ed article for The Washington Post, James K. Glassman (of late, executive director of the George W. Bush Institute at Southern Methodist University) wrote: "Workers think that they are investing for their own accounts, but actually their payroll taxes go straight to current retirees. There's something called a 'trust fund,' but it's small, and it's filled with dubious non-negotiable government bonds, not real assets." In a 1996 article posted on the Slate website, liberal commentator Michael Kinsley agreed that Social Security "is a Ponzi scheme. Payments from later customers finance payouts to earlier customers. The ratio of retirees taking money out to workers putting money in is rising, due to 1) people having fewer children, and 2) people living longer." More recently, Mitchell Zuckoff, a Boston University journalism professor who has written a book on Ponzi, noted critical dissimilarities between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme, which by definition is both fraudulent and unsustainable. "First, in the case of Social Security, no one is being misled," Zuckoff's January 2009 article in Fortune magazine says. "...Social Security is exactly what it claims to be: A mandatory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed on their incomes to pay benefits, with no promises of huge returns." Second, he writes, "A Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is eventually exhausted. That's when the last people to participate are out of luck; the music stops and there's nowhere to sit. It's true that Social Security faces a huge burden — and a significant, long-term financing problem — in light of retiring Baby Boomers...But Social Security can be, and has been, tweaked and modified to reflect changes in the size of the taxpaying workforce and the number of beneficiaries. It would take great political will, but the government could change benefit formulas or take other steps, like increasing taxes, to keep the system from failing." Third, his article says, "Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme... At the height of the Great Depression, our society (see "Social") resolved to create a safety net (see "Security") in the form of a social insurance policy that would pay modest benefits to retirees, the disabled and the survivors of deceased workers.By design, that means a certain amount of wealth transfer, with richer workers subsidizing poorer ones.That might rankle, but it's not fraud... None of this is to suggest that Social Security is a perfect system or that there aren't sizeable problems facing the incoming administration and Congress. But it's not a Ponzi scheme. And Ponzi himself, who died in a hospital charity ward with only enough money for his burial, would never have recognized it as his own." And how did our sister PolitiFacts sort this out? In September, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated Barely True GOP U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson's statement that Washington politicians "run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme." Despite a superficial similarity, Social Security is obligated to pay benefits, a commitment the shysters who run Ponzi schemes do not share. What’s more, participants are aware of how the system is operating. It’s all public. In a Ponzi, investors have no clue where their money is going and are told lies by the promoters. PolitiFact Rhode Island later rated False Republican U.S. House candidate John Loughlin's statement that "Social Security is a Ponzi scheme." Their analysis zeroed in on the lack of an element of deceit to how the 75-year-old Social Security program takes in money and pays it out. We'd add that Social Security is accountable to Congress and the American people while a Ponzi scheme is a crime. We rate Perry's statement False.

pomt-10070	Energy nominee Steven Chu has called coal "his worst nightmare."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/18/james-inhofe/chu-said-all-worlds-coal-burned-worst-nightmare/	Steven Chu, Barack Obama's nominee for energy secretary, is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and a director of one of the prestigious national laboratories in the Energy Department. His biography on the Web site of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory describes him as "one of the nation’s foremost and outspoken advocates for scientific solutions to the twin problems of global warming and the need for carbon-neutral renewable sources of energy." But the Senate's foremost skeptic on global warming expressed concern. "Steven Chu has made troubling comments," said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. "Chu has unabashedly called coal — which generates over 50 percent of our nation’s electricity — his 'worst nightmare.'" We've never had nightmares about coal or any other fossil fuel, so we wondered whether Chu made the comment and what he meant by it. It is indisputable that Chu called coal his worst nightmare. In fact, you can watch him make the comment during a videotaped talk on YouTube. (He says "Coal is my worst nightmare" at the 28-minute, 16-second mark.) It was part of a long speech he gave on renewable energy, and the video makes it clear he was talking about worldwide coal use. The context was a discussion of global warming, and he was talking about global coal supplies and what it meant for global warming. He was not talking about domestic utilities or energy prices for consumers. At his confirmation hearing, Chu was asked about the "nightmare" comment, and he explained it this way: "I said that in the following context. If the world continues to use coal the way we are using it today, and the world — I mean in particular not only the United States but China, India and Russia — then it is a pretty bad dream. That is to say in China, for example, they have not yet begun to even trap the sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides. There's mercury. There's particulate matter, as well as carbon dioxide. "But I also say many times in my talks that coal is an abundant resource in the world. Two-thirds of the known coal reserves in the world lie in only four countries: the United States, first and foremost, followed by India, China and Russia. India, China, Russia and the United States, I believe, will not turn their back on coal. "So it is imperative that we figure out a way to use coal as cleanly as possible. And so for that reason — and I think — again, my optimism as scientist — we will develop those technologies to capture a large fraction of the carbon dioxide that's emitted in coal plants and to safely sequester them. So if confirmed as secretary of energy, I will work very hard to extensively develop these technologies, so that the United States and the rest of the world can use it." We watched the video, and this seems like an accurate description of the context of his remarks. So Inhofe's "nightmare" comment is literally accurate, but it divorces Chu's words of important context. Still, there are aspects of coal that genuinely disturb Chu. We deduct points for that lack of context and find Inhofe's charge Mostly True.	None	James Inhofe	None	None	None	2009-01-18T15:37:04	2008-12-15	['Steven_Chu']
pomt-14283	Says his campaign has released his past tax returns.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/06/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-has-released-few-tax-returns-compar/	Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took some heat from CNN’s Jake Tapper during an April 3 interview. The topic: The degree of public transparency Sanders has provided for his tax returns. Tapper brought up the topic: "I’m kind of surprised that you haven’t gone further on transparency. You released the summary page of your 2014 tax returns. Hillary Clinton has posted on her website the last eight years of her personal returns, all of the returns. Before the New York primary, will you match her? Will you post your full returns for the last eight years?" Sanders responded, "You know who does our tax returns? My wife does our tax returns. We’ve been a little bit busy lately. So we will get out as much information as we can. There ain’t going to be very much exciting in that. I get a salary from the United States Senate, you know, there’s not going to be anything new in it that people haven’t seen for the last many years, but we will get it out as soon as we can." Tapper wasn’t satisfied. "But nobody has seen them at all, I guess, is the point, and whether or not there’s anything exciting in them...." At this point, Sanders interjected, "No, that is not true. That is not true. Of course, we have released them in the past. Our financial situation, to the best of my knowledge, has not changed very much, but we will get out all of that information as soon as we can." How transparent has Sanders been with his tax past returns? Not very, compared with others in the 2016 presidential field. Here’s a closer look. As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt. Here’s a look at what their current archive of the 2016 candidates looks like: In other words, among the candidates still in the race, Sanders’ releases are less extensive than anybody’s but Donald Trump. (Trump, too, has faced criticism for refusing to share his returns.) And Sanders’ shortcomings are actually bigger than the screenshot above would suggest. The 2014 filings Sanders released consist of just the first two summary pages of his Form 1040 and the equivalent summary pages from his home-state Vermont tax form. Why does this matter? Unlike most of the other candidates, Sanders has not released the succeeding pages -- the nitty gritty detail of things like charitable donations and other types of itemized deductions. For instance, Clinton’s release for tax year 2014 is 44 pages long, or more than 10 times the length of Sanders’ for the same year. It’s worth noting that Sanders, as a member of Congress, files annual financial disclosures, which are accessible online back to 2012. And as a presidential candidate, he also files financial disclosure documents to the Federal Election Commission. But tax returns are much more detailed. And despite what Sanders said in the exchange with Tapper, his campaign did not provide PolitiFact with any earlier, publicly available tax forms. The campaign told the Post that it has not released any other tax returns prior to 2014. (The campaign did tell PolitiFact that they would release his 2015 returns once they are filed.) Tax and disclosure experts we contacted agreed that Sanders’ current disclosures are weak by historical standards. "If I filed the first two pages of my return with the IRS, it would not take long for them to ding me," said Kenneth A. Gross of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and a specialist in political disclosure and ethics. "There is a lot of information on the pages following the cover pages." Joseph J. Thorndike, the Tax Analysts official who heads the Tax History Project, agreed. Sanders "has not, in fact, released his most recent tax return," Thorndike said. "He has released a portion of that return. The IRS would not accept a Form 1040 as a complete return and neither should voters. Also, it’s worth noting that Sanders has not released any portion of his older returns. … If Mitt Romney had tried to release an incomplete return in 2012, the media would never have accepted it." Our ruling Sanders told Tapper that his campaign has released his past tax returns. Sanders said his 2015 return is forthcoming, and he has made other types of disclosures in the past, including congressional and presidential-candidate filings. But his releases of prior-year tax forms -- the specific documents Tapper asked about -- have been limited in several ways. He’s only released information for one year, which pales compared to most other recent presidential candidates, and even that year’s release only includes a summary page, not the full return. We rate his claim False. UPDATE: As he had promised, Sanders released his full 2014 tax return on April 15, 2016. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ba140e0d-4c11-436d-ad29-15e562ba5a98	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-06T12:16:54	2016-04-03	['None']
pomt-08494	On a cap-and-trade plan.	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/09/scott-bruun/scott-bruun-sponsored-cap-and-trade-legislation-tw/	Three years ago, Rep. Scott Bruun, R-West Linn, was the co-sponsor of a bill that would have installed a statewide cap-and-trade system for Oregon electric utilities. The bill had the two major hallmarks of most cap-and-trade legislation, according to Jon Isaacs, the executive director of the Oregon League of Conservation Voters: It set a limit on emissions and then established a system by which companies could trade credits. The bill didn’t go anywhere, but a year later, in an ultimately successful effort to pick up the endorsement of the league, Bruun was happy to highlight his effort and pledged to give cap-and-trade another ago in the 2009 session. In fact, on the league’s endorsement questionnaire he listed it as the first of nine environmental issues he planned to highlight if re-elected to the Oregon House. "Rep. (Ben) Cannon and I were co-sponsors of cap and trade legislation in 2007," he wrote. "I look forward to working hard for this in 2009. I have been studying the issue intensely and am even more convinced of its appropriateness." That answer alone, Isaacs said, was one of the primary reasons why the league ended up supporting Bruun’s reelection to the Oregon House. Two years have passed since then, so what is Bruun saying these days -- you know, now that he’s campaigning for national office? "Cap and trade will cause a major tax increase for everybody in American, and will export millions of United States jobs, and will do nothing to solve the" problem of global warming, he said in February 2010 at a forum in Salem hosted by The 9/12 Project Salem. Alee Lockman, Bruun’s spokeswoman, says the congressional candidate wasn’t happy with the national legislation, which was crafted on a largely partisan basis unlike the Oregon legislation. She also noted in an e-mail that Bruun has had a change of heart in terms of the effectiveness of cap and trade. "Scott has found that the policy is flawed, and ultimately believes that the federal cap-and-trade policy is not effective." It’s clear to PolitiFact Oregon that Bruun’s views on the topic have changed pretty dramatically. We give him a Full Flop.	None	Scott Bruun	None	None	None	2010-10-09T10:23:52	2010-09-22	['None']
pomt-08734	"Congress and President Obama have accumulated more debt since he took office than the total amount of debt accumulated during the first 200 years of the United States existence."	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/01/chip-rogers/rogers-blames-president-obama-3-trillion-debt/	Republicans have portrayed President Barack Obama as a big spender. And though state Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers (R-Woodstock) doesn't politic on the federal level, he's joined the chorus blaming the president for the national debt's growth. In a flier recently received by the AJC's PolitiFact Georgia, Rogers said, "Congress and President Obama have accumulated more debt since he took office than the total amount of debt accumulated during the first 200 years of the United States existence." More than the first 200 years of the country? That sounds like a lot of debt. We decided to check it out. Rogers is running against Democrat Patrick Thompson in November. PolitiFact Georgia discussed Rogers' contention with two federal budget experts: James Horney of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation, which has conservative roots. These groups rarely agree with each other, but these experts do agree that Rogers' comparison doesn't work. "We're not big supporters of President Obama here," Riedl said, "but I do agree that it's not a fair assessment." First, some basics about the national debt. Basically, it's the total debt the country has accumulated over time. If a country spends $5 million more than it takes in for 20 years, its national debt is $100 million. There are two different kinds of that debt. There's the gross national debt, which includes money the government borrows from its own pools of money like the Social Security fund. The White House estimates that debt will be about $13.8 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. There's also the national debt held by the public, a figures economists prefer to use.That's the amount the government borrows from individuals, banks, and state, local and foreign governments with the promise of paying them back. It will be about $9.3 trillion by the end of the fiscal year. Economists agree that both debt figures are troubling amounts, but not just because they're such massive amounts of money. It's because the debt held by the public amounts to 63.6percent of the gross domestic product, a figure that represents the value of all goods and services produced in one year within the U.S. economy. That's why when economists think about the size of the national debt, they typically describe it as a percentage of GDP. It tells them more about how much of a problem that debt poses. If a family owes $60,000 but earns $6 million a year, it's not in big trouble. But if it owes $60,000 and makes $60,000, it's got problems. Rogers didn't use this widely accepted approach when he calculated how much the national debt had grown under Obama's watch. Instead, he took the gross national debt from 1989, 200 years after the federal government was formed. This amount was about $2.9 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department figures. Then Rogers took the gross national debt for January 2009, when Obama came into office, which was about $10.6 trillion, and subtracted it from projected national debt for fiscal year 2010. He came up with $3 trillion, which is more than 1989's debt. (We came up with slightly more: $3.2 trillion.) $2.9 trillion is less than $3 trillion. Therefore, Congress and President Obama have accumulated more debt since he took office than the total during the first 200 years of the United States existence. Q.E.D.? Not really. Federal budget experts pointed out some big problems with Rogers' approach. First is that 1989 isn't the best year for a comparison if you're trying to figure out Obama's impact on the national debt, Horney said. A lot of debt has accumulated in the generation since then, with help from both sides of the aisle. "It's convenient to cut it off in '89 and ignore what's happened since then," Horney said. Second is that it's not fair to compare the 1989 and 2010 debt totals. Those numbers aren't adjusted for inflation. Furthermore, the comparison doesn't take into account that our current economy is very different than it was 21 years ago. The population has grown, the importance of various industries has shifted, and overall economic conditions have changed. Back then, the economy was growing. Now, we're experiencing our worst downturn since the Great Depression. Third is that it's not fair to blame Obama for budgets that he didn't control, Riedl said. The 2009 budget went into effect Oct. 1, 2008, almost four months before Obama took office. The experts we consulted suggested different approaches. By Riedl's reckoning, for 2009, you can hold Obama responsible for discretionary spending he signed off on after he took office, plus the $220 billion of the stimulus package spent that year. You can also pin the debt for fiscal year 2010 on him as well. This comes to about $2.1 trillion, according to Riedl, which is less than the national debt's dollar amount in 1989. Horney is reluctant to assign a hard number to Obama's debt responsibility. It can vary dramatically based upon what share of responsibility you think he has in Iraq spending, recovery measures and other budget items. Horney has a different approach. From Jan. 16, 2009, the Friday before Obama took office, to Aug. 24, the national debt has grown by about $2.5 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. That amounts to roughly 17 percent of the country's GDP. That's far less than the debt accumulated by 1989, when the national debt amounted to 40.6percent of the country's GDP. Conservative and liberal experts consulted by PolitiFact Georgia think Rogers took the wrong approach. Riedl called it "kind of an unfair comparison." Horney called it "misleading." Rogers said the statement wasn't designed to be misleading. He looked up the facts to make sure they were correct. "The statement itself, word for word, is factual," Rogers said. While the numbers used by Rogers are generally correct, his calculation doesn't make sense. Rogers ignored critical facts about the economy and national debt that budget analysts of all stripes routinely take into account. Plus, he blamed Obama for debt he had little, if anything, to do with. When those experts performed what they consider a more fair and accurate comparison, neither concluded that the debt Obama ran up is equal to the amount run up by this country during its first 200 years. Both came up with much lower figures. We rate Rogers' statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Chip Rogers	None	None	None	2010-09-01T06:00:00	2010-08-19	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama', 'United_States_Congress']
pomt-07086	Phil Puckett "voted no on sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far not once, but twice."	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/24/republican-party-virginia/virginia-gop-says-phil-puckett-voted-against-sendi/	The Republican Party of Virginia says state Sen. Phillip P. Puckett, D-Russell, is whistling and cheering as President Barack Obama kills the coal industry. The RPV’s attack comes on the heels of warnings from American Electric Power, one of the nation’s largest utilities, that new air quality rules from the Environmental Protection Agency could force the company to shutter as many as 20 coal-fired plants and fire hundreds of employees. That’s added fuel to the fire in coal-rich Southwest Virginia, which is served by Applachian Power, an AEP subsidiary. The state GOP has declared war on the EPA for imposing "job-killing" regulations and is calling Puckett "President Obama’s lead cheerleader in Southwest Virginia." "He talks a good game on his campaign website, but when Southwest Virginia needed Puckett to stand up for coal jobs, Puckett stood up for President Obama," a recent release from the RPV says. "Phil voted NO on sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far, not once, but twice." We wondered whether Puckett really did vote twice to back the EPA. To support the claim, the state GOP points to two identical pieces of legislation from this year’s General Assembly session -- one introduced in the House, the other in the Senate. The measures, however, make no mention of the EPA or coal. The GOP release refers to two resolutions calling for a "repeal amendment" that were killed in the Democrat-controlled state Senate. The measures called for a U.S. constitutional amendment that would nullify any federal law or regulation at the vote of two-thirds of all the state legislatures. What does that have to do with coal jobs? Not a lot, other than the fact that if the repeal amendment survived an extremely difficult path to national ratification, then one of the countless regulations two-thirds of the state legislatures could theoretically agree to repeal might be an EPA rule affecting the coal industry. To date, North Dakota has the only state legislature that has endorsed the repeal amendment, according to Raegan Weber, director of public affairs for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization promoting the constitutional change. Garren Shipley, a spokesman for the state GOP, said the intent of the repeal amendment was to alert Washington it is encroaching on states’ rights. That’s different from his party’s claim that the amendment's purpose was "sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far" in regulating the coal industry. The next problem is that Puckett technically did not vote against the resolution twice -- or even once. The measure introduced on the Senate side, sponsored by Sen. Ryan T. McDougle, R-Hanover, was killed by a seven-member subcommittee of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee. Puckett is not a member of the subcommittee and did not participate in its vote. Puckett is a member, however, of the full 15-member Privileges and Elections Committee. Its chairman -- Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax -- declined a procedural request by GOP senators to resurrect the resolution and allow it to be considered by the full committee. When Republicans objected, Puckett voted with other Democrats to uphold Howell’s authority to set the docket. The House version of the resolution, sponsored by Del. James M. LeMunyon, R-Fairfax, was left in the same committee without ever coming up for a vote. Shipley conceded to us that Puckett didn’t cast a single vote directly on the repeal amendment, but insisted the Democrat "did everything he could to prevent it from being brought to the floor." Now, here’s the kicker: Puckett actually sponsored a resolution this year that urged Congress to stop the same type of environmental regulations the state GOP accuses him of supporting. Puckett’s resolution died in the Senate Rules Committee. It would have urged Congress to adopt legislation "prohibiting EPA by any means necessary from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, including if necessary defunding EPA greenhouse gas regulatory activities." The measure also asked for at least a two-year moratorium on new air quality rules. So let’s look back. The state GOP says Puckett betrayed his Southwest Virginia constituents by voting twice against sending the EPA a message that new regulations would harm the coal industry. Here’s the reality: The repeal amendment, which the Republicans use as the basis for the claim, has no direct tie to the EPA or coal. It could just as easily apply to any federal law or regulation in existence, from health care reform to playground safety requirements. Puckett didn’t vote twice against the amendment; he didn’t vote on it at all. Lastly, Puckett actually introduced a resolution seeking to achieve the very goal the GOP accuses him of opposing. This one’s more than a stretch, it’s absurd. Pants on Fire!	None	Republican Party of Virginia	None	None	None	2011-06-24T11:40:16	2011-06-16	['None']
pomt-01147	"My property taxes went down largely because my technical college portion went down 35.5% because of the money we put in at state."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/18/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-hes-got-himself-thank-his-tax-bi/	Christmas cards no longer stuff up mailboxes this time of year, but you can count on receiving one piece of old-fashioned mail: the annual property tax bill. After getting his residential tax bill in December, Gov. Scott Walker took to Twitter to proclaim it was lighter than last year. And to take credit for the reduction. "My property taxes went down largely because my technical college portion went down 35.5% because of the money we put in at state," the governor tweeted Dec. 12, 2014 from his personal account. Walker made tax relief a cornerstone of his first term, signing legislation easing both income taxes and property taxes, among others. In January 2014, we rated Mostly True the governor’s claim that "With the tax controls we already put in place, property taxes on a typical home in December of 2014 will actually be lower than they were in December of 2010." Walker was correct that the "typical" property owner -- a hypothetical individual owning a median-valued home taxed at the average statewide property tax rate -- would have a smaller tax bill than four years earlier. But that doesn’t mean everybody is in the same boat. So let’s take a look at the bill of one flesh-and-blood person -- Walker -- and see if his claim is on target when it comes to the year-to-year change. The governor owns and lives in a $360,000 home on a busy street in suburban Wauwatosa in Milwaukee County. An online database shows his total bill fell $118 or 1.4 percent this year. His total bill: $8,364. Two of the six taxing authorities represented on the bill collected less from the Walkers this year than in 2013: the Wauwatosa School District and the Milwaukee Area Technical College. As Walker tweeted, MATC billed him 35.5% less than last year, a drop of $255 Almost all of that drop is directly attributable to state legislation pushed by Walker and other Republicans who sought to return surplus state funds to taxpayers. Walker signed Wisconsin Act 145 in March 2014, injecting additional state aid into the state’s technical college system. At MATC alone, that unexpected state aid replaced $60 million in funds that would normally have been raised through local property taxes. Consequently, the overall MATC property tax levy for 2015 dropped by 40 percent, according to MATC budget documents. In terms of the school district portion of the tax bill, the governor saw a drop in school taxes of $90, or 3 percent. So the biggest contributor to his lighter tax load, as he claimed, was the technical college portion. And it was, as he claimed, due to actions taken at the state level. A couple notes before we leave you to check your escrow accounts. Walker had less to brag about last year at this time, when his property tax bill jumped more than $1,100. It coincided with the 2013 citywide property revaluation in Wauwatosa. Walker’s property assessment rose 11 percent that year. In fact, Walker is not one of those "typical" taxpayers whose bill is lower now than four years ago. His is up $1,300. Finally, the governor wasn’t alone on his block this year in seeing a dip in his property taxes. Across Wauwatosa, more than 95 percent of property owners saw a decrease. We checked three of his neighbors’ bills. They each fell by $50 to $100. And, in contrast to their famous neighbor, they have seen a decrease in their overall bill from 2010 to 2014. Our rating In a tweet, Walker said: "My property taxes went down largely because my technical college portion went down 35.5% because of the money we put in at state." He’s right. We rate his claim True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-08124	There are "10 or 20 deaths a year from foodborne illness" in the United States.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/09/tom-coburn/tom-coburn-says-only-10-20-people-die-annually-foo/	On Nov. 30, 2010, the Senate, by a 73-25 vote, passed the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, a landmark bill that would expand food-safety regulations. The House had earlier passed a different version, and the two chambers are now trying to reconcile the measures before the congressional session ends. Almost two weeks before the Senate passed its version of the bill, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., made a floor speech critical of the bill. During the Nov. 18 speech, Coburn referred to the number of deaths from foodborne illnesses annually in the United States. "The question is, how do we stop the 10 or 20 deaths a year from foodborne illness? Can we do that?" Coburn asked. "Well, as a physician trained in epidemiology, we could do it. But I will posit we do not have the money to do that because it would take billions upon billions upon billions of additional dollars to ever get there. So we find ourselves in a dilemma." A number of readers wrote us to ask whether Coburn was correct, citing widespread media references to the U.S. experiencing 5,000 foodborne-related deaths a year. So we decided to take a closer look. The 10 to 20 deaths a year originates in a study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The summary was published in the August 13, 2010, edition of the CDC publication Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The study recaps the number of illnesses and deaths caused by the 1,097 reported foodborne outbreaks in 2007, the most recent year available. The paper found that these outbreaks produced 21,244 cases of foodborne illness and 18 deaths. So, federal statistics do show that at least 18 people died from foodborne illness during the most recent year for which statistics are available. But epidemiologists say that statistic is a floor, not a ceiling, since there are several types of foodborne deaths that aren't included in that number. These were merely the deaths related to outbreaks that are officially reported to CDC. And CDC says that most foodborne illness is not associated with outbreaks, and would therefore not be included in these outbreak numbers. A more inclusive way of looking at foodborne deaths comes from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, or FoodNet. That's a program run by the CDC's Emerging Infections Program that tracks foodborne illnesses in 10 states, based on laboratory results. In 2009, FoodNet found 74 deaths caused by the 10 foodborne germs it tracks. Since the 10 FoodNet states account for about 15 percent of the population, "a reasonable extrapolation would put you close to 500 deaths" nationally, said Craig Hedberg, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. "These are real deaths associated with confirmed illnesses. This represents a justifiable minimum floor" for the number of foodborne deaths every year. (There may be overlap between official outbreak deaths and FoodNet-reported deaths, so we'll just use the 500 deaths figure from FoodNet on its own.) There's also a second layer of hidden foodborne deaths -- those that slip through the surveillance system and aren't tabulated as foodborne deaths at all. Many people with foodborne illness don’t seek medical care, and, even if they do, they may not see a doctor and have a lab test ordered. All of those steps are needed before FoodNet even hears about their case. The lack of lab testing means that "there is usually no way to know whether (someone) got their infection from contaminated food or from another source," CDC epidemiologist Barbara Mahon told our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas in September. "Only if they are part of an outbreak for which a source is determined -- usually less than 5 percent of cases of Salmonella infection -- would it be possible to know where that particular infection came from. Otherwise, it might or might not have been foodborne." As a result, Mahon said, estimating the true number of Salmonella deaths due to food requires looking at "many different kinds of data from multiple sources and using appropriate statistical techniques to adjust for the various sources of infection and for under-diagnosis and under-reporting." The CDC is currently working on a new estimate -- which is expected to be released soon, a spokeswoman said, -- so for now, the most recent figures come from a 1999 paper. This paper, published by the CDC and authored by a team led by epidemiologist Paul S. Mead, included the following estimate that has been quoted countless times over the last decade -- "76 million illnesses, 323,914 hospitalizations, and 5,194 deaths each year." The numbers look quite specific, but they actually mask quite a bit of uncertainty. In the paper, the authors note that "precise information on food-related deaths is especially difficult to obtain because pathogen-specific surveillance systems rarely collect information on illness outcome, and outcome-specific surveillance systems (e.g., death certificates) grossly underreport many pathogen-specific conditions." So, in order to estimate the number of deaths due to foodborne bacteria, the team calculated the number of deaths among reported bacterial cases, then doubled this figure to account for unreported deaths, and then multiplied by a percentage of infections believed to be attributable to foodborne transmission. This represented a good-faith effort to estimate the number of foodborne deaths, but it still relied on assumptions that could be -- and have been -- challenged by other scientists. At least one other paper published by CDC -- written by Paul D. Frenzen, a U.S. Department of Agriculture demographer -- warned that the estimate was "inherently uncertain." In fact, the real number of deaths, if it could be accurately calculated, might either be higher or lower than the roughly 5,000 cited in Mead's paper. "The estimate of deaths (in the Mead paper) was derived from hospital discharge and death certificate data on deaths attributed to gastroenteritis of unknown cause," Frenzen wrote. "Fatal illnesses due to unknown foodborne agents do not always involve gastroenteritis, and gastroenteritis may not be accurately diagnosed or reported on hospital charts or death certificates. The death estimate consequently omitted deaths from unknown foodborne agents that do not cause gastroenteritis and likely overstated the number of deaths from agents that cause gastoenteritis." Hedberg, of the University of Minnesota, agreed that, while the number of foodborne deaths fluctuates from year to year, the number may well be lower than the 5,000 cited commonly in the media. However, he added, it is certainly at least the 500 suggested by the tracking by FoodNet. "There can be no doubt that the number is much higher than 10 to 20," he said. Other experts agreed. "There is no factual (or imagined) truth to Sen. Coburn's comment," said Michael Osterholm, the former Minnesota state epidemiologist. When we contacted Coburn's office, spokesman John Hart noted that Coburn's broader point was that the frequency of foodborne illness has been decreasing over time. "In 1996, for every 100,000 people in this country, we had 51.2 cases of foodborne illness--the best in the world, by far," Coburn said in the speech. "But, in 2009, we only had 34.8 cases--three times better than anybody else in the world. So the question has to be asked: Why are we doing this now when, in fact, we are on a trendline to markedly decrease it? The second question that should be asked is: No matter how much money we spend, is there a diminishing return?" These are fair questions, but they don't justify Coburn's later use of a lowball estimate of deaths from foodborne illness. We would have given him some credit if he'd said there were 10 to 20 deaths per year from officially declared outbreaks, even though this still would have been misleading since official outbreaks represent a fraction of all cases. We also acknowledge that reasonable scientists can disagree over whether Mead's team made the right assumptions when they made their calculations. But Coburn's estimate also ignored a much more solid number -- the number of deaths estimated through laboratory-confirmed data from FoodNet. By themselves, the confirmed death figures just from FoodNet's 10 states are roughly five times bigger than Coburn's estimate, and the national approximation based on those numbers is 25 times as large. So we rate his statement False.	None	Tom Coburn	None	None	None	2010-12-09T14:01:14	2010-11-18	['United_States']
pomt-04134	"Switzerland (where the government) issues every household a gun . . . has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world!!!"	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/06/facebook-posts/facebook-posting-says-gun-rich-swiss-have-lowest-f/	Gun control advocates say that fewer guns mean less gun crime. But a Dec. 16 posting on Facebook by a group calling itself the Conservatives Club argues exactly the opposite, and uses the example set by Switzerland to prove its point. The portion of the post, titled "A Little Gun History," that is in all capital letters caught our attention. It says, "Switzerland issues every household a gun! Switzerland's government trains every adult they issue a rifle. Switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world!!! It's a no brainer! Don't let our government waste millions of our tax dollars in an effort to make all law abiding citizens an easy target." We thought the assertion that Switzerland "has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world" was worth checking out. (We’ll also give you some background about Switzerland's policy on issuing guns.) (Coincidentally, on Jan. 2, 2013, while we were working on this item, gun policy in Switzerland made the news after a man who started shooting people on the street left three women dead and two men wounded in the Swiss village of Daillon.) One source of information about guns is GunPolicy.Org, an evidence-based database on firearm safety hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health in Australia and partly co-funded, coincidentally, by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. We ran some comparisons through their database. We're not going to get into the definition of what makes a "civilized" country; instead, we looked at GunPolicy.org’s data on gun homicide rates for 24 countries, mostly in western Europe but also Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. Switzerland's gun homicide rate was anything but "the lowest." It was fourth highest. Only Greece, Ireland and the United States had higher rates. (Switzerland also has the seventh highest suicide rate and the third highest rate of gun-related suicide, according to the GunPolicy.org data. In the latter case, only the United States and Finland had higher rates. Switzerland and Italy were tied for second for the rate of unintentional gun deaths; the United States was number one.) "Guns kept at home are not necessarily dangerous in the streets, but mostly in situations that happen at home, such as suicide and murder of family members (especially females). In this respect, Switzerland has one of the highest proportions in the Western world," said Martin Killias, professor of criminology and criminal law at the University of Zurich Law School. But homicide isn't the only type of gun crime, and the Facebook posting wasn't specific. We wanted to know about all crimes involving a gun. The problem is, "different countries classify crimes totally differently, which makes it difficult to make a broad statement like that," said Philip Alpers, a gun policy researcher at the University of Sydney who runs GunPolicy.org and edits a firearm injury prevention news service. He said the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is the best source because the organization classifies crimes in a consistent way. But that organization's website doesn't report data based on gun use, except when homicide is involved. Nonetheless, we looked at its database on various crime categories such as assault, robbery, and theft, where guns were most likely to be involved, to see whether the crime rate in Switzerland was really that low. It wasn't. Eleven out of 26 countries had lower rates of theft than Switzerland. Thirteen of 26 had lower rates of robbery. Six of 26 had lower rates of assault. So the Swiss can't boast the lowest crime rate, another claim gun advocates make. How much of a role did guns play in such crimes? The best database on that question was developed by the International Crime Victim Survey, begun in 1987 by a group of European criminologists in an attempt to compare crime rates in 31 countries and 32 major cities. The ICVS was designed to standardize results and adjust for the fact that the legal definition of a crime can vary from country to country -- as can the willingness to report a crime. The data are based on surveys of victims. The most recent surveys were done in 2004 and 2005. Once again, when you look at how often guns are used in the commission of a crime, Switzerland doesn't look like the safest place in Europe or other developed countries. Instead of being at the top of the list among the safest of the 31 countries, Switzerland was tied for 12th when it came to the use of a firearm during a robbery. (The United States ranked 30th. Mexico was last.) Switzerland was tied for 25th when it came to the risk of seeing a gun if you're the victim of an assault. (The United States was next to the bottom of the list by that measure as well.) And while only 1 percent of the sexual offenses against women in Switzerland involved a gun, the rate was 0 percent in 22 other countries in the survey. (In the United States, the rate was 5 percent.) In short, the claim about Switzerland seems completely made up. One other point is particularly important here. The description of gun distribution in Switzerland omits important information. The Swiss government doesn't hand out a gun to every household. It requires nearly every able-bodied young male adult to serve in the citizen militia, where they are issued a military rifle. The guns are supposed to be for military use only, not for personal defense. Those men are supposed to show up for 18 weeks of training, followed by seven re-training sessions (each lasting three weeks) over the next 10 years. If you want to keep your weapon after your years of service, it is refitted to scale back its firepower and you need to provide a reason for keeping it. "It's very much like the militia ideal that was embodied in the Second Amendment," said Ladd Everett of the Washington, D.C.-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. "Individuals who own military-style firearms are literally serving the national defense of their country." The ammunition for the weaponry is kept in a government arsenal. (Swiss men used to be able to keep up to 50 rounds at home and the government did a periodic inventory to make sure it wasn't being used, but that changed in 2007 when the country tightened its rules.) Ammunition purchased at shooting ranges -- which are very popular in Switzerland -- is supposed to be used there. Overall, "they have fewer guns per capita than we do and far stricter gun laws in terms of private ownership," Everett said. "If the U.S. ever attempted to implement gun laws like Switzerland's, the NRA would fight it tooth and nail." Our ruling A Facebook posting, which has been shared more than 187,000 times, said, "Switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world." But Killias, a Swiss researcher, told us, "The way Switzerland is being depicted in some [accounts] is absurd." To say that the country has the lowest gun related crime rate is not true for homicide, according to the few studies of crime in various countries that includes data on gun use. It's also not true that Switzerland has the lowest crime rate, whether or not guns are involved.

pomt-01961	"The average age of the minimum wage worker is 35 years old."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/20/erin-lynch/sen-erin-lynch-says-35-average-age-people-earning-/	On Wednesday, the General Assembly passed legislation that would raise the state's minimum wage from $8 per hour to $9 per hour beginning next year. It now awaits the governor's signature. During the debate in the Senate June 11, the chief sponsor, Sen. Erin Lynch, a Warwick Democrat, said, "One of the other pieces of opposition that's always raised relative to minimum wage is that it's mostly teenagers working part time that are making the minimum wage." Critics say "we're putting an onerous policy on small business owners or other business owners," she said. "The reality is that the average age of the minimum wage worker is 35 years old." We wondered: Is the typical minimum wage worker really 35? It turns out that Lynch isn't the first to make that claim. President Obama made the statement during a April 26, 2014, radio address that called for hiking the national minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. When PolitiFact National checked the statement in April, it concluded that it was Mostly False. Here's why. The source of Mr. Obama's statistic was a study from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that promotes policies to help low- and middle-income workers. But the statistic didn't apply to the current minimum wage, which is $8 in Rhode Island and $7.25 nationally. It applied to people earning less than $11.10 per hour. In other words, the average age of workers making up to $11.10 is 35. After we left a message asking Lynch if she was using additional information, Senate spokesman Greg Pare sent us a three-page infographic from the Rhode Island AFL-CIO that makes the same claim. It cites the misquoted Economic Policy Institute paper as one source. John F. Killoy III, director of communications, mobilization, and research for the union organization, also referred us to a report from the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research. It also found the average age to be 35, but it looked at people earning as much as $10 per hour which is, once again, well above the state and federal minimums. Those two reports were used, Killoy said, "because there is very little data on minimum wage workers in Rhode Island and national data on minimum wage workers does not give the best picture because the Rhode Island minimum wage has consistently been higher than the federal minimum." In fact, the average age can be a misleading statistic, and choosing it skews the average age of the group receiving the minimum wage. For example, when a bad economy sends more 70- and 80-year-olds to jobs at WalMart, the average age increases dramatically. You can see the skewing in the Center for Economic Policy report, where the average age of a low-wage earner is 34.9 years but 57.8 percent of them are younger than 35. So what's the median age of a worker earning the minimum wage? To quote PolitiFact National, "In reality, the statistics on this specific point are murky. A different study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 71 percent of minimum-wage workers are YOUNGER than 30 -- a starkly different picture of low-wage workers." According to the data on Table 7 of the BLS report, 50 percent of the 3.3 million workers earning minimum wage were age 24 and younger. That would put the median age for people receiving the minimum at or near 24 years old. "But the BLS study has an important limitation," as PolitiFact National noted. "It looked only at workers making exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and below, so it doesn’t include workers from any of the 21 states and the District of Columbia that have enacted higher state minimum wages." In the end, Lynch was relying on an AFL-CIO fact sheet that took data on low-wage workers and mischaracterized it as data on minimum wage workers. That distinction is important. The evidence, including data from the two reports cited by the AFL-CIO, suggests that the actual age of the typical person now earning minimum wage is significantly lower than 35. Clearly a lot of people earning the minimum wage are not teenagers. That's the kernel of truth in Lynch's statement. But she seems so far off, we rate her assertion Mostly False.

pomt-02849	"You've seen where we're now going from a $700 million surplus to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/19/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-has-gone-700-million-sur/	In modern politics, Republican strategist Karl Rove is often credited with popularizing the strategy of attacking an opponent’s strength to neutralize a perceived advantage for the other side. Madison Democrat Mary Burke has trotted out the tactic early in her bid to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in November 2014. She’s labeled Walker a big spender. Asked by a Madison Capital Times reporter if she supported the $650 million income tax cut signed by Walker in 2013, the former state Commerce secretary said she would have wanted to see whether it put the state budget in a strong position going forward. But she suggested strongly that it didn’t. "You've seen where we're now going from a $700 million surplus to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit," Burke said in the interview published Nov. 6, 2013. "I'd love to be able to do tax cuts, but they have to be done in a way that is benefiting the state and is setting us up for fiscal responsibility in the long term." Walker frequently touts his frugal budgeting ways and emphasis on tax cuts. Did he really turn a state surplus red? Yes and no. We’ve tested one of Burke’s numbers before: Walker’s first budget (covering July 2011- June 2013) ended with a cash balance of $759 million, according to an accounting prepared in October 2013 by the nonpartisan budget scorekeeping agency, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau is considered the gold standard for independent budget scorekeeping. It is also what Burke cited when we asked her for backup. Many readers may not be familiar with the second number she cites, the $750 million "deficit." The Fiscal Bureau came up with that figure, too, so Burke mentions two credible figures. But the negative number she mentions is not a concrete figure that compares easily to the hard-cash surplus Burke cites. It’s a rough projection of the amount of tax-collection growth the Legislature and governor will need in mid-2015 to balance the next two-year budget, covering 2015-’17. Legislators use it as an exercise and a benchmarking tool. During budget deliberations, they’ll call Bob Lang, Fiscal Bureau director, and ask how a tax cut -- or a spending increase for a certain program -- would affect the potential size of this budget gap down the road. The estimate is officially known as the "structural deficit," which Burke shorthands as "deficit." It’s rough because Lang doesn’t try to guess how much tax collections might rise or fall, or factor in demand for Medicaid health programs, for example. But, in part due to the tax cuts Burke discussed, it’s true that the structural deficit heading into Walker’s third budget is now estimated at that $725 million figure Burke mentioned. So there’s truth in her overall point. But we won’t have a hard number to compare to the 2013 Walker surplus until 2015. For the record, Walker’s two budgets have recorded the lowest "structural deficits" since Lang started keeping track in 1997. It’s not even close; they ranged from $1.5 billion to $2.9 billion before Walker. His first budget actually wiped out the structural deficit entirely heading into his second budget. We’ve dealt with similar mismatched numbers on the Truth-O-Meter before. We rated Half True a Walker claim that,"The $3.6 billion deficit we inherited has turned into more than a half-billion-dollar surplus." His numbers also checked out individually, and his overall point on the big turnaround from red to black in his first budget is correct. But he mixed different ways to define the size of the turnaround, throwing the numbers off a bit. Our rating Burke said the state is going from a $700 million surplus "to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit." Her numbers check out, and she properly identifies a big swing in Walker’s budgeting, but -- like Walker’s similar claim -- there’s a problem because the two numbers aren’t easily compared. We rate her claim Half True.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2013-11-19T05:00:00	2013-11-06	['None']
pomt-04412	An Army report stated Allen West "performed illegal acts, merited court martial, faced 11 years in prison.'"	/florida/statements/2012/oct/16/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-attacks-allen-west-military-investi/	In a television ad, Democrat Patrick Murphy attacked Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West for a much-publicized incident that led to West’s retirement from the Army. The ad shows photos of West in his Army fatigues: "You need the facts about Allen West in 2003," states the narrator, as a manila folder opens. "West was criminally charged with violating the uniform code of military justice, found guilty of three counts of aggravated assault, and relieved of his command. The final Army report: West 'performed illegal acts, merited court martial, faced 11 years in prison.' Allen West. He just isn’t who he says he is." West and political newcomer Murphy have launched character attacks on each other in their battle for Congressional District 18, which spans parts of Florida’s Treasure Coast. We wanted to check if Murphy accurately portrayed the end of West’s two-decade Army career. In a separate fact-check, we evaluated West’s ad that Murphy tried to "hide his drunken assault of a police officer." When West fired in 2003 We first fact-checked claims about West’s military background in 2011, after hearing complimentary comments that radio host Glenn Beck made about West. (Read our earlier report for a longer account.) In 2003, West was serving in Iraq as a lieutenant colonel overseeing an artillery battalion of about 650 soldiers and officers. In early August, soldiers received a tip that West and one of his subordinate battery commanders were to be the subject of an assassination attempt. The informant offered the names of three people involved in the planning of the assassination, including an Iraqi policeman, Yehiya Kadoori Hamoodi. Hamoodi was apprehended and brought in for questioning. What happened next comes from accounts provided by West and the other soldiers involved in the interrogation through sworn statements they gave during a subsequent military investigation. West joined the interrogation in progress after soldiers were unable to get useful information from Hamoodi. West said soldiers told him Hamoodi was being evasive and belligerent. That's when the interrogation got more physical. Soldiers punched and shoved Hamoodi when he wouldn't answer interrogators' questions. At some point, West sat down across from Hamoodi, took out his 9mm pistol and placed it on his thigh pointing in Hamoodi's direction. "I'm here for a reason," West said, according to a soldier. "You are going to tell me who wants to kill me, or I am going to kill you." Then they took Hamoodi outside and placed his head over a clearing barrel -- a barrel filled with sand where people can unload firearms safely. West showed Hamoodi the gun and told him he had five seconds to talk. "I brought his head down toward the barrel using my left hand to shield him away from any sand or blast," West told investigators. Then West fired into the sand, at least once, maybe three times, inches from Hamoodi's head. Then West fired into the sky. Hamoodi was alive and ready to talk. West headed back to the operations center and let the interrogation conclude. West’s actions drew criticism, but he became a cause celebre among some in the military and conservatives -- and that brought him the fame that would lead to his congressional career. Outcome of military investigation We are going to focus on the part of Murphy’s ad that says, "The final Army report: West ‘performed illegal acts, merited court martial, faced 11 years in prison.’ " We reviewed preliminary investigative reports, including sworn statements by West and other soldiers obtained by the ACLU as part of a torture investigation. (The names in the report are blacked out except on the last page it does name West.) We also read media reports, including two cited in the ad, the Boston Globe and CNN. We also contacted the West campaign and interviewed West’s military defense attorney Neal Puckett, who disputes the ad. Finally, we interviewed military justice attorneys not involved in the case. The ad mentions a "final Army report," but the quotes that follow are from media reports cited in the ad. Our efforts to independently obtain any sort of final Army report were unsuccessful. 'Performed illegal acts' Soon after the incident, the Army launched a criminal investigation into charges of aggravated assault and communicating a threat. A statement from West -- in which he confessed -- and other soldiers were taken in September 2003. The case started as an Article 32, a preliminary hearing required under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. "I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted to take care of my soldiers," West testified, adding later: "If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can." An investigating officer recommended that the case be handled through Article 15/nonjudicial proceedings, which the general commander and West accepted. (Article 15 is a noncriminal process.) The Boston Globe wrote that during a closed-door tribunal in the town of Tikrit, "West was found guilty of three counts of aggravated assault and a single count of communicating a threat. The ruling was issued after West pleaded guilty to misconduct." West’s lawyer Puckett, who did not attend that tribunal, told us in an interview that West "was adjudicated to having committed those offenses -- in a broad sense he was found guilty of those offenses." But what the ad omits is that once the case became an Article 15, it was no longer a criminal proceeding, and that point isn’t in dispute. In December, the commander reprimanded West and fined him $5,000. West then retired. So West "performed illegal acts," but they were resolved through a nonjudicial, or noncriminal punishment. 'Merited court martial' Media reports made it clear that West could have faced a courtmartial but ultimately didn’t. The Boston Globe wrote that the military said West "disobeyed laws, ignored orders . . . and mortgaged future discipline in his unit. Without discipline, there is no trust, no cohesion, and no higher purpose for which we fight." But the military also stated, "while his crimes merit a court-martial, mitigating factors were considered, including the stressful environment . . . and Lieutenant Colonel West's record as an officer and commander." And that’s why the military recommended the Article 15 route. "Frustration and anger overcame his professional ethics and personal values, and he performed what he knew to be illegal and immoral acts," said the statement issued by the Army's Fourth Infantry Division. Article 15 is supposed to be used only for minor offenses, but it can be used for serious offenses including assault, said Eugene Fidell, a who teaches military justice at Yale Law School and previously served as a judge advocate in the U.S. Coast Guard. "You can have a serious case on paper, but because of the way it is handled through nonjudicial punishment, the actual exposure is much less," Fidell said. Though an Article 15 is not a criminal proceeding, "you cannot get an Article 15 because you are a slob. You have to have committed some military crime." The ad says that West "merited" court martial -- it doesn’t say he "was" court martialed, said Murphy’s campaign consultant Eric Johnson. 'Faced 11 years in prison' West’s lawyer Puckett wrote that a military legal adviser (who he doesn’t name) confided in him that the case was never destined for trial, court martial or plans for confining West, however "there was a perceived need to have a public hearing." An officer doesn’t "face" prison, Puckett said, until he or she is courtmartialed, and that never happened. The range of punishments for an Article 15 does not include prison. But Fidell said that while West could not be sent to jail as part of an Article 15 sentence, "Lt. Col. West was certainly ‘facing’ jail when he was charged," he wrote in an email. CNN wrote that the infantry's top general in Tikrit, "could have rejected the recommendation and ordered a court martial. If he were to be found guilty at a court martial of the two articles against him, West could have faced 11 years in prison, a military prosecutor told CNN." Some other news reports we found stated West could have faced eight years. So West could have faced prison time. But the ad omits that once his case entered the Article 15 proceedings, prison was no longer a possibility. Our ruling Murphy’s ad included this sentence: "The final Army report: West ‘performed illegal acts, merited court martial, faced 11 years in prison.' " The ad cites Boston Globe and CNN reports, but it also could leave viewers with the impression that those quotes were pulled from some "final Army report," though the Murphy ad wasn’t directly citing such a report. West did violate military code and confessed to the assault, so the ad is on safe ground when it says West "performed illegal acts." The military concluded that West’s "crimes merit a courtmartial," which could have meant prison time. But the ad fails to explain that the Army found mitigating circumstances and handled West’s case through a noncriminal proceeding that meant he avoided courtmartial and prison was off the table. For the omissions we rate this claim Half True.	None	Patrick Murphy	None	None	None	2012-10-16T19:34:27	2012-10-02	['None']
pomt-01073	Says he "balanced the budget without raising taxes."	/florida/statements/2015/jan/16/bob-buckhorn/buckhorn-balanced-city-budget-without-raising-taxe/	Ever since Florida’s real estate bubble burst, planning a budget that meets the city’s needs while living within its means has been among Bob Buckhorn’s chief challenges as mayor. For this year, Buckhorn proposed an $876 million budget that included a 2.5 percent raise for city employees and started replenishing city reserves, which he had drawn on to balance his previous budgets. Now, as he seeks a second four-year term, Buckhorn is running a cable television ad that says, "Bob balanced the budget without raising taxes." But did he? Two elements go into property owners’ annual tax bills: the value of their property and the tax rate. The first is assessed by county property appraisers. The second is set by local governments. Multiply the assessment by the tax rate — expressed in mills, with 1 mill equaling $1 in property tax for every $1,000 of assessed, taxable value — and that equals the tax owed. In Tampa, the city has kept the same tax rate — about 5.73 mills, or $5.73 in city taxes for every $1,000 of assessed taxable property value — for eight years. And Buckhorn notes that the city kept that rate even during the recession, when property values plunged, dragging the city’s revenues down with them. City property tax revenues fell from a high of $160 million in 2009 to about $117.4 million in 2013. During that time, Buckhorn said, the city didn’t raise its tax rate to try to capture more revenue. "When we were faced with a drastic decline in revenues, we didn’t raise the rates to compensate," Buckhorn told PolitiFact Florida in an interview in his office on Jan. 13, 2015. "So we’ve been consistent about this, and losing $40 million in revenue out of $160 million took a huge toll on us, but to compensate for that, we didn’t bump it up to raise the like amount. We just did more with less money. We ended up laying off 700 people." In the last two fiscal years, property values have started to rise again, so that the same tax rate now generates more revenue for the city — $123.5 million last year and an expected $132.2 million this year. Buckhorn said there’s been no tax increase because he did not raise the property tax rate. And he said at the existing tax rate it will take years for the city’s property tax revenues to climb back to where they were. "When people think of taxes," he said, the tax rate is "largely what they think about. That's what they react to." But the relationship between tax rates, the value of property and the amount of tax the two generate together has been the focus of Florida’s Truth in Millage (TRIM) law since it was passed in 1980. The TRIM law requires local governments to tell taxpayers what property tax rate would generate the same revenues for the coming year as in the current year. If property values — not including things like new construction and building additions — have risen, then the calculation determines how much officials would have to "roll back" the tax rate to generate the same level of revenue. If they propose a higher rate — including by keeping the rate they already have — then the law requires them to advertise a tax increase. That’s what the city of Tampa has done the last two years. For the city of Tampa's 2013-14 fiscal year, the adopted rate was 4.4 percent higher than the rollback rate. For the 2014-15 fiscal year, the adopted rate was about 5.2 percent higher than the rollback rate. Buckhorn said the additional revenue generated by keeping the same property tax rate instead of lowering it to the rollback rate does not count as raising taxes. "That is a function of the value of the property," Buckhorn said. "It's not a function of the baseline tax (rate) that the city assesses. If I had raised the property tax rate, then I couldn't have made that statement. There's a difference between somebody paying more because the value of their house increases versus the city assessing a higher rate to generate more revenue." That line of thinking, however, was what legislators were trying to push back when they wrote the Truth in Millage law in 1980. "This attempt by local officials to blame rising property taxes on increasing assessments and thereby ‘share’ the responsibility for tax hikes with the property appraisers is precisely the problem the TRIM disclosure provisions seek to resolve," according to a Florida State University Law Review article co-authored by then-House Finance and Taxation Committee chairman Steve Pajcic the year the law was passed. Before then, many taxpayers had focused on appealing their assessments, but with the TRIM law the Legislature was trying "to alert taxpayers to the importance of the millage rate and to encourage them to view it as the factor over which they have the most control," Pajcic and his co-authors wrote. "It is an incorrect statement to say that you haven’t increased taxes if you don’t go back to the roll-back rate, because you have," Benjamin Phipps, a Tallahassee attorney and expert on property taxation who served as counsel to the Florida House of Representatives Tax Committee and the speaker of the House in the 1970s, told PolitiFact Florida on Jan. 14, 2015. Buckhorn’s TV ad says he "balanced the budget without raising taxes." Because the city kept its property tax rate constant even as the total value of property in the city rose, the city has seen its property tax revenues rise the past two fiscal years. And it has been required by state law to advertise a tax increase for both of those years. Tax revenues are still significantly below what they were before the real estate crash. We rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Bob Buckhorn	None	None	None	2015-01-16T17:31:16	2015-01-15	['None']
pomt-10366	Obama says his bill "reduced welfare rolls nearly 80 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/30/barack-obama/welfare-rolls-dropped-but-not-just-because-of-law/	In a new TV ad, Sen. Barack Obama takes credit for reducing welfare rolls in Illinois. The ad begins with photos of Obama after he graduated from college, of a padlocked industrial site and of a working-class neighborhood. "He worked his way through college and Harvard Law ... turned down big money offers, and helped lift neighborhoods stung by job loss. Fought for workers' rights." The announcer continues, "He passed a law to move people from welfare to work, slashed the rolls by 80 percent ... passed tax cuts for workers ... health care for kids. As president, he'll end tax breaks for companies that export jobs, reward those that create jobs in America. And never forget the dignity that comes from work." We previously examined Obama's claim that he passed the welfare-to-work law (and gave him a Mostly True), so here we'll examine his new claim that the law reduced welfare rolls by 80 percent. Obama was a state senator in 1997 when Illinois, like other states, was forced to adapt to the federal welfare reform law. Obama became the key Senate Democrat for the bill, working to make sure the Illinois program, Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, met the federal guidelines and also had provisions to ease the transition for people leaving the program. Obama played a role in making sure the program had a child care subsidy and was the prime sponsor of another bill that required the state to study the effects of welfare reform. After the main reform law took effect, the number of welfare recipients began dropping sharply, from 167,124 in 1998 to 36,331 in 2006, which represents a 78 percent drop. So the campaign is correct about the size of the decline. But the law was not the sole cause of the decline, according to John Bouman, director of advocacy for the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, who was involved in shaping the bill. Bouman, a supporter and contributor to Obama's campaign, says the law was the main cause of the decline, but he estimates that about one-fourth to one-third of the drop was caused by the administrators of the state program who Bouman says were too hasty in ejecting many people from the program. Bouman called that "a harsh side of it that (Obama) was not an architect of — that was less the on-paper policy and more the administrative practices of the governor at the time." Dan Lewis, a Northwestern University professor who was hired to study the program (and also is an Obama supporter), says it is difficult to estimate what percentage of the decline is due to the bill or other factors such as the approach of state officials. But Lewis said he did not disagree with Bouman's estimate. Gary MacDougal, former chairman of the Illlinois Republican Party and the chairman of the Illinois Governor's Task Force for Human Services Reform, downplays Obama's role in the bill and agreed with Bouman that there were other significant factors in the decline besides the state law. He said the most important factor was the governor's reorganization of state agencies, and he said the booming economy of the 1990s was also "very helpful" in the decline. So the Obama ad is right about the size of the decline, but is reaching too far by taking credit for it. We find this claim Half True.

pomt-02336	"Obamacare will drive 2.5 million Americans out of the workforce."	/florida/statements/2014/mar/25/rick-scott/cbo-report-describes-obamacare-jobs-killer-rick-sc/	Before he was governor, Rick Scott spent millions attacking Obamacare. After he was elected in 2010, he continued to bash Obamacare, and in a new attack ad, his political committee portrays it as a jobs killer. Let’s Get to Work, Scott’s political committee, unveiled the ad March 24, 2014, and it is expected to run statewide starting March 27. The ad repeats snippets of Crist’s March 9 interview on CNN when he called Obamacare "great." Here’s part of the ad script: "Great?" the narrator says. "News reports say 300,000 health plans cancelled. Obama says patients may lose their doctors. The federal government says less work hours for American jobs," the narrator says, as an apparent quote from a February Congressional Budget Office report appears on the screen: "Obamacare will drive 2.5 million Americans out of the workforce." Are 2.5 million Americans being driven out of the workforce due to Obamacare? The CBO report The Republican Party of Florida pointed to the February report by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper. The report has prompted numerous attacks about the impact of Obamacare and jobs -- the inaccuracies have varied depending upon the wording. This ad states that Obamacare will "drive" 2.5 million Americans out of the workforce, which could leave listeners with the impression that those folks will lose their jobs against their will. But that’s not what the CBO report says. The Florida Republicans quoted this line from the CBO report: "CBO’s updated estimate of the decrease in hours worked translates to a reduction in full-time-equivalent employment of 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA." Greg Blair, a spokesman for Scott’s re-election campaign, told PolitiFact Florida: "The ad states what the report states – Obamacare will result in fewer work hours for American jobs." The CBO report says that with Obamacare providing greater access to insurance on the individual market and subsidies to help pay for it, some Americans will decide on their own to work less. That’s different from being "driven" out of work, for example due to layoffs or being fired. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would "reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive." This would equal a "decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024," the report continued. "By providing subsidies that decline with rising income and by making some people financially better off, the ACA will create an incentive for some people to work less," the report said. An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesn’t mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs or become unemployed. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job, while others may stop working entirely. Some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, previously told PolitiFact. "Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to," Sinclair said. "But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing." Our ruling Scott's TV ad says, "Obamacare will drive 2.5 million Americans out of the workforce." The ad suggests it is an actual quote in a February Congressional Budget Office report, but we didn’t find that quote in the report. The statement relates to a CBO report that says workers who can now receive subsidized insurance will cut back on hours equivalent to about 2.5 million full-time workers by 2024. The ad is misleading because the equivalent of those hours does not translate to 2.5 million actual workers, and by stating they will be driven out of the workforce suggests it’s against their will. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-03-25T12:05:14	2014-03-24	['United_States']

Perhaps in honor of that distinction, U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley helped pushed a resolution claiming the first full week of December 2011 as "National Christmas Tree Week." The resolution notes that there are close to 15,000 farms growing Christmas trees in the United States and that there are roughly 100,000 people employed in the real tree industry. The resolution also states that Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states. Apparently, this is a common statistic repeated in Christmas tree fun facts around the country. But we had to think about it. Are there really Christmas tree farms in tropical Hawaii? What about in sunny New Mexico? The claim kind of made sense -- where else would people living in those states get their trees? -- but we had to check. "Well, it's one of those things I ‘know, but can't technically verify,’" said Rick Dungey of the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group for real farm-grown trees. He directed us to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which conducts a census survey of farms every five years, the most recent in 2007. Oregon led with 6.8 million trees harvested in 2007, out of 17.4 million nationwide. Alaska, Nevada and Wyoming were at the bottom, with zero cut trees harvested. So maybe Oregon’s junior senator had his facts wrong? We called Catherine Howard, publisher of Christmas Trees Magazine, a trade publication for growers. She said she didn’t know whether there are tree farms in all 50 states, but she suspects there may not be many -- or any -- growers in the Dakotas or in Montana. "You never hear about them; they're just not involved," she said. "And, probably, I'm guessing Arizona and New Mexico... it's very hard to grow Christmas trees in the Southwest." So now we’d stumbled upon new states that may lack tree farms, but nothing definite yet. We continued sleuthing. There are several websites where you can find a place in your state to buy fresh cut trees. The National Christmas Tree Association did not list any members in Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota or Alaska. But of course, the sites are not comprehensive. We plugged Alaska into the Christmas Tree Farm Network, and we found Bob Smith -- owner of Bob Smith’s Minnesota Christmas Trees in Anchorage. That’s right. Alaskans have flocked to him since 1962 to buy Balsam firs and Scotch pines from Minnesota. Smith said he didn’t know of any tree farms in Alaska, either, but there may be a small tree farmer he’s missed. Anyway, why are Christmas trees hard to grow in Alaska? It takes a long time, he said. "The ground never gets that warm. They get a lot of daylight in the summer, but they never get that warm." Next, we turned to the dry Southwest where we found several listings for cut holiday trees in Arizona. Mast-Roth Farms looked promising. We found the store online and learned that the family behind Mast-Roth has proudly "been bringing highest-quality Oregon Christmas Trees to the greater Phoenix area for over 30 years." Well, so much for locally grown in Phoenix. But then again, where else are Oregon Christmas trees to go? We’re not expected to consume one third of the country’s cut holiday trees, are we? Finally, we received a call from Alex Minchenkov, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. He confirmed that as of 2009 there were no cut Christmas tree farms in Wyoming or North Dakota. Utah was near the bottom of the list with two tree farm operations. The numbers, he acknowledged, may not include small-scale farmers. Which brings us to our final point. Even though Merkley’s resolution highlights commercial Christmas tree farms, his statement honors the tree itself. And people in Alaska, Arizona and Nevada can always get a permit and cut their own tree from a forest. Merkley spokesman Jamal Raad points out exactly that: "The resolution says Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states, not that there are Christmas tree farms in all 50 states, which may or may not be true." We could downgrade Merkley for his statement, because we’re not sure there are tree farms in all 50 states, and the resolution emphsizes commercial tree farms. But that would be so Grinch-like. Instead, we rule the statement True. Christmas trees grow in all 50 states, and they bring a lot of joy to families in the United States. Return to OregonLive to comment.

"I don't go tanning-tanning anymore because Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning," Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi says after her boyfriend is shown spray-tanning her face. "And I feel like he did that intentionally for us." "McCain would have never put a 10 percent tax on tanning," she said, adding, "because he's pale, so he'd probably want to be tan." McCain entered the discourse via Twitter: "Snooki, u r right, I would never tax your tanning bed! Pres Obama's tax/spend policy is quite The Situation. but I do rec wearing sunscreen!" We should hope so. McCain has a history of battling skin cancer. But let's get to the facts. Did President Barack Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning? On March 23, 2010, Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka the health care bill) into law. And Chapter 49, SEC. 5000B makes this all very clear: "There is hereby imposed on any indoor tanning service a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount paid for such service." We were pretty sure Snooki was kidding about Obama passing that provision specifically to stymie the Jersey Shore crew. But it turns out that the president had mentioned her by name on May 2, 2010, and said she'd be exempt: "This next provision is called the Jersey Shore-Up," Obama said. "It reads: 'The following individuals shall be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this bill: Snooki, J-WOWW, the Situation, and House Minority Leader John Boehner.'" ("The Situation" and "JWOWW" are other members of the Jersey Shore cast.) Alas, Obama's comment was made during the White House Correspondents Association Dinner. In other words, it was a joke. (Yes, it scares us too that Obama and McCain are so familiar with Jersey Shore.) If we really wanted to pick a fight with Snooki, we could take issue with her saying it was a tax on tanning. There's no fee on sunshine, just indoor tanning. Or that it's Obama's tax. There's no indication an indoor tanning tax was Obama's idea. It was proposed by Senate Democrats in December as an alternative to a proposed tax on cosmetic surgery. The cosmetic surgery lobby (funded by plastic surgeons) apparently held more sway than the indoor tanning lobby. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected the tax will raise $2.7 billion over 10 years to help offset the cost of expanding medical coverage. Legislators said they also hoped it might discourage teens from indoor tanning, as some studies suggest it is linked to higher risk of cancer. The bill was passed by Congress, but Obama signed it, so we think Snooki's assigning the tax to Obama is fair. One other small point. The indoor tanning tax goes into effect on July 1, 2010. So when Snooki made her comment, she still could've gotten her tan on sans Uncle Sam's extra reach. But we're assuming Snooki isn't so much worried about the money as the principle. We rate her comment friggin' True.	None	Snooki	None	None	None	2010-06-21T12:15:21	2010-06-07	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-14304	Expanding the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery stores is "good for everybody."	/colorado/statements/2016/apr/01/your-choice-colorado/ad-says-beer-and-wine-grocery-stores-good-everybod/	The feel-good TV ad featuring images of Colorado outdoor adventurers and happy people holding beers bottles declares it's time to "give Coloradans what they want — real craft beer at grocery stores." The political ad is sponsored by King Soopers, Walmart and Safeway, big chains that are backing a Colorado ballot measure to allow grocery and big box stores to sell full-strength beer and wine. The campaign operates under the group Your Choice Colorado. The ad features Chris Phelps, co-owner of Saint Patrick’s Brewing Company, who says if the proposal becomes reality, "People have more access to it (craft beer), the breweries have more access to the people, and it's good for everybody." That heady assessment is hotly contested by opponents, who say the ballot measure would hurt craft breweries and wineries because big grocery chains would just offer the better-known craft brands. They also warn it would cause the demise of hundreds of liquor stores, a crucial marketplace for craft brewers and wineries. We decided to examine the ad's claim that expanding the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery and big box stores will be "good for everybody." Brewhaha years in the making The brewing debate highlights a contradictory quirk about Colorado, where marijuana chain stores are legal but state law prohibits chain stores that sell alcohol. This in a state whose craft brewery industry nationally ranks first for state economic contribution per capita, second in the average amount of beer consumed by drinking-age adults (13.6 gallons annually), and third in barrels of craft beer produced (1.7 million annually). Under current state law, a grocery store chain can only have one licensed location that sells full-strength beer, wine and liquor. The one-location-per-license limit also applies to liquor stores. Otherwise, the state restricts grocery and convenience stores to selling beer that contains just 3.2 percent alcohol. Colorado is one of five states in the country that have the 3.2 percent beer restriction. (The others are Utah, Kansas, Minnesota and Oklahoma). Colorado's liquors restrictions date back more than 80 years ago to the end of Prohibition, the nation's 13-year ban on booze. Colorado liquor stores have a near-monopoly on the sale of beer, wine and hard liquor — except for the one liquor store outlet each grocery store chain can operate. Grocery store-funded study: Everybody wins! Your Choice Colorado argues modernizing the state’s "antiquated" alcohol laws will save consumers time and money, create about 200 new grocery stores, add an estimated 22,000 new jobs and boost craft beer sales by $125 million. This analysis comes from a study by a University of Denver economist funded by King Soopers, Walmart and Safeway. You can imagine why the opposing campaign, Keep Colorado Local, an alliance of liquor stores, craft breweries, wineries and the Colorado Restaurant Association, questions the findings right off the bat. Allowing full-strength beer and wine sales at grocery and big box stores will cut the prices Coloradans pay by 18 percent through increased competition, the study said. "Alcohol restrictions act like a tax on Colorado consumers, by contributing to significantly higher alcohol prices and limiting consumer choice," said the study’s author, Jack Strauss, the DU economics professor. Strauss calls the state’s liquor stores a "protected class," because they don’t face competitive pressure to lower prices and have a comparatively low business failure rate. But the economist said the law is also bad for craft-beer brewers, because their products are denied access to a wider marketplace. Passage of the ballot measure would bring tens of millions in sales to medium- to large-sized craft brewers, Strauss said, and smaller brewers could do well if they have a good product and "get lucky" by gaining access to the big retail stores. Small brewers, however, should continue to find a "specialty" product niche in liquor stores, he added. Strauss said his conclusions are supported by sales data from Washington state and Oregon, big craft-brewing states where full-strength beer and wine are sold in grocery and big box stores. He said Safeway and Kroger’s sales of local craft beer in Oregon and Washington are well over $100 million annually. Meanwhile, liquor store sales in Portland and Seattle have more sales per capita of 55 percent and 14 percent, respectively, than Denver liquor stores, Strauss said. In Colorado, he noted that liquor stores appear to be thriving near grocery and big-box stores that have their chain’s allotted one liquor-store location. He counted about 75 liquor stores near the King Soopers and Target stores that sell alcohol in Glendale and 35 liquor stores near the Safeway that sells alcohol in Littleton. Still, Strauss acknowledges there’s a possibility of "some small liquor stores potentially going under." Opponents say the big chain stores got what they paid for in the DU economist’s study. "The notion that liquor stores adjacent to a grocery store would stay in business is something that must have been authored in the creative writing department," said Curtis Hubbard, a spokesman for the opposing campaign’s alliance, Keep Colorado Local. Opponent-funded study: Liquor stores will be decimated Opponents cite a 2011 study by Summit Economics on the potential impacts of allowing full-strength beer to be sold Colorado grocery and convenience stores. The study was funded by the Colorado Licensed Beverage Association and other groups representing independent liquor stores. The study said that full-strength beer legislation, which was being considered by state lawmakers at the time, would devastate mom-and-pop liquors stores. The study predicted that if the full-strength beer proposal became law, within five years: • 700 independent liquor stores -- 42 percent of the state’s 1,650 total liquor stores -- would close. • 10,000 jobs would be lost, including liquor store workers and the rippling impact across the economy. • $240 million in annual wages would be lost. There are 311 licensed craft breweries in the state and more than 50 breweries oppose the ballot measure to allow beer and wine sales in grocery stores. They say the loss of liquor stores would harm brewers, too. "Liquor law in Colorado encourages breweries to grow like nowhere else and have made us the envy of the rest of the country," said John Carlson, executive director of the Colorado Brewers Guild. "Craft brewers are able to get their beer on the shelves of local liquor stores quickly and easily because they have the cooler space and the staff of local stores are their friends and neighbors who are invested in the community’s success. Colorado brewers enhance and grow the local economy." Yet, a 2009 study for the state legislature concluded the evidence from Colorado and other states shows that allowing full-strength beer sales in grocery and convenience stores would not cause "the widespread closings of liquor stores predicted by opponents." The study was for a proposed bill that ultimately failed. Independent economists: Lower prices, negative impact on liquor stores Independent economists we consulted agree that increased competition should lead to lower prices. But they also say it will hurt the liquor stores. "We find that prices are indeed lower in states where alcohol is sold in grocery stores," said Marco Costanigro, an associate professor of economics at Colorado State University who co-authored a 2013 study, Economic and Social Implications of Regulating Alcohol in Grocery Stores. "I am pretty positive that the lower prices can be ascribed to increased competition and the cost-savings that larger distributors can achieve thanks to economies of scale," Costanigro added. Martin Shields, another CSU economist, said that while allowing full-strength beer and wine in grocery stories will likely give consumers lower prices and convenient one-stop shopping, it "will likely significantly hurt liquor stores." Research shows the potential economic winners -- and losers -- of loosening restrictive alcohol laws. In a 2012 study, Cornell University economist Bradley J. Rickard did a simulation model to assess the likely economic effects of allowing wine sales at grocery stores in New York state. Despite a poll showing that 58 percent of New York state residents support allowing wine to be sold in grocery stores, legislative efforts to make it happen have failed over 50 years. Rickard's analysis found that, if grocers could sell wine, state tax revenue would increase by $22 million annually and revenue for state wineries would grow about 13 percent. But introducing wine in grocery stores would have "negative consequences" for liquor stores, whose revenues were calculated to fall by 28 percent, the study said. Our ruling A Your Choice Colorado ad says a ballot measure to expand the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery and big box stores will be "good for everybody." The economic impact study funded by large grocery retailers said the proposal would save consumers time and money, create about 200 more grocery stores, add 22,000 new jobs and boost craft beer sales by $125 million. Opponents forecast precisely the opposite effect, saying it would close 700 liquor stores, cause the loss of 10,000 jobs, and hurt craft breweries and wineries. Independent economists say the proposal would increase competition, giving consumers lower prices and convenient one-stop shopping. But they acknowledge that liquor stories will be negatively impacted. The ad makes a fair point about consumer benefits but goes too far in saying the measure works out for all sides.

pomt-11776	"Close to half of the voters in America, the only tax they pay is the payroll tax."	/florida/statements/2017/nov/28/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-wrongly-says-close-half-voters-america/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has worked to persuade Republican leaders to expand the child tax credit so the tax overhaul benefits more working families. To do this, Rubio said he wants to make the credit refundable against payroll taxes. The Republican tax framework proposes increasing the credit from the current amount of $1,000 and raising the current income threshold at which the credit phases out, but does not include plans to make it refundable against payroll taxes. This means it only affects families with a federal income tax liability, but a good chunk of people don’t pay income taxes because the tax code exempts them. "We have to make (the child tax credit) refundable against the payroll tax," Rubio said in a Nov. 26 sit-down with CBS4’s Jim DeFede. "Close to half of the voters in America, the only tax they pay is the payroll tax." Experts have told us that the amount of tax relief working families receive under the plan greatly depends on what happens to the child tax credit. But we wondered about Rubio’s point about payroll taxes. (He said "voters," but we’ll focus on the available data for households.) Rubio’s exact point is a stretch, but experts said he "has the spirit of the situation right." "If the senator was trying to emphasize the widespread burden of the payroll tax as a larger component of most families’ tax burdens, he is right about that," said Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. Differences between payroll, income taxes For the most part, payroll taxes are one of two things: deductions from an employee’s paycheck, and taxes paid by the employer based on the employee's earnings. The payroll tax is a big money generator for the government and is used for social programs, such as Medicare and Social Security. We were not able to identify an exact percentage of Americans (or voters) who only pay the payroll tax, and Rubio’s office didn’t provide any evidence to back his specific claim. We did find one estimate from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center relating to Americans that pay taxes on their income. The center estimated that 44 percent of households paid no federal income tax in 2016. In a subsequent report using the same estimates, the center said about 60 percent of people who paid no income tax still worked and owed payroll taxes. Based on the center’s estimates, this means about a quarter of all households pay payroll taxes, but not income taxes. That’s half as large as what Rubio said. So where does Rubio’s factoid come from? Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas pointed to research from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation that shows the vast majority of workers pay more in payroll taxes than they do income taxes. (The data behind the analysis came from the Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office.) Specifically, it found that about 80 percent of American taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than in individual income taxes. (Keep in mind, though, that the bottom 40 percent of earners pay no individual income tax.) Len Burman, a Tax Policy Center fellow, said that 76 percent of taxpayers in 2017 owe more payroll taxes than income taxes if you include the employer portion of the tax. If you only consider the employee portion of the payroll tax, Burman said, 54 percent of households owe more payroll tax than income tax. Looney also mentioned estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which found that for 65 percent of taxpayers, the payroll tax represents the largest component of their total tax burden. "The correct observation is that for most people who pay taxes, their payroll tax payments (counting their employers’ payments as their own, which accords with economic theory) are greater than their income tax payments," said Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution economist. It’s worth remembering that people pay a lot of other taxes besides income and payroll taxes that contribute to their overall burden to Uncle Sam — there are federal and state excise taxes, state and local sales taxes, and local property taxes. "Rubio is trying to make a reasonable point that many people try to make, but in doing so, (he) forgets that poor people pay more than just payroll and income taxes," said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at the group Tax Analysts. Our ruling Rubio said, "Close to half of the voters in America, the only tax they pay is the payroll tax." Rubio garbled the specific percentage, as the closest estimate we could find shows that about one-quarter of all households in 2016 paid the payroll tax but not the income tax. However, experts said that the point Rubio was trying to make — that for most people, the burden of the payroll tax exceeds that of the income tax — is correct. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02296	"Charlie Crist signed into law an automatic 15 percent annual tuition increase that put college further out of reach for many Floridians."	/florida/statements/2014/apr/03/rick-scott/charlie-crist-signed-automatic-15-percent-annual-t/	As the gubernatorial campaign season gears up, Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are trading shots over their records on education spending, with each accusing the other of making bad decisions. One such series of volleys has been over college tuition. "While Gov. Scott is fighting to keep college tuition low and has challenged all state colleges to offer $10,000 degrees to make college more affordable for Florida families, Charlie Crist signed into law an automatic 15 percent annual tuition increase that put college further out of reach for many Floridians," a campaign email to the media said on March 26, 2014. It preceded a Scott visit to Jefferson High School in Tampa, where Scott met with students to discuss college costs. We wanted to see whether Crist approved automatic 15 percent tuition increases. High cost of learning Back in 2009, Sen. Ken Pruitt, R-Fort Pierce, sponsored a bill to increase tuition at all 11 state universities by up to 15 percent a year, an idea Crist supported. It was an extension of a plan approved by the Legislature in 2007 that allowed the largest state research universities to charge an annual increase up to 15 percent. (Prior that, the Legislature set undergraduate tutition with no cap, while the Board of Governors set graduate and out-of-state rates, not to exceed 15 percent over the previous year.) The plan, known as tuition differential, allows universities to raise undergraduate tuition beyond any legislative base tuition hike as long as the total increase does not exceed 15 percent each year. The universities may keep raising tuition until reaching the national average, which for 2012-13 was $8,893. The Legislature approved the measure during the 2009 session. Crist signed both the budget and the differential law, which went into effect that year. Prior to the announcement, Crist had been an opponent of hiking tuition, vetoing a 5 percent tuition increase in 2007 and opposing a plan for higher rates at some universities. The argument for the increase was that Florida universities needed to raise tuition in order to pay for need-based scholarships, keep top professors and be competitive with other states -- Florida public universities were 45th in tuition costs in 2011 (the state was 43rd last year, according to the College Board). Some university officials have since complained that decreased post-secondary education funding from the Legislature has necessitated the need for massive tuition increases. There are a couple of inaccuracies in the way Scott’s campaign worded its claim. First, the increase is not automatic. The Legislature sets base tuition each year. If the state budget doesn’t provide a base increase, tuition goes up at the rate of inflation. Individual universities then may ask the Florida Board of Governors for another increase, known as the tuition differential. The base increase by the Legislature and the differential, if approved by the board, can total no more than 15 percent. It can be less, and has been several times since the 2009 law was passed. The final increase takes effect in the fall term of the year it is approved. Lawmakers approved an 8 percent increase in 2009. The Board of Governors followed with a 7 percent differential increase, bringing the total to 15 percent. The Legislature and the board repeated the numbers in 2010 and 2011 -- 8 percent from Tallahassee, 7 percent from the board. But in 2012, the Legislature did not set a base tuition increase. Instead of asking for the maximum allowable amount from the board, universities asked for a wide range of differential hikes. This was done in part to protest the continued cuts in state funding to universities. The following year, Scott vetoed a 3 percent increase from the Legislature, and the Board of Governors voted to prevent universities to even raise fees, though students supported some of the hikes. Tuition statewide increased by an inflation-based 1.7 percent, which Scott had opposed. The governor appoints the Board of Governors and is allowed to voice his opinion in regards to the potential increase. When we contacted Scott’s campaign, spokesman Greg Blair took responsibility for the remark, and admitted it was not worded correctly. "It’s not automatic in the sense that it happens year over year no matter what," he told PolitiFact Florida. "However, it did take the increase out of the hands of the Legislature and the governor and allowed every school in Florida to raise tuition by 15 percent." Our ruling Scott’s campaign said in an email to reporters, "Charlie Crist signed into law an automatic 15 percent annual tuition increase." It’s true that Crist did sign a law allowing tuition increases, but they were neither automatic nor always 15 percent. The legislation allowed the Board of Governors to supplement whatever increase lawmakers provided in the state budget by increasing tuition up to a total of 15 percent. While the tuition differential was used to its fullest extent for several years, a Board of Governors vote was required each year. The governor has no say over what the board decides, but does pick the members. The amount by which the board has voted to change tuition has varied the past two years. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-04-03T10:00:00	2014-03-26	['Charlie_Crist']
pomt-09226	Elena Kagan is "a New York City radical, Marxist lawyer through and through."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/14/michael-savage/michael-savage-says-kagan-marxist/	You write your senior thesis on socialism, it's bound to come up if you want to become a Supreme Court Justice. Elena Kagan did. And it has. "Now the empty skirts in the media are saying that she doesn't have much of a 'paper trail' that would reveal her views on issues," said conservative radio commentator Michael Savage, "but her senior thesis at Princeton was entitled, 'To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900-1933.' She's a New York City radical, Marxist lawyer through and through." The question is not whether Kagan wrote the paper. It's available to anyone who's willing to pay the Princeton University Library $54.60 to read it. The question is whether the thesis reveals Kagan to be "a New York City radical, Marxist lawyer through and through." We paid our $54.60, and read the 153-page senior thesis submitted by Kagan in April 1981. And we can say for sure that nowhere in the paper did Kagan say that she is a socialist. In fact, while Kagan offers strong opinions about various theories of the decline of the socialist party, she does not give her opinions about the party's political ideas. The closest we get to an insight into why Kagan selected that topic is in the acknowledgements at the start of the paper, where she wrote, "Finally, I would like to thank my brother Marc, whose involvement in radical causes led me to explore the history of American radicalism in the hope of clarifying my own political ideas." The rest of the paper is an examination of why the socialist party never took off. Kagan focused on the socialist party in New York City as a microcosm of the national movement, and sought to answer the central question, "What caused the strange death of socialism in New York City?" And, she concludes, "The socialists' failure to maintain their momentum grew from their failure ever to achieve internal harmony." We put a call in to Savage's people at World Net Daily to see if there was some other evidence to support the "Marxist" claim other than Kagan's college thesis, and we got no reply. So we're left with the thesis. Here are the parts of it that have given some people pause (they're from the paper's conclusion): "In our times, a coherent socialist movement is nowhere to be found in the United States. Americans are more likely to speak of a golden past than of a golden future, of capitalism's glories than of socialism's greatness. Conformity overrides dissent; the desire to conserve has overwhelmed the urge to alter. Such a state of affairs cries out for explanation. Why, in a society by no means perfect, has a radical party never attained the status of a major political force? Why, in particular, did the socialist movement never become an alternative to the nation's established parties?" And this is the final paragraph: "Through its own internal feuding, then, the (Socialist Party) exhausted itself forever and further reduced labor radicalism in New York to the position of marginality and insignificance from which it has never recovered. The story is a sad but also chastening one for those who, more than a half century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America. Radicals have often succumbed to the devastating bane of sectarianism; it is easier, after all, to fight one's fellows than it is to battle an entrenched and powerful foe. Yet if the history of Local New York shows anything, it is that American radicals cannot afford to become their own worst enemies. In unity lies their only hope." Does this amount to Kagan showing political leanings toward socialism? Not according to Sean Wilentz, the Princeton history professor who advised Kagan on her senior thesis. "She was interested in it," Wilentz told the New York Times. "To study something is not to endorse it." According to a May 1, 2010, story on Kagan in the Daily Princetonian, "Wilentz defended Kagan against her critics, noting that she was adept at removing her personal beliefs from her academic research on labor and radical history. "Sympathy for the movement of people who were trying to better their lives isn't something to look down on," Wilentz told the Princetonian. "Studying something doesn't necessarily mean that you endorse it. It means you're into it. That's what historians do." And just to be even more clear, Wilentz said, "Elena Kagan is about the furthest thing from a socialist. Period. And always had been. Period." Indeed, in an interview with the student paper, Steven Bernstein, a classmate who appointed Kagan to the school paper, described her politics as "progressive and thoughtful but well within the mainstream of the ... sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case." In her later, professional career, Kagan aligned herself with the Democratic Party. In 1988, she was a staff member on Gov. Mike Dukakis' presidential campaign. She later served as associate counsel to President Bill Clinton, and went on to act as Clinton's deputy assistant for domestic policy. And, of course, she was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as solicitor general last year. Yet there's nothing in her record that suggests she's a Marxist, as Savage claimed. Yes, she wrote a paper about socialism in college. But she never said in the thesis that she subscribed to the political ideas of socialism. In fact, she mostly adopts the dispassionate tone of a historian. And there's certainly nothing in the public record to suggest she has since become one.

pomt-09541	"The law is very clear! 'The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt.'"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/05/judd-gregg/gregg-claims-tarp-money-must-be-used-pay-down-defi/	President Barack Obama has proposed a boost for small businesses, but Sen. Judd Gregg isn't hot on the idea. In a hearing about the administration's latest budget, Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, criticized the White House for proposing to use funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, an initiative originally intended to keep the banking system from collapsing, to help community banks lend to small businesses. Gregg said it violates TARP rules. "The whole concept of the TARP was that as we recoup the money ... and as we recoup that money, we would use it to pay down the debt," Gregg said, responding to Obama's Feb. 2, 2010, proposal to transfer $30 billion from TARP to a new program that will support small business lending. "Now that's not going to happen. ... It's become a piggy bank. ... The law is very clear! 'The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for the reduction of the public debt.'" Peter Orszag, Obama's budget chief, defended the proposal. "The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity," he told Gregg. "And remember, the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets ... and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels. One of the lingering problems in our financial markets, however, is access to credit for small businesses." Late in 2009, Obama ran into similar criticism from Republican lawmakers after he announced that he wanted to use unspent TARP money for tax breaks for small businesses and investments in infrastructure projects, among other things. Then, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said, "To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law, and it would betray the trust of the American people." We found Pence's claim to be Half True. On one hand, the TARP legislation is quite clear: Section 106, Part D of the TARP legislation: "Revenues of, and proceeds from the sale of troubled assets purchased under this Act, or from the sale, exercise, or surrender of warrants or senior debt instruments acquired under section 113 shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt." But we also talked with budget experts who said that Congress could get around those rules in a number of ways. For example, Congress could rescind the TARP money and then, in a separate action, use it to pay other expenses, said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Congress can of course vote to spend new money on anything it wants," Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, told us in December. In Gregg's case, though, he's strictly talking about what the law says, that TARP money cannot be used for anything other than deficit reduction. He's right and we find his claim True.

pomt-07365	"I’ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/06/herb-kohl/sen-herb-kohl-says-hes-never-done-any-negative-cam/	Twenty-three years into his Senate tenure, Wisconsin’s Herb Kohl hasn’t announced whether he will seek another six-year term in 2012. But as Republicans step up their criticism of him, Kohl is making crystal clear his disdain for the kind of rough-and-tumble campaign environment that almost surely would be part of another campaign. Compared to his last couple races when Kohl used his massive personal fortune to vanquish underfunded opponents with soft-sell TV ads, it would be a new environment for the senator who owns the Milwaukee Bucks and built the Kohl’s department and grocery store chains. In remarks to reporters in Madison on April 28, 2011, Kohl ruminated about the state of today’s campaigns. He said "people don’t like anybody in public life" because of "venomous" attacks and sniping among congressional members, something he said he engages in "hardly at all." Then he got specific: "I’ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning. And I don’t get into any personal jousts with other people in public life. But that’s just my style." So has Kohl really avoided any negative campaigning? That’s quite a claim in this age of mud-slinging and aggressive campaign tactics. We decided to check it out. Of course, it would be impossible to track down every campaign statement Kohl made since 1988 and copies of decades-old TV ads. So we focused our look-back to media descriptions of TV ads, debates and the candidates’ strategies in his four races. We also talked to the people who should know best: several of his former opponents or their aides, Kohl’s campaign staff, and a longtime political reporter. Kohl has of course benefited from negative attacks launched by groups supporting his campaigns, but he spoke only of his own campaigns’ conduct, so we’ll limit our review to that. One more note before we begin: Because there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes "negative" campaigning, we asked Team Kohl what exactly he meant by his claim. "Sen. Kohl has said that he believes campaigning is about telling the people of Wisconsin what he’s done and what he plans to do, not tearing down his opponent or telling people not to vote for them," Kohl press secretary Lynn Becker said. "He has not been deliberately malicious or factually dishonest in his campaigns or while serving in public office." Indeed, his two most recent opponents said there was no negative campaigning in their contests -- and had high praise for Kohl. "He never did anything negative in his campaign. He’ll have the job as long as he wants the job," said John Gillespie, founder of Rawhide Boys Ranch, who lost to Kohl in 2000. "Say hi to Herb if you talk to him. Tell him I owe him a dinner," said Robert Lorge, Kohl’s 2006 rival. Fair enough. Those were landslide wins. What about the earlier contests? 1988: Kohl was a surprise entrant in the Democratic primary, winning the nomination comfortably over former Gov. Tony Earl, Ed Garvey and Doug La Follette. He frustrated his rivalsby limiting his debate participation and spending millions on TV ads. At the time, Earl’s media consultant David Axelrod charged that Kohl’s popular slogan -- "Nobody’s Senator But Yours" -- was an implicit negative attack. It implied that candidates who -- unlike Kohl -- have to raise most of their campaign money are beholden to donors, said Axelrod, who later went on to help a guy named Barack Obama get elected president. Earl attacked Kohl as uninformed and error-prone, prompting Kohl campaign aide Bill Christofferson to call Earl "desperate" and guilty of misrepresentation. Insiders on both sides agree that Kohl ran no attack ads in the primary -- and none in the very tight general election that saw Republican state legislator Susan Engeleiter close the gap to just a few pointswith a series of ads targeting Kohl in the closing weeks. Engeleiter herself told us she has "nothing but positive recollections" of a "pretty cordial campaign." She also praised Kohl’s dealing with her when she later was confirmed as administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. La Follette and Garvey say today that they wouldn’t call Kohl’s primary race negative. Regarding Kohl’s slogan, La Follette agreed with Kohl aide Christofferson, who said: "Herb Kohl was talking about himself, not anyone else, when he promised to be 'nobody's senator but yours.'" Indeed, Kohl explicitly used his positive campaign ads as a selling point, and called his victory a blow against negative campaigning. 1994: In his first re-election campaign, Kohl wasted little time aggressively portraying Republican opponent Robert Welch, a state lawmaker from Redgranite, as an "extreme conservative" and flip-flopper. At an early debate, he cited Welch’s no-exceptions stance against abortion and his vow never to vote for a tax hike as "extreme." According to media accounts, he did not explain the flip-flop charge. Afterwards, Welch told reporters Kohl was "nastier than I expected." Later, after Welch attempted to tie Kohl to President Clinton, Kohl launched a rare TV ad that focused on an opponent by name. Another followed. The ads accused Welch of distorting Kohl’s record. One said that "fellow Republicans" had criticized Welch’s tactics -- something deemed misleading in a Milwaukee Journal fact check. The exchange led Welch to accuse Kohl of running a "multimillion dollar mudslinging campaign." Kohl said it was Welch who went negative. The rhetoric heated up. At one point in the race, after Welch accused Kohl of "religion bashing," Kohl spokesman Jeffrey Gillis said that " Welch's attack again shows that he'll say or do anything to get elected." So, that seems like quite a bit of snarling. Looking back, though, Welch’s campaign manager Mike Maxwell doesn’t have strong opinions about the back and forth. "I don’t know that Kohl was particularly negative through that election," he told us. He didn’t recall the "distort" ad that Kohl ran. He did say that some might consider the "extreme" charge a negative attack. Kohl, Maxwell recalled, "just had overwhelming resources and then he signed (Bucks first round draft choice Glenn Robinson) six days before the election." (We could not reach Welch for comment). Kenneth Lamke, a Milwaukee Sentinel reporter who covered the 1994 race, offered the strongest opinion we heard on whether Kohl went negative against Welch. He says yes. Lamke said the "extreme" charge by Kohl was "within bounds but uncharacteristic of Herb." Lamke viewed the attack as unprovoked and an exaggeration; Gillis, the Kohl aide, said it was a response to the drumbeat of criticism of Kohl during the Republican primary. Lamke, we should note, asked us to describe his personal politics as "leans Republican." We asked several political scientists to characterize the language of the Kohl ad. They reacted cautiously because we could not provide the ad itself, just direct quotes from it in media accounts. That makes it impossible to fully judge the tone. Vanderbilt professor John Geer, an author of a much-cited book on negative campaigning, said it sounded like a "tame" response ad -- "not the kind of classic negative ad the public doesn’t like." Darrell West, of the Brookings Institution, agreed. UW-Madison’s Ken Goldstein said Kohl’s ad met the academic research definition of "negative" because it focused on Welch, not Kohl. The test of whether it was unfair is whether it was accurate, he said. So Kohl’s campaigns have been remarkably low-confrontation affairs, with the most notable exception being 1994, the first -- and perhaps only -- time Kohl aired TV spots going after an opponent. So how does Kohl fare on his statement that he has never campaigned negatively? Clearly, Kohl has spent the vast bulk of his time and money on upbeat, positive ads. Even his opponents agree strongly with that -- one even wants to buy him dinner. The only ad that pops up as arguably negative is the 1994 "distort" spot against Welch. It drew some critical attention, but is viewed as a pretty tame response ad. Beyond that, Kohl’s campaigns have engaged in some labeling and name calling. And Kohl’s aggressive 1994 portrayal of Welch as an "extremist" was arguably negative. Kohl is mostly on target here, with some minor exceptions. Mostly True.

pomt-02505	North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis would let insurance companies "deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/13/patriot-majority-usa/pro-democratic-group-says-north-carolina-senate-ca/	A race in North Carolina has become one of the top battles in the war to control the U.S. Senate. Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., is trying to win a second term and help keep the Democrats in control. But she is expected to face a tough race against one of several Republicans competing in the primary. One of the leading candidates is Thom Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House. Patriot Majority USA, a pro-Democratic group operating independently of the Hagan campaign, has begun to run ads against Tillis, who has already benefited from a blizzard of ads against Hagan that were paid for by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity. Here’s the narration of the ad: "In North Carolina, we put families first. But Senate candidate Thom Tillis sides with health insurance companies. He'd let them deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and raise rates for women needing mammograms. Tillis supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it, and force seniors to spend up to $1,700 more for prescriptions. He's with the special interests; hurting North Carolina families." We wondered whether it was true that Tillis would let insurance companies "deny coverage for pre-existing conditions." In making the claim about pre-existing conditions, the ad cites a Charlotte Observer article from Sept. 23, 2013. That article, in turn, cites a comment from Tillis that we tracked back to a news release from his campaign. In it, Tillis said in part, "Many have asked where I stand in the battle to defund Obamacare. … I believe Obamacare is a mortal threat to our economy. It will decrease health care quality and raise health care premiums, and Republicans should do everything in our power to undo it. That means we must use every tool available to us." A spokesman for Patriot Majority told PolitiFact that "Tillis wants to repeal the ACA. Fact. If you repeal the ACA then … people could be denied coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Fact." But is it as simple as that? Not necessarily. It’s fair to assume that if Obamacare is repealed -- and, importantly, if nothing is passed in its place -- then the law’s consumer protections against getting denied for a pre-existing condition would disappear with it. But at least some Republican congressional leaders have been saying that they want to "repeal and replace" the law. In fact, just in the past few weeks, three GOP senators -- Richard Burr of North Carolina, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Orrin Hatch of Utah -- have put forth a proposal that would do just that. Most important to this fact-check, their proposal would keep the pre-existing conditions protection in Obamacare -- a provision that’s generally popular even among critics of the overall law. The Burr-Coburn-Hatch proposal isn’t as ironclad on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare is. It would allow a one-time window to get pre-existing conditions grandfathered into coverage, and protection as long as coverage is continuous. But beyond the initial grandfathering period, any lapse in coverage would mean the next policy someone buys would not necessarily cover pre-existing conditions. This protection isn’t as sweeping as it is under Obamacare, but it’s better than what existed before Obamacare. For the purposes of this fact-check, however, we will consider this to be one way of keeping some form of pre-existing conditions protection. So we checked with Tillis’ campaign to see whether he supported the Republican plan or if he wants simply to repeal Obamacare, as the ad suggests. Here’s what Tillis’ campaign manager and spokesman, Jordan Shaw, said: "Speaker Tillis doesn’t believe that the Affordable Care Act is the only way to address health care problems. While he hasn’t officially endorsed the Burr-Coburn-Hatch plan because he hasn’t had a chance to discuss it in detail with Sen. Burr, he does think there are many good ideas in the plan. It is certainly a positive step toward a conservative alternative to Obamacare." So Tillis is open to legislation that would replace Obamacare, but he hasn’t endorsed the main Republican plan currently on the table that, among other things, would include some protections for people with pre-existing conditions. So what about his past statements? Has Tillis said the health care law should be replaced with something that keeps popular elements of the law in place? We asked Shaw twice if he could provide documentation -- in speeches, news releases or videos -- of cases where Tillis made this point. But he didn’t reply. So we looked ourselves. We didn’t find any. Most often, we found, Tillis has used the word "repeal" without adding "replace." For instance: • The "Meet Tom" page on Tillis’ website: "As North Carolina’s U.S. senator, Tillis will push for repeal of Obamacare, a balanced budget, and conservative economic policy." • A statement criticizing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.: "My campaign to beat Kay Hagan is the key to a new conservative majority that will repeal Obamacare and balance the budget." • A tweet during the State of the Union address: "Obamacare's not working. Support repeal & end its $819.3 billion tax burden. #AskObama --> http://dld.bz/dg7Ca #SOTU." The closest he comes is another page on his website, where he says, "Thom will fight in the Senate for full repeal of Obamacare, for defunding Obamacare, and he will work to implement private-sector solutions to reduce health care costs for North Carolinians." Still, not only is his support for "private-sector solutions" vague, but he specifically cites solutions that "reduce health care costs," not ones that keep people from getting insurance if they have pre-existing conditions. Tillis is engaged in a primary against candidates fighting to win support among Republican base voters who are the hardest-line opponents of Obamacare. Given this situation, acknowledging that there are even small parts of Obamacare worth saving can be electoral suicide. However, constantly calling for repeal without acknowledging there may be a need to replace the law with something else makes it hard to be too critical of an ad that infers that he would let insurance companies "deny coverage for pre-existing conditions." Our ruling Patriot Majority USA’s ad said Tillis would let insurance companies "deny coverage for pre-existing conditions." Tillis’ staff says he is open to replacing the law, perhaps with the Burr-Coburn-Hatch proposal, but he hasn’t endorsed it yet. More importantly, we don’t find examples in which Tillis has publicly advocated replacing Obamacare with something else, at least not prior to our asking him about it in regards to this ad. Given all of this, we can’t really blame Patriot Majority USA for drawing the conclusion that Tillis would repeal Obamacare and not replace it. Still, we're left with an element of uncertainty about what Tillis' position on pre-existing conditions actually is. Overall, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02615	"With the tax controls we already put in place, property taxes on a typical home in December of 2014 will actually be lower than they were in December of 2010."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/23/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-typical-property-tax-bill-year-w/	In an hour-long State of the State speech, Gov. Scott Walker made 42 references to taxes while unveiling proposals for additional income- and property-tax cuts. One statement in particular grabbed our attention. "With the tax controls we already put in place, property taxes on a typical home in December of 2014 will actually be lower than they were in December of 2010." The Republican governor says that even before his new plan for more property tax relief would kick in, he and GOP lawmakers already have lowered the typical bill by virtue of past tax controls they put in place. Is he right? Walker draws his numbers in part from reports by the respected, non-partisan budget scorekeeping agency, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Every year, the bureau estimates the property tax bill of a median-valued home taxed at the statewide average property rate. It’s an illustration, not a real-world example. Even if your home is right at that statewide average, your results might be different due to various factors. And there are other variations -- higher and lower -- due to property values and levies in individual communities. Statewide, combined property tax collections for 2014 are likely to be somewhat higher than they were in 2010, noted Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. That’s partly because the controls put on school districts and municipalities were not absolute. But the Fiscal Bureau’s single-property illustration is an oft-used benchmark that politicians use to communicate state budget math in a down to earth fashion. The bureau’s numbers: In December 2010, just before Walker took office, this hypothetical median home had a tax bill of $2,963. The projected figure for the end of 2014 is lower by $9 -- $2,954. (Walker also cites a state Department of Revenue report that puts the decrease at $8). It’s a tiny drop, but it’s worth noting that from 2006 to 2010, the typical bill went up by $230. So the turnaround is significant. A major factor in the drop are the tax and spending restraints Republicans have placed on local governments and schools during Walker’s tenure. We gave Walker a Promise Kept for virtually freezing property taxes in his first budget. Additionally, the property tax picture was affected by the negative news in the home market. The recession and its aftermath pushed down home values, dropping the median-valued home from a peak of $172,000 in 2008 to $148,000 by 2013. It’s projected to pop up to $151,000 by December 2014, the Fiscal Bureau estimated. Those falling home values contributed to smaller bills, said Knapp. Finally, it’s important to note that the figures Walker relies upon are projections subject to change. So when he says the median bill "will actually be lower" it should be kept in mind that we don’t know that yet. But that’s what the projection shows -- and it will be helped if legislators approve Walker’s new plan for even more property tax savings. Our rating Walker said, "With the tax controls we already put in place, property taxes on a typical home in December of 2014 will actually be lower than they were in December of 2010." It wasn’t all because of the Republican actions, and the claim is based on projections that could change. But the governor’s main point is solid based on the specific citation he highlights from a respected source. With the caveats noted, we rate this Mostly True.

pomt-05452	Says she made a "cold call" and persuaded an Illinois company to relocate to Wisconsin.	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/25/rebecca-kleefisch/lt-gov-rebecca-kleefisch-says-her-cold-call-persua/	Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch says she’s on a jobs mission. Since taking office in January 2011, she’s held small business roundtable discussions throughout the state and engaged in other efforts to boost the state’s business climate. One of the strategies: Picking up the phone. "Right after I was elected I started making cold calls down to Illinois," Kleefisch told talk show host Charlie Sykes on March 28, 2012. "The fact is, my method has met with some serious successes." Then she got specific: "You’ll remember that Fox Business News live streamed the move of one of the companies I called from Rockton, Illinois, to Beloit, Wisconsin." Kleefisch is facing a June 5, 2012, recall election. And, like Gov. Scott Walker, she has gone on the offensive, particularly on the jobs issue. "It kind of silenced the critics who said it was beneath the lieutenant governor to make cold calls," Kleefisch said on the radio. "Because how could something possibly be beneath a leader if it works and it brings jobs to the state?" Said Kleefisch spokeswoman Jeanne Tarantino: "Had she not done this, (they) would have gone to another state. That’s pretty obvious." Let’s take a closer look at Kleefisch’s claim. The company in question is FatWallet.com, an online business that helps consumers find coupon deals. FatWallet receives commissions from companies such as Amazon.com and Newegg.com each time a customer clicks through to one of those big sites. Its headquarters was an almost-new $5 million high-tech building the company had constructed in the village of Rockton, Ill., a few miles from the Wisconsin border. In January 2011, the Illinois legislature passed a bill that would tax online retailers like Amazon if they had a retail presence in the state -- including an "affiliate," or partner, such as FatWallet. State officials said Illinois is losing $150 million a year in sales tax revenue to online firms. They also wanted to protect local companies who are losing sales to online retailers. After the law was passed Jan. 6, 2011, Amazon and other firms threatened to cut off business from companies like FatWallet.com as of April 15, 2011, if the measure was signed by Gov. Pat Quinn. "I feel like I’ve been completely flipped the bird," FatWallet founder and CEO Tim Storm told the Chicago Tribune after the measure passed. "Essentially, 30 to 40 percent of our revenue gets shut off instantaneously." He also said: "The reality is that as a business owner with 52 employees, we're not going to just get shut down because of a law Illinois passes. Our customers don't care whether we're in the state of Illinois." So, that gave Wisconsin an opening -- a big one. Indeed, it would be two months before Quinn signed the measure on March 10, 2011. Tarantino said Kleefisch spoke to Storm on the phone during the first week in March 2011, and he visited her office in Madison on March 15. "She told him about the reforms in place in Wisconsin" and that the Walker administration had no plans to enact a similar tax, she said. Storm had considered moving the company to Las Vegas or Florida to escape the Illinois sales tax law, said FatWallet spokesman Brent Shelton. But Wisconsin was a lot closer, a move to Beloit was less expensive and disruptive, he said. "We were already considering Wisconsin before she called," Shelton said. So that suggests Kleefisch’s role was far from pivotal. Here is the look at the sequence of what happened. September 2010: Storm contacts the city of Beloit and asks about space in a city-owned building downtown, according to Beloit economic development director Andrew Janke. That inquiry comes after the Illinois Legislature briefly considered -- but didn’t pass -- the Internet tax law. First week of March 2011: Kleefisch, who was elected with Walker in November 2010, contacts FatWallet. Her office did not provide an exact date. March 10, 2011: Quinn signs the measure into law. March 11, 2011: Storm tweets: "@GovWalker would you like @FatWallet, the #20 best small business to work in the nation to cross the border to WI? Let's chat." March 12, 2011: Storm tweets: "What a difference 5 miles makes." March 15, 2011: Kleefisch meets with Storm in Madison. City of Beloit officials invite Storm to consider leasing the city-owned space there. Kleefisch and other state officials were not involved with the offer made to FatWallet. March 22, 2011: Gov. Walker tweets at Storm: "Good talking w/u. Welcome 2 WI. We r not going 2 raise taxes as it would drive jobs out. We want u 2 grow here." March 25, 2011: FatWallet strikes a deal with Beloit to lease the city space. The City Council held a special meeting -- it was a Friday night -- to approve a one-year lease. The lease was renewed for another year in February 2012. The company pays rent of $7,716 a month. April 8, 2011: The company moves five miles north, across the border to Beloit. Once the move was planned, Shelton alerted Fox Business News, and the channel jumped on the story and televised the event live, saying a growing Internet company was forced to relocate because of the new Illinois sales tax law. Kleefisch was waiting with an "Open for Business" sign when the caravan of FatWallet employees and the television crew arrived at the Beloit office. During the live broadcast, Kleefisch was asked by the Fox reporter about the cold call she made to Storm. "It worked," she said that day. "You can see it coming to fruition today." Shelton, the company spokesman, described an important -- but very limited -- role for Kleefisch in convincing the company to move to Wisconsin. "She was very instrumental in making verbal promises that these kind of taxes would not be passed on his (Walker’s) watch," he said. A few footnotes: FatWallet received no economic assistance from the state of Wisconsin for making the move to Beloit, and the state did not play a role in securing the lease in Beloit, according to all parties involved, including Kleefisch’s office. Shelton said the national publicity stirred by the move led to a sharp increase in the company’s sales. On Sept. 9, 2011, Storm sold FatWallet to San Francisco-based Ebates.com. Storm left the company but remains as a part-time consultant and chairman. The company’s Rockton office space was owned by another business run by Storm and not FatWallet. "That’s what businesses do, they take advantage of an opportunity," said Rockton, Ill., Mayor Dale Adams. Our conclusion Kleefisch says she "cold called" FatWallet.com and persuaded the company to move from Illinois to Wisconsin. There’s no question that she made the call and that she met with the company’s CEO. But the wheels were turning for FatWallet to move months earlier. Indeed, the company had already inquired about office space in Beloit. (Employees could literally see Wisconsin from their Rockton building). The short move allowed the company to avoid the Illinois sales tax, and ensured that its employees didn’t have to pull up roots. It’s clear from the chain of events that the state -- and Kleefisch -- played a minimal role in encouraging FatWallet to move to Wisconsin. But they certainly did not play the pivotal role, as Kleefisch suggested. We rate her claim Mostly False. (You can comment on this item on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's website) (Editor's note, May 15, 2012) In a new TV ad, launched May 9, 2012, Kleefisch makes a similar claim to the one we evaluated and in materials supporting the ad her campaign indicates she first spoke with a company representative in January of 2011 -- not March as her spokesman told us. Since the claim related to her role in convincing the business to move here, not when she made her first call, it does not change our rating. Indeed, in the ad Kleefisch modifies a bit her original claim that it was her call that persuaded the company to make the move. Here’s what she says in the ad: "So I called them up and told them why they should move to Wisconsin, and they did. That’s just one of many businesses we’ve helped create more jobs."

pomt-15183	"Zero Planned Parenthood facilities are licensed to do mammograms. Planned Parenthood, women don’t need you!"	/georgia/statements/2015/aug/21/alliance-defending-freedom/numbers-right-mammogram-claim-missing-context/	Covertly filmed videos showing fake brokers discussing terms for procuring fetal tissue have prompted federal efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, led to a statewide inquiry into how the group disposes of such tissue in Georgia and apparently created some confusion among voters. One reader forwarded us a Tweet from the Alliance Defending Freedom that shows two national maps side by side, wondering how mammograms play into the abortion debate. The first map purports to pinpoint the 8,000-plus mammography facilities licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The second map lacks a single dot, to show the number of licensed facilities run by Planned Parenthood. "Zero Planned Parenthood facilities are licensed to do mammograms," the Tweet read. "Planned Parenthood, women don’t need you!" Our reader wanted to know, is it a false flag to talk about essential women’s health care such as mammograms in the debate over Planned Parenthood? PolitiFact has been down this road before, but it’s worth a repeat trip given the defunding debate stirred by those stealth videos. The anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress says its videos show Planned Parenthood proposes to illegally sell fetal tissue, something that Planned Parenthood adamantly denies. PolitiFact recapped the facts in that controversy here. Two state agencies have since reported that abortion clinics in Georgia are properly disposing of aborted fetuses and fetal tissue. Among the 12 clinics found to be following state law was the sole facility run by Planned Parenthood Southeast in the state, in Augusta. But on the federal level, the effort by congressional Republicans to strip $500 million in annual funding to Planned Parenthood has drawn more ire on both sides of the issue. Critics of Planned Parenthood say the videos show the organization has questionable practices. Supporters denounce the effort as an effective cut to women’s health care, citing the gynecological, referral and medical services the agency also provides. Casey Mattox, the senior counsel at the anti-abortion Alliance Defending Freedom, said he was attempting to cut off that debate by using the maps to point out that Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms. "You can’t go there and actually get a mammogram, which is what most people assume when they hear you can go there and get cancer screenings for breast health," Mattox said. "That is, at best, misleading, if not directly false." Mattox pointed us to the Food and Drug Administration’s list of facilities licensed to perform mammograms under the Mammography Quality Standards Act. The agency certifies the facilities across the nation and in military bases worldwide. The list, updated weekly, includes more than 8,700 facilities. A representative from the FDA did not get back to us by deadline, but a search of the list does not yield any facilities with the official "Planned Parenthood" name in its title. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Liz Clark confirmed why: The organization does not provide mammograms at any of its health centers. (One caveat: some clinics have brought in mobile mammography vans to clinic sites for special events. But none of the machines were a permanent part of a Planned Parenthood center). So Mattox is correct, by Planned Parenthood’s own acknowledgement, that the organization does not provide mammograms. But does that mean there is no need for Planned Parenthood when it comes to accessing the tests? The answer to that is far less clear but provides the context that shows why the overall argument is muddled. Planned Parenthood provided 487,029 breast exams or breast care services in 2013, the most recent year available. Based on those clinical exams and a doctor assessing risk factors, the group refers patients for mammograms and/or specialist follow-ups for procedures such as biopsies and, in some cases, financial assistance, Clark said. In that regard, Planned Parenthood functions mostly as a privately paid OB-GYN would in referring a patient for a service the doctor’s office didn’t provide. "Focusing on one narrow data point to create a false ‘gotcha’ moment ignores the larger picture of how Planned Parenthood both provides and connects millions of people to health care in communities across the country," Clark said. "The graphic is misleading because I wouldn’t walk into a mammogram facility to get a mammogram without first visiting my OB-GYN for an exam and a referral -- which is what Planned Parenthood provides," she added. Mattox said there is no reason, though, that Planned Parenthood must serve as the referring agency. According to the Charlotte Lozier Institute, there are more than 13,000 clinics nationwide that provide comprehensive health care for women and could at least provide referrals and, in some cases, the mammograms themselves. The pressure to "defund" Planned Parenthood is actually to redirect the federal money to those other facilities, Mattox said. "It’s nothing unique to Planned Parenthood if all they are doing is a referral," he said. "There are other health center options, with licenses that can do this directly on site. If you go to Planned Parenthood, you need to know you are not going to get that." Dr. Otis Brawley, the chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, agrees that Planned Parenthood does not need to be the referring physician for a mammogram. But the standard is for a doctor to provide the clinical, physical exam and then refer the patient for the screening at a mammography center – and it has been since 1970, Brawley said. Various risk factors determine referrals, as does the patient’s age. For women between 20 and 40, a doctor will order a mammogram if an abnormality is detected or suspected during the physical exam. For women older than 40, even a normal exam generally triggers a screening mammogram, Brawley said. "I’ve personally had patients who went to Planned Parenthood and got a referral that was also a voucher, so that the mammogram was paid for as well," Brawley said. "The first step is always to see a doctor, but there are cases where the referral was also a way for Planned Parenthood to reimburse the outside facility for the mammogram screening." Our ruling Covert videos showing discussions of fetal tissue sales have reignited the abortion debate nationally and in Georgia. In an effort to debunk defenders that Planned Parenthood provides essential women’s health services in addition to abortions, an anti-abortion group claimed that none of the organization’s clinics is licensed to provide mammograms. Federal data and Planned Parenthood’s own documents back up the claim from the Alliance Defending Freedom. However, that narrow bit of information ignores that Planned Parenthood physicians perform the clinical exams that lead to referrals for a mammogram or other specialized breast care. The physical exam is a necessary step in the process of getting the screening, although ADF has a valid point that other physicians could provide that piece of the process. That puts the claim in the realm that won’t make either side happy: partially accurate but misleading without additional details. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-12951	Says Kate Cloonen "needs that extra $68,000" lawmaker salary on top of the "$8.5 million in state contracts for her construction company."	/illinois/statements/2017/jan/05/aaron-degroot/illinois-gop-press-secretary-makes-8-million-twitt/	In early December, a group of House Democrats filed a lawsuit in response to former Illinois Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger’s decision to delay lawmakers’ pay. Munger had announced in April lawmaker pay would not be processed above any other state payments as she decided which bills to pay in the midst of an ongoing budget crisis. The lawsuit, filed by state Rep. Kate Cloonen, D-Kankakee, and five other Democrats, claimed Munger’s actions are unconstitutional and violate the separation of executive and legislative powers. Aaron DeGroot, the Illinois Republican Party’s downstate press secretary, was among many who criticized the Democrats’ lawsuit as being driven by personal greed. To make his point, DeGroot tweeted about Cloonen and the Democrats’ lawsuit, adding to an earlier tweet from the Illinois Republican Party account. "For Kate Cloonen, $8.5 million in state contracts for her construction company isn’t enough. She needs that extra $68k/year," DeGroot wrote. DeGroot’s tweet implies Cloonen made $8.5 million from the state in construction work and now she wants to be paid $68,000 for her legislative work, too. We decided to determine whether the dollar amounts are accurate, whether the practice of doing state business while also lawmaking was legal and ethical, whether comparing the numbers is relevant and what they tell us about Cloonen’s income. We’ll tackle these questions by looking at Illinois procurement law, talking to Cloonen and speaking to a political science expert about the ethics. Lawmaker pay vs. business profits Cloonen’s salary for a year of legislative work is $67,836, according to the comptroller’s office. According to her LinkedIn page, she has owned the Bonfield-based rebar installation company, JK Steel Erectors, Inc., for 25 years. Her involvement with JK Steel Erectors was scrutinized during her race against Republican Lindsay Parkhurst for the 79th House District. Since Cloonen took office in 2013, JK Steel Erectors has taken on several projects from the state, according to a document DeGroot received through a Freedom of Information Act request filed with the Illinois Department of Transportation. We reviewed this document and IDOT Director of Communications Guy Tridgell verified its accuracy. The document said JK Steel Erectors received $8.53 million on work done for the state since Jan. 18, 2013. In a phone interview, Cloonen said she also reviewed the IDOT document and said there were several instances where the compensation listed was incorrect, but she declined to provide details. "I’m not sure where he got the $8 million number from," Cloonen said. "No one knows what I netted but me because it’s a private business and I’m a private owner." Cloonen raises a valid point. While her firm was paid $8.53 million, how much her firm profited from that gross total and how much she personally netted are entirely different from her individual gross salary as a lawmaker. The legality of holding office while owning a business There also is nothing prohibiting Cloonen or any other Illinois lawmakers from holding another private job outside the legislature, according to the Illinois Constitution (Article IV, Section 2). Illinois General Assembly jobs are considered part-time, too. There are instances showing Cloonen made efforts to avoid any conflicts of interest during her time as a representative. For example, Cloonen normally votes present (instead of voting "yes" or "no") on any bills containing capital programs because of her role with JK Steel Erectors. When asked about his tweet, DeGroot said he never called Cloonen’s actions illegal. DeGroot said that during the election Parkhurst accused Cloonen of profiting off the taxpayers by using what they describe as a "loophole" in the Illinois Procurement Code which only prohibits officeholders from making other income from the state who make more than 60 percent of the governor’s $177,000 salary. In 2013, the Illinois Procurement Policy Board reviewed an instance where JK Steel Erectors was selected by Kankakee Valley Construction Co. to work on a bridge removal and replacement in Iroquois County. The board cited section 50-13 of the procurement code to clear her of any conflict. JK Steel Erectors was able to proceed with the subcontract work. Aside from her salary situation clearing her from a problem, Cloonen also pointed out JK Steel Erectors is a subcontractor. That means her business never does any direct bidding on state projects. Her company is only hired by a contractor once it wins a bid. Tridgell at IDOT verified that in an email exchange, saying, "The selection of registered subcontractors on projects is up to the discretion of the prime contractor." Attack the system, not the person Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois-Springfield, said DeGroot shouldn’t attack Cloonen for keeping a business while holding office. After all, Redfield said, Cloonen was never found to have engaged in any wrongdoing. "I don’t think you can fault her," Redfield said. "She has certainly complied with the law. Does [her position] create a conflict of interest? Yes. Is there any indication she acted unethically? No." Redfield said if DeGroot is intent on figuring out a way to eliminate conflicts of interest in the General Assembly, he should be focusing on changing the system. "If Cloonen’s situation is being characterized as a loophole, then it is incumbent of Republicans to introduce legislation to change that," he said. "As long as people comply with the law and are transparent with their relationships, it’s not fair to attack them." The only way to truly avoid conflicts of interest, Redfield said, is to make lawmakers step away from any outside employment the minute they come into office. "Then you know the legislator is making decisions that don’t benefit them financially," he said. Our ruling On Dec. 2, Illinois Republican Party’s Downstate Press Secretary Aaron DeGroot tweeted: "For Kate Cloonen, $8.5 million in state contracts for her construction company isn't enough. She needs that extra $68k/year" According to a document verified by IDOT, Cloonen’s company received $8.5 million in state construction funding for projects during her time as a legislator. Cloonen said that number is not an accurate reflection of what she personally netted from the state construction work, but she declined to share that amount. DeGroot’s tweet, though, lacks context and tries to draw a comparison between an individual salary and a company’s gross payment, not net profit, for work completed. Cloonen’s construction company only acted as a subcontractor and never directly bid on any state projects. Cloonen never was found to have a conflict of interest, and she recused herself from most votes regarding capital projects. And while political science professor emeritus Kent Redfield said Cloonen may have a conflict of interest being both a lawmaker and a business owner, he also said she operated within the law and did not act unethically. Though DeGroot’s comment about Cloonen was accurate, it omits significant information, including the fact that Cloonen was a subcontractor not hired directly by the state and regularly recuses herself from voting on capital problems. For those reasons, we rate DeGroot’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b5975ded-3a6a-45b7-86e3-c435001893d4	None	Aaron DeGroot	None	None	None	2017-01-05T19:59:18	2016-12-02	['None']

pomt-07691	Says nobody in higher education believes Gov. Rick Perry’s proposal to "serve up $10,000 college degrees" is possible.	/texas/statements/2011/mar/08/andy-brown/andy-brown-says-nobody-higher-education-believes-1/	UPDATE, 2:05 p.m., March 8, 2011: The article below corrects the name of the Midland newspaper. In a Feb. 22 web post objecting to slashes in education funding, the chairman of the Travis County Democrats sounds a skeptical note about GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s Feb. 8 call on higher education to devise a way that students could earn bachelor’s degrees at a cost of $10,000, including textbooks. "As for the governor’s preposterous scheme to serve up $10,000 college degrees, nobody in higher education believes that is even possible," Andy Brown writes. "Tuition and books for a single year easily add up to that amount, and tuition likely will increase in the face of state funding cuts." Granted, four years in college costs a bundle. But no one believes a $10K degree is even possible? We reached Brown, who said by e-mail that there is "probably someone out there who thinks it is possible at most Texas institutions, so the word ‘credible’ probably should have been included as a modifier" after nobody. "Regardless, it's not a realistic option for most higher ed institutions in Texas," Brown said, "and for Perry to imply otherwise is ridiculous." Next, we read news accounts following Perry’s State of the State address. Skepticism and uncertainty abound, the reports suggest. On Feb. 10, the Dallas Morning News quoted state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, who chairs the Senate Higher Education Committee, saying that it’s not going to happen. Among officials in higher education, Mike McKinney, chancellor of the Texas A&M University System, was quoted in the Feb. 12 Austin American-Statesman as telling state senators he has no idea how to meet Perry’s goal. The newspaper said McKinney also testified: "I'm not going to say that it can't be done." A Houston Chronicle news article, likewise published Feb. 12, says some education leaders say a $10,000 degree could be achieved at community colleges. The article quotes Bruce Leslie, chancellor of the San Antonio-based Alamo Colleges, saying: ""We already have the facilities, the infrastructure, the doctorate faculty. You could take community colleges and do that without building a whole new infrastructure, or forcing existing four-year universities to downsize." The story quotes Shirley Reed, president of South Texas College in McAllen, saying: "It is an idea that is long overdue." At the college, resident tuition for 120 credit-hours--which colleges typically require to earn a degree--is currently about $7,600, according to its website. According to a Feb. 10 Texas Tribune news article, South Texas College and two other community colleges are already authorized to offer a bachelor’s degree in Applied Technology, costing in the range of $10,000. Next, we asked the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board if anyone in higher education has rated the $10,000 degree possible. Spokesman Dominic Chavez replied by e-mail: "We interpret the $10,000 degree challenge by the governor as just that—a challenge...The question from the board’s perspective is not ‘is $10,000 the right target or a reasonable target?’ but rather ‘what can we do to get as close to it as possible?’" For national perspective, we contacted Beth Hagan, executive director of the Florida-based Community College Baccalaureate Association, which seeks to improve access to bachelor’s degrees. Hagan told us bachelor’s degrees costing $10,000 are now available through community colleges in 17 states. However, she said, they generally aren’t in the academic studies available through four-year universities. Besides, she cautioned, very few community college students get the four-year "niche" degrees, which tend to involve technologies or special skills such as nursing or teaching. Hagan said of Perry’s proposal: "If you asked a group of (community) college administrators and presidents if this could be done, they would laugh at you. Of course, it’s possible." But Perry’s call, she said, was akin to challenging a chain steakhouse to offer $1 hamburgers. "Can they do it? Sure. But they don’t want to." Perry’s communications director, Mark Miner, called Brown’s statement unfortunate, adding that it’s "just like the establishment to say it can’t be done, without trying." Catherine Frazier, Perry’s deputy press secretary, pointed out a Feb. 10 news article in the Midland Reporter-Telegram describing Midland College’s applied technology bachelor’s degree, which the article says can be earned for about $10,000. The article also says the program might not be funded in the next state budget. No doubt, there’s skepticism in higher education about Perry’s call. But it’s a stretch to say nobody believes $10,000 degrees possible. Four-year technology degrees at around that price point are already an option for some Texas students. We rate Brown’s statement False.	None	Andy Brown	None	None	None	2011-03-08T06:00:00	2011-02-22	['None']
pomt-10136	"Two years ago...I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them [subprime lending] is something we have to deal with."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/08/barack-obama/obama-sounded-the-alarm-on-subprimes/	As the U.S. and world economic systems continue to falter, both Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama claim to have seen the crisis coming to some degree, and tried to head it off. McCain has cited his endorsement of legislation in 2006 that would have reined in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac somewhat. And at the second presidential debate, Obama cited a letter he wrote to federal officials "two years ago." "Understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system," Obama said during the Oct. 7, 2008 debate. "Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a subprime lending crisis that has to be dealt with. "I wrote to (Treasury) Secretary (Henry) Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman (Ben) Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it." The last sentence appeared to refer to this letter that Obama sent to Paulson and Bernanke on March 22, 2007. Obama's comments in the debate suggest the letter warned about the then-looming subprime lending crisis and its potential impact on the wider economy. So let's check the text. "There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures," he wrote. "We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes." He went on to suggest the two officials convene a homeownership-preservation summit where banks, investors, regulators and consumers could forge a plan to stave off foreclosures. "Rampant foreclosures are in nobody’s interest... There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy," he wrote. So yes, Obama characterized the letter accurately. In it, he not only called for action to head off the unraveling of the subprime mortgage market, but also warned about its impact on the nation's economy. He sent the letter about 18 months ago, a time frame for which "two years" is a fair estimate. We find his claim to be True.

pomt-13083	"Surveys show that many of our citizens think we devote a full quarter or even a third of our federal budget to foreign aid."	/global-news/statements/2016/nov/09/john-kerry/yep-most-people-clueless-us-foreign-aid-spending/	Secretary of State John Kerry aired an old complaint about the public and foreign aid. In a speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Kerry bemoaned a persistent misconception about how much money Washington sends overseas. "Do you know that amazing surveys show that many of our citizens think we devote a full quarter or even a third of our federal budget to foreign aid?" Kerry said on Oct. 26, 2016. Foreign aid covers both military aid and more humanitarian forms of assistance such as fighting disease and boosting economic growth in other countries. Kerry’s comment accurately reflects what pollsters have seen for many years. Americans greatly exaggerate the scale of those items compared to everything else Washington spends on. To do our part to set the record straight, this chart comes from numbers in the president’s 2017 budget request. There are different ways to tally expenses across more than a dozen agencies, but by and large, foreign aid represents about 1 percent of all spending. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To support Kerry’s claim, the State Department press office pointed to several reports including a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely respected source of impartial data. In January 2016, Kaiser found that only 3 percent of Americans correctly estimated spending at 1 percent or less of total spending. The average answer was that foreign aid accounts for 31 percent of the U.S. budget; 15 percent of the people thought it represented over half of all spending. That misconception is a stubborn one. In a 1998 survey, the average answer put foreign aid at 26 percent of the budget. And decades before that, nearly a quarter of respondents in a 1963 Gallup poll said Washington spends between 10 to 25 percent of its budget on foreign aid. Another 13 percent said it might go as high as half of all government spending. So the surveys back-up Kerry’s statement. Which raises the question, why do so many people get it wrong? There are many possible reasons. The first and most obvious factor is that most Americans might not know much about foreign aid. In a 2010 poll, almost 70 percent said they had heard about the World Bank, but less that 30 percent had heard about the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government’s main overseas health and development body. Boston College political scientist Emily Thorson points the finger at a more fundamental problem. It seems we aren’t very good with numbers. "People don’t think in terms of percentages," Thorson said. "We do best with ‘more than’ and 'less than.’ And they also don’t have a sense of how big the federal budget is. So if they hear we’re spending billions, they don’t see how that can be a small slice of the total." Researchers Helen Milner and Dustin Tingley, professors at Harvard and Princeton universities respectively, suggested that the way surveys ask about foreign aid might make that problem worse. "No study that we are aware of asks individuals to assign percentages to an array of government programs, with a mandatory limit at 100 percent," they wrote in 2013. In other words, asking only about foreign aid might lead people to ignore the big ticket budget lines for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and defense. It’s also possible, Thorson said, that news coverage that touches on aid can be graphic and compelling -- such as scenes from refugee camps or fighter jets in flight -- which leaves the impression that these programs play a bigger role in the budget than they actually do. Our ruling Kerry said that surveys show that many Americans think that a quarter to a third of the U.S. budget is spent on foreign aid. The actual number is about 1 percent, and surveys back up Kerry’s statement. One 2016 poll found the average estimate was about 30 percent of all government spending. A survey done nearly two decades ago found an average estimate of 26 percent. There’s nothing wrong about Kerry’s summary.

pomt-06800	"Certainly we're going to be the most restrictive state in the land … in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/14/nicholas-scutari/state-sen-nicholas-scutari-says-new-jersey-has-mos/	More than a year and a half after it was enacted, New Jersey is implementing its medical marijuana law. State Sen. Nicholas Scutari, a primary sponsor of the law, said he’s glad Gov. Chris Christie decided to move forward with the program -- which, he said, is the most restrictive in the country by three measures. "Certainly we're going to be the most restrictive state in the land … in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace," Scutari (D-Union) said during a July 27 NJToday interview. Is New Jersey really the most restrictive in those three categories? Most of the experts we spoke with said New Jersey definitely has one of the most -- if not the most -- restrictive medical marijuana programs overall. Within Scutari’s three parameters, we found the state senator’s statement sound. Washington, D.C., and 16 states have medical marijuana laws. Maryland has a law, but it only allows medicinal marijuana use as a legal defense, so we aren’t considering it. The District of Columbia isn’t a state -- and Scutari said "most restrictive state." So, while we’ll look at Washington, D.C.’s program, it won’t factor into our final ruling. We’ll compare New Jersey with other programs by Scutari’s three measures -- who’s eligible to get medical marijuana, how medical marijuana is recommended and how a patient actually gets it. We should note that medical marijuana technically can’t be prescribed, but doctors can recommend it for patients. Every state describes certain medical conditions or treatments that qualify a patient to receive medical marijuana. New Jersey’s list of conditions is consistent with other states in some instances -- but of the 17 laws we are considering, only two -- New Jersey and Washington, D.C. -- don’t have a provision for chronic pain, according to a breakdown of medical marijuana laws by the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the legalization of marijuana. Tamar Todd, a staff attorney for Drug Policy Alliance, a drug policy reform organization, said while "pain is one of the categories where it is most needed," it also is "the category that allows the most abuse." The only mention of pain in New Jersey’s law states that a patient with cancer or AIDS or who is HIV positive, qualifies for medical marijuana "if severe or chronic pain, severe nausea or vomiting, cachexia, or wasting syndrome results from the condition or treatment thereof." "[New Jersey’s law] avoids some of the big loopholes that exist in some other states’ laws," like California and Colorado, said Jonathan Caulkins, professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Between New Jersey and Washington, D.C., the nation’s capital has the more restrictive list of conditions, said Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, though D.C.’s law also includes some medical treatments that New Jersey does not. New Jersey, like most other states and Washington, D.C., allows other medical conditions to be added to the program. Now, let’s look at how a doctor can recommend medical marijuana for a patient and how a patient can get medical marijuana. New Jersey lists several requirements a physician must meet in order to be eligible to recommend medical marijuana. One example is a provision requiring doctors to register with the state health department. New Jersey’s medical marijuana program is the only one in the country with that mandate, O’Keefe said. Once a doctor recommends in writing medical marijuana for someone in New Jersey, the patient or a caregiver must go to one of six dispensaries -- what the state calls "alternative treatment centers." There is no provision allowing patients to grow marijuana at home in New Jersey, and patients can get a maximum amount of two ounces per month. Delaware -- which allows up to six ounces -- and D.C. -- which allows up to two ounces -- are the only other medical marijuana programs that don’t have a grow-at-home provision. O’Keefe said, "If you are talking about restrictive, I think it’s reasonable to say that having dispensaries only is more restrictive," because marijuana is being grown in a controlled setting, rather than in private homes. The ruling Scutari said New Jersey will be the most restrictive state in the nation for medical marijuana because of who can get it, how a doctor can recommend it and how it is distributed. Most experts we spoke with agreed New Jersey is one of the most restrictive states for medical marijuana overall. But by Scutari’s three measures, PolitiFact New Jersey found that the Garden State is generally the most restrictive. So, we rate Scutari’s statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10704	"I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/29/ron-paul/a-military-victory-for-paul/	Ron Paul, the only Republican candidate for president who opposes the war and one of the most ardent antiwar candidates in both parties, is on the money here. The Center for Responsive Politics reports that since January, he has received at least $53,670 from U.S. military personnel. The Houston Chronicle, after an extensive analysis of Federal Election Commission reports, puts the figure at $63,440 for the same period. The disparity in the figures is caused by the complicated nature of campaign contributions. Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for CRP, speculates that the difference between their numbers and those of the Chronicle are because the newspaper had access to small contributions and was more familiar with the military connections of people who might not have listed the military as their employer. Regardless, Paul is right that he's on top. Both sources say Democratic candidate Barack Obama comes in second, with CRP reporting he has received $45,200 from military folks. The Houston paper says active and retired military personnel funneled $53,968 to Obama's campaign. "What we were hearing from the donors is that this money was definitely a statement about the war," Ritsch said. "It doesn't mean it reflects the views of anyone else in the military.

pomt-14433	"Over 32,000 people die from #GunViolence every year. Yet, (The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is banned from researching ways to prevent this."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/09/tammy-baldwin/testing-tammy-baldwin-claim-gun-deaths-cdc-researc/	While Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin is not up for re-election until 2018, she’s still engaging in at least one of the biggest issues in the 2016 campaign. In January, she co-sponsored legislation to appropriate $10 million to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the next five years for firearm research. To promote her legislation, Baldwin tweeted this on Jan. 24, 2015, citing limits on what the CDC can do: "Over 32,000 people die from #GunViolence every year. Yet, @CDCgov is banned from researching ways to prevent this." We wondered if Baldwin was right. Gun violence numbers As backup for the statistic that 32,000 people die from gun violence every year, Baldwin’s team pointed to the CDC’s National Vital Statistics database. It’s the most comprehensive source for national statistics as it is a census, pulling information from death certificates. The report shows that in 2013, the latest year for which data is available, there were 33,636 gun-related deaths. Beyond that, from 2009-2013, an average of 32,100 people died each year from gun-related injuries. So Baldwin is on target with the number. About one third of gun-related deaths are homicides, with suicides counting for about two thirds of deaths. PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton in October 2015: "We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns." This claim was backed up by taking the number of firearm deaths tallied by the CDC in 2013 and averaging it out over a year. Clinton hit the number, but didn’t mention that most of those deaths are suicides, not homicides. Her claim was rated Mostly True. Dickey amendment In the second part of her claim, Baldwin said the CDC is "banned from researching ways to prevent" gun violence. Her tweet linked to a news release that pointed to a 1996 piece of legislation as evidence. The news release said, in part: "Currently, a Republican appropriations rider from 1996 prohibits funding for such critical research at the CDC, even though the original rider’s author, former Republican Jay Dickey, has since announced his opposition to it noting that the rider’s intention was to prevent the CDC from lobbying for gun control, not from conducting gun-violence research." This 1996 rider is commonly called the Dickey Amendment. In the early 1990s, the New England Journal of Medicine published research that concluded gun ownership, independent of other factors, increased the risk for a homicide in the home. The study was funded by the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. In the wake of the research, and subsequent media attention, the National Rifle Association campaigned for the elimination of the injury prevention center. While the center survived, new language in the 1996 budget bill said that "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." In some ways the statement was redundant, as general funding cannot be used for advocacy. Congress also took from the CDC’s budget $2.6 million -- the exact amount invested in firearm injury research the previous year. While the language against advocating and promoting gun control did not explicitly ban the CDC from researching gun violence, the CDC stopped the work anyway. Linda Degutis, the former director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said the action by Congress sent a strong message to the CDC. "Even though that language doesn’t say research is prohibited," Degutis said, "everyone who was making decisions interpreted it to mean that you could not do any research on gun violence." The language, and lack of funding, has carried on in spending bills and even been expanded to the National Institute of Health, another agency in the Department of Health and Human Services. "It is the equivalent of a ban," said David Hemenway, director of the Injury Control Research Center at Harvard University. "It’s a touch more nuanced than a ban, but there’s basically no real difference in terms of research." In the wake of mass shootings in 2013, President Barack Obama requested the CDC be granted new funding to study gun violence. Congress did not appropriate the funds. Our rating Baldwin said "over 32,000 people die from #GunViolence every year. Yet, @CDCgov is banned from researching ways to prevent this." The most comprehensive data available supports the first part of the claim, that more than 32,000 people die from gun violence every year. On the research ban, while the language from the Dickey Amendment does not explicitly ban the agency from conducting research, its interpretation effectively banned the practice. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate Baldwin’s claim Mostly True.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2016-03-09T05:00:00	2016-01-24	['None']
pomt-08685	I "kicked crooked cops and government officials off the public pension rolls."	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/10/joseph-fernandez/fernandez-says-he-stripped-crooked-cops-and-govern/	Former Providence City Solicitor Joseph Fernandez, one of three Democrats running for attorney general, has painted himself as a crime- and corruption-busting prosecutor during his nearly-eight years in Mayor David N. Cicilline's administration. In a mailing to Rhode Islanders citing "the facts, plain and simple," Fernandez says that "during his term, crime dropped 30 percent over previous years" and he "protected tax dollars" because he "kicked crooked cops and government officials off the public pension rolls." We discussed the crime rate drop, which Cicilline also claims credit for, in an earlier PolitiFact item, in which we questioned whether Cicilline was directly responsible. The same question applies to Fernandez. So we focused on the pension question, and whether he actually kicked crooked officials off the rolls. Our first stop was the Fernandez campaign. We wanted to know whom they were talking about. Campaign manager Dan Herkert said the mailing referred to four people implicated in corruption probes -- former administration director Frank Corrente, former tax collector Anthony Annarino, former Police Chief Urbano Prignano and Kathleen Parsons, a former parks department employee. Herkert said that in February 2003, when Fernandez was in his second month on the job, he issued a key ruling that a criminal conviction was not required to revoke the pension of an employee who had acted dishonorably while on the job. "Based on that ruling, the Retirement Board moved forward and voted to either reduce or strip the pensions," said Herkert. "He developed the legal strategy that led to either the reduction or revocation of the pensions." But it's a lot more complicated than that. The city's Retirement Board voted to revoke Annarino's pension in February 2002 -- almost a year before Fernandez became solicitor -- after Annarino pleaded gulty to conspiracy, attempted extortion and mail fraud as part of Operation Plunder Dome, which focused on corruption in the administration of Mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci, now a talk-show host on WPRO (630-AM). Then in October 2002 -- two months before Fernandez took office -- the board voted to strip the pension from Corrente, Cianci's former director of administration, after Corrente was convicted of racketeering, conspiracy and attempted extortion in conjunction with the Plunder Dome probe. The Fernandez ruling first became relevant in the case of Prignano, who retired after being implicated in a police promotions cheating scandal. His case was different because it was the city's first attempt to strip the pension of an employee for violating the "Honorable Service Ordinance," even though he had never been convicted of a crime. It took until June 2008 for the board to actually vote to remove him from the pension rolls. Finally, there is Parsons, a former office manager in the parks department. She was originally granted a $1,895-a-month pension in June 2005, even though she had confessed on Nov. 24, 2004, to embezzling nearly $27,000 from an off-the-books account in the department. It took the board until April 2007, another 21 months, to vote to slash her pension by 99 percent. The Journal reported at the time that some Retirement Board members said they were not informed of her plea by Fernandez's office. He blamed it on miscommunication. Fernandez didn't prosecute any of these four cases directly. Instead, the city sometimes hires outside lawyers to act on behalf of the Retirement Board, said Vincent A. Ragosta Jr., who handled the Prignano case and independently recommended that it go forward. Ragosta issued the report that the board used to make its decision. Ragosta said Fernandez "has been at the forefront" of all the cases, hiring outside lawyers with expertise in labor and employment law, supervising those lawyers, and following the proceedings at the Retirement Board and in Superior Court, where the board's decisions needed to be ratified before they can actually be implemented. He said taking credit for the actions against the four employees is akin to the attorney general taking credit for putting a murderer behind bars even if an assistant attorney general actually tried the case. "In a broad sense, that's an accurate and truthful statement." All four cases have been long, involved and subject to appeals in Superior Court -- and in at least one instance -- to the state Supreme Court. Fernandez's office was responsible for pursuing them. He was also city solicitor when the board decided to reinstate part of Corrente's pension in August 2008, on the grounds that he had served honorably during his first stint in City Hall. There are two problems with Fernandez's claim. First, he says he "kicked crooked cops" off the public pension rolls. But the only police officer on the list the campaign supplied is Prignano. Last time we checked our dictionary, the word "cops" meant more than one. When we asked Herkert about this, he said, "the statement stands as it is. The statement is accurate." Not that part of it. Second, two of the four ex-employees are still receiving their pensions while their cases are under review in Superior Court. Prignano is getting $5,884.50 per month and Parsons is receiving $1,895.04 a month. They have not been kicked off the pension rolls at all. Herkert's response: "We're basing our statement on the actions of the Retirement Board." So the tally of those who have actually lost their pensions so far: two government officials -- Corrente and Annarino. And their pensions were acted on by the Retirement Board before Fernandez began working for the city. We think the average person reading the Fernandez campaign material would be led to believe that, thanks to the work of the former city solicitor, the city is no longer paying pension money to at least two crooked police officers and two crooked government officials. That wouldn't be accurate. Fernandez and the city get credit for trying to hold public officials accountable by pursuing the pension cases. But the statement in his mailing greatly exaggerates the facts. We rate his claim False.	None	Joseph Fernandez	None	None	None	2010-09-10T00:01:00	2010-08-25	['None']
pomt-06747	"Before Medicare, only 51 percent of Americans 65 and older had health care coverage and nearly 30 percent lived below the poverty line. Today, thanks to Medicare ... nearly all seniors have coverage and 75 percent fewer struggle in poverty."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/25/ron-kind/us-rep-ron-kind-says-thanks-medicare-75-fewer-seni/	Democrats marked the 45th anniversary of Medicare by accusing Republicans of renewing hostilities against the popular program. A partisan scrap over Medicare and the elderly? That’s nothing new. But there was one aspect of the rhetoric during the summer of 2011 that caught our attention. Democrats reminded audiences of life before and after Medicare -- the health insurance program funded by employer and worker taxes that passed in 1965 after years of debate. The comments from U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., partly echoed points made by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats: "Before Medicare, only 51 percent of Americans 65 and older had health care coverage and nearly 30 percent lived below the poverty line," Kind wrote on his website. "Today, thanks to Medicare, things are drastically different. Nearly all seniors have coverage and 75 percent fewer struggle in poverty. We wondered if the situation for seniors had improved as much as described -- and whether Medicare was the main reason why. In the early 1960s, both the elderly population and hospital care costs were surging. Private insurers repeatedly were forced to increase premium rates. "Old people were long considered ‘bad risks’ by commercial insurers, and unions had not made much headway in obtaining coverage for retired workers through employer-sponsored plans," notes an official government history of Medicare on the Social Security website. Over the objections of the American Medical Association, Congress approved Medicare by wide bipartisan margins, with President Lyndon Johnson signing the measure in July 1965. Medicare took effect in 1966. At what rate were seniors insured at that time? Kind points to a 2000 government report that said "in 1964, nearly half of all seniors were uninsured, making the elderly among the least likely Americans to have health insurance." We found wide agreement on this point among a half-dozen government and academic reports -- a range from 50 percent to 56 percent uninsured seniors in the early to mid-1960s. One report broke it down further: 54 percent had hospital coverage, and 46 percent had surgical coverage, according to survey statistics cited by the National Health Statistics Reports. It’s also true virtually all seniors have coverage today. "The folks left out are those not eligible for Social Security (either as a worker or dependent or survivor)," said Marilyn Moon, a Medicare expert at the American Institutes for Research, an independent policy group. "This is mostly legal immigrants who do not have enough earnings years to qualify. It has traditionally been about 2 percent." That covers the question of who had coverage. But what about the poverty part of it? Kind said that, thanks to Medicare, "75 percent fewer struggle in poverty." Pelosi did not use that number in her own release on this. Kind pointed us to a chart in a federal report showing a 30 percent poverty rate for seniors in the mid-1960s, and he compares it to a number Pelosi used (7.5 percent) for "today." That would get you to a 75 percent drop. But the figure didn’t reach 30 until 1967 (29.5 percent). And the 7.5 percent was off; Pelosi’s office reviewed it after we asked and will be changing her website. So we did our own check. We turned to census reports, which show 8.9 percent of seniors in poverty in 2009, the latest year available. The closest pre-Medicare census report on elderly poverty we found was 1959, when 35.2 percent of the elderly officially were considered poor. Compared to 2009, this is a 75 percent drop. (Census figures for elderly poverty were not kept for 1960-1965). So, Kind is right on the 75 percent. But his statement is aimed at a larger point -- that the poverty reduction is due to Medicare. In the Great Depression, at least half of all seniors were living in poverty, but that started to fall after the 1935 act creating Social Security. Experts agree that much of the drop in more recent decades is due not to Medicare, but to improvements in Social Security benefits, especially in the 1970s. "The poverty measures are based on cash income and do not reflect the contribution that Medicare has made to the quality of life of seniors. Almost all the decline in poverty is attributed to Social Security," said Virginia Reno, a Medicare expert at the National Academy of Social Insurance. Think of it this way: Social Security payments help determine a senior’s income. Medicare coverage impacts their health care coverage and costs, but isn’t factored into total income, which is how the poverty rate is defined. As Reno wrote in a 2010 report: "Poverty among older Americans declined in the 1960s and 1970s for the same reasons as their median incomes rose: more of them had worked long enough in covered jobs to qualify for Social Security benefits, and the level of these benefits was increased by Congress." Moon, of American Institutes for Research, added: "What can be said is that without Medicare, many of those both below and above poverty would not be able to afford health care." Kind spokeswoman Leah Hunter said the congressman did not mean to suggest Medicare was the sole reason for the poverty-line change. Let’s bring this home. Kind claimed that basically half of seniors lacked health insurance before Medicare, and the program reduced the share of seniors in poverty by 75 percent. His statistics pan out, but he overplays his hand by making Medicare the hero for getting seniors above the poverty line when experts agree other things, chiefly Social Security, are the reason. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Ron Kind	None	None	None	2011-08-25T09:00:00	2011-06-30	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'United_States']
pomt-09109	Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp is a "career politician."	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/20/doug-macginnitie/candidate-calls-opponent-career-politician/	So what makes someone a "career politician"? We at AJC PolitiFact Georgia became curious recently when we saw an advertisement mailed by Doug MacGinnitie, a Republican candidate for secretary of state. "Who would you entrust with the integrity of Georgia's elections?" it read. "A career politician or an independent thinker?" The ad didn't name names, but it was clear MacGinnitie was referring to the current officeholder, Brian Kemp, as the "career politician" in the ad. MacGinnitie campaign manager Brandon Phillips confirmed our suspicion during a telephone interview that the reference to "career politician" was aimed at Kemp. "It's a two-person primary," he said. Kemp and MacGinnitie are the only Republican candidates in the July 20 primary. Kemp, who spent four years as a state senator, has made a point during the campaign that he is the more experienced candidate, Phillips said. Kemp served in the Georgia Senate from 2003 to 2006. Gov. Sonny Perdue appointed Kemp as secretary of state in January after Karen Handel resigned to run for governor. MacGinnitie was elected to the Sandy Springs City Council in 2007. "I don't think you can convince voters that you're the best candidate because you've been around the longest," Phillips said. But does four years in the Georgia Legislature and five months as secretary of state constitute a "career politician"? The MacGinnitie campaign says yes, if you add Kemp's failed bid to become state agriculture commissioner in 2006 and that Kemp considered a run for the Georgia Senate in 2007. Phillips' argument: How do you run for agriculture commissioner and run for a job as vastly different as secretary of state four years later? "You couldn't find a more extreme example of going from one extreme to another. ... I just don't see how you do that and say you are not a career politician," Phillips said. Kemp, 46, however, has been a developer and in the real estate business since he graduated from the University of Georgia in 1987. Even when he served in the Legislature, Kemp (drawing an annual government salary of about $17,000) maintained his interest in the development game. Last year, Kemp started a manufacturing business, campaign officials said. He claims a net worth of nearly $6.3 million. Kemp will make about $120,000 this year as secretary of state and about $100,000 from his business interests, said his campaign manager, Tim Fleming. "I would consider someone a career politician who's served 20 or 30 years," Fleming said. Most of the people we talked to agreed with the Kemp camp. When he thinks of career politicians, University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock considers Georgians like U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, U.S. Rep. John Lewis and U.S. Rep. John Linder. The four men have spent an average of 17.5 years in Congress. "Four years is an awfully short time to constitute a career unless these are dog years," Bullock said in an e-mail. Bob Holmes, who served 34 years as a Democratic state representative, thought the combination of Kemp's four years in the Legislature and now two subsequent campaigns since 2002 shows "some truth" to the MacGinnitie campaign's claim. "What he's done in the past decade ... indicates he wants to be in politics for the rest of his career," said Holmes, a retired Clark Atlanta University professor. So is Kemp a "career politician"? Well, the average length of service for a U.S. senator is 12.9 years and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives is 11 years, according to Congressional Research Service. Many of those elected officials held elected posts before going to Washington. Perdue, a former state senator, has spent 19 years as an elected official. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, a former state senator, is finishing his 16th year as an elected official. Then there is Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin, who's been in office since 1969. Kemp is building a political resume, but two terms in the Legislature, a failed bid for Irvin's job and this campaign don't add up at this point. We rate Doug MacGinnitie's claim as False.

pomt-08078	Earmarks requested in a federal spending bill included "$277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin."	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/19/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-federal-spending-bill-included-27/	One bit of conventional wisdom gleaned from the November 2010 elections is voters turned Democrats out of office in Washington because they were turned off by their spending. The results, no doubt, were more complicated than that. But even if spending were only one reason Republicans took control of the U.S. House, would an outgoing Democratic congressman -- just weeks after his party got clobbered -- make a special federal funding request for potato pests in Wisconsin? On Dec. 14, 2010, U.S. Sen John McCain (R-Arizona) took to the Senate floor to blast 2011 earmark requests made by various lawmakers. An earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. McCain, reciting with disdain some of his "favorite" requests, highlighted an earmark for "$277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin." Two days later, a 1,900-page, $8 billion bill that included the earmarks was abandoned by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. That means the earmarks are not likely to be funded, said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense (and a University of Wisconsin Law School graduate). Nevertheless, let’s find out whether McCain’s claim was on target. The 2008 presidential candidate said his source on the earmarks he highlighted was EndingSpending.com, which has a 2011 earmarks database. The database was assembled by three Washington, D.C., organizations: Taxpayers Against Earmarks, led by Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts; Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group; and WashingtonWatch.com, which is run by a staff member of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research foundation. Our check of the database found that an earmark request for $300,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin was made by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau). Obey, who decided not to seek re-election in November after 41 years in Congress, was regarded as one of the most powerful members as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He’ll be replaced in January by Republican Sean Duffy, a former prosecutor and lumberjack athlete. So, did Obey request the potato money? Yes, said Ellis Brachman, spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee. He referred us to Obey’s official website, pointing out that members of Congress are required to post their earmark requests. Obey’s site does not label his requests as earmarks, but rather "Wisconsin projects submitted for consideration in FY 2011 appropriations." If you click there on Obey’s home page, you get a list of his more than 80 earmark requests. Among them: $36 million for studies of high-speed passenger rail between Madison and the Twin Cities; $2.5 million to replace the Bad River Tribal Youth Center in Ashland; and millions of dollars for water or waste water system improvements in communities including Cadott, Elcho and Unity. As for Obey’s potato pest request, here’s the summary: Recipient: University of Wisconsin College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Address: 1450 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706 Amount: $300,000 Description: Funding will help promote the development and adoption of bio-intensive integrated pest management practices to reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides, enhance habitat quality, develop marketplace incentives for ecologically-produced potatoes and maintain economically viable farming operations in the fragile central sands region of Northern Wisconsin. Obey was just renewing the potato earmark request. He won $849,000 for the same earmark from 2008 to 2010, according to earmarks databases kept by Taxpayers for Common Sense. Just how important are potatoes in Wisconsin? The state ranks third in potato production, behind Idaho and Washington, according to the Wisconsin Potato & Vegetable Growers Association. Among the threats to Wisconsin potatoes is the Colorado potato beetle, which isn’t easily killed by predator bugs. It is "the most serious insect pest" found on commercially produced potatoes in the central sands area, according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Entomology. We wondered why McCain said the potato pest management request was for $277,000, while the database he cited and Obey put the figure at $300,000. McCain’s office didn’t reply to our question. However, a "working database" of 2011 earmarks maintained by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), indicates the request was reduced to $277,000 before being put into the bill that was ultimately abandoned. Obey’s wasn’t the only potato pest management earmark request. Maine’s congressional delegation asked for $450,000 for its program, according to the Coburn database. OK, let’s return to McCain’s claim. Citing a database, the Arizona senator said an earmark request had been made for $277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin. The database shows the request was made by Obey, the outgoing congressman. He doesn’t dispute it. (But it’s entirely possible his office considers us a pest on this issue.)

pomt-01739	"So many people were critical of Secretary (John) Kerry going to Paris and talking with Hamas," because Kerry was seen as "supporting Hamas to the exclusion of the Arab League."	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/04/greta-van-susteren/van-susteren-kerry-angered-arab-league-meeting-ham/	Fox News host and pundit Greta Van Susteren wrongly claimed on ABC’s This Week that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Hamas officials in Paris on July 26 to discuss a possible ceasefire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a back-and-forth with host George Stephanopoulos, Van Susteren described how Arab League members were upset that Kerry chose to meet with Hamas. "That's why so many people were critical of Secretary Kerry going to Paris and talking with Hamas," she said. "The Arab League thought that that was, you know, supporting Hamas to the exclusion of the Arab League." Van Susteren was not challenged about her claim on air, but no meeting took place. No American official is allowed to negotiate with Hamas because it is defined by the United States as a terrorist organization. "If Kerry or his representatives were to meet with Hamas, they would spend the next 20 years in Leavenworth (Penitentiary)," said James Gelvin, a Middle East historian at the University of California, Los Angeles. In a post on Twitter, Van Susteren acknowledged her error. "Meant to say Kerry talked to Turkey/Qatar ABOUT Hamas in Paris," she wrote. "The point I was trying to make: talking to Turkey and Qatar ABOUT Hamas had the Arab League unhappy." What happened in Paris While Kerry did not meet with Hamas in Paris on July 26, he did meet with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Qatar, two of Hamas’ major international backers. After negotiating a short-lived ceasefire, he said that many state actors have helped in the peace talks but singled out the two countries. "We’re grateful obviously for the Egyptian initiative, for the Israeli efforts initially, but also this particular effort now has been significantly assisted by the input of Qatar, the input of Turkey, and the willingness of these foreign ministers to work hard even though they were at a distance, and to engage directly with some of the Palestinian factions in order to try to help get us where we are today," Kerry said. Arab League reaction Experts we spoke with said that even Van Susteren’s modified point -- that the Arab League was unhappy by Kerry’s talks with Turkey and Qatar -- is an oversimplification. Gelvin noted that Qatar itself is a League member (though Turkey is not), and that desire for peace in the region may outweigh disapproval of Hamas. The League, which is composed of 21 member states, also hasn’t issued any statement as a group condemning or criticizing Kerry’s meeting. "Most of the Arab League, while not enamored with Hamas, wants a ceasefire simply because their lack of a strong backing for the Palestinians is very unpopular among their people," Gelvin said. Still, there are tensions between some individual League members and the United States based on Kerry’s recent diplomatic maneuvers. Steven Cook, a Middle East expert on the Council on Foreign Relations, said Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates all have been critical of Kerry’s reaching out to Qatar and Turkey. Those countries oppose Hamas in the current crisis largely out of a fear that Hamas’ political Islamist movement will spread, experts say. "The Arab states may not be fond of Israel, but they fear political Islam and Hamas as a more direct threat to their stability than Israel," said George Bisharat, a professor at the Hastings College of Law and a legal expert on the Middle East. In general, the great majority of the Arab League members are either indifferent to or enemies of Hamas, said Amatzia Baram, professor of Middle East studies at the University of Haifa in Israel. The two exceptions are Qatar and Sudan, a "friend" of Hamas because of shared ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. "It’s very clear that (most of the Arab League) supports Egypt and not Hamas. Of course, Qatar has a lot of money, which Egypt does not, but Egypt is still the most important country in the Arab world," Baram said. The ruling Van Susteren said, "So many people were critical of Secretary (John) Kerry going to Paris and talking with Hamas," because Kerry was seen as "supporting Hamas to the exclusion of the Arab League." Kerry never spoke directly with Hamas, a factual error that Van Susteren acknowledged. Instead, Kerry spoke with leaders from Turkey and Qatar -- who are seen as intermediaries for Hamas. As to her point about the meeting upsetting the Arab League, experts say some key members of the League were upset, but not all of them. We rate her claim False.

pomt-03193	Says that "unlike Texas, Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating."	/texas/statements/2013/aug/30/jay-nixon/give-missouri-governor-comparison-credit-ratings-m/	Responding to an ad blitz in which Texas Gov. Rick Perry urged Missouri businesses to move to the booming Lone Star State, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon suggested that taxes are lower in his state and that students fare better. Nixon, a Democrat, also singled out credit worthiness in the radio spot we noticed online Aug. 27, 2013. Unlike Texas, Nixon said, "Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating." Three days earlier, he posted a similar claim on a Twitter list of ways he ranks the Show-Me State as "#betterthantx." His credit claim snagged our attention. A chart posted online by the California state treasurer lists state general-obligation bond ratings by three rating agencies. We noticed that Missouri and Texas both earned the highest, AAA rating from both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service. But Standard & Poor’s gave Missouri a AAA rating and Texas a rating of AA+, which is its rating immediately below AAA. Via emails from spokespersons for each of those rating services, we confirmed those ratings for both states--and we inquired into the differences. By phone, New York-based Moody’s spokesman David Jacobson told us that both states have long been stable borrowers, though Missouri has had its Moody’s AAA rating longer--since at least 1972, Jacobson said. In contrast, he said, Moody’s lowered its rating for Texas general obligation debt from AAA to AA in 1987. That year, Texas faced a recession that drove down state revenues. In 2010, Jacobson said, Moody’s recalibrated its methodology for rating state debt; Texas regained a AAA rating. A Standard & Poor’s spokesman, Olayinka Fadahunsi, emailed us a Nov. 20, 2012, report by the firm stating it had assigned its AA+ rating to general-obligation bonds issued by the Texas Transportation Commission. The report credited the Texas economy with being diverse and strong and likely to continue to generate additional jobs. Also, it said, state government had strong cash-management practices and low overall debt and retirement liabilities. On the other hand, it expressed concern at the state’s "budgetary pressures, which are primarily related to the growing proportion of school revenues Texas is required to fund, as well as insufficient new sources of recurring dedicated tax revenues to support the increased funding." The report also cited "increasing spending pressure from public assistance payments, including Medicaid," plus uncertainty about how the Obamacare law might affect the state’s health-care expenditures. "Based on the analytic factors we evaluate for states, on a four-point scale in which '1' is the strongest, we have assigned Texas an overall score of '1.8," the report said. We asked Fadahunsi to discuss the distinction between the firm’s AA+ and AAA ratings. By email, he said that "there is no one precise financial distinction." The firm’s general debt ratings’ methodology, as published Jan. 3, 2011, states that it develops a state’s credit rating by judging conditions across factors including the government’s framework; financial management; economy; budgetary performance; and debt/liability profile. "We assess each of these factors utilizing various metrics that we score on a scale from 1 (strongest) to 4 (weakest)," the methodology states. "For each metric there may be several indicators we evaluate to develop the metric score. We score each indicator individually on the same scale and average the indicators' scores to develop the overall score for the metric. We average the metrics for each factor to develop a composite score for each. The scores for the five factors are combined and averaged with equal weighting to arrive at an overall score which is then translated to an indicative credit level." The report says an overall score of 1 to 1.5 is needed to draw the AAA rating. Separately, R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the Texas state comptroller’s office, pointed us to a December 2012, report by the Texas Bond Review Board which includes a chart indicating that as of August 2012, Missouri was among seven states with AAA GO debt ratings from the three major rating services. The other "perfects" were: Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia. Finally we asked Robert Coalter, executive director of the Texas Public Finance Authority, which issues bonds for the acquisition or construction of state buildings, to speak to any financial costs to Texas from not having Missouri’s three AAA ratings. Coalter said by phone that the effect is minimal, adding that any entity that issues bonds--including state agencies--sometimes obtain ratings from only one or two of the rating services. Also, he said, investment firms conduct their own research before committing to bonds. Coalter said the ratings of Texas debt are outstanding. "Our debt is considered to be top quality." Put another way, might the Missouri governor’s statement be real-world meaningless? "I do not believe it’s significant," Coalter replied. He said the claim sounded like comparing one student scoring 100 on a test with another scoring 99. Our ruling Nixon said that unlike Texas, Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating. That’s correct, though Texas is close; two major services rate the bigger state’s GO debt AAA, one rates it AA+, which is its next-highest rating. We rate this claim as True. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-12437	"What does Trumpcare do? Yank tax credits away from veterans unlike any other American."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/15/richard-blumenthal/gop-health-care-bill-yanks-tax-credits-away-vetera/	Among Democrats’ many gripes with the House Republican health care bill is the fact that it’s missing a special protection for veterans. "What does Trumpcare do? Yank tax credits away from veterans unlike any other American," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., at a May 9 press conference. Does the health care bill supported by President Donald Trump actually strip veterans of a tax protection? This issue is more complex and less far-reaching than Blumenthal’s exaggerated one-liner suggests. It is possible that if the Republican bill were to become law in its current form, a subset of veterans might not be able to access financial assistance that would enable them to choose private insurance over health care through the Veterans Administration. But the language of the bill actually treats veterans like "any other American," as opposed to what Blumenthal said. And there are regulations the Trump administration could pursue to blunt any impact (by taking a page out of the the previous administration’s playbook, we’d add). What the GOP health care bill omits Both the Affordable Care Act and the Republican health care bill (the American Health Care Act) provide government financial assistance to low-income Americans buying health insurance plans on the individual market through tax credits that subsidize premiums. To qualify for the tax credits under either system, a person cannot also be eligible for other affordable health insurance options, like employer-provided insurance, Medicaid or military-related health care. Point being, if you have access to Medicaid or can get insurance from your company, the government won’t pay for you to get insurance a different way. But there is an exemption to that rule under the Democratic-supported Affordable Care Act. Veterans who qualify for Veterans Administration health care (not all do) but aren’t enrolled in the system are eligible for subsidized premiums — allowing these veterans to choose between VA health care or subsidized private insurance. The Republican bill doesn’t include language that would have the same effect. This means that if the Republican bill were to become law in its current form, some veterans might not be able to access the tax credit. That means they’d either have to get their health care through the VA or pay full freight for a different type of insurance. This could have a tangible impact on veterans who choose not to take part in VA health care for reasons outside their control, such as living far away from VA facilities. How broad is the impact? Blumenthal said the Republican bill in its current form could affect as many as 8 million veterans, which is the approximate number of veterans as of June 2014 who qualify for VA benefits but choose not to enroll in the program, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But not all 8 million are in the market for a tax credit to help them buy private insurance. Many get health care through other means, such as Medicaid, their employer, or TRICARE, the military health benefits program. And as we already explained, that means they could not get federal subsidies to purchase a plan on the individual market under either Obamacare or its possible replacement. A report by the Urban Institute, a social and economic policy think tank, found that subsidized premiums under the Affordable Care Act played a big role in the 40 percent drop in uninsured veterans between 2013-15. But the Urban Institute’s numbers suggest that the omission from the Republican health care bill would affect far fewer than 8 million veterans. In 2010, the year Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, there were 520,000 uninsured veterans eligible for subsidized premiums, according to a 2012 report. By 2015, that number dropped to 225,000. And it’s still a subset of these groups who would be impacted by the Republican bill — those who qualify for subsidies and VA benefits. For scale, there are 21.6 million living veterans as of 2014. Why the omission? Interestingly, an earlier version of the Republican health care bill did include the relevant language, but it was removed from the final version that passed the House — a point that Blumenthal’s staff emphasized to us. Including non-budgetary language, such as this veterans provision, could derail Republicans’ plan to get the bill through the Senate using a special procedure called reconciliation. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., has defended the omission, saying that existing federal regulations stemming from the Affordable Care Act will be able to ensure VA-eligible veterans can qualify for the tax credit. Why? There’s another wrinkle to all of this. The Affordable Care Act veteran exemption isn’t found in the text of the Affordable Care Act itself. It’s actually a 2012 IRS rule. Contrary to Roe’s point, however, regulations applied to one law don’t automatically apply to that law’s replacement, said Lisa Zarlenga, a Washington lawyer for Steptoe and Johnson who served as the Treasury’s tax legislative counsel during Affordable Care Act implementation. If the Republican health bill becomes law, the Treasury and IRS might decide that the Affordable Care Act veterans rule carries over, but it’s not guaranteed, she said. Close readers might have noticed an irony: The Democrats are criticizing the Republican bill for a protection that wasn’t built into the Affordable Care Act to begin with. In fact, the Treasury and IRS wrote the 2012 rule to deal with the difficulty of determining a particular veteran’s VA-eligibility. The fact that this rule also gives some veterans a degree of choice they otherwise wouldn’t have was an added benefit, Zarlenga said. Our ruling Blumenthal said, "What does Trumpcare do? Yank tax credits away from veterans unlike any other American." A reasonable person might hear Blumenthal’s statement and think that under the Republican health care bill, most or all veterans won’t get a tax credit to which they are entitled. It’s much more nuanced than that. Under the Republican plan, like the Affordable Care Act, a person cannot qualify for financial assistance to help them buy an individual health insurance policy if they have access to other affordable health care options. Regulations written in 2012 to comply with the Affordable Care Act said this rule doesn’t apply to veterans who are eligible but not enrolled in the Veterans Administration health care system. The Republican bill doesn’t contain language that would have the same effect. So if it becomes law in its current form, a subset of veterans might not be able to access financial assistance that would enable them to choose private insurance over health care through the VA. But a Republican administration could do what the Democrats did before them and include the benefit as part of a regulatory change. Blumenthal’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

A viral article saying as much is a fake news story created and published on satirical news sites. We first saw the claim on breakingnews365.net under the headline "Snapchat is shutting down!" on Nov. 8, 2017. The post was sparse and contained a single grammatically depressing sentence. "Snapchat will be shutting down tommrow for the U.K. , and will shut down today for the U.s , such a shame" See? Although Snap Inc’s owner has announced that the app has seen less daily activity than expected in the third quarter of 2017, the company has made it clear that this rumor is fake news. Snopes had earlier traced the claim to Channel45news.com, another prank news site that proudly sports a "Create A Prank And Trick All Your Friends!" homepage headline and a "You Got Owned" meme-style header icon. Snapchat has been facing some financial issues due to $40 million worth of unsold Snapchat Spectacles, a device that allows you to record the world around you through a pair of sunglasses. Due to the loss of revenue from the unsold units, lowered shares and the dip in daily activity, Snap Inc CEO Evan Spiegel announced his plan to redesign the app in the wake of this fiscal low point. Although Snapchat has definitely been facing some financial woes, they have no plan of shutting down in 2017 or at any point in the near future. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-08212	The economic impact of Atlanta's 2000 Super Bowl was $292 million.	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/19/atlanta-sports-council/2000-super-bowls-economic-impact-tallied-292-milli/	When Gov.-elect Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed told the NFL they hope to woo the Super Bowl back to town, the NFL played coy. The Super Bowl has plenty of suitors, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said last week. Winning cities tend to have brand-new stadiums. Atlanta's chances may improve if it built one, too, he hinted. That costs money, which boosters think the event can generate. Atlanta's last Super Bowl in 2000 had an economic impact of $292 million, according to a study backed by the Atlanta Sports Council, which aims to build the city's reputation as the "sports capital of the world." That figure has been repeated in media accounts and academic research for a decade. That seems like a nice little nest egg, but does the game really bring in that much money? Festivities for the nation's biggest regular event last for a week and attract celebrity guests and corporate tycoons willing to pay for luxury rental cars, hotel suites and fine dining that are well beyond the means of typical tourists. Still, skeptics say that even that degree of excess cannot support economic impact projections for the Super Bowl. Estimates for upcoming games have passed the half-billion mark. AJC PolitiFact Georgia interviewed independent sports economists to see whether they have come to a consensus on the game's worth. They haven't. Some place the amount in the tens of millions. Its harshest critics think its net effect is zero. But they do agree on this: Independent economists come up with much lower estimates than boosters do. They warn that boosters' estimates do not adequately acknowledge that a mega-event may drive away other potential visitors. They can bring such large crowds and tangled traffic that conventions opt to move elsewhere. Plus, the frenzied activity could prompt locals to stay at home. This can actually lower spending at restaurants and movie theaters. Estimates must also consider where the money is going. If visitors patronize chain restaurants and hotels based outside of the Atlanta area and buy T-shirts and caps licensed by an out-of-town sports league, the bulk of their money isn't creating local wealth. It's heading elsewhere. Further complicating the matter is that the Super Bowl's impact won't be the same in all cities. It might pack more economic punch in Detroit, which doesn't get many tourists during January or February, than it would in Miami, where hotels fill up that time of year whether or not the game is in town. Now back to the 2000 Super Bowl, which didn't go smoothly. An ice storm blanketed Atlanta, and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis was arrested on murder charges after a fight in Buckhead. He pleaded guilty to an obstruction of justice charge in exchange for testifying against his co-defendants. The Tennessee Titans battled back from a 16-point deficit before losing 23-16 to the St. Louis Rams. About 94,000 people visited the city, 87 percent of whom stayed in hotels an average of 3.7 days, according to a 2000 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Atlanta Sports Council obtained its economic impact estimate with the help of the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and Bruce Seaman, a Georgia State University economist who studies sports and cultural events. He regularly completes economic impact studies on local institutions. We requested a copy of the original 2000 estimate from Seaman and the Sports Council, but neither was able to locate one. Seaman wrote an abstract of his findings, but not a full report. He did provide an unedited version of a letter he wrote to the Atlanta Business Chronicle that explained his methodology. We used this, a working paper he wrote that touched on the subject, and media coverage to bolster our understanding of the estimate. Seaman said the Sports Council asked for his help because he's skeptical about economic impact estimates. Critics blasted the NFL for an estimate of the 1999 Super Bowl in Miami that topped $350 million. The council hoped to avoid a similar problem in Atlanta. Here's how the study worked: It estimated the game's impact on gross regional product, personal income, employment and tax revenue. It surveyed visitors on their spending and interviewed hotel, car rental and restaurant operators. It also incorporated NFL spending. To avoid overestimating the impact, Seaman adjusted his figures to exclude money that would not go to local vendors and workers, and he considered whether the Super Bowl would displace other visitors. Seaman also looked at hotel occupancy, airport traffic and tax receipts. The data were plugged into a mathematical model that Georgia State economists developed to estimate the economic impact of large events. It gave them $292 million. But this number needs heavy qualification. It's not quite as it has been portrayed by the media and academics. The first qualification is that $292 million represents the economic impact estimate for all of Georgia, including direct spending and longer-term effects as the money made its way across the state. The original estimate for the game's economic impact on metro Atlanta was actually $215 million. The bigger problem is the original estimate is outdated. In 2005, during Atlanta's failed bid for the 2009 Super Bowl, Seaman took another look at the 2000 Super Bowl economic impact figure and revised it down to $182 million for the metro area. Now, Seaman thinks that $150 million may be a safer bet, he told AJC PolitiFact Georgia. That's in today's dollars. The estimate sank because Seaman fine-tuned the economic model in the decade since the Rams-Titans faceoff. Some significant adjustments included changes in how much fans spent on hotel accommodations and food, beverage and retail purchases outside the Georgia Dome. For instance, Seaman used to think spectators (excluding media) spent more than $100 per night on hotels, based on double-occupancy. Now he thinks that figure is $70.33. This change knocks millions off the estimate. "In retrospect, even the $182 million figure is too high," Seaman said. "But is there a positive economic impact? I contend 'yes.' " To sum up, the Sports Council's original $292 million figure was once correct, but it took on a life of its own. It was used without specifying that it measures the impact statewide, not for the metro area. And now it's no longer accurate. The true impact is likely $150 million. It might have been an OK figure to use in the early 2000s. But it's been revised downward, which means it's now False.

pomt-07424	"Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world (behind) Saudi Arabia."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-iraq-has-second-biggest-oilfield/	During an April 14, 2011, interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, businessman and potential Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Iraq is strategically important to the United States because of its vast supply of oil. Trump said the United States spent $1.5 trillion on the Iraq War, and it could all go down the drain because the nation is so unstable. "Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world. Fifteen trillion dollars worth of oil, second to Saudi Arabia. We go over, we decapitate their armies. Their armies are wiped out. They have weak armies, it is a corrupt society anyway, I mean, it's totally corrupt what is going on over there. We then leave in Iran which has fought for years back and forth, back and forth, because they were basically of equal strength, well, now they are not. Iran will come in. And they will take over Iraq, within two seconds after we leave, forget it, it is not even a contest. ... "So, they are going to have the second-best oilfields in the world, second-biggest oilfields in the world that we made possible with our soldiers, thousands of people dead, wounded and … less importantly, $1.5 trillion. So, I said very simply. That if it is me, we take the oil. You know, in the old days, when you win a country, you win a country. Now with our stupid people, we win a country, we lose money, we lose soldiers, we lose lives, and then we leave." We won’t address Trump's opinions about Iraq and the war, but we did wonder whether he was right to say that "Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world (behind) Saudi Arabia." Trump’s comment was rather disjointed, so we had to do a bit of interpretation before looking at the statistics. (We e-mailed his office but did not hear back.) Based on the wording and context, we concluded that by referring to the "second-largest oilfields in the world," Trump meant oil reserves, not production. He clearly indicates that Iraq’s fields are a valuable resource, and we concluded that the real prize is the oil remaining to be extracted, rather than what is being produced. Second, we concluded that Trump had actually used the "oilfields" statistic to refer, interchangeably, to two distinct periods in time -- right before the Iraq War, and the present day. He used the same statistic in both referring to the eve of the Iraq War and also to what could happen in the near future if we abandon Iraq and Iran takes over. So we will look at the figures for 2002, the last full year before the Iraq War, and 2010, the most current statistics available. So do the figures back up Trump’s claim? We turned to the website of the Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that compiles energy statistics. One caveat: EIA says its estimates of energy reserves are from a variety of sources and may not be precise. Experts confirmed for us they can be inconsistent and sometimes exaggerated. That said, let’s see what EIA says about Iraq and other countries. In 2002, Iraq’s proven reserves of crude oil amounted to 112.5 billion barrels. That indeed ranks second to Saudi Arabia, with 261.8 billion barrels. By 2010, Iraq’s proven reserves had risen slightly, to 115 billion barrels, but other countries passed it by. Saudi Arabia was still first, with 262.6 billion barrels, but new to the top tier were Venezuela (211.2 billion barrels), Canada (175.2 billion barrels) and then Iran (137.9 billion barrels). So currently -- or in the near future, a time when Trump says Iran would "take over Iraq" within "about two minutes after we leave" -- Iraq ranks fifth in the world, not second, at least according to this estimate. So where does this leave us? For the part of the comment in which Trump appeared to be talking about the eve of the Iraq War, he’s correct that Iraq had "the second-largest oilfields in the world … to Saudi Arabia." But where he flashes forward to a hypothetical, near-term takeover by Iran, Trump’s statistic is off slightly, since Iraq -- while still high on the list -- has been passed by three additional countries. On balance, we rate Trump’s comment Mostly True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2011-04-25T10:19:41	2011-04-14	['Iraq', 'Saudi_Arabia']
pomt-01800	"If you look at what we’ve done over the last several years, the crime rate has actually gone down in [Providence] and . . . the number of shootings has been going down."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/24/angel-taveras/mayor-angel-taveras-says-crime-rate-shootings-have/	Providence is known for a lot of great things. One thing it doesn't want to be known for is the gun violence that regularly makes headlines. On Monday, July 14, 2014, the NAACP tried to rally support for a five-point program to deal with street crime, including providing more job opportunities in low-income communities. That was a week after five people were injured in a July 8 drive-by shooting. In anticipation of that news conference, Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, a Democrat currently running for governor, said there have been signs of hope dealing with the problem. "If you look at what we’ve done over the last several years, the crime rate has actually gone down in the city, and in terms of violence as well, we know the number of shootings has been going down year from year," he told The Providence Journal. "Several" is a vague word. But because he prefaced his statement by saying, "If you look at what we've done," we'll assume he's referring to his tenure as mayor, which began in January 2011. We contacted Taveras' office and spokesman David Ortiz provided data from the Providence police. We should note that the crime rate in the United States -- both violent crimes and property crimes -- has been declining steadily for at least the last 20 years, according to the FBI, so any reduction would not be unique to Providence. We've looked at Providence crime rates before. On December 30, Brett Smiley, now a Democratic candidate for mayor, earned a Mostly True when he said, "Of all cities in the United States with more than 100,000 people, Providence is the 183rd safest." Prior to that, on July 19, 2010, we gave former mayor David Cicilline a True for his statement that Providence had "the lowest crime rate in three decades." We found that, at the time, for 2009 the crime rate was the lowest in 44 years. Has the crime rate and the number of shootings gone down in recent years, as Taveras claims? To determine the crime rate, we used U.S. Census Bureau data for Providence combined with an updated count of crime incidents from the Providence police, as reported to the Rhode Island State Police and the FBI, from 2000 through 2013. (We spot-checked the data with reports on the FBI website.) The rates for total crimes -- including both violent crime and property crime -- have bounced around a bit from year to year but the trend is down. The rate was 52.4 incidents per 1,000 population in 2009 -- the year we used for the Cicilline fact check. It ticked up to 53.7 in 2010, and rose to 54.3 in 2011, which marked Taveras' first year in office. It dropped to 51.9 the following year and was 51.7 in 2013. Based on our research for this item and our Cicilline fact check, that 2013 rate was the lowest in 48 years. A reduction in property crimes -- burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft was responsible for most of the reduction. Such crimes make up roughly seven out of every eight crimes committed in the capital city. The 2013 violent crime rate was 6.7 per 1,000, the lowest since 2007. And what about the number of shootings? Because car backfires and fireworks might sound like a gunshot, the Police Department does not track reports of shootings, according to the city's public safety commissioner, Steven Pare. Taveras' spokesman, Ortiz, said that "When the mayor spoke of shootings, he was referencing the reports he gets regarding shooting victims. The mayor does not get reports regarding shots fired, and that is not at all what he meant." So we got data on shooting victims from Providence police. In 2011, Taveras' first year in office, the number of shooting victims jumped sharply to 108. That's 18 more than in 2010. The number had been rising steadily -- there were 47 shooting victims in 2006, the first year of the statistics provided by Ortiz. But in 2012, the number declined to 105, then to 100 in 2013. And as of July 12, the day Taveras made his statement, there were 61 shooting victims so far this year, the exact same number as of July 12, 2013. We will note for the record that crime rates are down nationally and Providence's rate had been declining long before Taveras took office. Our ruling Angel Taveras said, "Over the last several years, the crime rate has actually gone down in the city and . . . the number of shootings has been going down." While the overall rate ticked up the year before Taveras took office and during the first year of his tenure, it has declined by a few percentage points in the last two years, reflecting the long-term trend. Similarly, the number of shooting victims made a significant jump the first year Taveras was in office. The number has fallen since then, but in 2013, it was still 10 higher than the year before he became mayor. The count as of July 12 -- the date of Taveras' statement -- was not lower than the same time last year; it was identical. All things considered, the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07451	"America's wealthiest 25 percent pay 86 percent of total income taxes. Wealthiest 5 percent pay 60 percent of total income taxes."	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/20/tom-graves/tax-burden-overwhelmingly-wealthy-congressman-says/	Some of you may have come to work bleary-eyed Tuesday and angry at Uncle Sam. You procrastinators waited untl the last minute to file your income taxes, which were due by midnight Monday. In honor of the tax deadline, Tom Graves, a congressman from northwest Georgia, began sending out messages last week about the current tax system. One message, posted on his Twitter page, caught our attention. "America's wealthiest 25 percent pay 86 percent of total income taxes. Wealthiest 5 percent pay 60 percent of total income taxes," the message said. If you’re part of either of those income classes, you may be really upset now. That’s the point most fiscal conservatives are making as President Barack Obama proposes ending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans as part of his debt reduction plan. "This is not because we begrudge those who’ve done well -– we rightly celebrate their success," Obama explained in a recent speech. "Instead, it’s a basic reflection of our belief that those who’ve benefited most from our way of life can afford to give back a little bit more." The top 5 percent have an annual adjusted income before taxes of about $160,000 or more. The top 25 percent have an annual adjusted income before taxes of about $67,000 or more. Instead of trying to figure who’s right about whether the rich pay their fair share in taxes, we wanted to know whether Graves’ facts were correct. Our friends at the PolitiFact national site found that U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., slipped up while talking about the subject in a recent television interview on "Today." Bachmann, who is considering a run for president, said, "The top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government." The top 1 percent of income earners (people making more than $380,000 a year before taxes) did in fact pay 39.5 percent of individual income taxes in 2007, but they paid 28 percent of all federal taxes in 2007. That’s a meaningful distinction because, as a general rule, the burden of the income tax is tilted heavily toward the upper end of the income spectrum, while the payroll tax burden -- another major federal tax -- is paid somewhat more evenly by poor and rich alike. PolitiFact rated Bachmann’s claim False. Graves, by contrast, avoided Bachmann’s linguistic error. His spokesman, John Donnelly, directed us to a report by the Internal Revenue Service that was completed this past winter, based on 2008 data. The report shows that the top 5 percent of taxpayers paid 58.7 percent of federal income taxes. The top 25 percent of taxpayers paid 86.34 percent of total income taxes. The National Taxpayers Union keeps a chart of such data on its website, and its spokesman said Graves’ math is accurate. The group supports the Republican proposals to cut the federal debt, which includes spending cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicare and no tax increases. "The [tax] burden is inordinately high on the top 50 percent of income earners," spokesman Doug Kellogg said. Eric Toder, a veteran tax expert at the centrist to liberal Urban Institute, said his organization analyzed income tax rates for 2010 and also found similar numbers to what Graves put on Twitter. Toder noted that the current annual income cap on Social Security is $106,800, which is less than what the top 5 percent of earners pay. Obama said Tuesday that he wants to raise the income cap on Social Security. Graves was off by a percentage point in relaying the figure for the top 5 percent, but both of his numbers are very close to the IRS data. And while using only the federal income tax as a stand-in for the total federal tax burden paints a somewhat skewed picture, Graves was careful to make his words in the tweet accurate. So we rate his claim as True.	None	Tom Graves	None	None	None	2011-04-20T06:00:00	2011-04-13	['United_States']
pomt-13372	Says "Catherine Cortez Masto failed Nevada rape victims. While attorney general, thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis."	/nevada/statements/2016/sep/28/senate-leadership-fund/ad-accuses-catherine-cortez-masto-not-addressing-r/	A new Nevada ad campaign claims Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto "failed Nevada rape victims" during her tenure as the state’s attorney general. Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has launched several ads attacking the former attorney general on the issue of untested rape test kits. "Catherine Cortez Masto failed Nevada rape victims," the ad says. "While Attorney General, thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis." Cortez Masto’s campaign has taken the ads seriously, as she’s staked much of her candidacy on her record of combating human trafficking and violence against women (even releasing two ads attempting to push back on the claims). However, it’s hard to find any evidence that she took on the specific problem of the state’s rape kit backlog while in office from 2006 to 2014. How the backlog happened "Rape kits" are shorthand for sexual assault forensic evidence kits, intended to be collected soon after a sexual assault or rape by a nurse or doctor. It collects a variety of evidence including the patient’s medical history, tissue and hair samples from the victim’s body and clothes, photos of injuries sustained by the victim, and biological samples such as saliva, blood, semen, urine, skin cells and hair. Nevada came under fire in October 2014 when a nonprofit group released a report showing Las Vegas tested only 16 percent of kits collected by police between 2004 and 2013, with more than 4,300 left unprocessed. Nationwide, the backlog of untested kits was estimated to be more than 400,000 in 2014. Kits aren’t tested for several reasons, including if police decline to request a test in favor of other evidence or if the victim decides not to proceed with prosecution. Testing kits can also be expensive (up to $1,500 for an individual kit), which contributes to backlogs. Advocates say that testing every kit is important because DNA samples from the kits are entered into an FBI database which can uncover new leads and introduce evidence linking sexual assault or rape cases together. Who to blame? The Senate Leadership Fund ads use several pieces of evidence to claim that Cortez Masto "neglected" the issue for eight years, including video of an October 2014 exchange between her and a member of a criminal justice committee on the backlog issue. The video highlights a question from Richard Siegel, former president of the Nevada American Civil Liberties Union, asking Cortez Masto if she’s aware of recent articles about the unprocessed rape kit backlog issue. Cortez Masto responds that she hasn’t (clip begins at 2:17:40), which the ad highlights as evidence that she had "no idea" of the issue. A review of the video shows the ad plays the exchange relatively straightforward, but Siegel (who is supporting Cortez Masto) says it’s taken out of context and ignores all the other work she did on the issue. "The truth was the opposite of that," he said. "She was the leader without any question with anything to do about sexual violence." Still, there isn’t much evidence that Cortez Masto specifically tackled the backlog issue while in office, though she did support legislation expanding access to rape test kits and more broadly sought support for victims of human trafficking and sexual violence. The most direct evidence provided by the Cortez Masto campaign is a 2012 letter that she and 52 other state attorneys general signed urging Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. The letter references a "rape kit that goes unprocessed for lack of funding" as an example of the consequences for not reauthorizing the bill. Cortez Masto also worked on legislation expanding access to sexual assault kits, secured grants to combat violence against women, and helped draft legislation preventing rape or domestic violence victims from being compensated due to their "conduct," which critics say is a form of victim-blaming. As for the ad’s central claim, there is little direct evidence that she took direct action on dealing with the backlog. Her successor, Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt, made filling the backlog a campaign pledge and was able to secure roughly $3.7 million in grants and redirected settlement funds to pay for funding the backlog about a year after taking office. Though the funding is secured, filling the backlog is still a work in progress. Out of about 8,000 total untested kits, the Attorney General’s office says about 1,500 have been sent out for testing as of August 2016, with expectations that roughly half of backlogged kits will be sent out for testing by the end of next year. Adding to the complexity is that responsibility over untested rape kits is a jurisdictional web, as Nevada is an outlier among most states in not having a dedicated state-level forensic lab. The state is instead served by two separate police-run facilities in Reno and Las Vegas servicing the rest of the state. "The attorney general has no responsibility over the laboratory or over the police agencies that the laboratory serves," said Renee Romero, former director of the Reno-area forensic lab. So there is no statutory requirement that Nevada’s attorney general must oversee rape test kits and any potential backlogs, but as the state’s top law enforcement officer, they clearly have the discretion and freedom to take on issues that aren’t clearly laid out in state law. The ads also claim that Cortez Masto was unable to find money needed to address the backlog, while her successor "quickly" found funds to fill the backlog. Laxalt did gain approval from legislators in December 2015 allocating $3.7 million targeting the backlog, but those funds came from various sources, including a one time payment of $1.7 million in settlement funds from JP Morgan Chase case over fraudulent debt collection practices. The initial action against the bank was taken by a group of 13 state attorneys general (not including Nevada) that negotiated the national settlement. Nevada received $1.7 million from that deal, which Laxalt asked to have specifically dedicated to filling the rape-kit backlog. Cortez Masto’s office did send out an advisory in 2014 encouraging Nevadans to file complaints about fraudulent debt collection practices with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though it’s difficult to draw a line between that press release and the ultimate settlement agreement, which Nevada played no part in negotiating and coming in July 2015, after she left office. "It is unclear what former Attorney General Masto is referencing when she states that her work 'helped fund testing of Nevada’s rape kit' backlog," Attorney General’s office spokeswoman Monica Moazez said in a statement. Laxalt’s office also applied for and received around $1.9 million in federal grant money to address the backlog, which wasn’t available when Cortez Masto was in office. But it’s not a new issue, as Congress has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars targeting rape-kit backlogs since 2004 (though it’s been criticized for not effectively tackling the problem). One reason Cortez Masto may not have tackled the backlog issue specifically is because the extent of problem wasn’t revealed until the final months of her term. The first reporting as to the actual extent of the backlog appeared in October 2014, just two months before Cortez Masto left office. Our ruling Senate Leadership Fund claims, "Catherine Cortez Masto failed Nevada rape victims," and "while attorney general, thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis." The ad is misleading in the sense that it portrays Cortez Masto as insensitive to the plight of victims of rape, but the charge that nothing was done to reduce the backlog during her time as attorney general is accurate. However, the labs where rape kits are tested are run by police, and not directly by the attorney general. We rate this ad Half True.

pomt-02146	After the attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, "the ambassador's body was dragged through the street."	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/05/laura-ingraham/ingraham-recycles-incorrect-benghazi-claim/	Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham restated a debunked talking point Sunday, claiming that the body of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was "dragged through the street" following the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi. "We have to not forget, we have four dead Americans," Ingraham said during a roundtable discussion about the Benghazi attack on ABC's This Week. "The ambassador's body was dragged through the street. Okay? It was beyond heartbreaking and beyond infuriating." Stevens' body was not dragged through the street, at least not in the way Ingraham suggests, multiple accounts and three official reviews make clear. PolitiFact examined a similar claim in September 2013 and the facts remain the same. The bottom line: Good Samaritans took Stevens to a hospital where he could receive medical treatment. The most recent summary of the events came from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in January 2014. In an appendix, the report provides a timeline. It has this entry for 1 a.m. Sept. 12, 2012: "Local Libyans found the Ambassador at the Mission Facility and brought him to a local hospital. Despite attempts to revive him, Ambassador Stevens had no heartbeat and had perished from smoke inhalation." Two other government bodies said much the same thing. An Accountability Review Board, headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, declared that Stevens was brought to the hospital by six civilians. "To the best knowledge of the Board these were ‘good Samaritans’ among the hordes of looters and bystanders," the review concluded. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- controlled by Republicans -- reported that "local Libyans found the remains of Ambassador Stevens in the main diplomatic building at the Benghazi Mission and transported him to the hospital. The Libyans apparently did not realize who the Ambassador was, but they alerted the State Department of his location by using the cell phone that was in the Ambassador’s pocket. Libyan doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ambassador Stevens upon his arrival at the hospital." The Associated Press interviewed the Libyan doctor who treated Stevens. CNN spoke to Libyans who said they had found Stevens. The CNN report includes amateur video that shows rescuers pulling Stevens through a window. It seems established fact that Libyans brought Stevens directly to the hospital and there were no signs that anything else took place. Our ruling Ingraham said that the body of Ambassador Stevens was dragged through the street. We reached out to Ingraham but did not hear back. After reading three government reports and independent press accounts, we find that Stevens, overcome by smoke from the fire, was brought to a Libyan hospital where efforts to revive him failed. To be dragged through the streets implies disrespect. There are no reports of public abuse of his body. This claim was debunked long ago and the truth has been widely available. We rate Ingraham's claim False.	None	Laura Ingraham	None	None	None	2014-05-05T17:31:43	2014-05-04	['United_States', 'Libya', 'Benghazi']
pomt-15310	The Iran deal "violates promises the president made to the American people." ... "It is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/19/marco-rubio/rubio-iran-deal-breaks-anytime-anywhere-inspection/	The agreement reached with Iran over nuclear weapons remained a top issue on the Sunday July 19 news shows, with critics of the deal urging that it be scuttled by Congress. On CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told host Jake Tapper that "this deal violates promises the president made to the American people on multiple fronts. It is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process." This issue also came up on the same day on CBS’s Face the Nation, when Secretary of State John Kerry said of anytime, anywhere inspections, "This is a term that, honestly, I never heard in the four years that we were negotiating. It was not on the table. There's no such thing in arms control as ‘anytime, anywhere.’ There isn't any nation in the world, none that has an anytime, anywhere. We always were negotiating was an end to the interminable delays that people had previously. " On Rubio’s claim, we see two questions. First, does the Iran deal fall short of an "anytime, anywhere inspection process"? And second, did Obama promise that it would include an inspection regime that strict? Does the Iran deal fall short of an ‘anytime, anywhere inspection process’? We addressed this question in the course of checking a recent claim by Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., that "thanks to the Obama administration’s negotiations, Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year." We found that it’s correct that certain specific Iranian assets that will be under 24/7 monitoring by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA. According to the agreement, "for 15 years, Iran will permit the IAEA to implement continuous monitoring, including through containment and surveillance measures, as necessary, to verify that stored centrifuges and infrastructure remain in storage, and are only used to replace failed or damaged centrifuges." This round-the-clock monitoring will explicitly include "electronic seals which communicate their status within nuclear sites to IAEA inspectors, as well as other IAEA approved and certified modern technologies," according to the agreement. For instance, at an Iranian facility like Natanz, where more than 5,000 centrifuges will be operating, the IAEA will have cameras that provide 24-hour monitoring, said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition, the agreement says, "Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at (the Iranian nuclear facility at) Natanz ... for 15 years." However, this sort of 24/7 surveillance will not be the rule everywhere in the Iranian nuclear archipelago. "At most locations, inspections will be every once in a while, on a schedule the inspectors judge to be sufficient based on the sensitivity of the activities at that location, how long it would take for Iran to do something there that would make a difference, and so on," Bunn said. In fact, even if Iran ultimately agrees to a contentious inspection, the wait could be as long as 24 days. The agreement spells out that if the IAEA and Iran can’t work out their differences over suspicions about undeclared nuclear materials or activities within 14 days, a joint commission empowered by the agreement would try to resolve the situation for another seven days. Once the commission decides what to do, Iran would have three more days to follow through. In other words, when looking at Iran’s nuclear complex as a whole, "the IAEA can’t just drive up with no warning — it’s not ‘anytime, anywhere,’ " Bunn said So on this point, Rubio is justified in suggesting that the deal doesn’t include "anytime, anywhere" inspections. Did Obama promise that the agreement with Iran would include an ‘anytime, anywhere’ inspection regime? This question is a bit more complicated. We located at least one, and possibly two, instances in which Ben Rhodes -- an assistant to the president and deputy national security advisor for strategic communications and speechwriting -- said the deal would include "anytime, anywhere" inspections. One of Rhodes’ comments came in an interview with Tapper on April 6, 2015. Tapper asked Rhodes, "So the Israelis have put out this list of things that they think should be in the final deal with Iran, including allowing inspectors to go anywhere, anytime. That seems perfectly reasonable, no?" Rhodes responded, "Well, Jake, first of all, under this deal, you will have anywhere, anytime 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has." The second of Rhodes’ comments came on the same day, in an interview with Israel's Channel 10, April 6, 2015. After objecting to the paraphrases used in a widely cited Times of Israel article about the interview, the White House sent us a transcript of the exchange. Rhodes was asked, "Will the IAEA have the ability to visit anywhere, anytime?" Rhodes responded, "Yes, if we see something we want to inspect. So in the first case we will have ‘anytime anywhere’ access to all of the nuclear facilities. We’ll have the ability to look across all of their supply chain, their uranium mines and mills, their centrifuge production and storage facilities. But I think what you're mainly referring to is if there's a suspicious site, for instance, on a military base in Iran, and we want to seek access to that we will be able to go to the IAEA, and get that inspection because of the additional protocol of the IAEA that Iran will be joining, and some of the additional transparency and inspection measures that are in the deal." Much of the coverage has focused on Rhodes’ agreement with the interviewer’s words that the IAEA will "have the ability to visit anywhere, anytime." The White House notes, however, that Rhodes’ full comments are more nuanced, spelling out the more complicated -- and not instantaneous -- process of inspecting suspicious sites not already cited in the agreement. So we see one pretty clear statement, plus one somewhat less clear statement, made by the Obama administration that backs up Rubio’s claim. "The answer given by Ben Rhodes is consistent with the messaging that the Obama administration has been providing since the nuclear talks with Iran began," said Rick Brennan Jr., a senior political scientist with Rand Corp. "In fact, in 2012 President Obama declared that the final deal with Iran would ensure ‘the end to their nuclear program,’ which we now understand is not accurate." That said, though, Rhodes' comments are something of an outlier to the words other White House officials have said. In general, the message from senior White House officials has been that the inspections regime in the deal would be strong by historical standards -- and strong enough to achieve its goals -- but not allowing "anytime, anywhere" inspections. Critics like Rubio "are trying to imply that the Obama administration promised that international inspectors bust into any undeclared Iranian site, whenever they felt like doing so, and without cause," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. However, that was not the administration’s goal, because "no sovereign state would agree to such an arrangement; no such access is necessary to verify compliance; and any such arrangement would waste the inspectors' resources. Iran is a large country and the inspectors should and will focus on particular areas/sites of concern." A good example of the White House's usual wording is the briefing held by Press Secretary Josh Earnest on March 9, 2015. Here are some of the phrases Earnest used to describe the extent of the inspection regime: • "We're going to insist that the Iranians agree to intrusive inspection measures that will resolve the broader international community’s concerns." • "What we are seeking from Iran are a whole set of commitments from them … to comply with an intrusive set of inspections to verify their compliance with the agreement." • "They’re going to have to agree to a set of very intrusive inspections." • "Any sort of agreement that is reached will require serious commitments on the part of Iran to an intrusive inspections program that allows international inspectors not just into their nuclear facilities, but also into the manufacturing facilities that are manufacturing parts and equipment for their nuclear facilities that would require inspections at uranium mines in Iran." • "We would insist … that Iran commit to comply with a historically intrusive set of inspections." • The deal would "impose an intrusive set of inspections that would verify Iran’s compliance with the agreement." Such language has been echoed numerous other times by White House officials, including Obama. In a Rose Garden address on April 2, 2015, four days before Rhodes’ televised comments, Obama said: "Iran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history. … International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities, but to the entire supply chain that supports Iran’s nuclear program -- from uranium mills that provide the raw materials, to the centrifuge production and storage facilities that support the program." Obama repeated the sentiment in his weekly address on April 4, 2015, and the message was echoed by others -- including Rhodes himself. At a press briefing at Camp David May 14, 2015, Rhodes said, "Under this agreement that we're pursuing with the Iranians, (the nuclear) program will be rolled back and face significant limitations that it doesn’t currently face, and there will be the most intrusive inspections regime of any arms control agreement that we've ever had." Rhodes tried to clarify the "anywhere, anytime" phrasing in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on July 14, 2015. "We never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called ‘anytime, anywhere’ where you can basically go anywhere in the country, look at whatever you wanted to do, even if it had nothing to do with the nuclear program. What we did seek is beyond this comprehensive verification of the nuclear sites. If we have a suspicion about a site, we have the ability to go to the IAEA, the organization that conducts inspections, and to say, we need to inspect that site." So Rubio’s not wrong to say that the Obama administration promised "anywhere, anytime" inspections. However, it’s also reasonable to point out that most of the administration’s statements on this point have not used that specific language. Our ruling Rubio said that the Iran nuclear deal "violates promises the president made to the American people" because it "is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process." Rubio has a point that a senior administration national-security official did, in at least one case and possibly two cases, say on television that the deal would include "anytime, anywhere" inspection provisions. However, focusing on these two comments is a bit of cherry-picking, since most of the White House’s statements on this issue have avoided that term in favor of ones that can be more plausibly used to describe the provisions of the agreement that were ultimately reached. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-07-19T16:52:10	2015-07-19	['United_States', 'Iran']
pomt-13011	Wisconsin has only one county, Dane, "that's hand counting the votes" in the 2016 presidential recount.	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/09/sean-duffy/wisconsin-presidential-election-recount-only-dane-/	A Twitter war (well, skirmish) broke out between two Wisconsin congressmen after one of them, Republican Sean Duffy, called Madison a Communist community. In making the attack, Duffy also made a claim about the state’s recount of 2016 election results, which was forced by Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein and supported by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. "We only have one county that's hand counting the votes, that's Dane County, which is the home of Madison," Duffy told Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson on Dec. 1, 2016. "It's the progressive-liberal-Communist community of Madison. "And they’re taking as long as they can -- the Stein and Hillary folks who are on the ground are taking as much time contesting ballots, slow walking as much as they can." Six days later, Democrat Mark Pocan, a decades-long resident of the Madison area, tweeted: Demanding an apology from @RepSeanDuffy for calling Madison communist community that doesn't believe in democracy & freedom on @FoxNews. That led Duffy to respond the same day with his own tweet: The PC crowd is humorless. For those offended by my "communist" comment, I'll send a therapy dog to your "safe place" of choice in Madison. And the next day, Pocan went on Carlson’s show to talk about the spat some more. Perhaps lost in the back-and-forth was Duffy’s claim about the recount -- that Dane is the only county in Wisconsin recounting ballots by hand. The recount Stein raised millions of dollars over the Thanksgiving holiday to pay for presidential election recounts in Wisconsin and two other states. She also said Wisconsin uses illegal voting machines, which we rated Pants on Fire. We noted in that item that the vast majority of voting machines in Wisconsin are optical readers. Voters fill out a paper ballot and feed it into the machine, which then electronically records the vote. Meanwhile, a small percentage of votes are cast on touch-screen machines -- but in Wisconsin they also generate a paper record for each ballot cast. As of early afternoon on Dec. 9, 2016, with the recount expected to be completed within two or three days, 88.5 percent of the Wisconsin votes had been recounted. Clinton had gained 49 votes on Republican Donald Trump, who won the state by some 22,000 votes in the original count. All told, there was a net change of 1,322 votes in the presidential race among the more than 2.63 million ballots that had been recounted. As for how the recounting has been done, the majority of Wisconsin’s 72 counties (including Dane, but not Milwaukee) are doing it by hand. Here is what the county election clerks told the Wisconsin Election Commission at the outset of the recount about their plans for the recount: 47 counties: Recount by hand 13 counties: Combination of hand count and optical scanners 12 counties: Optical scanners A word on the process in Wisconsin: Every ballot is first examined by the recount workers so the candidates’ representatives can see it and raise any questions or objections to it. If the recount is conducted by hand, the ballots are sorted into piles for each candidate for counting by hand. If the recount is by machine, the ballots are fed into the tabulating machine for counting. The commission told us it did not follow up with the clerks to see if any of their plans had changed. But there were news reports about hand counts being done in various counties, including Brown, Clark and Marinette. In any case, Duffy was not claiming that Dane was the only county doing hand recounts, according to Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar. Duffy "was explaining that Dane County was the only county where there were reports on the ground of Stein supporters trying to slow-walk the recount process," Bednar said. But that’s not how it came out in the interview. Duffy declared that only Dane County was hand counting votes. But many counties decided to do the recount by hand. The "slow walking" part of what Duffy said has to do with Stein and Clinton supporters and nothing to do with Dane County. Our rating Duffy said Wisconsin has only one county, Dane, "that's hand counting the votes" in the 2016 presidential recount. But several dozen counties committed to doing recounts by hand, Dane being one of them. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b3f85e86-7ccc-4ba0-92e7-7491472043c2	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2016-12-09T18:01:11	2016-12-01	['None']
pomt-08665	John Boehner wants to reopen a tax loophole "that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/13/barack-obama/obama-said-boehner-opposes-tax-rule-keep-profits-a/	President Barack Obama has been in campaign mode this month, no doubt looking toward the elections less than two months away. In two speeches recently, he's said American companies shouldn't be rewarded for shipping jobs and profits overseas, but warned that Republicans don't agree. Obama discussed aid the federal government sent to the states in August, part of a package to pay teacher salaries. The aid was offset by changes to the tax code that closed what Obama said were loopholes for corporations. "By the way, this bill that we passed to save all those jobs, we made sure that bill wouldn't add to the deficit," Obama said in a speech on Labor Day. "You know how we paid for it? By closing one of these ridiculous tax loopholes that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas. I mean, this was one of those loopholes that allowed companies to write off taxes they pay to foreign governments –- even though they weren't paying taxes here in the United States." "So middle-class families were footing tax breaks for companies creating jobs somewhere else," Obama added. "I mean, even a lot of America's biggest corporations agreed that this loophole didn't make sense, agreed that it needed to be closed, agreed that it wasn't fair -– but the man who thinks he's going to be speaker, he wants to reopen this loophole." We wanted to know two things: Is the law Obama talks about really "one of these ridiculous tax loopholes that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas"? And does Ohio's John Boehner -- the current House Republican leader -- want to reverse the law? Let's take these questions in order. Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10. It sends $26.1 billion to states facing budget shortfalls, providing $10 billion for salaries and compensation for teachers and another $16.1 million to help states pay for Medicaid, the long-standing government insurance program for the poor and disabled. The law also includes "offsets," which is any kind of spending cut or tax increase that balances out the new spending so that it doesn't add to the deficit. This closed the "loopholes" that Obama mentions by taking away exemptions and credits that previously existed, which increases revenues by $9.8 billion over 10 years. The summary of the law from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service lists seven different credits or exemptions that the law changes. The United States government taxes its companies on foreign profits, which not all countries do. But companies don't have to pay taxes on foreign earnings until they bring their profits back to this country. So companies tend to keep the money with their foreign subsidiaries as long as possible. But companies also get U.S. tax credits for taxes they pay to foreign governments. Some companies figured out how to game the system by keeping their profits overseas while still claiming a tax credit for taxes paid on the same income to foreign governments. That's the loophole the new law is trying to address. It says companies can't claim the foreign tax credit until they report their income. Boehner's office sent us several letters from business groups who opposed the law. During the debate over the measure, companies said any increase in taxes would make American companies less competitive with their foreign rivals. "The current U.S. system is inconsistent with the free flow of trade and investment, and it inhibits use of foreign earnings to invest in the U.S. economy. The provisions included in the House legislation to be considered today will only make matters worse," wrote Larry Burton, executive director of the Business Roundtable, in a letter to members of Congress. The Business Roundtable represents chief executive officers of major U.S. companies. We queried several tax professors via e-mail to see what their take on the new law was. We got a range of responses, but they all agreed that companies with international operations can shield profits from being taxed, and these changes make that harder. "The rules that were changed were necessary, if narrowly targeted, reforms of the foreign tax credit rules," said Robert Peroni of the University of Texas at Austin. "The old rules resulted in overstated foreign tax credits for some U.S. multinational corporations, resulting in those corporations paying lower U.S. income taxes than they should have paid under a properly designed U.S. international income tax system." "It's hard to deny that there was a problem. There clearly was a problem," said David Rosenbloom of New York University. "But companies worried that any rules that the IRS adopts will be very hard to confine to only the abuse situations." The tax experts also said it's difficult to prove whether American companies with business overseas employ fewer people in the United States because of the tax rules. "The connection between the loophole and jobs being shipped overseas is tenuous at best," Rosenbloom said. Finally, Lawrence Lokken of the University of Florida warned us that even experts disagree about the effects of some international tax rules. "Whether the current system encourages companies to move jobs offshore, and whether these fixes will discourage companies from doing so, are hotly debated issues. You can find entirely respectable opinion on each side of the issues," he said. So does Boehner want to reverse the new rule? Yes, said his spokesman Michael Steel. Boehner "opposes the change the President mentioned but would strongly disagree with the way the President characterizes it," Steel said via e-mail. We're fact-checking Obama's statement that John Boehner wants to reopen a "tax loopholes that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas." The tax experts we spoke with said the rules did attempt to close loopholes in the tax system. The loopholes had to do with companies keeping profits overseas. Boehner does oppose the measure.

pomt-08739	Under the new health care law, "if a landscaper wants to buy a new lawnmower, or a restaurant needs a new ice-maker, they have to report that to the feds."	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/31/john-boehner/rep-john-boehner-gets-it-right-new-business-tax-ma/	Congressional Democrats found a lot of ways to pay for the country’s health insurance overhaul, some more popular than others. But one in particular has small lawn services, work-at-home parents and the nation’s smallest businesses mighty concerned. In a move to increase government revenues for health care while cutting tax abuses, Congress included a provision in the bill, approved in March, requiring businesses to file Internal Revenue Service reports on expenditures above $600 to any single vendor. Here is how John Boehner, the House Republican leader and a leading critic of the provision (and the health insurance bill), derided it when he spoke at the City Club of Cleveland on Aug. 24: "If a landscaper wants to buy a new lawnmower, or a restaurant needs a new ice-maker, they have to report that to the feds. If you're a mom-and-pop grocery store, and you buy $1,000 worth of merchandise from 15 different vendors, that's 15 different forms you have to file." We have to assume that Boehner, who’s from southwestern Ohio, meant the mom-and-pop store is spending $1,000 on each of the vendors, rather than spreading a $1,000 purchase among 15 vendors (because that would only be $66.66 each). If that is the case, Boehner’s statement is true, or will be as of Jan. 1, 2012. But Boehner is not the only one calling it nuts. So is the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and even a Cleveland congressman who is generally Boehner’s ideological opposite. "This obviously was something that needed to be better thought out," said that congressman, Democrat Dennis Kucinich, in a telephone interview. "It has to be fixed, and it will be fixed, because it’s not tolerable." Businesses were already required to file an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 for payments of $600 or more for services they obtained, such as accounting or advertising advice. But according to the National Taxpayer Advocate Service, a watchdog arm of the IRS, the prior law "generally did not require a person to report payments to purchase goods, presumably because the purchaser could not determine the amount that (less cost of goods sold) would have been income to the vendor." And under "a longstanding regulatory regime," the Taxpayer Advocate Service said in a June 30 report to Congress on a host of IRS-related tax issues, "there was an exception for payments to corporations as well as to tax-exempt and government entities." There had been earlier efforts to eliminate the corporate exemption, which would assure that even if a small business was paying in cash for a corporation’s services, the corporation could not avoid paying taxes. But the provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- specifically in section 9006, amending the Internal Revenue Code -- went further by including goods as well as services. Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee figured this would help pay for part of the health care bill. Congressional Quarterly reported that provision "aims to discourage tax cheating by vendors in the form of not disclosing all of their income. The premise is that vendors are more likely to report all of their income and to pay all of the taxes they owe if their customers are telling the IRS, via form 1099, how much they are paying vendors in a given year." How extensively would this affect businesses? Quite extensively, says the Taxpayer Advocate Service. The provision "would apply to businesses of all sizes, charities and other tax-exempt organizations, and government entities." That includes 26 million non-farm sole proprietorships, 4 million S corporations, 2 million C corporations, 3 million partnerships, 2 million farming businesses, 1 million charities and other tax-exempt organizations, "and probably more than 100,000 federal, state, and local government entities." Small business owners would have to get Tax Identification Numbers or Employer Identification Numbers from their vendors -- and if a vendor refused to provide one, "the business is required by law to impose back-up withholding at the rate of 28 percent of the purchase price," says the Taxpayer Advocate Service report. Let’s say you own a two-person landscaping company and want to buy $600 worth of mowers from a guy who refurbishes them in his spare time. He won’t give you his identification number. So you’re supposed to pay him $423 and withhold another $168, or 28 percent -- and file the appropriate withholding forms, of course. That’s assuming that the backyard repairman is willing to part with his mowers at this point in your transaction. In the words of the Taxpayer Advocate Service, this "could significantly impair the normal course of commerce." Boehner and fellow Republicans are using this provision to lampoon Democrats. Yet Democrats say they, too, want to get rid of the provision. The problem is that Democrats need to find a way to make up the revenue, estimated at $17 billion, if they give up this particular one.. Before leaving for their August recess, House Democrats suggested a tax on multinational corporations that move operations offshore, but that failed. Senate Democrats this fall may try to get some of the money by removing a manufacturing tax deduction from big oil and gas companies while keeping part of the provision intact. They would raise the reporting threshold to $5,000 and exempt companies with fewer than 25 employees. But as CQ reports, Senate Republicans have a different idea: Repeal the whole provision and soften the health care bill’s requirement that individuals buy insurance with, if needed, government subsidies. If the insurance bill were to cost less, it would reduce the need for this money, Republicans say. You may agree or disagree with any of these approaches, but the issue here is simply Boehner’s statement on the $600 reporting requirement. It’s about mom-and-pop stores and lawn-mowing services, and we rate it True. Comment on this item.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-08-31T11:30:00	2010-08-24	['None']
pomt-04955	Says India "gained jobs thanks to Romney."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/26/priorities-usa-action/super-PAC-ad-mitt-romney-outsources-jobs-india/	A super PAC ad uses the splendor of the Olympics opening ceremonies as a backdrop to denounce Mitt Romney as an outsourcer and tax dodger. The ad, by the pro-Barack Obama group Priorities Action USA, opens with an overhead shot of an Olympic stadium packed with people, cameras flashing. Romney, who led the 2002 Salt Lake City games, strides onto a stage and waves. Olympic teams from China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands parade in as an announcer makes multiple charges that Romney sent American jobs overseas and stashed his personal wealth in offshore accounts. "Welcome to the Olympics," the voiceover says. "There’s Mitt Romney, who ran the Salt Lake City games, waving to China, home to a billion people. Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney’s companies. "India, which also gained jobs thanks to Romney, an outsourcing pioneer. And Burma, where Romney had the uniforms made for the 2002 games." The announcer continues with claims about countries where Romney has had bank accounts or corporations. The ad was apparently removed from YouTube because of copyright concerns, but we are checking its claims because they received so much coverage on cable news channels and the Web. Here we’ll look at the claim that India "gained jobs thanks to Romney." (We've previously examined the claim he was a "pioneer" of outsourcing.) Outsourcing governor? A spokesman for Priorities USA Action provided two different examples to back this up: a state contract that included use of a call center in India while Romney was governor of Massachusetts and a software company that also had a call center in India while it was owned by Romney's firm Bain Capital. First, the call center from Romney's days as governor. Last month, the Obama campaign released an an ad that said Romney, while governor of Massachusetts, "outsourced call center jobs to India." PolitiFact looked into that claim and found it wasn't so clear-cut. We rated it Half True. When he was governor, Massachusetts had a $160,000 a month contract with Citigroup to process debit cards for food stamps, as well as offshore contracts through its child support enforcement and unemployment insurance programs in 2005. Citigroup outsourced its customer service call center to a facility in India. So it’s an important point that the state wasn’t outsourcing work to India -- a state contractor was. But Romney chose not to to end the arrangement. During budget negotiations in 2004, the second year of Romney’s term, the Democratic-controlled legislature sent Romney a budget with an amendment that "would prohibit Massachusetts from contracting with companies that ‘outsource’ the state's work to other countries," according to the Boston Globe. At the time, many states were contracting with companies that outsourced some form of their work overseas. The Government Accountability Office found that in 2005, 43 states had contracts with companies administering state programs in which some of the work, primarily customer service and software development, was done overseas. The revelation prompted 38 states to consider similar bans on contracting with companies that outsourced, the Globe wrote. Romney was forced to weigh two competing interests: protecting and promoting jobs in his state vs. saving taxpayers money. The Globe pointed out that lawmakers in Kansas considered a similar measure but pulled the plug when they learned it would cost the state an additional $640,000. The prohibition in Massachusetts’ was favored by labor unions but opposed by some economists who said it didn’t make economic sense for taxpayers to pay more for low-skill jobs. Ultimately, Romney vetoed the measure because he said that even if those jobs were back in the United States, they would not necessarily have been in Massachusetts. Outsourcing claims at Bain Priorities USA Action also pointed us to Bain’s involvement with the technical support firm Stream International. Bain bought a stake in the software company CSI in 1993, and later merged it with another firm to form Stream International, according to the Washington Post. In the mid 1990s, Stream was setting up tech-support call centers outside the U.S. There's no question that Stream had employees in India because it boasted in an October 2000 news release that it had a joint venture with the Indian company Tracmail to provide customer service at locations that included India. However, Romney left Bain in 1999 to head the Salt Lake City Olympics, so he was gone from day-to-day operations by the time of this press release, though he remained CEO of Bain until 2002. But PolitiFact has rated claims of his continued involvement to be Half True because he founded the company and was responsible for its overall direction, and documents indicate he continued to be involved to some extent for the next couple of years. Our ruling Priorities USA Action said that India "gained jobs thanks to Romney." While Romney was governor, Massachusetts had contracts with companies that had customer service call centers in India. That’s not the same as the state directly sending work overseas, but Romney blocked a legislative effort to stop it. And it's reasonable to conclude that India gained some jobs, at least while the Massachusetts arrangement was in effect. At Bain, he was part of a move to invest in CSI, which later merged with another firm to form Stream International, which announced the call centers in India a year after Romney departed to run the Olympics. So yes, India got some jobs from CSI, but Romney's influence was early and ultimately indirect. As for being a pioneer, Romney and Bain joined the bandwagon, but they didn’t lead it. Outsourcing was an established practice by private equity firms to cut costs at companies they invested in. They were more like disciples than pioneers. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-08486	In 2009, "the state Legislature passed more than $5 billion in tax increases."	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/11/leah-vukmir/gop-state-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-says-legisl/	With Democrats hoping to retain control of the state Senate, one of the most hotly-contested races features two lawmakers from Wauwatosa -- Republican state Rep. Leah Vukmir vs. Democratic incumbent Jim Sullivan. Going door to door, Vukmir distributes a flier that says she will work to improve the economy, attract more jobs and cut taxes. In it, she also laments the current tax burden in the state, saying that in 2009, the Legislature "passed more than $5 billion in tax increases." We’ve been here before. And though the Legislature did raise taxes -- and fees -- quite a bit in 2009, the total wasn’t anywhere near $5 billion. Our research was done after Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, made almost the identical claim. We found that taxes and fees were upped by $3.14 billion in 2009. Consequently, we gave Kleefisch’s statement a False rating. To try to get closer to $5 billion, Vukmir’s campaign includes -- as Kleefisch did -- a$1.5 billion boost in net property taxes. But we’ll repeat what we said in the Kleefisch claim: Property tax levies are set by local taxing bodies, such as the city and the county, not by the Legislature. And we’ll give Vukmir’s claim the same rating: False.	None	Leah Vukmir	None	None	None	2010-10-11T09:00:00	2010-10-09	['None']
pomt-01398	"An overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders have endorsed Brad Schimel."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/13/brad-schimel/brad-schimel-says-most-republican-and-democrat-col/	Political scientists say that in a tight race between little-known candidates and few defining issues, endorsements can have more influence than usual. That might be why Brad Schimel, the Republican candidate for state attorney general, is calling himself "law enforcement’s choice." And it’s probably why the first thing that pops up on the Waukesha County district attorney’s campaign website is a boast regarding 89 endorsements. In a new TV ad just a month from his Nov. 4, 2014 face-off with Democrat and Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, the ad’s narrator says that as a "decorated prosecutor and father of two girls, Brad Schimel puts public safety ahead of politics." The TV spot, which began airing Oct. 1, 2014, continues: "It’s why an overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders have endorsed Brad Schimel." Is Schimel right? Behind the numbers Schimel defines "law enforcement leaders" as county sheriffs and district attorneys. A solid majority of them -- about 60 percent -- run as Republicans, so Schimel had a natural advantage vs. Happ. But a fair number of law enforcement officials decline to endorse, so the advantage is not guaranteed. We analyzed the endorsement lists of both candidates and here’s what we found: Combined, Happ and Schimel claim 112 endorsements from current DAs and sheriffs. Schimel has received 80 percent of those endorsements. If you were to look at all sheriffs and DAs -- including those who have not issued endorsements -- his total of 89 would represent about 60 percent. Significantly, Schimel won over nine Democrats and one independent. In contrast, Happ’s 23 endorsements were all from within her party -- not a single Republican official defected to her side. Bottom line, Schimel started with a natural "base" of 60 percent, but wound up with 80 percent support from those who endorsed. So, by that measure his "overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders" claim holds up to scrutiny. But his claim can also be read as a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats. By that measure, he is accurate with Republicans, but not with Democrats. Of the 32 Democrats who have endorsed, Happ received 23 compared to Schimel’s nine. For Schimel, that is 28 percent of the nods from Democrats. That’s 28 percent more than Happ won from Republicans, but not a majority. Our rating Schimel’s ad says that "an overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders have endorsed Brad Schimel." The AG candidate has won 80 percent support from those who endorsed, and wooed 9 Democrats into the fold. He has won a clear majority overall, and from Republicans, but not from Democrats alone. That makes for a partially accurate claim, our definition of Half True.

pomt-13623	"California is home to the largest death row population in the Western Hemisphere."	/california/statements/2016/aug/12/yes-62-death-penalty-repeal/does-california-have-largest-death-row-western-hem/	Californians will decide in November whether to abolish — or possibly speed up — the state’s death penalty. Proposition 62 would eliminate capital punishment, replacing it with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole as the state’s maximum punishment for those found guilty of murder. It would apply retroactively to the nearly 750 inmates on California's death row. Proposition 66, meanwhile, would keep the death penalty but proposes a faster appeals process. Campaigns for the competing ballot measures are making numerous claims as they seek to persuade voters. A provocative statement by the Yes On 62 campaign on its twitter page caught our attention: "California is home to the largest death row population in the Western Hemisphere." The Yes On 62 campaign to abolish California's death penalty made the claim at the center of this fact check on its twitter page above. Home to nearly 40 million people, California leads the way in many numerical categories. We wondered, however, whether that includes this somber grouping. Our research The largest death row populations in the Western Hemisphere belong to states within the United States, not separate countries, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. The Washington D.C.-based nonprofit is considered an authority on death penalty topics, and opposes capital punishment. As of August 5, the California Department of Corrections lists 746 prisoners on the state’s death row. That’s nearly double the next largest total — Florida’s 388 — according to figures from that state’s department of corrections. Texas’ total is nearly 250, the third highest. Beyond Florida and Texas, there aren’t any states in the United States that are even close, Dunham said. PolitiFact California: Truth be told: California has ‘largest death row in Western Hemisphere’ Create your own infographics Nor are other countries in the hemisphere anywhere close. "Most of the Western Hemisphere has abolished the death penalty. Apart from the United States, the retentionist countries are Cuba, Guatemala and Guyana and then a couple of countries in the Caribbean. None of them have death rows that are remotely the size of California’s or even Florida’s," Dunham added. Canada did away with the death penalty in 1976; Mexico eliminated it in 2005. The Cornell Law School’s Death Penalty Worldwide database shows it’s been several years since Cuba, Guatemala or Guyana executed anyone. There are 19 states in the United States with no death penalty. Several have abolished capital punishment in recent years, including Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey and Maryland. There are two federal death rows, including one in the military, both of which are much smaller than California’s. Explaining the backlog Reasons cited for California’s massive death row vary. Dunham says death penalty appeals backlog in the courts because the state fails to provide prisoners with enough legal help. Bill Bradley, spokesman for the No On 62 campaign, said delays result from a system that allows inmates and their attorneys to "file appeal after frivolous appeal to delay justice." Another cause: Executions have been on hold in California since 2006 following a legal challenge to the state’s three-chemical lethal injection method. The state has executed just 13 people since it reinstated the death penalty in 1978. Experts say execution is the third leading cause of death on California’s death row, behind natural causes and suicide. When asked, a Yes on 62 campaign spokesman pointed to research by the Death Penalty Information Center and the Cornell Law School database to back up its "largest death row" statement. Bradley of the No on Prop 62 campaign described the claim about California’s large death row as "technically true" but dismissed its significance saying "California has the largest of everything." A guard stands watch over condemned inmates on death row at San Quentin State Prison. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) Confusing claim? While California clearly has a large death row, there’s an aspect of the Yes On 62 claim that could be considered confusing. California has fewer people on death row than are condemned to die across the United States. So, how could it have "the largest death row population" in the Western Hemisphere? Experts explain it this way: In the United States, death sentences are primarily the product of state courts. The federal government plays less of a role compared to central governments in other countries. As a result, the size of death rows have long been tracked by state and not necessarily as a national, comprehensive total. "It may be a dramatic way of making the point," Dunham said of the Yes On 62 claim. "But the point is still accurate." We used a similar interpretation of the claim as we examined its accuracy. Frank Zimring, a law professor and death penalty expert at UC Berkeley, agreed California has the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere. He estimated it ranks behind only a handful of countries on the planet, including China and Iran. Our ruling The Yes On 62 campaign to abolish the death penalty said "California is home to the largest death row population in the Western Hemisphere." Death penalty experts and public data show California has nearly 750 people condemned to die. That’s nearly twice as many as the next closest state or country, Florida at 388, in the Western Hemisphere. The claim could be confusing to some because California’s death row is smaller than the total number of people with death sentences across the United States. But experts say death rows in the U.S. are ranked individually, making California’s stand far out from the rest. We also found that few countries in this hemisphere still have the death penalty, which is helpful to note but does not take away from the accuracy of the statement. We rate the claim True.

pomt-03035	The health care marketplaces have "no privacy protections."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/09/tom-cotton/aca-marketplaces-have-no-privacy-protections-cotto/	When it comes to Web design, everyone’s a critic. The Affordable Care Act’s new online marketplaces certainly aren’t an exception. But some Internet complaints directed in President Barack Obama’s general direction go beyond cosmetics, attacking security, too. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who opposes Obamacare, was particularly vocal on MSNBC about the issues he saw with the new system. He said lawmakers now realize some of the downfalls of the system, including technical concerns. "They realize that the websites aren't ready, that there's no privacy protections, that there's likely to be data breaches," he said. Now, it’s clear that there are lots of bugs in the online marketplaces where consumers browse and purchase health care plans. There have been reported issues with the live chat function, registration process and speed of service, among other things. It’s not even clear how many people have been able to buy insurance, but it doesn’t seem like very many. Cotton, though, said that the websites have no privacy protections and are therefore likely to be hacked. We decided to look into it to determine just how vulnerable consumer information is. Where does your personal data go? As users navigate healthcare.gov, they get pointed toward the marketplace websites appropriate for their specific states. To apply for health insurance, they have to submit some sensitive information, including a Social Security number and last year’s income. The site itself routs responses through a data hub, so that the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration can verify customers’ identities and confirm eligibility for subsidies to buy health insurance. This information isn’t stored in the hub itself, though, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the online marketplaces. So information isn’t sitting there waiting to be stolen. There are baseline privacy standards for the marketplaces that come directly from the health care reform legislation itself and previous health privacy laws. All the information collected must be relevant to determining eligibility and enrollment, said Christopher Rasmussen, a Health Privacy Project analyst at the Center for Democracy & Technology. The information is submitted through secure protocols that government websites have long followed, said George Smith, an expert in the technology and science of cybersecurity. The U.S. Department of Commerce developed a cybersecurity framework (that we would link to, if not for the government shutdown) that includes guidelines and best practices for organizations to secure their IT systems, designed to complement risk management already in place. Scott Borg, CEO of the U.S. Cyber Consequences unit, a nonprofit institute that researches the economic consequences of possible cyber attacks, said the marketplaces are more secure than most popular e-commerce sites because they’re less complicated. "We can expect the health insurance industry websites after the Affordable Care Act is fully operating to be simpler, less numerous, and more like each other," Borg said. "This will make them easier to secure and, in general, should improve their cyber security." Potential data breaches When we asked Cotton’s office about his statement, his staff pointed us to an August report indicating that government agencies pushed back some early security testing deadlines. This is true, but CMS reported later that the security testing was completed in September. That includes security testing done by an independent organization. The final security authorization for the marketplace websites were completed on Sept. 6, two days behind the original timeline and several weeks before the marketplaces opened in October. We also looked at an incident of a state website leaking personal data that a spokeswoman from Cotton’s office referred us to. MNsure, the Minnesota marketplace, accidentally emailed a spreadsheet identifying 2,400 insurance agents to an insurance broker’s office. But that didn’t involve consumer data, and it happened prior to the opening of the MNsure marketplace on Oct. 1. Also, MNsure reported that this was due to human error, not an IT glitch. Can the marketplace websites be hacked? Data isn’t lying around for federal employees to take, but we also wanted to see how easy it might be for hackers to access. "In general, it is very difficult to assess whether any website has adequate data security without conducting an internal security audit or attempting an attack from the outside," said Anton Dahbura, the executive director of the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. However, we found no evidence that the healthcare.gov webpages are any more vulnerable to to attack than other websites associated wtih traditional e-commerce. "These are actually going to be more secure than most government sites need to be," Borg said. Our ruling Cotton claimed that there are no privacy protections in the new online health care marketplaces. However, we found federal privacy regulations in the Affordable Care Act that keep the system’s data hub from storing user data. The cybersecurity experts we spoke with said that the security precautions in place on healthcare.gov are at least as strong as secure e-commerce websites consumers are already accustomed to using. No one we spoke with raised concerns about privacy. The most relevant complaints we saw remain that the websites are slow, not that consumer information is vulnerable. We rate Cotton’s statement False.	None	Tom Cotton	None	None	None	2013-10-09T13:50:51	2013-10-03	['None']
pomt-12314	Says Barack Obama "acknowledged over 20 times" that his administration’s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans "immigration edict was a violation of law and the separation of powers."	/texas/statements/2017/jun/21/ken-paxton/ken-paxton-inaccurately-says-barack-obama-repeated/	A Texas Republican, pleased at the revocation of a federal effort to shield older immigrants from deportation, elaborated that then-President Barack Obama repeatedly acknowledged that his administration's 2014 immigration order wasn’t legal. In a June 2017 press release, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton applauded the June 5, 2017, Department of Homeland Security decision rescinding the Obama-era policy memo announcing the program to protect parents of certain immigrants from deportation. The Obama-era effort, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, never took effect after Texas and 25 other states persuaded a federal district judge to block implementation--a move ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. Paxton said: "I applaud President (Donald) Trump for acknowledging what President Obama himself acknowledged over 20 times – the Obama Administration’s DAPA immigration edict was a violation of law and the separation of powers." We requested the basis of Paxton’s claim that Obama had, over 20 times, said DAPA was offered in violation of federal law. Kayleigh Lovvorn in Paxton’s state office answered by email: "All of Barack Obama’s quotes on the subject are documented, archived, and available online." Checking Obama’s statements We’ve been over such turf before though Paxton’s claim that Obama said the DAPA in particular violated the law adds a twist. In December 2014, we gave Mostly True ratings to statements by a U.S. House member and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to the effect that Obama had many times said he couldn’t act to protect immigrants from deportation unless Congress revised immigration laws. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, said at a December 2014 hearing of Obama’s past statements on immigration: "The president said over 20 times that he did not have the legal authority to do this, to take this executive action, and that this is not how democracy works." McCaul’s count was overly high, we found. But Obama had often said through March 2014 that absent congressional action, he couldn’t do more by himself to protect immigrants living in the country without legal permission. In a 2015 interview, Abbott said: "22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of" anti-deportation "measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’" Like McCaul, we found, Abbott overstated the confirmed instances of Obama indicating he couldn’t independently do more to prevent deportations. Obama’s statements since DAPA Notably, those fact-checks were based on statements that Obama made long before announcing DAPA. In contrast, Obama insisted he was within the law when he announced DAPA in November 2014 as a follow-up to his administration’s established effort to keep certain young immigrants from being deported (as of June 2017, the older program--Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--was left intact by the Trump administration). A 2014 memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel said DAPA fell within Homeland Security’s discretionary powers to enforce immigration laws. That office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. In announcing DAPA, Obama changed his declared position on his ability to act unilaterally as PolitiFact noted at the time. Obama told the country he was launching DAPA to delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who had lived in the U.S. for more than five years and who had children who were citizens or had green cards. The intent was that if an applicant could pass a background check and pay a fee, he or she could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. Obama also reaffirmed that he’d have preferred Congress act on comprehensive immigration reform. Regardless, he said: "The actions I’m taking are not only lawful, they’re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half century." After Paxton made his 2017 claim, we searched for post-2014 instances of Obama saying he didn’t have the authority to impose the DAPA--and came up empty. Obama in May 2015 vowed to defend his authority to carry out DAPA. As reported by the Miami Herald, Obama said: "In the short term, if Mr. [Mitch] McConnell, the leader of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, want to have a vote on whether what I’m doing is legal or not, they can have that vote. I will veto that vote because I’m absolutely confident that what we’re doing is the right thing to do." A footnote in a legal brief filed by Texas and other states pointed us to Obama’s comment to reporters in June 2015, after a federal district judge held up DAPA, indicating the president believed he’d acted legally. Obama said then: "I am absolutely convinced this is well within my legal authority, Department of Homeland Security’s legal authority. If you look at the precedent, if you look at the traditional discretion that the executive branch possesses when it comes to applying immigration laws, I am convinced that what we’re doing is lawful, and our lawyers are convinced that what we’re doing is lawful." Obama’s pre-DAPA calls for congressional action Then again, Obama was previously clear about needing Congress to act first. The March 2015 legal brief filed by Texas and other states led us to a January 2015 article in the Texas Review of Law & Politics presenting many of the Obama quotations we’d confirmed for the McCaul and Abbott fact-checks. Here are a few of the times when Obama seemed to say that he lacked independent legal authority to act on immigration: In October 2010, Obama told Eddie "Piolin" Sotelo, a radio host on Spanish-speaking Univision, that he couldn’t achieve comprehensive immigration reform without congressional action. "I am president, I am not king," Obama said. "... I’m committed to making it happen, but I’ve got to have some partners to do it." At a Univision event in March 2011, Obama was asked if he could stop deportations of students with an order. That’s "just not the case," Obama said, "because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed... Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws." Simply issuing such an order, he said, "would not conform with my appropriate role as president." Yet he also hinted at wiggle room, saying: "That does not mean, though, that we can't make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity. In an April 2011 speech in Miami and the next month in El Paso, Obama said he couldn’t bypass Congress and change immigration laws himself, saying that’s not how a democracy works. Addressing the National Council of La Raza in July 2011, Obama drew exhortations to act without waiting for congressional agreement. He called that idea "tempting," then said "that's not how our system works." In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that "as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally," as in parents deported. At a presidential debate the next month, Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney were asked: "What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?" Obama said: "I've done everything that I can on my own." In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had aided law-abiding students. "I’m not a king," Obama replied, tracking his response the same month to a similar query from Univision and his reply at a February 2013 Google Hangout town hall where he also said "we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can." The same year, Obama was asked by Telemundo if he would consider freezing deportations of the parents of students benefiting from the administration’s 2012 action. Obama replied that if he broadened his protective orders, "then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option." We previously confirmed similar statements by Obama in a November 2013 speech in in San Francisco and a March 2014 Univision interview. Our ruling Paxton said Obama "acknowledged over 20 times" that his administration’s DAPA "immigration edict was a violation of law and the separation of powers." Paxton might have been trying to revisit mostly accurate earlier claims about what Obama once repeatedly said. But there are significant differences between the earlier statements and this one. Paxton specified that Obama was speaking about his DAPA policy; in fact, Obama’s statements were made long before DAPA was announced and were not about a specific policy initiative. Contrary to Paxton’s statement, Obama has always maintained the DAPA policy was legal. We find that Paxton’s statement has an element of truth but ignores the critical fact that Obama has stood by his DAPA policy since it was issued. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-07513	Abortion services are "well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/08/jon-kyl/jon-kyl-says-abortion-services-are-well-over-90-pe/	As the government inched toward a shutdown on April 8, 2011, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., gave a speech on the Senate floor to respond to Democratic charges that the major sticking point in the negotiations was a disagreement over Planned Parenthood. Many Republicans want to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the organization does abortions. The federal government currently provides Planned Parenthood with $363 million annually, but by law, that money cannot be spent on abortion. It is spent on other types of health care services, such as cancer screenings, breast exams, and tests and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Some opponents of abortion say that by sending any money to Planned Parenthood, taxpayers are still supporting abortions indirectly, since money is fungible. That’s why they’re pushing to eliminate all funding for the organization. Here’s a portion of what Kyl said on the floor: "Everybody goes to clinics, to hospitals, to doctors, and so on. Some people go to Planned Parenthood. But you don’t have to go to Planned Parenthood to get your cholesterol or your blood pressure checked. If you want an abortion, you go to Planned Parenthood, and that’s well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does." We got many requests to fact-check his statement. Planned Parenthood says the statistics are dramatically different -- that 90 percent of its services are preventive in nature, compared with 3 percent that are abortion-related. Planned Parenthood calculates the numbers by services provided, rather than dollars spent. In a fact sheet last updated in March 2011, the group lists the following breakdown of its services: Contraception (including reversible contraception, emergency contraception, vasectomies and tubal sterilizations): 4,009,549 services Sexually transmitted infections testing and treatment: 3,955,916 services Cancer screening and prevention: 1,830,811 services Other women’s health services (including pregnancy tests and prenatal care): 1,178,369 services Abortions: 332,278 procedures Miscellaneous (including primary care and adoption referrals): 76,977 Total services: 11,383,900 By this tally, abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures Planned Parenthood provided in 2009, which is the most recent year for which the group is reporting statistics. And that would make Kyl’s statement way off. We should note a few caveats. First, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of "services" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. Second, it’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith. Still, even with those caveats, we do think that Kyl has vastly overstated the share of abortions. We checked with Kyl’s office but did not hear back. However, a few hours after the speech, CNN anchor T.J. Holmes told viewers that the network had received a statement from Kyl’s office saying that the senator’s remark "was not intended to be a factual statement but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, an organization that receives millions in taxpayer dollars, does subsidize abortions." The statistics from Planned Parenthood and the statement from Kyl's office make it clear that he erred by saying abortion counts for well over 90 percent of the group's services. We find his claim False.	None	Jon Kyl	None	None	None	2011-04-08T18:18:07	2011-04-08	['None']
pomt-15322	"In New Orleans, nearly 100 percent of our kids are in charter schools."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/16/bobby-jindal/bobby-jindal-says-nearly-100-percent-new-orleans-s/	Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal appeared on Fox News Sunday July 12, 2015, to talk policy, taxes and Louisiana's success. He especially lauded the state’s advances in education. "In Louisiana, we privatized our state charity hospital system. We've got statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child instead of the child following the dollars. In New Orleans, nearly 100 percent of our kids are in charter schools. Doubling the number doing reading and math on grade level in five years." Not a lot of school districts across the nation can claim charter school attendance rates that are quite so high. Using data from the 2012-13 school year, 92 percent of school districts had less than half of their total students attending a charter school. Is New Orleans that different? According to data, the answer is yes. In 2012-2013, the New Orleans School District had 84.1% of all its students attending charter schools. In 2013-14 that number increased to 91 percent. New Orleans’ charter school rate is uncharacteristically high even compared to other Louisiana districts, as the following chart shows. Why do students overwhelmingly attend charter schools in New Orleans? The answer may have something to do with the sheer number of charter schools there. Of the 82 schools currently in the Orleans Parish, 76 are charter schools. Only 6 are non-charter public schools. Why so many? The history of charter schools in New Orleans tracks back to 1995. That year, Louisiana passed its first charter school law, which allowed up to eight volunteer districts to have charter schools established. In 1997, the law was changed so that any districts could volunteer, although "the number of charter schools statewide was capped at 42." In 1998, the first charter school opened in New Orleans. However, it would be almost a decade before charter schools became prevalent in there. The Louisiana Legislature established the Recovery School District in 2003. The RSD "is a special school district run by the Louisiana Department of Education that intervenes in the management of chronically low-performing schools." That year, "chronically low-performing schools" were defined as those that earned the "lowest performance label, Academically Unacceptable (AUS), for four consecutive years." That first year, 17 schools were identified for takeover. Sixteen of those schools were in New Orleans. After the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education gave the RSD the green light to take control of the schools, the RSD had the choice of either "directly operat(ing) the schools itself, or to contract with universities or non-profit organizations to operate them as charter schools." Laura Hawkins, the deputy chief of staff at RSD, said the RSD always had the goal of establishing charter schools, believing from the start that it was "the best strategy." Still, before 2005, there were only a handful of charter schools in New Orleans. "Charter schools were a nascent movement," said Hawkins. And then Hurricane Katrina came. Brian Beabout, a professor of educational leadership at the University of New Orleans, has studied education reform in post-Katrina New Orleans. "In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, (New Orleans) temporarily lost 100 percent of its students and did not reopen a single school for more than two months," Beabout wrote in a 2007 article. When the Orleans Parish School Board did reopen public schools in January 2006, those schools were reopened as charters. Why? "OPSB opted to open the schools as charter schools to take advantage of the U.S. schools," said a Cowen Institute report. "(The OPSB) had easy access to government money," said Hawkins. Part of the Katrina legacy After the hurricane, many in New Orleans realized they had the opportunity to start with a "clean educational slate" and restructure the school system. In response, the state Legislature introduced Act 35. "(This) amendment changed the focus from chronically failing individual schools and added a ‘district in academic crisis,’ " Beabout said. "(The amendment) was tailored specifically to wrest control of New Orleans public schools from the locally elected school board and put them in the hands of the RSD. They defined any district with a certain percent of failing schools as "in crisis" and took control of all schools in the district which performed below the state average. Initially, 114 schools were transferred over the RSD for control. The Cowen Institute reports that under Act 35, the RSD "was empowered to lease, rebuild, or renovate the school facilities as necessary for the successful operation of schools, but it could not sell any school buildings, as they still belonged to the OPSB." Because of the sudden increase of schools given to it for control, the RSD did not have enough approved charter organizations established. Because of this, the RSD took direct control of some schools as a school district. Over the years, as more charters were established, the number of schools run directly by the RSD decreased. In 2014, the RSD became a 100 percent charter school district. For the record, all of this largely played out before Jindal was elected governor in 2007. Our ruling Jindal said that "in New Orleans, nearly 100 percent of our kids are in charter schools." As of the 2013-14 school year, 91 percent of student in New Orleans go to charter schools. However, the high percentage is a reflection of the fact that the majority of schools in New Orleans are charter schools. Most of them were established after public schools within "in crisis" school districts (read New Orleans Public Schools) were handed over to the state-controlled RSD in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Over the years, these schools were converted to charter schools. Jindal’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.	None	Bobby Jindal	None	None	None	2015-07-16T11:08:54	2015-07-15	['New_Orleans']
pomt-12226	"America has more people employed as tax preparers (1.2 million) than as police and firefighters."	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/18/george-will/do-tax-preparers-outnumber-firefighters-and-police/	Newspaper columnist and TV pundit George Will says the current U.S. tax code takes more manpower to maneuver than firefighting and law enforcement combined. "The complexity of the code, which is about 4 million words, is why America has more people employed as tax preparers (1.2 million) than as police and firefighters," Will wrote in a July 12, 2017, column on tax reform. According to the National Taxpayer Advocate’s annual report to Congress this year, the 2016 tax code indeed came to roughly 4 million words. And even they agreed it’s convoluted. The tax code "rewards taxpayers who can afford expensive tax advice and discriminates against taxpayers who cannot," the report said. But are there more Americans employed as tax preparers than police and firefighters? After a reader asked us to look into it, we found it’s not the case. Will did not respond to our request for comment, but the number in the story linked to a U.S. News & World Report article from 2012, which we eventually traced back to an Internal Revenue Service report citing a 2007 statistic. The number given was that between 900,000 and 1.2 million people were "preparing tax returns for a fee." We asked the IRS for a more recent estimate. About 713,448 people had current preparer tax identification numbers, or PTINs, in 2017, the closest estimate to the number of people employed as tax preparers this year. This is an annually renewed credential that the IRS requires of every tax preparer, a prerequisite that wasn’t in place when the original estimate Will cited was created. The Labor Statistics Bureau found in May 2016 that 657,690 people are employed as police and sheriff's patrol officers. In turn, the BLS counted 315,910 firefighters. When we added the number of these civil officers together, they exceeded tax preparers by 260,152 people. The BLS had a much lower figure for people employed as tax preparers -- 70,030 people -- but these don’t include individuals who were self-employed or identified as attorneys, accountants or auditors, as the survey only allows people to identify one occupation. Will isn't the only person to make this mistake. A May 13, 2017, Economist article also included the outdated information. Our rating Will said that the number of tax preparers outnumbered the number of firefighters and police officers in the United States, but he was looking at outdated data. When we looked at the most recent statistics from the IRS and BLS, we found that the sum of firefighters and police officers outnumbers tax preparers. We rate this statement False.

pomt-03849	"Super Bowl L by everybody's estimation is a $500 million economic impact to the state of Florida."	/florida/statements/2013/mar/14/ron-book/dolphins-lobbyist-says-super-bowl-50-everybodys-es/	The Miami Dolphins are seeking tax break subsidies to help pay for a $400 million stadium renovation. Project supporters hope that such a massive investment will lead to more Super Bowls in the future. South Florida is competing with San Francisco to host the 50th anniversary Super Bowl in 2016. The NFL will announce the winner in May. Stadium supporters told a state Senate committee March 6 that the public will reap benefits from the big bucks that come from a Super Bowl. "A single Super Bowl generates over $300 million in economic benefits to South Florida and its businesses," said Sen. Oscar Braynon, a Democrat who represents Miami Gardens, where the Sun Life stadium is located. Long-time Dolphins lobbyist Ron Book upped the ante: "Super Bowl L by everybody's estimation is a $500 million economic impact to the state of Florida," Book said. That’s a pretty strong claim that "everybody" estimates a half-billion impact from a single Super Bowl. Is there widespread agreement on that number? The Dolphins are seeking about $200 million in public financing for about half the cost of a major stadium renovation. It would include state sales tax rebates and an increase in the Miami mainland hotel bed tax from 6 to 7 percent. County voters would have to approve the hotel bed tax increase. The bill has received favorable votes in committees but faces an uphill public relations battle: A recent poll showed 73 percent of county voters are against the financing plan. Legislators will make a decision based on the backdrop of another much criticized deal for a Miami team: In 2009, Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami partnered with the Marlins baseball team for a $634 million stadium/parking complex. Since opening in 2012, that stadium has had sluggish attendance and failed to revitalize the neighborhood. And it had political consequences: It helped lead to the recall of Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez. Book points to study by host committee Book pointed us to a study -- commissioned by the Super Bowl Host Committee -- about the 2007 Super Bowl in South Florida done by Sports Management Research Institute, whose clients include the NFL and other major sports entities. Total economic impact to South Florida: $463 million. "I cannot share all of the information that we have as to the NFL’s plans for Super Bowl L," Book wrote in an email to PolitiFact Florida. "You must just accept that everybody in the country that wanted the opportunity to bid for Super Bowl L believes it’s a $500 million-plus economic impact to host that game." The 2007 Super Bowl drew about 75,000 visitors to watch the Indianapolis Colts defeat the Chicago Bears 29-17. The study Book cited examined spending on hotels, restaurants, transportation, entertainment, retail and other services during the game day and associated events. Researchers collected data from about 3,000 visitors at airports and a half-dozen hotels -- including some lavish spots such as The Breakers in Palm Beach County. Researchers also examined other economic impact studies, hotel occupancy, surveyed businesses and other information. The study concluded that direct economic impact from spending was about $298 million. Then it added in the spending to prepare for the Super Bowl and the induced spending from new money flowing through the area, and the total came to $463 million. The biggest winner was Miami-Dade County, followed by Broward, and then neighboring Palm Beach and Monroe counties. The study did not subtract out the normal tourist spending that would have happened during the period without a Super Bowl. "We track whatever was spent by the Super Bowl fan. Period," Kathleen Davis, president of the firm that did the study, told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. Davis has also taught sports management at multiple universities -- and she has been to 11 Super Bowls. While South Florida is already a tourist mecca in the winter even without a Super Bowl, these visitors were richer -- with an average household income of about $220,000 a year -- and spent more, the study concluded. Attendees spent more than four times the typical Broward County visitor and nearly three times that of a Miami-Dade visitor. They stayed an average of five nights and spent about $668 per day. The same firm did a study of the 2010 Super Bowl in South Florida and concluded it was $333 million amid the economic downturn. Experts say studies inflate benefits of Super Bowl There is no dispute that a Super Bowl in South Florida draws some high-rollers who rent limos, wine and dine at our best restaurants and clubs, hit the shops at tony malls and book luxurious hotel suites in South Beach, Coral Gables, Fort Lauderdale and other cities. Businesses that cater to these tourists can rake in some hefty profits. "The Super Bowl is a magic event," said Broward tourism chief Nicki Grossman, who says direct spending for the 2007 Super Bowl was about $65 million in Broward County. Super Bowl visitors "buy things normally any other traveler wouldn’t. Some spend more to say they spend more." Studies by the National Football League or the host committee often peg the impact anywhere between $300 million and $600 million, depending on the analysis. A study about the 2008 Arizona Super Bowl -- coordinated in part by a business professor who served on the Host Committee -- concluded a $500 million impact. A study examining the 2009 Super Bowl in Tampa said it resulted in spending totaling $375 million. We didn’t find a study predicting the economic impact of the 2016 Super Bowl in South Florida -- the 2007 study doesn’t actually predict the impact for 2016. (Economists often look at the impact after the event.) But many independent economists say the benefit is much lower than boosters’ totals. These economists share a joke: take the boosters’ estimates and move the decimal place one point to the left. Economists say boosters dangle the enormous revenue figures as politicians are weighing whether to support public funding. Holy Cross Economics Professor Victor Matheson, together with Professor Robert Baade, wrote in a 2004 paper that for Super Bowls held between 1970 and 2001, the host city experienced an average increase in personal income of about $92 million and that the game could not have contributed more than $300 million. In today’s numbers, the $92 million means $120 million and the $300 million would equal just under $400 million, Matheson told PolitiFact Florida. "Not only is our best guess a fraction of the boosters' estimates, but we are also quite certain that any estimate over $300 million is flat-out wrong," he said. We asked Matheson if Miami would warrant going with the higher figure rather than the average. "Miami might be slightly better off than some other cities since it has more hotel rooms than most other Super Bowl host cities allowing for more visitors before capacity constraints are hit," Matheson wrote in an email. "On the other hand, as a big warm weather destination, it has rather large numbers of tourists anyway during late January, early February that will be crowded out by Super Bowl fans. Overall, I would expect the economic impact in Miami to be typical of the average host city." Studies by boosters often take the number of attendees and multiply that by expenditures to arrive at a gross direct spending total. Then they use a multiplier to calculate an indirect effect of those initial expenditures circulating around the economy. Matheson told us, "Economic consultants seem to be pretty good at adding and multiplying, but not so good at subtracting." Economists say boosters ignore some factors that affect the bottom line, which they call the substitution effect, the crowding out effect, and leakages. Substitution is when someone spends money on the Super Bowl that they would have spent elsewhere in the economy. Since an event such as the Super Bowl draws so many out-of-town visitors, the substitution effect is far less than from a regular game. Crowding refers to other visitors deciding to stay away from the area to avoid the congestion, resulting in the loss of spending from those folks. That means if hotels are largely full anyway, economists focus on the net effect from the increased bookings (and inflated costs) -- not the total revenues of hotels. (During the 2007 Super Bowl, attendance at Monkey Jungle, a south Miami-Dade tourist attraction, plummeted.) And leakages occur when money spent on chain hotels and restaurants leak back to corporate headquarters -- not the local economy. "The local employees changing sheets or running room service, they don’t get 10 times their wage that week," said Professor Craig Depken, an economist at the University of North Carolina. Some economic models used to calculate economic benefits do account for leakage. But Matheson wrote that those models calculate leakage based "on the normal inter-industry relationships that exist in local economies, and during a mega-event these relationships may be anything but normal." PricewaterhouseCoopers has estimated the economic impact of multiple Super Bowls. According to its analysis, direct visitor spending has ranged from a low of close to $120 million in Detroit in 2006, to high of about $200 million in Dallas/Fort Worth in 2011. The firm (which wasn’t paid by the Host Committee) projected $185 million in economic impact for the New Orleans Super Bowl held earlier this year. Dolphins spokesman Eric Jotkoff said that Book took the $463 million in the 2007 study and cited a $500 million in 2016 as a result of inflation and increased spending because "Super Bowl L promises to be the biggest Super Bowl in the game’s history." Our ruling Lobbyist Ron Book said "Super Bowl L by everybody's estimation is a $500 million economic impact to the state of Florida." First, Book uses numbers from a study commissioned by the Host Committee. The numbers take a broad measure of all spending that went on during a Super Bowl week in 2007, without accounting for usual economic activity. In fact, it’s among the highest estimates we reviewed for economic activity generated by a Super Bowl. But the main problem with Book’s claim is that "everybody" agrees on that number. Economics professors argue that studies by boosters routinely inflate costs and fail to take into account net costs or fully account for the fact that some spending locally is sent to corporate chains. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/997c16ae-1610-4f19-8604-b63254dee497	None	Ron Book	None	None	None	2013-03-14T13:09:43	2013-03-06	['None']
pomt-14682	"We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-us-has-lowest-percentage-americans-w/	During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took aim at the nation’s economic record under President Barack Obama. "The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama," Cruz said. "But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country." We decided to fact-check Cruz’s statement that we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today since 1977. Cruz is on to something. One key employment statistic known as the civilian labor force participation rate is at its lowest level since the 1970s. This statistic takes the number of Americans in the labor force -- basically, those who are either employed or who are seeking employment and divides it by the total civilian population. Here’s a chart going back to the mid 1970s. When the civilian labor force participation rate is low, it’s a concern, because it means there are fewer working Americans to support non-working Americans. But we’ll offer two asterisks for Cruz’s statement. First, as we’ve noted before, a notable factor in the decline of the labor-force participation rate is the aging of the Baby Boom generation. As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. When we last looked at this question in 2013, Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, told us he had estimated that the labor-force participation rate would have fallen in recent years on the basis of aging alone. That said, Cruz has a point that the recession exacerbated that decline. In a weak job market, some people who might otherwise want a job may return to school, become full-time parents or retire early. Second, there’s another way to read Cruz’s words. He said "the lowest percentage of Americans working" since 1977, which could also refer to a different statistic, the employment-population ratio. This statistic takes the number of people who are employed and divides it by the civilian population age 16 and above. The difference in this case is that using the employment-population ratio, Cruz’s statement is incorrect. Unlike the labor-force participation rate, the employment-population ratio has actually been improving in recent years, although it’s below its pre-recession highs. Here’s a chart showing this statistic over the same time frame: If you exclude the Great Recession, the employment-population ratio was last at its current rate in 1984, not 1977. So by that measurement, he’s close. Our ruling Cruz said, "We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977." He’s put his finger on a trend that worries economists of all stripes, but his wording was sloppy. In addition, it’s worth remembering that this particular trend is being driven at least to a degree by demographic trends beyond the control of any president. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02232	A recent Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans and 56 percent of Democrats "say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/16/marsha-blackburn/gop-rep-marsha-blackburn-says-56-percent-democrats/	Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., isn’t as well known nationally as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, or Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. -- two lawmakers who are weighing presidential bids in 2016. But like Cruz and Paul, Blackburn recently trekked to Manchester, N.H., to address the New Hampshire Freedom Summit, a gathering sponsored by the conservative groups Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United. In her speech on April 12, 2014, Blackburn -- like many of her fellow speakers -- took aim at the government and earned applause from the staunch conservatives in the audience. "Gallup did a survey recently," she said, "and what they found was that 72 percent of all Americans say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government. That is amazing. Now, the really fascinating part of this is 56 percent of all Democrats say the biggest threat to our nation is big government. Now I’ve got to tell you something -- when the Democrats say the government is too big, we all know the government is too big." We wondered whether it was true that Gallup found that 72 percent of Americans, and 56 percent of Democrats, "say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government." We didn’t hear back from Blackburn’s office, but we quickly found the study she was referring to. It was a poll taken in early December 2013, which we think qualifies as "recent." It has a sampling error of 4 percentage points. The survey asked the Gallup question that’s been asked with identical wording since 1965: "Which of the following will be the biggest threat to the country in the future -- big business, big labor or big government?" Gallup reported that 72 percent of all respondents said "big government," calling it "a record high in the nearly 50-year history of this question. The prior high for big government was 65 percent in 1999 and 2000. Big government has always topped big business and big labor, including in the initial asking in 1965, but just 35 percent named it at that time." In the December 2013 version of the poll question, Blackburn’s percentages were on target. Here’s the breakdown by party: Party of survey respondent Big government is biggest threat Big business is biggest threat Big labor is biggest threat Republican 92 percent 4 percent 3 percent Independent 71 percent 20 percent 5 percent Democratic 56 percent 36 percent 6 percent All respondents 72 percent 21 percent 5 percent Gallup said it expects the results to continue to fluctuate as it asks the question periodically, since both parties tend to be more suspicious of government whenever the opposite party controls the White House. In general, though, Republicans have long been more wary of big government, the data shows. Democratic concern about big government maxed out at 62 percent in 2005, during George W. Bush’s presidency -- a high level, but much lower than the GOP’s current 92 percent rate. But what about Blackburn’s talking point? Gallup’s question gave respondents one of three choices -- big government, big business and big labor. Blackburn didn’t mention that framing, and that’s an important distinction to make. We think most listeners, when hearing someone cite results of a poll about "the biggest threat to our nation's security" and "the biggest threat to our nation," would assume that respondents were choosing from a larger universe of possible threats. Yet the way the question was worded prevented respondents from considering any number of possible threats to the nation’s security, ranging from radical Islamism to climate change to a weak economy. Pollster.com co-founder Charles Franklin, a professor of law and public policy and director of the Marquette Law School Poll, agrees that there’s a disconnect between the poll question Gallup asked and the way Blackburn framed it. "The Gallup question is not specific as to the nature of the possible threat, and seems to imply one of these three should be selected," he said. "The reason for the threat, or its nature, would almost certainly vary across partisans and lead to very different conclusions as to what should be done." For instance, a CBS News poll taken in March 2014 asked, "What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?" It left the question open-ended for the respondent to answer. The economy and jobs finished first with 30 percent, followed by health care with 7 percent, the budget with 5 percent, "President Obama" with 4 percent, and four topics with 3 percent -- immigration, education, "miscellaneous government issues" and religious values. No fewer than 37 percent split their answers among other topics in segments smaller than 3 percent. The economy topped the list in several other versions of the CBS News question asked over the previous year. And Gallup itself has asked a similar open-ended question as well, most recently in June 2013. The question was, "Looking ahead, what is your greatest worry or concern about the future of the United States?" The economy finished first with 17 percent, followed by "the debt/deficit/nation’s finances" with 11 percent, "employment/jobs" with 11 percent, and "wars/conflicts in other countries" with 5 percent. The closest category to "big government" in this poll was "government not working for the betterment of the people," with 4 percent, and government "overreach/power" with 3 percent. Combined, these two categories drew a distinct minority of respondents -- 7 percent, a far cry from the 72 percent "consensus" found in the more limited-question poll Blackburn cited. Our ruling Blackburn said a recent Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans and 56 percent of Democrats "say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government." She got the numbers right, but the specific poll only offered respondents three options: "big government," "big business" or "big labor." Her phrasing gives the misleading impression that there is wide consensus -- even among Democrats -- that "big government" is the biggest threat to the nation’s security. Other polls, including Gallup’s own, show that when respondents are asked an open-ended question, other issues such as the economy rise to the top of the list. So Blackburn is essentially cherry-picking among polls. Blackburn’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-11883	"To be clear, all my investments are in a trust that I don’t control."	/illinois/statements/2017/oct/27/bruce-rauner/rauners-blind-trust-procedures-dont-excuse-lawsuit/	A lawsuit filed Oct. 5 against Gov. Bruce Rauner by a former business associate has piqued the interest of those who follow Illinois politics. But the substance of the suit remains unknown because, in a highly unusual move, the complaint and three exhibits in the case filed in Cook County Circuit Court are sealed. The plaintiff’s attorney says he wants the records made public and says they’re under wraps at Rauner’s request. When asked about the lawsuit after a public appearance on Oct. 20, Rauner said he knew nothing about it. "To be clear, all my investments are in a trust that I don’t control. I did that when I became governor," Rauner said. "I can’t comment on any business disputes. That gets settled in its own process." This lawsuit is likely to draw more interest as it plays out, which makes this a good time to look into Rauner’s claim that he has no control over the business interests that predate his term as governor. Big business Rauner’s vast wealth had been a point of contention in his 2014 campaign against incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn, who consistently tried to portray Rauner as economically out of touch with the vast majority of voters. After winning the election, Rauner sought to allay concerns that his extensive business portfolio -- which would generate $279 million in income in his first two years in office -- would make him vulnerable to conflicts of interest as governor. So shortly before his inauguration on Jan. 12, 2015, Rauner announced he was turning over control of his financial affairs to New York-based Roundtable Investment Partners and released a document detailing the "blind trust commitments" by which he would abide. "To avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest, I am designating an investment adviser under a power of attorney and establishing specific blind trust procedures during my service as governor to eliminate my day-to-day involvement in any company or issuer in which I hold any security interest or investment," Rauner said in the document. "At all times during my service as governor, any information regarding the business and affairs of the issuer, including information on the financial performance of the issuer, or otherwise related to my status as a security holder in the Issuer, will go to the investment adviser and not to me." But while Rauner invoked "blind trust procedures" in his explanation, the business arrangement he entered into was a power of attorney, not a blind trust. The Chicago Tribune explained the difference in an article that appeared shortly before Rauner’s inauguration: What Rauner did instead (of creating a blind trust) was create a different, less rigorous structure known as a power of attorney that granted management authority over much of his wealth to a New York investment adviser…. If Rauner had set up an actual blind trust, he would have had to transfer to it ownership of most of his wealth. Rauner would still have been the beneficiary of the trust, but he would have relinquished control over his assets to an independent trustee pledged to keep the governor in the dark about transactions. Rauner’s press secretary, Patty Schuh, said Rauner was speaking colloquially when he spoke of a "trust" rather than a "power of attorney" in his statement about the lawsuit. Even if Rauner had wanted to created a blind trust, however, a quirk in Illinois ethics law would have prevented it. Legally blind Under Illinois law, state officeholders are required to file annual statements of economic interest in which they must list all their business interests in the state. In a blind trust like those used by federal officials, an officeholder turns over ownership of financial interests to a trustee who is prohibited from communicating with the official on investment matters. Such a setup would prevent Rauner from fulfilling the state economic disclosure requirements. Rauner’s then-press secretary Lance Trover explained the compromise arrangement to the Tribune: "This is the strongest possible structure that both established blind trust procedures and allows the Rauners to fully comply with the state's economic disclosure laws moving forward," said Trover, who noted that blind trusts can be used to shield a politician's assets from public view. "Doing this ensures to the people of Illinois that Gov. Rauner will not try to hide his financial assets behind a blind trust." The reporting aspect of Rauner’s setup is a key distinction between it and a blind trust. Because Illinois requires that he submit an annual summary of his economic interests, Rauner can’t legally blind himself to knowledge of his investments as would be required in a blind trust. "If you still have to report it, it does defeat the purpose of a blind trust," said Larry Noble, senior director and general counsel of The Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C., campaign ethics watchdog group. Noble believes voters would be better served if Illinois law didn’t favor mandatory disclosure over true blind trusts. "If you know what assets are in there, even though you’re not calling the shots you still have a conflict," Noble said. There are two other significant differences between Rauner’s arrangement and a blind trust as defined by federal law. In a blind trust, there can be no relationship between the officeholder and the trustee. Rauner is an investor in Roundtable and its CEO, Geoffrey Boisi, donated $50,300 to Rauner’s 2014 campaign. Even though Rauner has pledged to leave all business activities to Roundtable, his pledge is not legally binding. There is no legal prohibition on his communicating with or receiving reports from Roundtable, and he retains the right to make investment decisions if he so chooses. That could be significant in relation to the current court case, Noble said, because it gives Rauner a convenient way to quickly dispel any controversy that develops over the alleged secrecy. "He could say, ‘In the interest of disclosure I authorize my trustee to make it public,’ " Noble said. Our ruling Rauner said, "To be clear, all my investments are in a trust that I don’t control." He was not being clear when he said his investments were held in trust. A quirk in Illinois ethics law means candidates can’t establish blind trusts like those used by federal officials, so Rauner’s investments are handled through a power of attorney granted to Roundtable Investment Partners. It’s not technically a "trust," as Rauner called it, but if he is following his "blind trust commitments" pledge, the power of attorney arrangement appears to come as close as Illinois law permits. The power of attorney system he established doesn’t legally prohibit him from contact with Roundtable, however, so he’ll have a hard time hiding behind it if pressure mounts to make the substance of this month’s lawsuit public. Rauner’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out some important details. We find it Half True.

pomt-14577	"Ted Cruz defended a Chinese company that stole an invention from an American inventor."	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/07/marco-rubio/rubio-attacks-cruz-role-lawsuit-defending-chinese-/	Getting tough on China has been a recurring theme among the candidates running for president in 2016 In Bow, N.H. last week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said one his GOP rivals isn’t telling the whole truth about his record standing up for American firms against the Chinese. "Ted Cruz was counsel on record for a Chinese company that stole an invention from an American inventor in Florida," Rubio said. "Here you have someone who goes around talking tough about China, but he leaves out the fact that when China stole an American inventor’s product, he stood with the Chinese." "That is a fact," Rubio said. We decided to check it out. The case The case in question involved a man named Jordan Fishman, the CEO of Alpha Mining Systems, a Florida-based specialty tire company. In 2009, he sued a Chinese tire manufacturer, Shandong Linglong Rubber Co., in U.S. District Court, in Virginia, accusing them of stealing blueprints and violating his copyright. His company was manufacturing tires in China when he said an employee conspired with Shandong Linglong, "to steal our copyrighted blueprints and make low-quality knock-off tires," Fishman wrote in an Op-ed published in the Concord Monitor. Fishman won the suit and was awarded $26 million in damages in 2010, according to federal court records. But the Chinese company appealed and hired the Washington D.C. law firm Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, where Cruz was a partner. Lawyers argued the court erred in its original verdict because the Copyright Act could not be used to enforce damages against a foreign company when no violation occurred within the United States. Federal court records list R. Ted Cruz as one of the lawyers representing the Chinese firm. The court rejected the appeal and affirmed the decision in June 2012 to award Fishman $26 million in damages. But collecting the money proved difficult. In October 2012, federal marshals seized Shandong Linglong property in an attempt to enforce the court order, according to industry news reports. The claim We reached out to Rubio’s campaign, which provided links to several news articles about the case and Cruz’s involvement. The case gained political attention in 2012, when Cruz was running for U.S. Senate against David Dewhurst. PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim that Cruz represented a Chinese company "found guilty of stealing blueprints from an American manufacturer." That claim was rated Mostly True. This isn’t the first time Rubio has made such an accusation during his presidential campaign, and Cruz has defended himself calling it a "bogus attack." We reached out to Cruz’s campaign, which said Cruz’s involvement in the case was minimal. "When Cruz worked for Morgan Lewis, the law firm represented a Chinese tire company, he had nothing to do with the trial," said Rick Tyler, Cruz’s Communications Director. "He helped edit briefs, but did not argue the appeal." Our ruling Marco Rubio said "Ted Cruz defended a Chinese company that stole an invention from an American inventor." Cruz’s firm represented a Chinese firm found liable for stealing blueprints. While other lawyers argued the appeal, Cruz’s name appears as one of the lawyers representing the Shandong Linglong Rubber Co. against an American company. Cruz and his firm were not involved with the original case, just the appeal. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-02640	"Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/17/lisa-bloom/americans-are-20-times-likely-die-gun-violence-cit/	As shootings at a Florida theater and a New Mexico school rocked the news this week, CNN host Piers Morgan greeted viewers Tuesday with alarming stats about gun violence. Then one of Morgan’s guests jumped in with numbers of her own. After questioning the sheriff investigating the theater killing, Morgan turned to Lisa Bloom, a lawyer and author of Swagger: 10 Urgent Rules for Raising Boys in an Era of Failing Schools, Mass Joblessness, and Thug Culture. "Let me give you another number: 20," Bloom said. "Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries. Why? Because other civilized countries rein in guns." We can’t quantify whether gun policies are preventing gun violence, as Bloom said, but we can look at her claim that "Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries." First of all, it’s not typical to refer to peers of the United States as "civilized countries." More often, they are grouped as "developed," "advanced industrial" or "high-income countries," many being in Western Europe. When we asked Bloom what she meant, she directed us to a Washington Post infographic comparing gun-related murders per capita for the United States and the nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The global consortium of 34 countries includes Western Europe, Turkey, Israel, Chile, Japan and South Korea. Mexico is also in the group, but the Post did not include it because its murder rate is exceptionally high amid a drug war. (The OECD considers all but Mexico, Chile and Turkey as "advanced" countries. Those three are "emerging.") The United States is tops -- way tops -- for gun deaths, with a 2010 rate of 3.2 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 population, according to statistics collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Chile was second at 2.2, followed by Turkey and Switzerland, tied for third at 0.8. The rest of the countries fell below 1, if they made the map at all. The U.S. rate is more than 20 times the rate of Australia, France, the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), Israel, South Korea, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. The U.S. rate firearm-related deaths is closer to 10 or 16 times the rates of countries such as Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain. (Country to country comparisons are slightly imperfect due to the variance in how data is reported. For example, the rate for Turkey and Switzerland is based on each country’s most recently reported year, which is 2006 and 2004, respectively. You can see more on this Google spreadsheet we compiled using U.N. data for firearm death rates from 2004 to 2010.) Post foreign affairs blogger Max Fisher concluded, "The U.S. gun murder rate is about 20 times the average for all other countries on this chart. That means that Americans are 20 times as likely to be killed by a gun than is someone from another developed country." A related fact-check from PolitiFact examined a 2011 study by researchers of the Harvard School of Public Health and UCLA School of Public Health. Their findings, while based on data for 23 high-income, populous countries from the World Health Organization now almost a decade old (2003), mirror more recent trends. The United States, they found, has more firearms per capita, the most permissive gun control laws and a disproportionate amount of firearm-related deaths from homicides, suicides and accidents. "The United States had a homicide rate 6.9 times higher than those in the other high-income countries, driven by a ﬁrearm homicide rate that was 19.5 times higher than those in the other high-income countries," the report says. "For 15 year olds to 24 year olds, the ﬁrearm homicide rate in the United States was 42.7 times higher than in the other countries." Bloom said her particular statistic is widely reported, and she will include more stats on gun deaths in her upcoming book, Suspicion Nation. "No matter how you analyze the data, the numbers are deeply disturbing," she said. Our ruling Bloom said, "Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries." Her phrasing is imperfect ("civilized" countries versus "developed"), and depending on what countries you count you can reach a slightly different figure. But Bloom’s point is well-sourced and largely accurate. The United States has a much higher rate of the world’s most developed countries. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-11764	"Simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime"	/new-york/statements/2017/dec/01/kathy-sheehan/being-undocumented-immigrant-us-not-crime/	Albany Mayor Kathy M. Sheehan said in a national television interview that it’s not a crime for immigrants to live in the U.S. without documentation. Sheehan, a Democrat, was defending her city’s status as a so-called "sanctuary city" to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The city's law enforcement officials do not report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities unless they commit a serious crime. "Simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime," Sheehan said. "The U.S. Supreme Court has said that." Carlson was left baffled. "You just said that being here illegally is not illegal? I’m not aware of that Supreme Court decision," Carlson said. "How is that true?" Sheehan cited a court ruling. "In Arizona v. the United States, the Supreme Court said simply being here undocumented is not a crime," she said. "There are civil violations and then there are criminal violations." So, who’s right? Sheehan or Carlson? What’s Sheehan talking about? The Supreme Court case Sheehan cited involved a 2010 challenge to an Arizona immigration law from the Obama administration. The law required that immigrants carry documents proving their status in Arizona. Police were also instructed to stop and seek documents from anyone they suspected of being undocumented. Those without documents faced a state criminal charge. The Obama administration contended Arizona could not create a state level criminal charge for the violation because it’s already regulated by Congress. The Supreme Court agreed with the Obama administration and struck down that section of the Arizona law, among other parts. Civil or criminal Experts supported Sheehan’s claim by pointing out how the U.S. legal system works. People who break the law in the U.S. have committed either a criminal or civil violation depending on how the law defines it and how prosecutors choose to proceed. Being in the U.S. without documentation is considered a civil matter, said Nancy Morawetz, professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law. "Being present in the U.S., that status, is not a crime," Morawetz said. That doesn’t mean undocumented immigrants can live in the U.S. without consequence, said Rick Su, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law. Federal authorities can deport them. A criminal violation comes with a punishment, like time in prison. Civil cases come with penalties instead. Deportation is considered a penalty under federal law, not a punishment. "Congress can decide what they want to make a crime and what they want to make a civil violation," Su said. "What they’ve decided is that immigration violations by themselves are civil violations." The Supreme Court confirmed that decision in Arizona v. United States. "What the Supreme Court said in Arizona v. U.S. is that generally being unlawfully present in the U.S. is not a crime, and that’s definitely true," Su said. "What the court did, is say Congress had made these civil violations and Arizona is trying to make them criminal violations." Why a civil matter? It’s easier to deport undocumented immigrants through civil proceedings, Su said. In deportation proceedings, immigrants face a special immigrant judge. The government does not have to provide a public attorney to immigrants who cannot afford one in these cases. The burden is then entirely on the immigrant to show they are in the country lawfully. They are also not entitled to any kind of due process. There are some immigration laws that can land an immigrant in criminal court. Entering the U.S. illegally is a crime, for example, but staying after a temporary visa has expired is a civil violation. As much as two-thirds of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. entered legally with a visa, according to the Center for Migration Studies. Our ruling Sheehan said "simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime." It may be semantics, but Sheehan is right. Living in the U.S. without documentation is a civil violation, not a crime. PolitiFact Florida rated a similar claim Mostly True earlier this year. As its fact check noted, however, those in the U.S. without documentation may have committed a crime by entering the country illegally. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally opposes loosening immigration laws, told PolitiFact Florida that "it's easy for such individuals to run into separate criminal problems even beyond their method of entry, such as filling out an employment eligibility form to get a job when they aren’t eligible to work." But their illegal presence is not a crime. Sheehan's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15250	Since parole abolition, Virginia's "crime rate has fallen to third lowest in the country, our recidivism rate is down 20 percent and that’s the second lowest in the country."	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/03/mark-obenshain/obenshain-says-virginias-crime-and-recidivism-rate/	Republicans are denouncing Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s efforts to study whether Virginia’s no parole policies, in effect since 1995, should be eased. Among the most vocal critics is state Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, who ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in 2013. Here’s what he said during a July 21 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond. "We’ve been studying this for the past 20 years and we’ve got great experience and shown that this whole truth-in-sentencing movement actually works, and what the governor is doing is messing with success. Our crime rate has dropped to, what, third lowest in the country; our recidivism rate is down by 20 percent, and that’s the second lowest in the country. The governor just doesn’t need to do this." Virginia’s no-parole policy -- a legacy of former Gov. George Allen, a Republican who served from 1994 to 1998 -- requires that criminals serve at least 85 percent of their prison sentences. McAuliffe, a Democrat, says he’s not talking about easing the program for violent offenders. But the governor has appointed a bipartisan commission to explore whether there are better ways to handle thousands of non-violent inmates, particularly drug offenders. The governor’s action is sure to be an issue this fall when all General Assembly seats are up for election. So we decided to see whether Obenshain’s statistics on the drop in crime and recidivism rates since the advent of no-parole hold up. Crime rates Obenshain said his information that Virginia has the third lowest crime rate came from a staff briefing on parole reform given to the Senate Finance Committee last November. The PowerPoint presentation cited statistics from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report dating back to 1994 -- the year before no-parole went into effect. One slide said Virginia had the third lowest violent crime rate in 2013 -- the most current year available -- and called it a "significant improvement" from 1994, when the state ranked 14th. We verified those rankings through the FBI reports. The ranking, however, needs some context. Violent crime has been has been waning throughout the U.S. in recent decades. Nationally, 714 people out of every 100,000 were violent crime victims in 1994; that dropped 368 in 2013, a 48.4 percent decrease. In Virginia, 358 people per 100,000 were victims in 1994. That dropped to 188 in 2013, a 47.4 percent decrease. In other words, Virginia’s decline in violent crime rates is consistent with national trends. The Powerpoint slide that Obenshain cites does not connect Virginia’s decrease to no-parole. To the contrary, it contains this caveat: "There are many factors involved in the national drop in crime rates over the last two decades, many of which are not unique to Virginia." The FBI also compiles property crime rates. Virginia has also seen a decline in this category that is consistent with U.S. trends. Nationally, 4,660 people out of every 100,000 were property crime victims in 1994. That fell to 2,732 in 2013, a 41.4 percent decrease. In Virginia, 3,690 per 100,000 were victims in 1994, and that dropped to 2,066 in 2013, a 44 percent decline. Recidivism rates Obenshain also cited the Finance Committee briefing last November as his source for claiming that Virginia’s recidivism rate has dropped by 20 percent and is the second lowest in the nation. A slide in the presentation said, "Virginia’s rate has dropped from 28 percent for offenders released in (fiscal year) 2004 to 22.9 percent for those released in (fiscal) 2009. Virginia has the second lowest recidivism rate among the states that have a comparable measure. Virginia had the eighth lowest recidivism rate for offenders released in 2004." The figures come from the Virginia Department of Corrections. You may have noticed that the drop between the years Obenshain cites is 5.1 percentage points. But you have to pay close attention to language. The decrease from 28 to 22.9 is an 18.2 percent drop, which the senator rounds to 20 percent. Virginia’s computes its recidivism rate by calculating the percentage of of inmates who are returned to prison for committing new crimes within three years of their original release. DOC records show the rate was 25.4 percent for prisoners released in 1992 -- three years before no parole began. So the decrease in the rate since the advent of the policy is about 10 percent -- or half the figure Obenshain offered. Now, let’s discuss Virginia’s national ranking. The DOC has distributed a chart showing that Virginia’s 22.9 percent for prisoners released in 2009 was the second lowest in the nation. There are no national standards for computing recidivism rates. DOC uses the three-year recidivism rates other states publish. Tama Celi, statistical analysis and forecast unit manager for DOC, the Virginia Department of Corrections, said the footnoted chart does not offer an apples-to-apples comparison. The years for each state’s recidivism rate vary, she said, and different states have different criminal laws defining thresholds for violations. "The states are measuring their own criminal justice systems and laws," she said. Two experts on recidivism told us comparing state numbers has little value. They noted that states have different ways of defining three-year recidivists. Some like Virginia, with lower rates, require a high standard of a former inmate being sent back to prison. Others, with higher rates, require lower standards for recidivism such as being convicted or arrested for a crime. "You want to believe these crime statistics are solid, but they really don’t tell you much," said Danielle Rudes, a professor of criminology at George Mason University. "To me, they don’t offer any evidence that Virginia’s abandonment of discretionary release has been successful. They don’t offer any evidence to the contrary, either." Adam Gelb, director of the Public Safety Performance Project and The Pew Charitable Trusts, agreed. "On the surface, it seems like recidivism rates are a straightforward issue but, in reality, it’s fraught with complexity," he said. Gelb directed a Pew effort several years ago to equate all state recidivism rates by a standard formula. The study found that Virginia had a 28.3 percent, three-year recidivism rate for prisoners released in 2003. That ranked fifth among the 41 states that cooperated. The study broke down recidivists into two categories -- those who returned to jail for committing new crimes and those who went back for violations such as breaking parole or probation conditions. Virginia’s recidivism rate for new crimes was 23 percent, which ranked 28th among 41 states. Its recidivism rate for technical reasons was 5 percent -- the fifth lowest among the states. Our ruling Obenshain says that since parole abolition, "Our crime rate has fallen to third lowest in the country, our recidivism rate is down 20 percent and that’s the second lowest in the country.’ Virginia’s violent crime rate did drop to the nation’s third lowest in 2013. The recidivism rate is a stickier issue. It fell by 10 percent over the last 20 years -- half of what Obenshain said. And the No. 2 national ranking, released by Virginia’s DOC, is fraught problems because different states compute their recidivism rates in vastly different ways.

"Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt,’ " read the headline on a story we first saw Oct. 30, 2017, on SnapUSANews.com. Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news. We also saw the same post dated Oct. 29 or later on several other websites. The story claimed that Freeman made the statements during a promotional appearance in New York for the National Geographic series The Story of Us. "Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President (Donald) Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America," the fake story quoted Freeman. Freeman also allegedly said in a profane rant that President Donald Trump was elected to imprison Clinton. Until she is punished, Freeman said, "everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us." The fake story rightly points out that Freeman made a video suggesting how Trump should have handled allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. The Story Of Us is a miniseries featuring Freeman traveling the world to interact with different cultures, and premiered on Oct. 11. But the rest of this story is fiction. The 80-year-old actor has been an ardent Clinton supporter, narrating political advertisements and a biographical video about the former secretary of state for the Democratic National Committee during her campaign. The post appeared Oct. 29 on the fake news site YourNewsWire.com, under the byline of Baxter Dmitry. YourNewsWire.com has spread fake stories putting words in the mouths of famous people before, such as when they wrongly posted that Vladimir Putin had said Pope Francis was "not a man of God." As in that case, there’s no proof that Freeman made any of the comments about jailing Clinton. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-00780	"Debt doubled" under Bush "and now it’s tripling under Barack Obama’s watch."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-debt-has-tripled-bush-took-office/	Both Republicans and Democrats share the blame for America’s increasing debt, said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., in a speech announcing his presidential campaign April 7. "Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration," Paul said. "And it’s now tripling under Barack Obama’s watch." Quite a few readers asked us if the debt has tripled since Obama took office in January 2009. We took a look at the numbers, and it hasn’t. It's increased about 1.7 times. However, Paul’s office said this isn’t the proper interpretation. Looking at the whole statement -- not just the second clause -- Paul wasn’t saying the debt has tripled under Obama alone. Instead, he was saying that it doubled under President George W. Bush. And since Obama took office, it has risen to a point that is triple what it was when Bush first took office. By this measure, Paul’s statement is closer to accurate. Let’s go through the numbers. Paul’s interpretation We used the Treasury Department’s Debt to the Penny clock, which is a daily log of federal debt going back about 20 years. The debt held by the public and gross federal debt (which includes debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings) are both considered appropriate measurements. But we only have data that goes back far enough for the gross federal debt, so we’re going to stick with that measure. When Bush’s term started Jan. 20, 2001, the gross federal debt was $5.73 trillion. At the end of his term, Jan. 20, 2009, the gross federal debt was $10.63 trillion. This means that the debt just about doubled under Bush. The gross federal debt under Obama -- as of April 7, 2015 -- is $18.15 trillion. So, the debt is a little more than triple what the debt was when Bush took office in 2001, $5.63 trillion. Pinning the debt A lot of factors contribute to the debt other than the policies of the current president. By talking about debt growth spanning both a Republican and Democratic administration, Paul sidesteps this issue somewhat, but we wanted to provide some extra context. For example, the debt has increased so dramatically in Obama’s term -- particularly in the first couple years -- largely due to the recession, which unfolded before Obama took office, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in law, economics and the national debt at George Washington University Law School. "The gross debt increase in 2009 was huge, because of the decreased tax revenues and increased benefit payments caused by the Great Recession," he said. Two other large contributors to debt since 2009 are the government’s continued borrowing to fund military operations in the Middle East and increasing costs of the health system, said Linda Bilmes, an expert in national budgetary issues at Harvard University. Both of these were a result of previous administrative policies and external factors. Bilmes noted, though, that Obama has decided to continue the military operations (increasing the debt) and attempted to slow the growing costs of health care through the Affordable Care Act (lowering it). Additionally, measuring the debt in raw dollars does not reflect inflation or the fact that a larger economy can handle a larger amount of debt. A better measurement would be the debt burden, or how the debt compares to the gross domestic product, Buchanan said. During the Bush administration, debt as a percentage of GDP went from about 55 percent to about 68 percent. As of 2014, it’s shot up to 103.2 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. Our ruling Paul said, "Debt doubled" under Bush "and now it’s tripling under Barack Obama’s watch." This statement is confusing. A person could easily interpret it to mean that debt has tripled since Obama took office -- which would be incorrect. Paul, on the other hand, said that it means debt today, under Obama, is triple what it was when Bush’s term started. Indeed, today’s national debt is about triple what it was in January 2001, when Bush took office. It's also worth noting that many factors other than a particular president's policies affect the national debt. From one not-so-obvious angle, Paul's numbers are correct. But because the statement could so easily be interpreted in another, less accurate way, we rate it Half True.

pomt-03238	Medicaid spending declined by 1.9 percent in 2012, the second such decline in 47 years.	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/16/kathleen-sebelius/obama-official-touts-lower-medicaid-spending/	The Obama administration’s top health care official recently gave a speech in Atlanta and made some specific comments about Medicaid spending that we wanted to diagnose. PolitiFact Georgia was alerted to comments U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made on the topic through Twitter posts from people who heard her speak. "Sebelius says Medicaid spending dropped 1.9% in 2012. First time in 47 years," one person tweeted. But as we’ve learned with the popular social media tool, you can’t always tell the whole story about something in 140 characters. Sebelius offered more context in her speech. "(D)espite some of the rhetoric in Washington, the cost outlook for Medicaid is as strong as it’s been in a long time," Sebelius said during her speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures. "In 2012, Medicaid spending per beneficiary actually fell 1.9 percent, the first time it had fallen in 47 years, except for the year when prescription drug costs shifted to Medicare Part D." PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Sebelius was correct that Medicaid spending per beneficiary declined by nearly 2 percent last year. We also wanted to find out how many times there has been a decline since the program was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. Medicaid has been a big issue in Georgia over the past year. The state’s top political leaders have refused to join the Obama administration’s plans to expand Medicaid coverage, starting in 2014. Sebelius told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an exclusive interview during her recent visit here that the state’s stance would hurt many working-poor families. But Georgia leaders say the state cannot afford to pay for the estimated 650,000 residents who would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion. The federal government has pledged to pick up nearly the entire tab in the coming years. Georgia leaders are dubious Washington can follow through with such a commitment and fear state taxpayers might have to foot the bill. There have been many news accounts in recent years about the rise in spending on Medicaid, which provides health services to many low-income Americans. An estimated 54 million Americans receive Medicaid, according to congressional testimony. Medicaid spending has consistently grown higher than the nation’s economic input. The costs rose dramatically in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Many fear it is a budget buster unless costs are brought under control. So how could Sebelius be right about a cost decline? The secretary’s office sent us an actuarial report it put together to support her claim. It was a report on the current fiscal health of the Medicaid program, with statistics on past, present and future spending. "Acute care fee-for-service Medicaid expenditures are projected to grow at an average rate of 5.7 percent per year over the next decade. In 2012, these expenditures are estimated to have declined by 1.9 percent. But they are projected to increase in 2013 and later years," the report says on Page 27. By 2012, the report means the federal government’s fiscal year 2012, which began Oct. 1, 2011, and ended Sept. 30, 2012. Sebelius said in her speech that Medicaid spending in 2020 will be 14 percent lower than previously projected. One government spreadsheet we looked at showed federal Medicaid spending rose steadily since its creation. The only years we saw a decline were in 2006, the year when Medicare Part D took effect, and in 2011, which would include portions of fiscal year 2012. Medicare Part D was a drug benefit plan that federal officials said would save seniors money. Medicaid recipients eligible for the Part D benefits were automatically enrolled into the new Medicare program, which lowered total Medicaid spending, federal officials say. "As a result of this shift in coverage, Medicaid drug spending (net of rebates) decreased 44 percent from 2005 to 2006," according to the Medicaid report that a HHS official sent us. The same HHS report attributed the 2012 decrease in Medicaid spending on a decline in costs on hospital services and prescription drugs. Some news accounts said fewer new recipients added to the Medicaid rolls helped decrease spending. The HHS report says that was a small factor. The report credits the controversial Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as being another small factor in the spending decline. Other organizations sent us reports with similar findings: The only other year Medicaid spending decreased was in 2006. To sum up, Sebelius said per capita Medicaid spending declined by about 2 percent in 2012, the first time in the history of the program that happened, aside from 2006. The reports we reviewed confirm her claim. She was making a much larger point: That Medicaid costs might not increase as rapidly as some had predicted, even though they will still go higher. The federal government has warned spending is going to rise again sharply in the next few years. Her claim is accurate but could have used a little more context. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

pomt-10261	"Less than four cents of every health care dollar is spent on prevention and public health."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/26/democratic-national-committee/yes-only-an-ounce-on-prevention/	This year's Democratic platform sets a goal of providing more affordable health care. One way to attack medical costs is to prevent chronic illness through less expensive preventive care, although the subject is ripe for academic dispute. The platform states: "Yet despite all of this, less than four cents of every health care dollar is spent on prevention and public health." This is true. A report in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that 3 percent of total health expenditures went toward preventative health care. The 1992 report looked at figures from the Health Care Financing Administration about the costs of different kinds of health care. The authors included spending that either reduced disease and injury or enhanced health. The small percentage from that long-ago report is still widely repeated. An article May 28, 2008, in the Journal of the American Medical Association about preventive medicine refers for cost estimates to an article in the Harvard Health Policy Review in fall 2006, which cites the 1992 report. The Harvard publication also mentions a 2006 article in Health Affairs by former surgeon general David Satcher that estimated spending on preventive care at less than 2 percent. In 2004 testimony before a Senate subcommittee, Dr. Dean Ornish, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco and founder of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, described how three-quarters of health-care spending goes toward chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. But he said less than 2 percent was spent on preventing those ailments. We should note, we're not ruling on whether preventive care is cost effective, but rather on the specific claim that we're currently spending only 4 percent on it. We would like to be using figures more recent than 1992, but that appears to be the last time researchers used government figures to calculate the percentage of health care spending that goes to prevention. With that in mind, we have to say the Democratic Party platform claim is True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2008-08-26T00:00:00	2008-08-13	['None']
pomt-03427	Says 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider in 2008.	/texas/statements/2013/jun/25/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-92-percent-texas-counties-had-no-/	A Democrat bent on talking to death a proposal pitched by backers as improving the safety of abortion clinics while imposing other limits bandied a statistic about existing access to abortion toward the beginning of her filibuster. State Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth quoted to Senate colleagues from written testimony submitted at a March 19, 2013, hearing on a different bill by Physicians for Reproductive Health, a group whose website says it advocates reproductive health services. From the testimony, which Davis called "compelling," the senator apparently read aloud: "‘While Texas women have the right to safe, legal abortion, in reality there are already very few facilities in Texas to provide this essential care. In 2008, 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider.’" Davis said the testimony attributed the statistic to the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, a research group focusing on reproductive health issues. And is the statistic accurate? In a telephone interview, Guttmacher spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said the statistic came from the latest round of its occasional national study tabulating abortion providers by county, "Abortion Incidence and Access to Services in the United States, 2008." However, Wind counseled, another statistic built into each study can be more revealing. In Texas in 2008, she said, 33 percent of women of child-bearing age lived in the counties without abortion facilities, according to the study, which based its count of women on U.S. Census Bureau figures. Generally, Wind said, "metropolitan areas have higher numbers of women and higher numbers of providers." The study covering 2008 was published in 2010; Wind said an updated census, covering 2010-11, is to be published in 2014. The description of methodology in the study covering 2008 said, "All facilities known or expected to have provided abortion services in 2007 and 2008 were contacted, including hospitals, clinics and physicians’ offices." There were 67 Texas facilities, the report said. The study noted that it had likely missed some providers. "Undoubtedly, some abortion providers were not counted because we were unable to identify them," the study said. A 1994 survey found Guttmacher’s 1992 count overlooked "a number of small providers," it said. "Undercounting has likely become more pronounced over the last decade" as non-surgical facilities offered an abortion-inducing drug. We also looked for a state-level count of abortion providers by county. By email, Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us that according to the state’s most recent count, 74 facilities reported having performed abortions in 2011. Of those, the agency said, 41 were holders of an abortion facility license, 28 were hospitals, four were ambulatory surgical centers and one was a physician’s office. We did not obtain the locations or addresses of those listed in 2011, but Williams provided addresses for the state’s 36 abortion facility license-holders as of late June 2013 (a group that excludes hospitals, doctors’ offices and ambulatory surgical centers). By telephone, Williams said most Texas abortions are performed at such facilities. A small percentage of abortions take place in hospitals and physicians’ offices, she said. By our calculation, the 36 centers were located in about 18 Texas counties, or 7 percent of the state’s 254 counties. Geographically, they were located from Beaumont and Jefferson County near Louisiana west to El Paso County and from Lubbock County on the plains south to Hidalgo and Starr counties on the Rio Grande. The centers were mostly in the populous counties of Harris, Fort Bend, Dallas, Tarrant, Travis and Bexar. Our ruling Davis said that in 2008, 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider. Her statement matched the Guttmacher Institute’s findings, which seem supported by the locations of Texas abortion facility license holders as of late June 2013. But the institute’s study also said it likely undercounted facilities, while presenting an arguably more meaningful statistic; 33 percent of Texas women of child-bearing age lived in counties lacking abortion providers, meaning more than 65 percent lived in a county with a provider. Davis’ statement lacked these clarifications, making it Mostly True.	None	Wendy Davis	None	None	None	2013-06-25T19:28:42	2013-06-25	['Texas']
pomt-15136	The claim that 97 percent of scientists believe humans are causing climate change has been debunked by the "head" of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. "That number was pulled out of thin air."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/02/rick-santorum/santorum-un-climate-head-debunked-widely-cited-97-/	Appearing on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, GOP presidential hopeful Rick Santorum doubled down on his skepticism of man-made climate change. Santorum made two claims to back his point. First, in a large survey of climate scientists, "57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2," according to Santorum. (We found that claim False.) Second, Santorum said that a widely cited figure of scientific consensus on climate change — 97 percent — has been debunked by the "head" of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he said. "The 97 percent figure that’s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists," he said on Aug. 28. "Not even 97 scientists responded to that survey." Several readers asked us to look into Santorum’s claim. His campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found that Santorum misstated both who objected to the figure and what that person objected to. From 2002 until recently, the chairman of the IPCC was climate scientist Rajendra Pachauri, who resigned from his post in February 2015. To our knowledge, neither Pachauri nor current chairman Ismail El Gizouli has criticized the 97 percent figure. Pachauri has, in fact, endorsed the notion of scientific consensus on climate change. "By overwhelming consensus, the scientific community agrees that climate change is real," he said at a press conference in 2010. Santorum is likely referring to Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex who’s been a vocal critic of the 97 percent figure. He is not, as Santorum claims, the "head" of the IPCC, though he was the convening lead author of a chapter of the IPCC’s fifth report. He has since parted ways with the IPCC. Currently, Tol serves as an adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation. That group, says Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychologist at the University of Bristol who studies the rejection of climate science, is "the U.K.’s most prominent source of climate change denial." The "thin air" quote Santorum cited is from Tol’s testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. "I mean it is pretty clear that most of the science agrees that climate change is real and most likely human-made," Tol said on during a 2014 hearing on the IPCC. "But the 97 percent is essentially pulled from thin air. It is not based on any credible research whatsoever." Tol was specifically referring to a 2013 survey by John Cook, who studies climate communication at the University of Queensland. Cook’s study found that among over 4,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change, 97.1 percent "endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global phase" and 97.2 of 1,300 authors who responded agreed with the position. Tol takes issue with Cook’s methodology. By his analysis of Cook’s data, the real figure is around 91 percent. (Cook replied critiquing Tol’s methodology and standing by his survey’s original finding of 97 percent.) "There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans," Tol writes in his analysis. "I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this." So Santorum is talking about the wrong person. And his reference to "a survey of 77 scientists," is talking about something else entirely. The study Santorum is attempting to describe is a 2009 survey by Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University. About 90 percent of around 3,000 surveyed earth scientists said they think climate change is happening, and about 82 percent said human activity is contributing to it. The 97 percent figure comes from a subsample of climate scientists in Doran’s study, and Santorum correctly describes its small size: 74 out of 77 respondents said they agreed that climate change is man-made. Beyond his and Cook’s study, a 2010 study of over 1,300 climate researchers and their work also showed a 97 to 98 percent consensus. "They keep talking about how ‘the’ 97 percent study is wrong," Doran told PolitiFact in an interview. "Well it turns out, we never know which study they are referring to because there have been three peer-reviewed studies of late that have arrived at this 97 percent number in different ways and by different people." Our ruling Santorum said, "The 97 percent figure that’s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists." Santorum’s claim confuses several points. First, the critic of the 97 percent he’s referring to isn’t the "head" of the UN’s climate panel, but an economist who has collaborated with but has since left the IPCC. Second, the 97 percent doesn’t come from one specific survey — it appears in at least three. And finally, the study Santorum describes isn’t the one the economist objects to. Moreover, Tol himself doesn’t refute the notion of broad scientific consensus on man-made climate change. Santorum’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False. Correction, Sept. 3, 2015, 10:45 a.m: Cook's analysis looked at over 4,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change. An earlier version of this fact-check had a different figure.

pomt-07282	"The new light bulbs will cost roughly six times the cost of the light bulbs we now use."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/23/ameripac/conservative-pac-claims-new-government-regulations/	Is the government going to force you to buy light bulbs that cost $50? That's just one claim from opponents of new light bulb efficiency standards. We are fact-checking several claims from the fundraising letter circulated by AmeriPAC, a conservative political action committee, and the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise (CDFE) Action Fund, which seeks contributions and support for a bill to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. In this item, we will address the groups' claim that the law will force consumers to buy light bulbs that are significantly more expensive than conventional light bulbs sold today. The groups contend that the law -- which is being rolled out in phases -- will "outlaw" incandescent light bulbs in favor of compact fluorescent bulbs. It's a claim we rated Pants on Fire, for reasons that have an impact on this claim as well. But we'll get to that in a bit. First, here's the wording of the claim in a letter from CDFE: "Democrats in Congress passed legislation that raises the cost of a single light bulb to $50!" Ron Arnold of CDFE backed up this claim with a link to a May 16, 2011, AP story about two leading light bulb makers showcasing LED bulbs that are bright enough to replace the 100 watt light bulbs that will be phased out in January -- and which were projected to cost about $50 each. Later in its letter, the CDFE claims that "the new light bulbs will cost roughly six times the cost of the light bulbs we now use." The letter quotes a Dec. 19, 2007, study from US News and World Report which states, "Each cone-shaped spiral CFL [compact fluorescent light] costs about $3, compared with 50 cents for a standard bulb." There are, however, two major problems with the claims in the letter. The first, said Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, is that there are two costs to a light bulb: the front-end cost of a light bulb at the store and the cost of electricity to operate it. The CDFE letter only considers one side of the equation -- the up-front cost. The curly-shaped compact fluorescent light bulbs use about 75 percent less electricity than comparable incandescent bulbs and last about 10 times longer, according to an analysis by the Department of Energy. As a result, the DOE concluded, "typical CFLs can pay for themselves in less than nine months and then start saving you money each month." That point would have been clear had the CDFE letter contained the full context of the study from US News and World Report, instead of just cherry-picking one sentence. Here's how the fuller Q & A reads: How do I save money, when a CFL costs six times as much as an old-fashioned bulb? Each cone-shaped spiral CFL costs about $3, compared with 50 cents for a standard bulb. But a CFL uses about 75 percent less energy and lasts five years instead of a few months. A household that invested $90 in changing 30 fixtures to CFLs would save $440 to $1,500 over the five-year life of the bulbs, depending on your cost of electricity. Look at your utility bill and imagine a 12 percent discount to estimate the savings. As for LED light bulbs, it's true that some were put on the market with a $50 price tag, but the Department of Energy and most industry experts expect that price to come down dramatically as more products enter the market. Also not mentioned is that LED lights use about 20 to 25 percent of the energy of a traditional incandescent equivalent, and the LED light can last up to 25 times longer. The other problem with the claim in the CDFE letter is that it assumes the law will limit light bulb options to either fluorescent or LED bulbs. In fact, however, all of the major light bulb manufacturers have developed new halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the law's new efficiency standards. We spoke to Randy Moorhead, vice president of government affairs at Philips, which began selling its latest halogen incandescent bulbs at Home Depot in April. Moorhead said the EcoVantage light bulb -- which puts off as much light as a traditional 100 watt bulb -- comes with a suggested retail price of $1.49. That's roughly triple the cost of the existing 100 watt bulbs. However, it saves about $3.36 is reduced energy costs to the customer over the 1,000-hour life of the bulb, he said. In other words, the bulb may cost $1 more up front, but saves $3.36 in energy costs -- for a net savings of $2.35. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs even more up-front but saves more over the life of the bulb. The Department of Energy put out a fact-sheet detailing the up-front costs and longer-term energy costs of all the light bulb options. The data is clear, said, Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, while light bulbs that meet the new efficiency standard cost more than the traditional incandescent light bulbs, "the energy savings more than pays off the extra cost." We asked Arnold, who penned the CDFE letter, about the potential long-term cost-savings of the more energy efficient bulbs. "We're not obligated to tell the other guy's side of the story," Arnold said. Perhaps not, but we think it's awfully misleading to warn about up-front cost without also mentioning the longer-term savings. The claims in the CDFE letter also assume that consumers will have no options come January when the new efficiency standards kick in. Even if you consider only the up-front cost of light bulbs, consumers would not be obligated to buy LED bulbs that cost as much as $50 apiece; nor would they be forced to purchase fluorescent alternatives that go for $3 apiece. There also are halogen incandescent bulbs for $1.49. It's true that all of these options will cost more at the store than traditional incandescent bulbs cost today. But when you factor in the cost of electricity needed to power the light bulb, they will end up costing significantly less. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06320	Says the Treasury Department "says 41 percent of all business income reported on individual returns would be hit by the [millionaires’] surtax" that "would harm small businessmen and women, the very people we are counting on to create new jobs."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/13/rodney-frelinghuysen/rodney-frelinghuysen-claims-proposed-millionaires-/	The millionaires’ tax proposal made its latest appearance in New Jersey this summer. Now it’s in the national spotlight. Congressional Republicans and Democrats are going toe to toe on whether to raise taxes on individuals making more than $1 million to pay for pieces of President Barack Obama’s jobs proposal. U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-11th Dist.) joined the national fray after a bill for $60 billion in spending on transportation and infrastructure that would have been paid for with an income tax hike of less than 1 percent was blocked in the Senate. "To offset the ‘temporary’ spending, the proposal would contain a permanent tax increase on Americans earning $1 million annually. Here’s the problem: the so-called ‘millionaire surtax’ is a permanent tax to pay for a temporary benefit," Frelinghuysen wrote in a Nov. 4 newsletter. "And the President’s own Department of the Treasury says 41 percent of all business income reported on individual returns would be hit by the surtax. Thus, the President’s tax would harm small businessmen and women, the very people we are counting on to create new jobs and hire new workers!" PolitiFact New Jersey found the congressman used a statistic that refers to all businesses to make a point about small business owners. The 41 percent figure comes from an August technical paper from career staff at the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis. It identifies small business owners for the purpose of tax policy analysis. According to that paper, business owners with more than $1 million in adjusted gross income received 41 percent of business income, or about $237 billion. We should note that represents earnings, not individuals. Individuals with more than $1 million in income account for 2 percent of all business owners. But small business income, by the paper’s broad definition, accounts for about 28 percent of that overall income, or $67 billion. Large business income accounts for nearly 72 percent of all business income, or $170 billion. If you drill down further, and look at just small business income, individuals with more than $1 million in income received between 14 percent and 18 percent of small business income and represent 1 percent of small business owners. For large business owners, those making more than $1 million in income received 83 percent of large business income and represent 13 percent of large business owners. Frelinghuysen’s emphasis on small business owners is "not consistent with what he just said about the 41 percent," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "He draws an implication that doesn’t really tie to what he just said." "The sentence following the 41 percent number could be viewed as misleading in its reference to ‘small’ business people, although it is not incorrect," said Alan Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in an email. "Some of the tax would indeed fall on (‘harm’) small businesses," he said, "although more of the tax would fall on large businesses." It’s worth nothing that Frelinghuysen also said it’s small businesses that "we are counting on to create new jobs and hire new workers," but the Office of Tax Analysis paper found that slightly more than one-fifth of small businesses fit its definition of an employer. A spokesman for the congressman said Frelinghuysen is "en route back to the United States from an official visit to our troops in Afghanistan and is unavailable to comment," but said the congressman’s statement was correct. "I regret that the Star-Ledger has chosen to apply another interpretation to the Treasury Department data," he wrote in an email. Our ruling Frelinghuysen claimed the Treasury Department said "41 percent of all business income reported on individual returns would be hit by the surtax. Thus, the President’s tax would harm small businessmen and women, the very people we are counting on to create new jobs and hire new workers!" The congressman’s use of the statistic is misleading. Frelinghuysen applies the statistic to small business owners, saying it would hurt the individuals we are counting on to create jobs. But the figure represents income from all businesses, not just small businesses. And the same report he’s basing his information on found that slightly more than one-fifth of small businesses are employers. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13368	Says Rob Portman "even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."	/ohio/statements/2016/sep/29/ted-strickland/sen-rob-portman-voted-let-terrorists-buy-guns-nope/	CORRECTION, 5:48p.m., September 29, 2016: Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly described an amendment by Sen. Susan Collins. The story has been updated to reflect her as the author of that measure. Our rating on the claim did not change. A new TV ad from Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland features a veteran of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan who says he carried a gun "so we wouldn’t have to worry about terrorists using them here." But Sen. Rob Portman, Strickland’s Republican opponent, "is blocking commonsense laws to stop terrorists and criminals from getting guns. Sen. Portman said no to background checks on all purchases," the ad’s soldier continues. "He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns." That last statement caught our attention. No, Portman did not vote to allow suspected terrorists to purchase guns. The attack obscures what really happened. The ad cites Senate voting records from June 20 and 23. First, we’ll consult the record. Votes 106 and 109 were two of four votes on gun control measures considered by the Senate after the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. On June 12, Omar Mateen, a man who had twice been investigated by the FBI for suspected terrorist ties, killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.. Vote 106 asked senators to vote to end the debate, or to keep debating, an amendment by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein which would authorize the U.S. attorney general to deny requests to sell firearms to "known or suspected terrorists." Portman voted "nay," a vote against bringing the issue up for passage or failure. The week ahead of that vote, Portman told reporters in his weekly media conference call, "I do believe that you should not be able to buy a weapon when you’re on the (terrorist) watch list." Strickland’s ad doesn’t mention the other three votes taken that day, June 20, 2016, on the issue of suspected terrorists and gun sales. All four measures failed, largely along party lines. Portman voted in favor of Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley’s amendment to "address gun violence and improve the availability of records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System." He also voted in favor of Republican Sen. John Cornyn’s proposal, an alternative to Feinstein’s measure to prevent watchlisted terrorists from buying guns. The main difference between the Feinstein amendment and the one proposed by Cornyn had to do with due process -- granting an avenue for an individual to appeal if they are wrongfully listed as a terror suspect and denied a gun purchase. The Republican amendment allowed authorities to detain a terrorism suspect who tries to obtain a firearm, and gave a judge 72 hours to determine whether there was enough proof to bar the gun sale. Feinstein’s amendment provided for an individual to appeal to the Justice Department if they felt they were wrongfully listed and barred from buying a gun. It did not have a three-day limit for the government to make its case. Republicans argued that Cornyn’s amendment, with a stronger check-and-balance requiring a court order, was necessary in light of well-known errors on federal no-fly and terrorist watch lists. Former Sen. Ted Kennedy is often cited as an example after he was erroneously stopped for extra airport security checks because "T. Kennedy" was an alias used by a terror suspect. A motion to table a tweaked version of Feinstein’s amendment, proposed by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine -- the "Vote 109" referenced by Strickland’s ad -- failed on June 23 with a 46-52 vote, short of the 60 votes required to advance. Portman voted "yea," or against the amendment, in line with all but eight Republicans. Our ruling Strickland’s campaign ad said of Portman, "He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns." The ad distorts facts on many levels. People on the terrorism watch list could already buy guns before the votes in question. Portman voted along party lines on the gun control measures that came up for Senate vote on June 20 and 23. He voted against Feinstein’s amendment to enact a blanket ban on firearm purchases by terrorists or suspected terrorists. But he voted for the Republican version of the legislation, sponsored by Cornyn, that would ban a gun sale after a three-day period of judicial review to determine whether an individual was on a watch list for legitimate reasons. The vote for Cornyn’s legislation was literally a vote to stop terrorists from buying weapons — but the extra hurdles for the government were not supported by Democrats.

pomt-10809	"With those first principles, it allowed a fellow like me to get in his truck and go from one end of the state to the other; started 20 points down and wound up 20 points ahead on election night."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/02/fred-thompson/driving-his-truck-to-victory/	Yes, it's true. Fred Thompson combined his folksy charm (the truck) with a set of conservative principles (less government, lower taxes, more free markets) to win election to the U.S. Senate in 1994. And, indeed, in February of that year Thompson trailed Democrat Jim Cooper by 19 points — 36 to 17 percent — according to polling at the time by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research. Thompson went on to win the race, which was a special election to complete the term of Al Gore who became vice president, with 60 percent of the vote to Cooper's 39 percent (a 21 percentage-point spread). Thompson won re-election to a full term two years later, defeating Democrat Houston Gordon, 61 to 37 percent. The truck played a role for the lobbyist and actor. He leased it to campaign in the state, building his down-home bona fides among voters. In the same speech Thompson also pointed out, correctly, that President Bill Clinton won Tennessee twice. But it's worth noting that Thompson's first victory, 1994, came in a tidal wave year for Republicans, who took control of Congress. "That was kind of a watershed year in Tennessee," said Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon.	None	Fred Thompson	None	None	None	2007-10-02T00:00:00	2007-09-21	['None']
pomt-04494	Says black women are "fastest-growing demographic group in ... Texas seeking concealed handgun licenses."	/texas/statements/2012/oct/05/stefani-carter/stefani-carter-says-black-women-texas-fastest-grow/	You might be surprised to learn who cares about the Second Amendment, lawmaker Stefani Carter suggested in a recent USA Today opinion article. "What is the fastest-growing demographic group in my state of Texas seeking concealed handgun licenses? Black women," wrote Carter, a Dallas Republican running for re-election to the Texas House, in the Aug. 30, 2012, piece. We decided to check out who’s taking advantage lately of Texas’ concealed-handgun law, which since January 1996 has allowed permit holders to carry such guns in most public places while excluding others, such as churches. Katy Aldredge, a deputy district director for Carter, told us Carter’s main source was a July 12, 2012, post on The Volokh Conspiracy, a conservative-leaning legal analysis blog written by law professor Eugene Volokh of the University of California-Los Angeles. Aldredge also sent us links to annual reports on concealed handgun licenses on the Texas Department of Public Safety website. Aldredge said Carter found Volokh’s blog and compared his data to the DPS reports of licenses issued. (We did the same, and the data matches.) Aldredge also said that despite the word "seeking" in her article, Carter was discussing licenses issued, not applications. In his blog post, Volokh looked at how many of the permits issued in each year went to black men and women and white men and women. By email, he told us that he did not look at the DPS’ other race groupings because they were too small or too unclear. Those categories are "American Indian or Alaskan Native," "Asian or Pacific Islander," "Multi-Racial" and "Other/Unknown." Volokh’s post said that most Hispanics seem to be counted as "white" in the DPS numbers, "following the modern demographic approach of treating Hispanic as an ethnicity rather than as a separate race." But Hispanics are Texas’ largest minority. According to the latest state QuickFacts sheet from the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas’ 2011 demographics (including some overlap) were: 44.8 percent white, 38.1 percent Hispanic, 12.2 percent black, 4 percent Asian, 1 percent "American Indian and Alaska Native," 0.1 percent "Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander." The DPS numbers, not separating Hispanic and white, show that of the CHL permits issued in 2011, 86.5 percent went to whites, 6.8 percent to black, 3.4 percent to "other/unknown," 2 percent to "Asian or Pacific Islander," 1 percent to "multi-racial," and 0.33 percent to "American Indian or Alaskan Native" Texans. Volokh’s analysis found that among black and white permit recipients, from 1996 through 2011, the percentage of women in the total was consistently smaller than the percentage of men but that this gender gap was narrowing slightly. The uptick among black women, he said, was "especially striking": Black women got less than 1 percent of the 317,205 permits issued from 1996 through 2000, he said, but got 1.63 percent of the 558,190 permits issued from 2007 through 2011. Seeking another expert view, we contacted conservative writer John Lott, whom we saw cited in an April 24, 2012, New York Times news story that discussed "growth in the number of people with concealed-carry permits" nationwide; the Times described Lott as "a researcher of gun culture who has held teaching or research posts at a number of universities, including the University of Chicago." When we asked him by email about Carter’s statement, Lott took a look at Texas data from 2000 through 2011, comparing the number of permit recipients in a particular race category each year with the number of people in that race category who got permits in 2000. The jump in multi-racial women permit holders from 2000 to 2011 was the most extreme, but Lott cautioned that result is exaggerated because the category is small -- meaning the addition of a few people can dramatically alter the percent change -- and because more people these days describe themselves as multi-racial than in 2000. Throwing out that category because of its size -- as Volokh did -- Lott told us, "Carter is correct that black females since 2000 have had the largest percentage increase." He created this chart of the Texas data for us: That’s a lot of little colored lines, but we determined that the DPS numbers back up Lott’s finding: The biggest increase between 2000 and 2011 was in the category of multi-racial female permit recipients, which jumped from 28 in 2000 to 318 in 2011. That 139-person difference produced the 1035.7 percent change charted by the dark-brown line at top. The number of black female permit-holders rose 554 percent from 2000 to 2011 -- a smaller percent change, but involving a larger number of people: 2,046. The records show 369 black women in Texas had CHLs in 2000 and 2,415 had them in 2011. In a later interview, Volokh took a look at the multi-racial numbers and agreed they were statistically unreliable, for the same reasons: because it was such a small group and some of its growth likely came as people began adopting that term for themselves. "I’d still say that black women were the fastest-growing demographic group of any substantial size," he told us. But that observation, like Lott’s and Carter’s, is limited by the demographic groups DPS used. Without breaking out Hispanics -- nearly 40 percent of Texans -- separately, we see no way to give an accurate picture of the demographics and changes among Texas’ concealed-carry permit holders. Carter’s piece didn’t mention the lack of data on Hispanics. Why such changes occurred is murkier. Carter’s opinion article cites some statistics about crime against black women and mentions nationwide increases in women owning guns. Volokh limited his analysis to the numbers rather than the reasons behind them. Lott told us that black women as a group overlap with the two categories of people who benefit the most from concealed-carry permits, according to his research: people who are physically weaker than assailants (primarily women and elderly people) and people who are likely victims of violent crime, including low-income residents of high-crime urban areas. Our ruling Carter claims black women are the fastest-growing group of permit-seekers. We accept her explanation that she meant to refer to permits issued each year. And her statement fairly captures available data and research. However, the lack of information on Hispanic permit recipients makes it impossible to conclude which Texas subgroups are getting permits most often. We rate the statement as Half True.

pomt-08634	"As the CEO of HP, Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/barbara-boxer/ad-sen-barbara-boxer-attacks-carly-fiorina-layoffs/	In a race to represent California in the U.S. Senate, Republican Carly Fiorina has emphasized her "real-world" business experience as chief executive officer of one of the world's largest tech companies. But Fiorina's controversial six-year tenure as CEO of computer-maker Hewlett Packard has also been used by Democrats to attack her. The latest attack ad from Sen. Barbara Boxer picks up on a thread introduced in the primary -- accusing Fiorina of laying off tens of thousands of workers at HP, shipping jobs overseas and all the while padding her own bank account and toy box. Here's what the announcer in the Democratic incumbent's ad says: "As CEO of HP, Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers. Fiorina shipped jobs to China. "And while Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets ... Carly Fiorina. Outsourcing jobs. Out for herself." Fiorina was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard in July 1999, the first woman to lead a Fortune 100 company. She reorganized the company's structure and pushed for a controversial 2002 merger with Compaq Computer Corp., in an attempt to get a greater share of the personal computer market. The merger succeeded, but HP's board fired her anyway in February 2005 (with a $21 million severance package), primarily due to the company's sluggish stock price and missed earnings targets. Fiorina has numerous detractors, but she also has defenders of her time at HP. In fact, the Fiorina campaign set up the "Hewlett-Packard and Carly" website, where a number of former HP employees and executives tout her tenure as HP's CEO. But the issue for us is the Boxer ad's claim that Fiorina layed off 30,000 workers and shipped jobs to China. That HP laid off about 30,000 workers while Fiorina was CEO is largely undisputed. The larger context very much is. In an interview with InformationWeek on Oct. 16, 2006, Fiorina talked about the merger with Compaq. "When we combined the R&D budgets of HP and Compaq, we didn't have to have two R&D teams working on industry standard servers, for instance. We could have one. That's why the merger was such a great idea. We could decrease the cost structure by billions and billions of dollars. In the course of my time there, we laid off over 30,000 people. That's why I understand where the anger came from." And Fiorina has not been shy about acknowledging that many jobs were outsourced overseas. In January 2004, Fiorina provocatively told Congress, "There is no job that is America's God-given right anymore." In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal the following month, Fiorina wrote that while "attention has focused on a handful of companies, like HP, which have sourced some jobs to other countries" the U.S. "must focus on developing next-generation industries and next-generation talent" rather than following Japan's attempt at "protectionist proposals to limit or prohibit the practice." Moreover, Fiorina contends that over the entire course of her tenure at HP, the company created more jobs than it cut. She explains this in an exchange with Chris Wallace in a Fox News interview on June 13, 2010. "But, Ms. Fiorina, if the issue is jobs, Senator Boxer says your record is what you did as the head of Hewlett-Packard, "Wallace said. "And the record shows, according to her -- and it's not just her, the facts are that during that time you laid off more than 30,000 American workers, and many of those jobs went to India and China." "It is true, I managed Hewlett-Packard through the worst technology recession in 25 years," Fiorina said. "And in those tough times, we had to make some tough calls. "It is also true that, net-net, we created jobs," she said. "We doubled the size of the company from $44 billion to $88 billion. We tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day. We quintupled the cash flow. We improved the profitability in every product segment and ... "What about the 30,000 American jobs that...you laid off?" Wallace asked. "You know, every family and every business in California knows what it means to go through tough times," Fiorina said. "And every family is cutting back, and every business is laying off right now. I don't say that with delight. I say that with sorrow. But yes, it is true that jobs are being taken out of California. By the way, China fights harder for our jobs than we do. Texas fights for our jobs. Nevada fights for our jobs. North Carolina fights for our jobs. We have to start fighting for our jobs in this nation and in our state." Let's take a look at that "net-net" claim. Or, as she told the Los Angeles Times in a May 20, 2010 story: "We had more employees by the time I left HP than either pre-merger HP or pre-merger Compaq had, combined." Here's the math: According to SEC filings, HP had 84,400 employees worldwide in 2001, the year before the merger. In 2001, Compaq had 63,700 full-time employees. That comes to a total of 148,100 workers. In 2005, just after her departure, HP's worldwide workforce reached 150,000. Net gain? In the Los Angeles Times story, reporter Robin Abcarian said that claim is dubious, because "in that same period, HP bought more than a dozen other U.S. companies with at least 8,000 employees, according to company filings, press releases and news reports." Moreover, the proxy reports are for worldwide employment figures. They don't tell you how many American jobs were lost or gained. In its response to the Boxer ad, the Fiorina campaign claims the only numbers that are relevant are the ones that show that in October 1999, HP had about 84,400 employees worldwide; and in October 2005, the company had 150,000 employees worldwide -- so that under Fiorina's leadership HP nearly doubled its number of employees worldwide. It's not that simple. For one, there was the Compaq merger. Pre-merger, the companies had a combined workforce of 148,100. It's clear that Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers as a result of the merger with Compaq, as she said in the interview with InformationWeek. And it's clear that by October 2005 the merged company employed more workers than the two separate companies had pre-merger (Fiorina had been forced out seven months earlier in February 2005). But some of those jobs may have resulted from acquisitions, and some may have been abroad. A company as large as HP is very dynamic, so it's possible that the initial layoffs resulted in a stronger company that contributed to job growth in the long run. That's good in the macro sense, but it doesn't cancel the fact that 30,000 workers lost their jobs. So we rate the claim Mostly True.

"Breaking: Laura Ingraham just fired!!!" stated an April 22 headline on Red State Wave, which styles itself as a conservative website. The article was written by "MAGA student," a reference to Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan Make America Great Again. A disclaimer states that redstatewave.com is a "passive service for storage and dissemination of the works that redstatewave.com members may choose to post and distribute." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The headline is a hoax and intended to draw in readers. The story that followed never said that Ingraham was fired. Instead it said she "fired off on Democrats." The story posted Ingraham’s April 20 tweet related to the recent Democratic National Committee lawsuit filed against President Donald Trump’s campaign, Russia and WikiLeaks alleging election interference. The DNC filed the lawsuit in federal court in New York April 20. "My personal advice to Democrats is this: Keep doing what you're doing because the American people are a lot smarter than you give them credit for," Ingraham tweeted. The conservative website sides with Ingraham. "Democrats continue to show the American people that they have no identity and no sustaining message for their platform," the website said. "2018 may not be ‘in the bag’ as they have predicted." In March, Ingraham took a week off as advertisers pulled out of her show following her comments about Parkland survivor David Hogg. The controversy began when she posted an article about Hogg being rejected by four colleges and said he was whining about it. She later apologized. Fox News said at the time that her break was a pre-planned vacation. On her show, The Ingraham Angle, she said that she was spending Easter break with her children. Fox News co-president Jack Abernethy issued a statement of support for Ingraham to the Los Angeles Times on April 2: "We cannot and will not allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts. We look forward to having Laura Ingraham back hosting her program next Monday when she returns from spring vacation with her children."

pomt-10320	Obama "says he'll raise taxes on electricity."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/31/john-mccain/no-tax-offered-on-electricity/	A television ad from Sen. John McCain got attention because it contrasted photos of Sen. Barack Obama with tabloid stars Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. "He's the biggest celebrity in the world," the ad's narrator said. "But, is he ready to lead? With gas prices soaring, Barack Obama says no to offshore drilling. And, says he'll raise taxes on electricity. "Higher taxes, more foreign oil, that's the real Obama," the voice concludes. We know that Obama does not support expanded offshore drilling, because he says it won't do anything to reduce gas prices. But we were intrigued by the claim that Obama wants to raise taxes on electricity. That's not something we recalled from his policy proposals. In a prepared memo in support of the ad, the McCain campaign pointed to an interview Obama had with a Texas newspaper in February 2008. "What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas," Obama said in the interview. The McCain campaign argued that because coal and natural gas are major sources of electricity, Obama supports a tax on electricity. But the context of the interview (which we've looked at before ) shows Obama was making a statement of principle rather than a policy proposal. In the interview with San Antonio Express-News columnist Carlos Guerra, Obama discussed funding sources for education. Guerra then asked, "Have you considered other funding sources, say taxing emerging energy forms, for example, say a penny per kilowatt hour on wind energy?" Obama replied: "Well, that's clean energy, and we want to drive down the cost of that, not raise it. We need to give them subsidies so they can start developing that. What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. But I think that the real way to fund education is for local communities to step up and say this is important to us. There are no shortcuts." If you look at Obama's proposals, he does not advocate an electricity tax or a carbon tax, but instead proposes a cap-and-trade system. A campaign spokesman said that was what Obama was talking about in the interview. The idea behind cap-and-trade is that the government sets a limit on how much carbon industries can emit (the cap). The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed so they can conduct business (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively. Cap-and-trade systems can raise the cost of energy for some consumers if companies have to buy additional permits for emissions, but they are not usually considered a tax. McCain, incidentally, also supports a cap-and-trade system. "It wouldn't officially be considered a tax," said Eric Toder of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "The proposal for a cap-and-trade system would raise prices for some people, but both candidates support cap-and-trade." Yes, Obama did use the word "tax" in the interview, but he was reacting to a question about taxing clean energy and making the point that producers of clean energy should not be given a disincentive. And he concluded that energy taxes should not be used to fund education. The McCain ad says that Obama "says he'll raise taxes on electricity" and points to a line from one interview that requires a lot of explanation. Obama's proposals don't say anything about a tax on electricity. Is Obama open to the idea of taxing dirty energy? Arguably yes. But that's some distance from saying he wants to tax electricity. We find the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08072	"CEOs now earn 431 times what their workers earn."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/21/bumper-sticker/bumper-sticker-says-ceos-make-431-times-what-their/	Most bumper stickers don’t lend themselves to fact-checking. So many are simple statements of support for candidates or opinions. After all, how can you fact-check "I believe in whirled peas?" But we came across one in downtown D.C. the other day that made us go, Hmm. "CEOs now earn 431 times what their workers earn. Support unions." 431 times? Really? It wasn’t hard to find the source of the number at the heart of the bumper sticker’s claim. For many years the liberal Institute for Policy Studies and the non-profit group United for a Fair Economy have produced ratios of CEO pay to worker pay. On its website, United for a Fair Economy says it "raises awareness that concentrated wealth and power undermine the economy, corrupt democracy, deepen the racial divide and tear communities apart." We found a chart on the site that showed CEO pay at 431 times the average worker’s pay. But the number was out of date: It was the number for 2004. The car, a Volkswagen, looked like a more recent model than 2004, but maybe the bumper sticker was printed before the car rolled off the assembly line. We wanted to look at fresher numbers, and we found them in a Sept. 1, 2010, annual compensation survey, now produced by the IPS alone but still using pretty much the same sources of data as earlier studies. This survey found the ratio had dropped to 263 times the average workers’ pay by 2009. IPS took CEO data from an Associated Press online survey for the S&P 500 companies that included salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest on deferred compensation and the value of stock and option awards measure by their fair value on the day of the grant in its definition of total compensation. Their data on worker pay came from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics "Average Hourly Earnings of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees" and on the average weekly hours for those same workers. According to Gary Steinberg of BLS, that category includes everyone except those whose principal work is supervisory and covers 80 to 85 percent of all workers. Other studies also have found a considerable gap between executive and worker pay. A Financial Times story from Aug. 30, 2010, noted: "S&P 500 chief executives last year received median pay packages of $7.5 million, according to executive compensation research firm Equilar. By comparison, official statistics show the average private sector employee was paid just over $40,000." Recent legislation passed by critics of high corporate compensation has guaranteed that the ratio of corporate chieftain pay to worker pay will continue to be a high-profile issue. U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd and Rep. Barney Frank's financial reform law requires all United States corporations to report CEO pay compared to the median pay for all other employees. With the rules in the works, the business community has raised concerns about the difficulty of carrying them out. Barbara H. Franklin, chairman of the National Association of Corporate Directors, noted in the NACD’s comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission: "The median pay figure can be highly misleading for a global company operating in regions where there is a low cost of living and hence a lower level of wages. Indeed, there is simply no way to calculate this with any utility or accuracy. It would take global companies months and thousands of hours to come up with a completely useless number. We would urge the SEC to implement this provision with extreme care." Do these types of comparisons make any difference? We turned to Graef Crystal, an expert in executive compensation and a frequent critic of CEO pay, for his views. "These numbers get thrown around a lot by people to prove whatever," he said. Some CEOs might be surprised by the numbers, he said, but generally what matters most to executives and those who set their pay is how they compare to their peers, he said. "They don’t look down, and they don’t look across at China." In fact, he said, as proxy statements disclose details about pay that may now be opaque, it could ratchet up pay. He also noted that there is a "significant correlation between sales volume and the pay of CEOs." Crystal has his own database of companies, which produced an average pay rate of $10.1 million in 2009, he said. But if you sort it by sales volume, the top 100 companies average $14.4 million, Expand it to the top 200, and the average drops to $11.7 million. The S&P 500 is only part of a much larger universe of publicly traded firms. It is made up of 500 firms which have market capitalization (number of shares multiplied by stock price) of $10 million or more. In contrast there are nearly 6,000 publicly traded firms on the nation’s two largest stock exchanges. So comparing the compensation of CEOs at only the select companies in the S&P 500 to the pay for all nonsupervisory production workers is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Turning back to the bumper sticker, is it true that corporate executives earn 431 times as much as the average worker? Not any more, since the most recent study in the same series found the figure in 2009 was 263 times the average worker pay. But, having gone through the pain of removing outdated bumper stickers ourselves, we’ll allow a little leeway for the figure’s lack of currency. And, leaving aside the question of whether it is warranted or not, there is still a sizable gap between corporate executive pay and worker pay, although probably not as large as the gap between S&P 500 CEOs and the average of all nonsupervisory production workers, some of whom work at much smaller companies. So we’re rating the bumper sticker Half True. CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story said the bumper sticker was on a Volkswagen VR6, suggesting that was a VW model. It is an engine model on the car, so the reference to the VR6 has been deleted for clarity.	None	Bumper Sticker	None	None	None	2010-12-21T13:08:57	2010-12-20	['None']
pomt-05383	The congressional district for Miami-Dade and Broward counties has a "staggering drop-out rate of almost 61 percent."	/florida/statements/2012/may/07/rudy-moise/rudy-moise-miami-dade-broward-drop-out-rate/	Rudy Moise, a Democrat running for Congress in South Florida, says his district "is going in the wrong direction." He cites some troubling statistics on his campaign website: "We're No. 2 in crime in the state. Unemployment is at 17 percent amongst minorities in my district. And we are losing our future with a staggering high school drop-out rate of almost 61 percent." The figure that caught our eye was the double-digit dropout rate. Moise will face Democrat U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Miami Gardens, in the primary. (Wilson now represents Congressional District 17, but as a result of redistricting they will face off in District 24.) First, some background about the race between Moise, a Haitian-American doctor, and Wilson, an African-American former state legislator. The district largely lies in Miami-Dade County and includes a slice of Broward County. About 59 percent of the district is black or African-American. The Census also shows that within the district, about 11 percent were born in Haiti. Haitian-Americans had hoped to win this seat in Congress in 2010 when U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek left to run unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate. But the Haitian community didn’t coalesce behind one candidate, and four Haitian-American candidates ran in a crowded primary, with Moise earning the most votes among the Haitian candidates. Moise’s 2012 bid drew attention in April when Haitian president Michel Martelly urged Haitian-Americans living in the district to vote for Moise. Moise’s claim about dropout rates doesn’t mention Wilson, a former Miami-Dade school board member and principal who founded a dropout prevention program about 20 years ago. Moise points to report on black males When we asked Moise’s campaign for evidence, they pointed us to a report by the Schott Foundation about black males and education for 2007-2008. The Florida report shows graduation rates for black males by county and state: 27 percent in Miami-Dade, 39 percent in Broward and 37 percent in Florida. Moise’s campaign took those rates and subtracted from 100 and got the "almost 61 percent" dropout rate. That works on pure math, though some educational experts say the dropout rate isn’t simply the inverse of the graduation rate. More significantly, the number only counts the dropout rates for black males compared to white males. So that rate leaves out other students, including females. PolitiFact examined the Schott report for a previous claim by state Rep. Stephen Wise, R-Jacksonville, about the gap in graduation rates between black and white boys. Michael Holzman, a research consultant for the Schott Foundation, told the Tampa Bay Times he simply divided the number of standard diplomas awarded in 2008 by the number of students who entered high school four years earlier. The calculation does not include people who obtained a GED. Miami-Dade had the seventh-lowest graduation rate among the 59 districts examined while Pinellas, Palm Beach and Duval fared worse. Pinellas officials criticized the Schott report, saying that the formula it used was oversimplified, and, among other shortcomings, did not account for students who transferred away from the district. Calculating dropout rates tougher than it sounds There are other ways to calculate the dropout rate, as our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas and PolitiFact National have shown in previous fact-checks. "A dropout rate seems like it should be the most intuitive thing in the world, but it’s not," said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education who specializes in comparative statistics. "There are almost as many ways of calculating state dropout rates as there are states." One way to calculate it is to track individual students as they progress from freshman year of high school until graduation. This provides the most accurate data, but tracking students this way requires a lot of effort, so many school districts do not do it. An alternative is to track the decline in enrollment between freshman year and graduation. This is known as the AFGR, or averaged freshman graduation rate. It's much easier to do -- and it's the most consistent "apples to apples" statistic across the 50 states -- but it is undermined by a greater risk of error. That's because this method does not necessarily distinguish between students who actually dropped out and those who left for other reasons, such as moving to another state or graduating early or late. Students who leave for other reasons can be excluded, but this is not always done, and not doing it tends to inflate the apparent number of dropouts. Standardization mandated by provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act has reduced these errors over time, but the statistics are not yet perfect, our experts said. The real dropout rates So what are the dropout rates for Miami-Dade and Broward? One measure Florida uses is the National Governor’s Association, or NGA, which counts standard and special diplomas as graduates but excludes GEDs and students who transfer to adult education. These graduation rates are based on a cohort: it is the percentage of students who graduate within four years of their first enrollment in 9th grade. In Broward County in 2010-2011, about 76.5 percent graduated with a standard diploma within four years, 3.3 percent dropped out at anytime during the four years and 20.2 percent were listed as "not graduating." Students are listed as "not graduating" if they need a fifth year or received a certificate of completion, for example, which means they didn’t meet all the requirements for a diploma. In Miami-Dade County, those figures were 77.7 percent graduating, 6.8 percent dropping out and 15.4 percent not graduating. (Starting in 2010-11, all states had to start calculating the Federal Graduation Rate, which is the most restrictive measure. This rate counts as graduates only recipients of standard diplomas, not special diplomas for students with disabilities or GEDs. The federal graduation rate for Broward was 71.6 percent and in Miami-Dade it was 71.3 percent, but the data we saw didn’t show figures for dropouts or other in-between categories.) Although the inverse of the graduation rate isn’t the dropout rate, those students who don’t get a diploma within four years are at risk of dropping out, said Thomas C. West, an affiliated researcher with the Everyone Graduates Center at John Hopkins University. "They are not with their peers," he said. "Something has gone wrong." Both Miami-Dade and Broward sent us data showing the single year dropout rate per high school in the school districts. The majority of the high schools had dropout rates in the single digits. But both had some schools with double-digit dropout rates -- typically these were smaller schools that served targeted populations such as special needs, teen parents or students who had left school in the past. The Moise campaign responds When we told Moise’s campaign about our conclusion, campaign manager Willis Howard said they would change the claim on the website to refer to black boys. He said that it’s important to talk about graduation and dropout rates for black students because of the demographics of the district: "We are talking to predominantly black folks. … We’ve got to bring some light to we have an outrageous amount of dropouts in this district and South Florida and we’ve got to figure it out." Our ruling Moise said that his district has a "staggering high school dropout rate of almost 61 percent." Moise points to a report about graduation rates from the Schott Foundation which provides some interesting data. But we have several problems with it as it relates to Moise’s dropout claim. • Most critically, Moise's claim is based on a measurement for black males. We saw nothing in his comment to indicate he was talking about male dropouts only. • Also, the number is based on 2007-2008 data even though data is available from 2010-2011. • The number subtracts graduation rates from 100 percent and concludes that the rest are dropouts. This leaves out some categories such as students who need a fifth year to graduate. • Finally, the data is for the entire Broward and Miami-Dade school districts, not the congressional district, which includes only portions of those districts Moise didn’t explain these caveats on his campaign website when he made his claim. He erred by trying to boil down a complex area of data into a single phrase about dropout rates that requires far more explanation and more thorough data. We rank this claim False.

pomt-07899	"From 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent" while "the median wage in the country over (the same) 10 years went up 3 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/03/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-tanglles-wall-street-journals-steve-/	Rachel Maddow got into a spirited back-and-forth with Stephen Moore of the Wall Street Journal on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher show Jan. 21, 2011, over the effect of the Reagan tax cuts and income inequality. Moore got the ball rolling with his comment, "I say the Reagan tax cuts were the greatest economic policy of the last 50 years." Maddow disagreed. As the two exchanged arguments, Maddow tried to get out a statistic about growing income disparity during the 1980s, but she was repeatedly interrupted. Frustrated, Maddow raised her hand and finally stood up to belt out her point. "From 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent," Maddow said. "The median wage in the country over 10 years went up 3 percent. That means for the best people, the people that were best off in the country, it was the Matterhorn, and for everybody else in the country, it was like this (she drew a flat line with her finger). So, if you were rich, Reagan was awesome, and if you were anybody else, it sucked." "You've got to get the statistics right," Moore said. "That's not true." In fact, Moore said, "everyone's income went up...The lowest income people had the biggest gains." Economists disagree over the effect of tax cuts, and we're certainly not going to try to settle that here, but we can check the underlying statistics behind Maddow's point. The problem is that there are lots of ways to slice income statistics (do you include investment income such as capital gains? pre- or post-tax income?), and neither Maddow nor Moore responded to our e-mails seeking clarification and backup material. In a Jan. 22, 2011, article on the conservative NewsBusters website, reporter Noel Sheppard wrote that, "Not surprisingly, Maddow was 100 percent wrong." Sheppard attacked Maddow's claim about the median wage in the country going up just 3 percent between 1980 and 1990. NewsBusters cited a Census Bureau table which shows that median income for men in 1980 was $12,530 per year; and grew to $20,293 in 1990 -- a 62 percent increase. For women, this figure went from $4,920 in 1980 to $10,070 in 1990 -- a 105 percent jump. "This means that the median income for the entire population in that decade rose at roughly the same rate as Maddow claimed the income for the top 1 percent did," Sheppard wrote. Those figures are correct for the actual income figures at the time. But they aren't adjusted for inflation. When the 1980 and 1990 figures are adjusted for inflation, the increase for men gets awfully close to Maddow's figure -- going from $31,054 in 1980 to $32,284 in 1990, a 4 percent increase (the median income jump was 31 percent for women). Further complicating things, however, is that Maddow toggled between two different statistics, first citing income statistics for the top 1 percent; then citing overall median wage figures. Income and wage are two different things. Income can include a lot of things other than just wages, such as investment income or capital gains. To get more precisely at what Maddow cited, Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution pointed us to Census Bureau figures for the median annual wage of "workers who are on full-time schedules." These statistics show that the inflation-adjusted median earnings of full-time male workers fell 4.5 percent between 1980 and 1990 (declining from $46,127 to $44,033 ) while the real median earnings of full-time female workers increased 13.6 percent (climbing from $27,750 to $31,535). You would think the Census would provide combined figures in this category for for men and women, but it doesn't. As a result, Burtless said, "it’s hard for me to guess whether the real median wage for both men and women increased exactly 3 percent during the decade. However, the estimate does not look unreasonable in view of the relative number of male and female full-time workers in the labor force." As for Maddow's claim that from 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent, the Census Bureau again leaves us wanting. The Census Bureau tracks income by quintiles, but not the top 1 percent. It's unclear where Maddow got her statistic, but several economists suggested it must have been from the analyses of tax data performed by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. So we contacted Saez, an economics professor at the University of California Berkeley, who said tax data he compiled with Piketty show that average inflation-adjusted income (pre-tax) per family in the top 1 percent increased from $427,000 in 1980 to $661,000 in 1990. That's a 55 percent increase. Meanwhile, the average income (pre-tax) per family in the bottom 90 percent fell slightly from $30,900 in 1980 to $30,800 in 1990, he said. You can see all of the results in Table A6 of their report. So how did Maddow get to 80 percent? Saez believes Maddow must have used statistics in the report that did not include capital gains (Table A4), which show the same stagnation in the bottom 90 percent but a bigger, 74 percent increase at the top 1 percent. "All economists agree that the 1980s saw a huge increase in inequality," Saez said. There was "increased concentration at the top and big losses at the bottom (especially during the early 1980s recession)." Added Burtless: "Ms. Maddow seems to be completely correct that incomes at the very top increased many times faster than the real median wage." As for Moore's claim that "everyone's income went up...The lowest income people had the biggest gains," he's only half right. It's true that everyone's income went up. But adjusted for inflation, the lowest income people saw the smallest percentage of gain. Said Burtless: "Incomes rose in the bottom, middle, and top portions of the income distribution as Mr. Moore stated, although the income gains were certainly bigger at the top compared with the bottom. These results clearly show that low-income Americans did not obtain the biggest income gains between 1980 and 1990." According to Census data, when presented in equivalent 2009 dollars, the income among the lowest fifth increased about 6.3 percent (from $10,682 to $11,400). That's the lowest gain compared to other quintiles: 7.9 percent for the second lowest fifth; 8 percent for the middle fifth; 10.5 percent for the fourth fifth, and 20.3 percent in the highest fifth. Incomes rose 28.2 percent among the top 5 percent. Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute summed up the Maddow-Moore exchange this way: "She's right, he's wrong. He might have been thinking about the '90s, when everyone’s income did indeed go up, even at the bottom, (but even in the nineties the people at the top made the biggest gains). You have to go back to the '50s and '60s to find business cycles where growth was faster at the bottom." Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Princeton and author of "Unequal Democracy," believes the best indicator of the real income change of the top 1 percent between 1980 and 1990 is the Piketty/Saez figure of 55 percent. "I’d say Maddow exaggerated a bit but got the general story right, whereas Moore was not within shouting distance of anything true," Bartels said. "Of course, how much of this can be attributed to the Reagan tax cuts is a separate question, and worth debating in its own right." Again, we're not wading into the debate about whether Reagan tax cuts had anything to do with the growing gap in income inequality. To see some of the varying viewpoints among economists on that issue, check out an article by Slate's Timothy Noah on Sept. 9, 2010, which ran under the headline, "The United States of Inequality: Can We Blame Income Inequality on Republicans?" At issue are the statistics Maddow and Moore used to underpin their arguments. In this case, Maddow said that "from 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent" and that at the same time "the median wage in the country over 10 years went up 3 percent." The median wage in the country, expressed in constant 2009 dollars, does appear to be in the range Maddow cited (though with statistics broken out separately for men and women, we can't be precise). As for Maddow's claim that the top 1 percent saw their income go up that decade by roughly 80 percent, that's close but only if you cite numbers that do not include capital gains. It's not unreasonable to cite those numbers, but the economists we spoke to preferred to use figures that included capital gains, which show the top 1 percent saw an increase of 55 percent. Either way, Maddow's point that the 1980s were much more of a boon for the very rich than everyone else is valid. And so we rate Maddow's statement Mostly True.

pomt-10948	"In December of 2017, the Prince William board of supervisors had a meeting ... (Corey Stewart) skipped that meeting to go campaign in Alabama for Roy Moore to be a U.S. senator … You haven't disavowed Roy Moore's name yet."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/24/tim-kaine/kaine-correct-stewart-skipped-board-meeting-campai/	During a recent campaign debate, Sen. Tim Kaine took aim at Republican Corey Stewart’s support for former Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost an Alabama special election after facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. "In December of 2017, the Prince William board of supervisors had a meeting ... you skipped that meeting to go campaign in Alabama for Roy Moore to be a U.S. senator," Kaine said at the July 21 debate, noting that the meeting covered topics such as zoning and the opioid crisis. Several minutes later, after Stewart dodged Kaine’s original question, Kaine added: "You haven't disavowed Roy Moore's name yet." Stewart, the at-large chair of Prince William County’s board of supervisors, has battled frequent criticism for his history with the far right. He has since renounced some activists with whom he previously associated, but he has not been shy about supporting estranged figures in his party, so we decided to see whether Kaine’s claim checked out. Stewart’s absence On Dec. 12, 2017, the Prince William County board of supervisors met to consider, among other things, an increase in spending on the county’s substance-abuse treatment programs. Stewart was not present at that meeting. He was on the campaign trail in Alabama with Moore, carrying out a plan he announced two days earlier in a news release, according to local reports. Stewart also detailed his visit to Alabama in a Facebook live video. He said he planned to fly to Atlanta, and drive a rental car to Montgomery in order to show support for Moore, who he said was a fellow "anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate." "If you’re wondering, why am I going down to Alabama, why is it important, and that is because we’re all in this together, folks, we’re all in this together," Stewart said. "It is the establishment Republicans who are together colluding with Democrats, with liberals, and they’re trying to take out every single anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate." "I’m going down there to support him," Stewart added. "Next year, when the establishment comes after me … I’m hoping, of course, that I will get his help as well." Stewart later tweeted a photo taken at the Moore rally in Alabama. "With @UofAlabama students at the @MooreSenate rally! #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp," he wrote. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Stewart’s support for Roy Moore Most conservatives severed ties with Moore, but Stewart supported him even as accusations surfaced detailing his sexual misconduct with teenagers. "I am not going to cut and run from a good man like Judge Roy Moore," he said in a Facebook live video. Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, pointed to multiple occasions when Stewart defended Moore or explained his belief that Moore should have been presumed innocent until proven guilty because the accusations were decades-old. In a post-debate interview with PBS NewsHour anchor Judy Woodruff, who moderated the debate, Stewart refused to condemn Moore. "I do believe (Moore) when he said he didn’t do that," Stewart said. "I thought that he was treated unfairly," Stewart added. "I don’t think it’s right that 40 years after something supposedly happened, somebody comes out and says that you do something, and then, instead of them having to prove that you did it, it was left upon him to try to prove that he didn’t do it." Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch acknowledged Stewart’s continued support for Moore in an email. "Corey never claimed to have disavowed Moore," he wrote. "To claim so would be false." Our ruling Kaine said Stewart skipped a Prince William County board of supervisors meeting to campaign for Moore. Stewart missed a Dec. 12, 2017, meeting at which the board of supervisors voted on a proposal to boost funding for programs meant to cope with the opioid crisis. Instead, he attended a rally for Moore in Alabama because he said it was important to support an "anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate." Stewart has not disavowed Moore and refused to do so in an interview after the debate. We rate Kaine’s statement True.

pomt-09712	You must list all your guns on your 2010 tax return.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/02/chain-email/list-your-guns-your-1040-no-bill-never-passed/	It's a scary time to be a gun owner in the United States — at least if you believe some of the claims made by gun-rights groups and spread in chain e-mails. We recently investigated a claim made by Gun Owners of America that a version of a health care bill currently in Congress "could be used to ban guns in home self-defense," and rated it False. We gave the National Rifle Association a Pants on Fire for making a similar claim during the 2008 election. So we were skeptical when a reader forwarded us a chain e-mail that claims the following: "Now 'all Guns' must be listed on your next (2010) tax return! As if we didnt [sic] have enough to get upset about! If you have a gun, I hope it isn't registered! Senate Bill SB-2099 will require us to put on our 2009 1040 federal tax form all guns that you have or own. It will require fingerprints and a tax of $50 per gun." The e-mail continued: "This bill was introduced on Feb.. 24, 2009, by the Obama staff. BUT... this bill will only become public knowledge 30 days after the new law becomes effective! This is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Act of 1986. This means that the Finance Committee has passed this without the Senate voting on it at all. Trust Obama ? ...... you must be kidding!" The e-mail is wrong in so many ways that it's hard to know where to begin. But here we go: • The "Obama staff" can't introduce bills, only members of Congress can. • No such bill was introduced on Feb. 24 of this year. But there was such a bill introduced on Feb. 24, 2000, by Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island. • The bill didn't pass. Indeed, it died in committee, as most bills do. The e-mail wrongly says the law will take effect with your "next tax return." The bill would have required people to register handguns in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, the government would have shared that information with law enforcement agencies, and guns would have been taxed when they were manufactured or sold. But again, the bill did not pass. • The National Rifle Association wrote a blog post discrediting the e-mail, saying that it was "recycling an old alert that wasn’t even accurate when it was new," and noting that the bill in question "disappeared without any action by the Senate, back when Bill Clinton was still in the White House." The e-mail is also ridiculously false with its claim that "this bill will only become public knowledge 30 days after the new law becomes effective." Although Congress has its share of closed-door meetings, bills are made public on the Thomas Web site . Indeed, that's how we found this one. It's worth noting that variations of this chain e-mail have been circulating for many years. The Web site UrbanLegends.about.com wrote about this rumor back in September 2000. Only recently has a new version emerged. And like so many incorrect e-mails we've examined lately, it targets President Barack Obama. This e-mail makes so many ridiculously false claims that we have to set the meter ablaze — Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-11-02T13:50:58	2009-11-01	['None']
pomt-08684	"When the mayor of Providence's brother wrote over 100 grand in bad checks to the city, Joe Fernandez didn't have the guts to prosecute him. He let him off the hook."	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/10/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-says-fernandez-didnt-prosecute-mayors-br/	Democratic Attorney General candidate Peter Kilmartin came out swinging against primary opponent Joseph Fernandez last week, accusing the former Providence city solicitor of not having the courage to prosecute John Cicilline, Mayor David Cicilline's brother, after John wrote two bad checks to the city. "When the mayor of Providence's brother wrote over 100 grand in bad checks to the city, Joe Fernandez didn't have the guts to prosecute him. He let him off the hook," the Kilmartin campaign ad says. The facts of this case have been widely reported but the story broke two years ago. So let's review. In the spring of 2006, Providence was trying to collect back taxes from Felix Nelson Garcia for his storefront property on Cranston Street. John Cicilline, Garcia's lawyer, wrote a $75,000 check on his law office account to the city tax collector's office, to be used as collateral. Garcia was to pay the tax bill once he refinanced the property. To allow the refinancing to happen, the city lifted a lien on the property. When that check expired, Cicilline wrote a replacement check on the same account, which apparently never had sufficient funds to cash it. Cicilline maintained that the city knew that the money wasn't there. City officials said they agreed to the deal because Cicilline was a well-regarded criminal lawyer who was unlikely to jeopardize that distinction or do anything to embarrass his brother. (Cicilline was subsequently sentenced to 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty in June 2008 to shaking down drug-dealer clients. He is now disbarred.) The check was never cashed and the property changed hands without the city getting its money. The incident led to the firing of Tax Collector Robert P. Ceprano. ProJo.com reported the news of the bad check on Sept. 18, 2008. By then, Garcia's bill, with interest, had grown to $132,000. Five days later, Providence Police Chief Dean M. Esserman asked the state police to investigate. They spent nearly nine months on the probe, before sending the case to Attorney General Patrick Lynch. Two months later, Lynch's office decided against criminal prosecution. Now back to the campaign ad. During all of this, Fernandez, as city solicitor, was Providence's top lawyer. Neither Fernandez nor his office prosecuted the case. Kilmartin says Fernandez should have done that, implying that he didn't because John Cicilline is the mayor's brother. The Kilmartin ad leaves out a lot of important information. It is true that Cicilline wrote two bad checks totaling "over" $100,000. The actual total was $150,000. But the second $75,000 check was a replacement for the first check, which had expired. Cicilline never owed the city "over $100,000," as the ad implies. As a result, the phrasing of the Kilmartin ad is technically true but grossly misleading. Second, and perhaps more important, state law prohibits any city or town solicitor from prosecuting a felony. That authority rests with the attorney general, who declined to take action after an independent investigation by state police. Robert Craven, a lawyer for the Kilmartin campaign and former state prosecutor, argued that Fernandez should have repackaged the case as a misdemeanor charge or filed a civil suit against Cicilline to get the money. (That wouldn't actually be a prosecution. Only crimes are prosecuted; civil cases are litigated.) The Fernandez campaign said that, by that time, the city solicitor's office had a conflict of interest because Ceprano (the fired tax collector who had been represented by Fernandez's office) had sued the city for wrongful discharge. To avoid the conflict, Fernandez hired Deming E. Sherman, of Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge, to pursue a civil lawsuit to recover the unpaid taxes. David M. Zlotnick, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law, said Fernandez's sending the case to a private lawyer seems more than reasonable. "If you refer the case to outside counsel, then the suit is going to get pursued." In a later e-mail he said, "There seems to be no effort to sweep this under the rug or avoid tackling a serious matter." Sherman says Fernandez instructed him about a year ago to explore potential civil action against Scott L. Hammer, the private attorney who dealt with the Garcia account on the city's behalf. The campaign provided us with an April 21, 2009 letter from Sherman acknowledging that he would represent the city "in connection with potential litigation against Scott L. Hammer and John M. Cicilline..." Sherman said he has been actively pursuing a case against Hammer and depositions are still being taken. He would not say whether any action was planned against Cicilline, who has since been released from prison. And, for the record, the Kilmartin ad says, in big letters, "Joe Fernandez failed to prosecute corruption - Providence Journal 4/1/09." The Journal's story that day, headlined "Deadline near for suit in Providence tax case," says no such thing. To sum it up: * Kilmartin's ad cites a dollar amount that is misleading. * He attacks Fernandez for not bringing criminal charges, when Fernandez, by law, had no authority to do so. * He faults him for not bringing a civil case, when Fernandez, for ethics reasons, turned the case over to a private lawyer to pursue potential civil action. His allegations against Fernandez fall into the realm of ridiculous, and we give him a Pants On Fire!	None	Peter Kilmartin	None	None	None	2010-09-10T00:02:00	2010-09-01	['None']
pomt-05430	"In my years in the State Legislature, I have never voted for a tax increase."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/29/joseph-kyrillos/us-senate-hopeful-joe-kyrillos-claims-he-never-vot/	After two decades as a state senator, Joe Kyrillos has been involved in politics long enough to know one should never say "never." But that’s just what Kyrillos, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, did in this April 17 statement on his campaign website: "In my years in the State Legislature, I have never voted for a tax increase." That’s a bold claim, but as PolitiFact New Jersey found, also an inaccurate one. Kyrillos, who represents part of Monmouth County, voted in December 1997 to double the tax rates on cigarettes and tobacco products. In more recent years, Kyrillos also has supported some measures labeled by his own Republican colleagues as "tax increases." First, we’ll talk about that tax increase on smokers. About a month after then-Gov. Christine Whitman won re-election, the Republican-controlled Legislature on Dec. 18, 1997 approved Assembly bill A-2157. That legislation doubled the cigarette tax from 40 cents to 80 cents per pack, and the tobacco products wholesale tax from 24 percent to 48 percent of the wholesale price. According to the minutes of that day’s proceedings, Kyrillos was one of 33 senators to vote for the bill. The next day, Whitman signed the bill into law. Also, in 1998, Kyrillos was a co-sponsor of a bill to increase the gas tax, but since the measure never made it to the Senate floor, Kyrillos didn't get a chance to vote on it. That’s good enough to prove Kyrillos’ claim is wrong, but let’s also look at his votes on what his own Republican colleagues have referred to as "tax increases." Over the last several years, the Democrat-led Legislature has approved numerous tax and fee increases -- a subject that Republican legislators frequently criticize. In October, we fact-checked a claim by Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. that Democrats had increased taxes more than 115 times. Calling them all "tax increases," a Senate Republican spokesman sent us a list of tax increases, fee hikes and tax policy changes between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. Kyrillos voted against most of those bills, but not all of them. Here are a couple of examples where -- by his own party’s measure -- Kyrillos supported tax increases: In January 2008, Kyrillos supported a bill that increased fees and penalties related to handling explosives. In June 2009, Kyrillos voted for legislation that, in part, allowed certain municipalities to impose a tax on car rentals. It’s worth noting that Kyrillos has rejected certain major tax increases in recent years. For example, when the Legislature agreed in July 2006 to increase the sales tax to 7 percent and expand it to various transactions, Kyrillos said no. Kyrillos also rejected a measure in June 2009 to temporarily increase certain state income tax rates. In response to our findings, Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin pointed to the senator’s record of opposing "broad-based tax increases, such as increases in income, sales and business taxes." Cronin cited four of Kyrillos’ specific votes against new or increased taxes. Those measures included the sales tax increase in 2006; a hotel tax in 2003; a business tax increase in 2002; and a tax against health insurers in 2005. "Most recently, Senator Kyrillos supported Governor Chris Christie’s local 2 percent property tax and spending cap," Cronin said in an e-mail, referring to a July 2010 vote in favor of the cap. Our ruling In an April 17 message on his campaign website, Kyrillos offered this biographical note: "In my years in the State Legislature, I have never voted for a tax increase." Kyrillos has voted against certain major tax hikes -- such as increasing sales and income taxes -- but the senator is wrong to claim he "never voted for a tax increase." In December 1997, Kyrillos voted to double the tax rates on cigarettes and tobacco products. More recently, Kyrillos has supported some measures labeled by his own Republican colleagues as "tax increases." We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12100	"We’ve got a police station that’s under construction right now, they are actually ahead of schedule and under budget."	/florida/statements/2017/aug/24/rick-kriseman/new-st-pete-police-station-under-budget-and-ahead-/	Rick Baker has accused Mayor Rick Kriseman of spending wildly on a new police station, saying it's $35 million over budget. Kriseman, in contrast, says the project is actually under budget. "We’ve got a police station that’s under construction right now, they are actually ahead of schedule and under budget," Kriseman told Beauty & The ‘Burg, a podcast on LifeImprovementRadio.com, on Aug. 9. That makes two competing narratives about the police station from the two leading candidates in the Aug. 29 mayoral primary. We wondered who was right — is the new police headquarters under budget, over budget, or none of the above? The upshot: It’s simply too soon to say anything about the budget and timeline for the construction of the new police department building. What you need to know about St. Petersburg's plans for a new police department For over a decade, there have been plans to replace the city’s police building on 1300 First Ave. N. The old headquarters was built in multiple parts. The east side of the police station was opened in 1951 and it included a jail and additional space for police operations. The building on the west side was opened in 1978. Eventually, the jail located inside the east side building was shut down and inmates were sent to the Pinellas County jail. It was not until 2015 that Kriseman announced there was enough money to construct a new police headquarters. St. Petersburg plans to spend about $86 million on new police facilities. That includes $79 million for the headquarters and $6.5 million for a new shooting range. The building will be 167,500 square-feet and able to withstand a Category 4 hurricane. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new headquarters was in late April 2017. City officials estimated the project will be done in December 2018, and fully operational in spring 2019. Is the project under budget? Not really. The basis for Kriseman’s comment was the possibility of the city not tapping into a $1.4 million contingency fund for unexpected costs. "The mayor's remarks were based on conversations with staff, who informed him that things are progressing well, no surprises, and that there is a chance we may not need all the contingency money and could finish under budget," said spokesman Ben Kirby. "But there is a long way to go." City architect Raul Quintana said the amount of contingency dollars fluctuates during various points of the project. "Generally, the earlier we are in a project and the greater the unknowns, then the higher the project contingency," Quintana said. Despite the possibility of not needing this money, Quintana said the nature of the project is very complicated, so the city plans to keep the contingency money in play. So, only four months in, it’s too soon to say the project is under budget with certainty. The construction contract with the Construction Manager is a little more than $61 million and the city has spent about $4 million. As for the timeline, Quintana said the project was ahead of schedule by at least three weeks and said he "feels good" about how the project has progressed. But with so much time to go, there are some factors that could affect the timeline, such as the weather. For the record, Baker's point that the project is massively over budget is also misleading. We're fact-checking what he said about the new police station in a separate fact-check to come. Baker’s campaign argued that Kriseman’s remarks were directly contradicted by reporting on the police station. They sent three news articles that allude to how the costs and plans have evolved over the years. But the stories don't refer to the project as either over budget. Here's what happened: In 2006, with Baker as mayor, the original estimate to replace the police station came in at $50 million. As the economic downturn set in, the city looked at other options, including building a scaled-down version while making updates to the old facility. However, after the economy picked back up, Kriseman announced the city would have enough money to build a new station again for $70 million. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Jeff Forrest, the president of Winter Park Construction in Maitland, Fla., and someone used to handling big construction projects said it’s too premature to make claims about a project of this size being under or over budget. Same goes for the timeline. "If I was building a project I would never communicate that early in a job because there’s just too many unknowns," Forrest said. "There’s too many opportunities just to easily lose that time." He said there are a number of challenges including labor shortages in the construction industry and Florida’s volatile weather that could affect the timeline and costs of a project. "We can all be optimistic. I’m an optimistic person, but I’m a realistic person when it comes to building and recognizing the challenges that exist," he said. Our ruling Kriseman said construction on the new police station is "ahead of schedule and under budget." In reality, there is no definitive evidence that supports Kriseman’s claim about being under budget, and the city’s architect estimates that the project is three weeks ahead of schedule. The most important thing to note in this check is the that the police station still has a long way to go and the progress could change. So any claims about the project being over or under budget or ahead of schedule are too premature. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10358	E-mail quotes Maureen Dowd column that Obama has received suspicious contributions from Saudi Arabia, Iran and China.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/08/chain-email/fake-column-spreads-unfounded-claims/	Add this one to the many ways chain e-mails are spreading false information in the campaign: bogus columns. A new chain e-mail, echoed by dozens of blog postings, claims to have a column from New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that criticizes Sen. Barack Obama for accepting suspicious contributions from Iran, Saudi Arabia and China. It has Dowd's byline and a headline that says "OBAMA'S TROUBLING INTERNET FUND RAISING." Some versions of the e-mail even have Dowd's picture. The column, which is dated June 29, 2008, says Dowd got a call from "one of the Obama's campaign [sic] internet geeks" who told her the campaign has received a flood of small contributions from overseas. The contributors were difficult to trace, the column says, but they came from a small number of banks and credit cards in various countries, particularly from "Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries." The column says that "another concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP (Internet provider) with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges." The column says campaign officials were aware "these donations were very likely coming from sources other than American voters," but they concluded it was legal to accept them. Federal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to the presidential campaigns, but donations from Americans living overseas are legal and fairly common. The column calls the decision to accept them "a shocking revelation" and says the Obama campaign should be audited. (You can find the full text of the e-mail here .) The column is a fake. Dowd told us she did not write it and that "It just seems like anyone who is familiar with my column would know this wasn't me." For more detail on how the e-mail spread, see our story Bogus Dowd column spreads quickly. It's not clear who wrote the column. One of the early appearances of the column was when it was posted June 29, 2008, on a blog on AZCentral, the Arizona Republic newspaper site, by someone identified as Thomas Moore. In his bio, he describes himself as "a retired journalist/technical writer/illustrator" and a fan of Barry Goldwater. His photo on the blog is a computer animation of a man waving a McCain sign, although Moore has no apparent ties to the McCain campaign. When someone pointed out on his blog that the column was a fake, Moore wrote, "It appears that I may be the fool for posting the editorial, since I don't find it on the NYT Website, either. I'm checking with the friend who sent it to me, as to whether he copied it directly from the Website." But Moore then mused that it still might be accurate and that the New York Times might have pulled the column from the Web site because the newspaper feared a lawsuit. Moore could not be reached for comment. A posting on his blog from Monday said he was departing for a long sailing vacation. "I should return in September," he wrote, "so in my absence please torment the liberals just as if I were here." The Obama campaign says it follows federal law and does not accept donations from foreign citizens. Donors must certify that "I am a United States citizen or a lawfully-admitted permanent resident." Because the column is fake and provides no factual evidence to back up its assertion about foreign contributions, we don't consider there is enough evidence to address the allegation here. The issue for the Truth-O-Meter is whether Dowd wrote the column. She didn't, which makes the claim False.

pomt-01965	The decision to cancel the trademark of the Washington Redskins "is not the Patent and Trademark Office. This is Barack Obama."	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/19/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-reaches-claim-obama-blame-washington/	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the trademark registration of the Washington Redskins June 18 because it disparages American Indians, marking the latest but not the last development in a decades-old battle over the NFL team’s name. Should supporters of the team’s name blame Obama? That’s who conservative radio pundit Rush Limbaugh singled out on his popular radio show. Limbaugh says President Barack Obama audaciously, whimsically canceled the trademark in a show of political power and out of hyperpolitical correctness. "This is not the Patent and Trademark Office. This is Barack Obama," Limbaugh said, according to a transcript of his June 18 show. "... All this stuff is coming out of the executive branch. All of this, well, tyranny. It's all coming from the executive branch, and Obama owns the executive branch." At best, that’s an unproven conspiracy theory. We’ll walk you through it. Background about the ruling The ruling does not mean the team has to change its name. The team will keep its trademark registrations throughout the appeals process. If the ruling is upheld and the team loses, the team can still use the name "Redskins" but it could lose the legal rights of having a trademark, such as the federal government blocking counterfeit goods with its logo. There's also a possibility it could retain its "common law" rights without the federal trademark based on how long it has been used. Team attorneys played down the significance of the June 18 decision by highlighting the same trademark board’s 1999 ruling that also "canceled" the team’s name after an earlier challenge. The team won on appeal. Meanwhile, the trademark agency has not allowed trademarks with the term "Redskins" about a dozen times since 1992, when the earlier case was filed, because it "may" disparage American Indians, the Associated Press reported. Obama’s fingerprints The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is an independent administrative tribunal -- an identity it stressed in media materials announcing the decision. It operates within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which is a division of the Department of Commerce. The Commerce secretary, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office director and deputy director are presidential appointees that serve at his pleasure. From there, the Commerce secretary chooses the board’s 21 judges with input from the Patent and Trademark Office director. The chief judge, currently Judge Gerard F. Rogers, picks judges to preside over specific cases. In the Redskins matter, Rogers picked veteran judges because the case was viewed as setting a binding precedent for the board in similar cases, said Patrick Ross, Patent and Trademark Office deputy chief communications officer. The judges do not get terms or lifetime appointments. But they can’t be fired willy-nilly. They work like other civil service employees, not political appointees, and must be fired for cause. Like umbrella agencies for thousands of administrative judges around the country, the director and deputy director cannot tell the judges how to rule in a certain case. So, as in all things in Washington, politics plays some role. But the administrative law system is set up to try to remove politics as much as possible by creating barriers between the work of the judges and the politics of the bosses serving layers above them. Obama did wade into the debate last year, saying he would "think about changing" the team’s name if he were the owner in an October Associated Press interview "I don't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real legitimate concerns that people have about these things," Obama said. About the judges and their role Obama’s comments, plus the letter to team owner Dan Snyder signed by 50 U.S. Democratic senators, did draw politics into the fracas. But did that pressure interfere with an otherwise impartial decision? "There’s no evidence for that," said Elizabeth Rowe, University of Florida College of Law professor and director of the Program in Intellectual Property Law. "There is no room for that in the way the system is set up." The office makes hundreds of decisions a year and operates independently of the White House, she said. The decisions are made based on specific rules from Congress and legal interpretations from various courts’ decisions and precedents in intellectual property cases. And importantly, none of the three judges involved in the ruling were appointed while Obama was in office. All three took their seat during the terms of President George W. Bush. Judge Karen Kuhlke was appointed May 1, 2005. Judge Peter Cataldo was appointed May 14, 2006. And Judge Marc Bergsman was appointed Nov. 13, 2006. Bergsman dissented with Kuhlke and Cataldo in this case, arguing the trademark should not be canceled because the plaintiffs failed to show that a "substantial composite" of American Indians find the team’s name offensive and that its evidence was essentially a "database dump" that proved little. Kuhlke and Cataldo, on the other hand, found the trademarks were disparaging to Native Americans at the time they were registered, and the five people who brought it forth had standing because they were members of Native American tribes. As we noted earlier, judges in the same administrative court issued the same finding in 1999, before it was overturned on appeal. Our ruling Limbaugh said, the decision to cancel the trademark of the Washington Redskins "is not the Patent and Trademark Office. This is Barack Obama." Limbaugh, for whom a spokesman could not be reached, does not prove that Obama usurped the administrative law judges’ hands in canceling the trademark. The court issued the same decision in 1999. This time, the two judges who found the trademarks disparaging were appointed in the Bush years. The judges do not serve at the pleasure of the president and have to be fired for cause. We rate Limbaugh’s claim False.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2014-06-19T17:05:14	2014-06-18	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-14015	The University of Wisconsin System had a "jobs-for-life tenure program" for professors.	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/03/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-uw-tenure-policy-used-promise-jo/	In Wisconsin, "tenure" has become a contentious word. In March, the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents made it easier for tenured professors to lose their jobs. The move spawned outrage among faculty members and put lawmakers who supported the changes on the defensive. While some faculty members dubbed the new policy "#FakeTenure," Gov. Scott Walker framed the changes as modest and necessary tweaks to give the system more flexibility to deal with tight budgets and changing student needs. On May 16, 2016, in an interview with conservative radio host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM, Walker described recent no-confidence votes by faculty members aimed at the UW Regents and System President Ray Cross as overreactions. People were upset, Walker said, because the Regents "had the audacity to put just a slight restraint on this ‘jobs-for-life’ tenure program that they have at the University of Wisconsin System." Walker used the jobs-for-life phrase several times that week. It’s not an uncommon refrain. Supporters of university reform frequently characterize tenure as a "job-for-life" guarantee, a concept meant to sound absurd to workers outside of academia. While the concept of tenure dates to the Middle Ages, tenure as we know it was defined in 1940 and quickly became the widespread practice at colleges and universities. It was created to bolster academic freedom and to protect professors from being fired for expressing unpopular views or pursuing research considered controversial. But what about Walker’s claim? When it comes to the old UW tenure system, is he right about "jobs for life"? How the program worked As evidence that UW faculty members had "jobs for life" under the former policy, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson pointed to the Board of Regents’ policy document on tenure. The statement defines tenure as an appointment of a faculty member "for an unlimited period." Evenson noted Merriam Webster defines "unlimited" as "not limited in number or amount" and added: "The UW System’s use of ‘unlimited’ in this case is obviously in reference to the unlimited period under which one is employed under a tenure appointment." Evenson also cited an opinion piece for the website Right Wisconsin written by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester. That piece said records obtained by Vos’ office from the UW System showed only six tenured faculty members were fired for just cause in the last 20 years. The UW System has 4,560 tenured faculty members, according to the article. That makes the odds of being let go very low — but not non-existent. Next, we asked a UW System spokesman about the system’s policies. Spokesman Alex Hummel acknowledged there have been few cases of faculty members being dismissed after attaining tenure, but said the word "unlimited" does not signify eternity. Rather, he said, it recognizes the lack of a specified limit. He also said the six-in-20-years statistic doesn’t account for situations in which faculty members, when faced with being fired, chose to resign instead. He didn’t have data on how many times this happened in the same time period. We also checked with the American Association of University Professors, which advised UW on its changes and whose model policies form the basis of tenure at institutions around the country. A spokeswoman said the UW System’s original policy aligned with the group’s model procedures, which say tenured appointments can be terminated for three reasons: just cause, such as misconduct; program discontinuations due to educational considerations; or financial emergencies that threaten the university’s existence. The changes in UW’s tenure policies expanded the criteria decision-makers use to determine if a program should be discontinued. In the past, if a program was discontinued, faculty members would have the option to be placed in another department. Under the new policy, decision-makers can consider — among other factors — if the program’s work is duplicated in another department, if student demand for the program has decreased or if the program is not cost-effective for the institution. In such cases, no new job is guaranteed and the decision is ultimately left to chancellors. Even before the change in Wisconsin, "faculty members with tenure could lose their jobs in case of financial exigency," Laura Markwardt, a spokeswoman for the group, said in email. "They could also be terminated for cause." Thus, the old policy had grounds for dismissal, undermining Walker’s "jobs for life" claim. The fact it was rarely used does not mean it was not there. But we think the underlying point Walker was making is a valid one. As a practical matter, the extremely rare usage of the provisions can, in effect, make it a job for life. Our rating Walker described the UW System’s original policy as a "‘jobs-for-life’ tenure program." He left out the fact that even before the Board of Regents broadened the grounds for dismissal of tenured faculty members, individuals could be dismissed under several circumstances, such as misconduct and financial difficulties that threaten the university’s existence. But because dismissals under that policy were extremely rare, being granted tenure effectively promised someone a job for life. Our definition of Half True is "the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context." That fits here.

pomt-15046	Says "Bernie Sanders was there when it came to (same-sex) marriage 20 years ago. ... He was there when it wasn't popular."	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/29/chuck-todd/nbcs-chuck-todd-bernie-sanders-there-same-sex-marr/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign serve as an almost constant reminder that Hillary Clinton has not always taken the lead on issues near and dear to the more liberal members of the Democratic Party. She only recently declared that she opposed the Keystone XL pipeline that would link oil from the tar sand fields of Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. On same-sex marriage, Clinton’s views evolved. As PolitiFact has described, in 1999, Clinton both supported the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between a man and woman, and legal recognition of civil unions. By 2007, she opposed DOMA, but fell short of backing same-sex marriage. Then in 2013, she came out in favor of same-sex marriage pure and simple. Chuck Todd, the host of NBC’s Meet the Press, focused on same-sex marriage during an interview with Clinton on Sept. 27, 2015. "Bernie Sanders has been where you are on these issues," Todd said. "Bernie Sanders was there when it came to marriage 20 years ago. Do you think one of the reasons he's doing well right now is some progressives think, ‘Well, you know what? He was there when it wasn't popular.’" Clinton said Sanders could speak for himself and used the question to attack Republicans. Here, we wanted to look at whether Sanders supported same-sex marriage two decades ago. What we found was long-standing support for gay rights in general, a voting record consistent with same-sex marriage, but not much in the way of public statements on behalf of same-sex marriage itself. An early gay rights backer Todd said Sanders was "there" on same-sex marriage 20 years ago, but we found evidence pointing back even further. In the early 1970s, Sanders ran for governor of Vermont under the banner of the Liberty Union party, a coalition of leftist groups. The party platform called for making taxes tougher on corporations and lighter on families, an end to the Vietnam War and a number of measures to get government out of people’s private lives. "The Liberty Union believe that there are entirely too many laws that regulate human behavior," Sanders wrote in an open letter. "Let us abolish all laws which attempt to impose a particular brand of morality or ‘right’ on people. Let’s abolish all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, sexual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, etc.)." There’s an image of that letter, thanks to Alternet. While you could read Sanders’ sweeping reference to all laws dealing with homosexuality as including same-sex marriage, it doesn’t specifically say that. As mayor of Burlington, Vt., Sanders supported a gay pride parade in 1983, saying "we must all be committed to the mutual respect of each other’s lifestyle." Sanders also put through a 1984 housing anti-discrimination ordinance that protected people based on "his or her sexual preference." In 1995 on the House floor, Sanders came to his feet to chastise a Republican congressman who attacked supporters of a tougher Clean Water Act as "the same people that would put homos in the military." According to a Boston Globe article at the time, "You used the words 'homos in the military,' " Sanders shouted at Cunningham. "You have insulted thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country." So Sanders has a long track record on the side of gay rights in general. When it comes to same-sex marriage and Todd's reference to "20 years ago," Todd is pointing to Sanders' votes related to the Defense of Marriage Act. The Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 In May 1996, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., introduced a bill most notable for its section on definitions. The bill, best known as DOMA, empowered states to disregard same-sex marriages that might be legal in other states. It also defined marriage as "only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife." Sanders had a couple of key opportunities to vote as DOMA moved through the House. As the bill was headed for a final vote, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., offered an amendment that would allow each state to set its own definition of marriage. Sanders joined about 100 lawmakers in supporting Frank’s amendment, far short of the total needed. On DOMA itself, Sanders was part of a smaller group of opponents, just 67. The bill passed and President Bill Clinton signed it in September. We wondered if Sanders made any public statements about DOMA in 1996. A search of the Congressional Record and the Nexis news database turned up nothing. His campaign staff couldn’t provide any examples from that time. We contacted Susan Murray, a Burlington lawyer and a co-founder of the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force. Murray said members of her group met with Sanders in 1996. "He opposed DOMA and explicitly told Freedom to Marry so," Murray told us. "The meeting was not focused on whether Bernie affirmatively supported marriage equality." Same-sex marriage was not on the legislative table in the mid 1990s. When Todd said Bernie was on board before it was popular, the survey numbers back him up. In 1996, Gallup found that 68 percent of the public opposed marriage between couples of the same sex. Vermont passed a civil union law in 2000. Sanders supported it. The year before, Gallup found that 62 percent of the public opposed marriages between people of the same sex. In 2006, Sanders opposed a Republican-sponsored constitutional amendment that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. In an Associated Press interview, Sanders said the measure was designed to divide the public, and he praised Vermont’s civil union law. Vermont "led the way," but noted that it was "a very divisive debate." The AP reported that when asked if Vermont should legalize same-sex marriage, Sanders said, "Not right now, not after what we went through." Our ruling Todd said that Sanders was "there" 20 years ago on the issue of same-sex marriage. What we found specific to same-sex marriage is that Sanders opposed defining marriage exclusively as between a man and a woman. He expressed that opinion through his votes, and in conversations with activists in his state. Todd’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-14941	"The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country."	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/26/sean-hannity/250000-syrian-refugees-us-fact-check-trump-hannity/	Editor’s note: After this fact-check originally published, Sean Hannity responded and provided the source of his claim. We have updated the fact-check to include his source and our analysis of it. The original version of this fact-check is archived here. The ruling remains Pants on Fire. The waves of refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq have given the conflict there a domestic immediacy in the race for the White House. While Europe is absorbing the great majority of refugees, some are headed toward the United States. The question is, how many? About 250,000, according to Fox News host Sean Hannity. During an interview with Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush on Oct. 19, 2015, Hannity worried that ISIS would try to infiltrate the arriving masses. "You see the backlash emerging now in Europe over the refugee problem for Syria and Iraq," Hannity said. "The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 refugees into this country." "We can’t take 250,000 refugees," Bush responded. "I’ve never heard that, and that would be impossible to imagine logistically for us to screen." In plain fact, President Barack Obama never said that, nor as far as anyone can tell has any member of his administration. In September, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Obama "informed his team that he would like them to accept -- at least make preparations to accept -- at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year." The 250,000 figure would dwarf the 120,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict the European community said it aims to relocate inside its members’ borders. What gives? A refugee crisis Hannity said his figure was based on a Sept. 20 Associated Press report. The AP report said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the United States would accept up to 85,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 and up to 100,000 in Fiscal Year 2017. In Fiscal Year 2015, the United States accepted nearly 70,000 refugees. Add those three numbers together and you get 255,000 refugees, Hannity said. That math is right, but none of it makes Hannity's claim accurate. The Associated Press report Hannity cited is discussing the total number of refugees admitted to the United States worldwide. But Hannity, in his remarks Oct. 19 and Oct. 20, was discussing refugees coming from Iraq and Syria, fearing they might be infiltrated by ISIS or al-Qaida. Here, again, is what Hannity said Oct. 19: "You see the backlash emerging now in Europe over the refugee problem for Syria and Iraq," Hannity said. "The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 refugees into this country." And Oct. 20: "You see what’s happening in Europe, there’s a huge backlash because of Syrian refugees and Iraqi refugees and the cost … We’re being told by our National Intelligence Director that ISIS and al-Qaida, not if, they will infiltrate the refugee community. This president has committed to nearly 250,000 coming to America." In reality, the commitment Hannity talks about largely has been the standard practice of the United States going back decades. The United States has been accepting on average more than 83,000 refugees a year worldwide from 1980-2008, State Department records show. In Fiscal Year 2013 (the last year for which we have data), the State Department said it would admit up to 70,000 refugees. It ended up admitting 69,926, records show. Those refugee spots are not awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis. They are allocated specifically by region. Europe has an annual limit. So does Africa. So does Near East/South Asia, the area that includes Syria and Iraq. In Fiscal Year 2013, for example, the United States accepted 4,205 Cuban refugees and 16,000 from countries in East Asia. So what’s changing? For Fiscal Year 2016, the Obama administration has proposed raising the cap to 85,000 refugees -- an increase of 15,000 refugees over the previous year. In 2017, the cap would move to 100,000. Many, though not all, of those extra spaces would be used for Syrian refugees, the State Department says. "We expect to admit some 1,600-1,800 Syrian refugees in FY 2015. In FY 2016, we project we will admit at least 10,000 Syrians," the State Department said in a report to Congress. The number of Iraqi refugees admitted to the United States has fluctuated over the years. In Fiscal Year 2013, the United States admitted 19,488 Iraqi refugees, up from 12,163 and 9,388 in Fiscal Years 2012 and 2011, respectively. Here is a breakdown of the State Department’s proposal by region for FY 2016: Refugee Admissions in FY 2014 and FY 2015 Proposed Refugee Admissions by Region for FY 2016 Region FY 2014 Actual arrivals FY 2015 Ceiling Revised FY 2015 Ceiling FY 2015 projected arrivals Proposed FY2016 Ceiling Africa 17,476 17,000 20,400 22,600 25,000 East Asia 14,784 13,000 17,300 18,200 13,000 Europe and Central Asia 959 1,000 2,300 2,350 4,000 Latin America/Caribbean 4,318 4,000 2,300 2,050 3,000 Near East/South Asia 32,450 33,000 27,700 24,800 34,000 Regional Subtotal 69,987 68,000 70,000 70,000 79,000 Unallocated Reserve 2,000 6,000 Total 69,987 70,000 70,000 70,000 85,000 Source: State Department The Migration Policy Institute gathers data to track the movement of people across the globe. "We are not aware of any suggestion that the United States would seek to resettle 250,000 refugees from Syria or Iraq," Michelle Mittelstadt, the institute’s director of communications, told us. Our ruling Hannity said, "The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country." Hannity says his number represents a three-year figure of the total number of refugees the United States is expected to admit worldwide. But that’s all lost on the viewing audience, who gets no idea of the time frame and would reasonably think he’s talking about only refugees from Syria and Iraq. From 1980-2008, the United States has accepted around 83,000 refugees a year. The Obama administration has said it will accept around 70,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2015 and is saying it will accept 85,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 and 100,000 in Fiscal Year 2017. Over those three years, that’s about 6,000 refugees more than the recent annual average. Overall, Obama is asking the country to take in an additional 45,000 refugees in 2016 and 2017. Most, but not all, of those additional refugees will come from Syria. Hannity’s claim rates Pants on Fire!	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2015-10-26T17:16:45	2015-10-19	['Iraq', 'Syria']
pomt-04665	Says Charlie Bass forfeits right to equal cost for TV ads under FCC rules	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/07/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-mclane-kuster-accused-charlie-bass-dirty-campa/	With the primary days away, some congressional campaigns are already focused on their future adversaries on the long road to Washington. Democrat Ann McLane Kuster, looking to overcome incumbent Rep. Charlie Bass, R-NHto be the next U.S. representative for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District, cried foul when she saw a new ad targeting her as a "left-wing darling." She accused Bass of violating federal regulations with his ad, "Not Working for Us," which is running locally on WMUR. Attack ads, like Bass’, are subject to a specific set of rules, and when they are broken, the candidate is no longer entitled to the same ad rate as competitors, Kuster argued. "Congressman Bass's campaign is in violation of a rule which states that within 45 days of the Primary Election, candidates must include ‘a clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of the candidate’ for a period of no less than four seconds at the end of advertisements," Kuster said in a news release emailed to New Hampshire reporters on Aug. 31. "Congressman Bass’s ad, ‘Not Working for Us,’ fails to meet this basic requirement and includes no photograph or other image of the candidate for any duration at the end of the advertisement." The lowest unit charge was established in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to protect candidates from excessive advertising costs -- charges no more than the lowest rates available to regular commercial advertisers. It’s ultimately up to the FCC to decide if its rules were broken, but PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to find out if Kuster was right about what the FCC rules say. When to show face Kuster’s Campaign Manager Garrick Delzell said he had no comment on the situation, but emailed us portions of Section 315 of The Communications Act of 1934 and a letter to WMUR outlining the accusations against Bass’ advertisement. The Communications Act requires that broadcast stations charge candidates for federal office for advertising "during the forty-five days preceding the date of the primary runoff election and during the sixty days preceding the date of a general or special election, in which such person is a candidate, the lowest unit charge of the station for the same class and amount of time for the same period," said Paul Burkett, Kuster for Congress treasurer, in a letter to WMUR. "A candidate loses this right to preferential pricing, however, if a candidates makes ‘any direct reference to another candidate for the same office, in any broadcast using the rights and conditions of access under this Act, unless such reference meets requirements of subparagraphs (C) or (D).’" In other words, Kuster argues that because Bass’ ad is directed at her, it had to meet certain requirements. OK, so let’s look at those subparagraphs. In this case it’s C, which deals with television broadcasts. It says that at the end of a TV broadcast, two things must appear simultaneously: (i) A clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of the candidate; and (ii) A clearly readable printed statement, identifying the candidate and stating that the candidate has approved the broadcast and that the candidate’s authorized committee paid for the broadcast. Kuster is right that Bass’ ad doesn’t contain a photo of Bass during the last four seconds of the broadcast.In the ad, Bass’ image does appear, but it’s during the first two seconds of the spot. In addition, the first words people hear is "I’m Charlie Bass and I approve this message." During the last four seconds of the commercial, it displays the words, "Approved and Paid for by Bass Victory Committee," and there’sno picture of Bass. According to Kuster, that means "the Bass Victory Committee and Charlie Bass are no longer entitled to benefit from the lowest unit charge." We called the Federal Communications Commission. Know your opponent The extra photo requirement relies on the idea that Kuster and Bass are running for the same office. Cut and dried, right? Well,as it turns out, the section of the Communications Act that Kuster cited does not even apply to her race against Bass -- at least not yet. When Congress adopted Section 315, commonly referred to as the "equal opportunity" or "equal time" provision, it required opposing candidates receive the same treatment -- that, if one candidate for an office gets air time, his opponent "for that office" is entitled to equal air time at the same cost, according to the FCC’s "The Law of Political Broadcasting and Cablecasting: Political Primer 1984." But the term "for that office" requires some careful distinction. Which candidates are actually opponents, and whether stations are required to afford them "equal opportunity" under Section 315, depends entirely on the election. "The FCC for many years interpreted Section 315 to mean that before the primaries or the nominating conventions take place, only those candidates who seek the nomination of the same party for the same office are entitled to opportunities equal to those of each other, since only they are opponents at that point," according to the Primer. In other words, the primary and the general election are considered two separate races. Opponents in a primary are candidates of the same party running for the nomination to run in the general election. Even if Bass and Kuster consider themselves opponents at this point, the FCC views it differently. In Bass’ case, his opponents are Gerard Beloin, Will Dean, Miroslaw Dziedzic and Dennis Lamare until the primary on Sept. 11. No Democrats have filed to run against Kuster in the primary, but under FCC rules, she still wouldn’t be Bass’ opponent until the general election in November. The content of Bass’ "Not Working For Us" advertisement -- which has been running for more than a week -- does not deal with "equal opportunity" issues or violate Section 315 because, according to the FCC, Bass’ opponents are the Republicans running against him in the primary, not his presumed Democratic opponent in the general election. For its part, WMUR doesn’t see anything wrong with the ad -- or what they are charging Bass for it. "At this point, it’s the opinion of our FCC attorney that the spot we’re running is legal and the rates we’re charging the campaign are fine as well," said Jeff Bartlett, WMUR’s President and General Manager. "From the FCC’s point of view, that’s fine," he added, referring to the image of Bass. "You can run it at the beginning or the end. There’s no regulation compelling us to do anything about it, because the FCC, which regulates us, says they can run it either place." Even if Bass and Kuster were currently considered opponents and Bass was found in violation of the rules, WMUR could still give him the lowest ad rate anyway, according to an opinion published by the Federal Elections Commission. (It’s worth noting, the Federal Election Commission has its own set of rules ensuring candidates identify themselves in TV ads and the Bass advertisement passes those bars too — his image can appear at the beginning or the end.) Our ruling Kuster says Bass’ "Not Working for Us" TV ad forfeited its right to WMUR’s lowest rates because it violated FCC rules. The rules Kuster cite only apply to advertisements about Bass’ Republican opponents in the primary. Until Kuster and Bass are direct opponents for the Second Congressional District general election race, her accusation is moot. Moreover, even if Bass did violate the rules, WMUR is still free to charge him the lowest rate. We give Kuster a False.	None	Ann McLane Kuster	None	None	None	2012-09-07T19:09:31	2012-08-31	['None']
pomt-02563	Says Peyton Manning struggles in cold weather games.	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/31/tweets/does-nfls-most-prolific-passer-struggle-cold/	It’s pretty much impossible to avoid talk about Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning and his career in cold weather. So we won’t even try. Blame the two-week gap between the conference championships and the Super Bowl. Blame ESPN for its non-stop coverage of the big game. Blame whoever decided a Super Bowl in New York (er, New Jersey — sorry, Sen. Booker) was a good idea. Blame the sports media that has exhausted nearly every angle of analysis before Sunday. Whatever the reason, Manning’s performance in frigid temps is one of the most talked about story angles heading into the first outdoor Super Bowl in a northern city. You can find a few examples here, here, here and here. People have come down on both sides of the debate. But is it true? We went deep into the future Hall of Famer’s numbers to find out. Small samples The biggest problem we found in drawing broad conclusions about Manning’s statistics in cold weather games is that the sample size is relatively small. Even for a quarterback who has dropped back to pass 9,300 times in his career including the playoffs, Manning has only played a small fraction of his 262 games in the cold. Much of that is because Manning spent the first 14 seasons of his career with the Indianapolis Colts, who played in the RCA Dome and later Lucas Oil Stadium, which are domed stadiums. It’s also due to Manning’s prowess. In leading perennial Super Bowl contenders to the playoffs, Manning’s Colts were often a top-seeded team. That means they got to play at home, instead of outdoors at a time when temperatures drop. Ten of Manning’s playoff games during his time in Indianapolis were at home in a controlled environment, while seven were on the road. And then there’s the comparison problem. What if all quarterbacks just play worse when it’s cold out? In those temperatures, the oblong ball is harder to throw and catch, the wind becomes a factor and you would expect teams to run the ball more. Not exactly conditions that make for prolific passing performances. Despite all of this, in the true spirit of sports punditry, let’s weigh in anyway, shall we? Manning in the cold Pro-Football Reference keeps a game log for NFL players. Included in each entry is the weather that day. Using that information, we broke down all of Manning’s performances, noting the temperature for each game and his stats. We won’t rely too heavily on his win-loss record, but rather his individual effort. There is a notable difference just comparing Manning’s passing numbers outdoor (136 games) versus indoor (126 games). The below numbers include playoff appearances and tally completions, attempts, yards, touchdowns and interceptions per game. Venue Completions Attempts Comp % Yards TDs INTs Passer rating Indoor 22.43 33.99 65.98 267.90 2.10 0.88 99.66 Outdoor 23.85 36.83 64.76 275.86 1.93 0.96 93.95 So, inside, Manning completes a few more passes per attempt, throws slightly more touchdowns, slightly fewer interceptions and his quarterback or passer ratings (which factors in completion percentage, passing yards, touchdowns and interception to create a metric that compares quarterbacks) is much higher. The average QB rating for all NFL QBs in 2013 was 84.1 and a perfect score is 158.3, though anything over 90 is considered very good. So basically he’s amazing indoors and a little less amazing outside. Let’s breakdown the outdoor games even further by weather. Manning has played 97 games where its 50 degrees or warmer, and 39 games where it’s colder (as you can see, the sample sizes are getting smaller). Temp Completions Attempts Comp % Yards TDs INTs Passer rating 50 and up 24.32 37.19 65.47 281.22 2.00 0.91 97.21 < 50 22.69 35.95 63.12 262.54 1.77 1.08 89.03 There’s greater parity here. Completion percentage is relatively close regardless of the temperature, but the yards are down a bit when in games under 50 degrees, as are touchdowns. Also, interceptions are up when the temperature drops, and Manning’s QB rating dips below 90. Still a very good quarterback, but not his elite self. But what if it gets even colder, like it will be in East Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday. The high for the day is currently forecast in the mid 40s, but kickoff isn’t until 6:30 p.m. and temperatures will be lower then. So let’s assume it’s 40 degrees or less during the game. Manning has 26 games in that environment. It’s worth noting that all but four of them were on the road (hostile environment) and five of them were in the playoffs (good competition). What does it look like per game? Temp Completions Attempts Comp % Yards TDs INTs Passer rating 40 and colder 22.65 36.12 62.73 258.35 1.69 1.15 86.46 Manning’s numbers continue to fall with the temperatures. And his record during that stretch is 12-14. But maybe Manning has improved. The early knock on the former University of Tennessee star was he choked in big games, and he now owns a Super Bowl ring that says otherwise. Perhaps he is better of late in the cold. With a sample size this small you can cherry pick dates that prove or disapprove that point. For example, since joining the Broncos, Manning is just 3-3 in games where it’s 40 degrees or colder out, but his numbers are stellar. Team Total completions Total attempts Comp % Total yards Total TDs Total INTs Passer rating Colts 421 680 61.91 4887 26 26 80.43 Broncos 168 259 64.86 1830 18 4 102.31 But if you pick a different range of games and temperatures, you’ll get an entirely different result. For example, Sports Illustrated (citing ESPN numbers) notes that, "Manning’s teams have lost seven of the 10 regular-season and postseason games in which the temperature was 32 degrees or colder. He has thrown 12 interceptions in those games to 11 touchdowns, his completion percentage is 59.4 in those games (career percentage: 65.4), and his 214.1 yards per game total is quite a bit below his career average of 269.5." We can say Manning has been great as a Bronco in cold weather. Or we can say Manning has a recent history of not performing when it’s below freezing. And in both cases, we’d be right. That’s what happens when sample sizes are small. Manning vs. the league Analysis of Manning’s cold weather performance also often fails to include how other quarterbacks perform when temperatures drop. While league stats in cold weather aren’t readily available, we can try to piece it together ourselves, thanks to Yahoo!, which provides career regular season splits at various temperatures. We took the career passer ratings of the 34 quarterbacks in the league last year with significant playing time and compared it to their career numbers when the temperature is between 21 and 40 degrees, as it should be for Sunday’s Super Bowl. But many of those 34 quarterbacks have played just a game or two in those temperatures. That’s not nearly enough to draw a conclusion. So we also broke out the quarterbacks with 10 or more regular season games in cold weather — there are 12 of them — and compared their quarterback ratings. (This rating is an imperfect metric, but it does factor in completion percentage, yards, touchdowns and interceptions and is widely used.) Player Games in cold Career passer rating Career passer rating in 21-40 degrees Difference Tom Brady 44 95.7 95.0 -0.7 Ben Roethlisberger 36 92.6 91.9 -0.7 Eli Manning 18 81.2 74.2 -7.0 Aaron Rodgers 17 104.9 106.9 2.00 Jay Cutler 17 84.6 90.2 5.6 Joe Flacco 14 83.7 86.8 3.1 Carson Palmer 14 85.9 80.4 -5.5 Philip Rivers 12 96.0 98.3 2.3 Matt Cassel 12 80.5 78.4 -2.1 Jason Campbell 11 81.8 78.1 -3.7 Ryan Fitzpatrick 11 77.5 77.8 0.3 Peyton Manning 10 97.2 92.6 -4.6 Career quarterback rating of 34 qualifying 2013 QBs* 216 8837 80.9 -7.8 Career quarterback rating of QBs with at least 10 starts in cold weather 278 90.1 82.0 -8.1 *Qualifying QBs averaged 14 pass attempts per teams’ games played, per ESPN Manning only has 10 games in the cold, compared to Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, who has played in 44. Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers has played in 36 cold weather games, twice as many as the next closest quarterback. Both Brady and Roethlisberger had very small dropoffs in their performance in cold weather versus their career numbers. Perhaps that’s a sign that with more games played, statistics will trend toward their career averages. Or maybe Brady and Big Ben, who both play in the Northeast, are familiar with the cold weather and it doesn’t affect them as much. Across the league, there is a significant drop off in quarterback rating when it gets cold out. The rating of the 12 players we focused on in 21-40 degree temperatures is more than 8 points lower than those players’ combined career quarterback rating. (We determined this by plugging all the combined career and cold weather stats of the quarterbacks into this handy calculator, which computed the complex passer rating formula for us. If you’re looking for an average drop off between the 12 players, it’s about -0.53 points, but that doesn’t factor in the number of games played in these conditions.) So there is reason to believe quarterbacks tend to play worse in the cold. Manning is not as good in his 10 regular season games played when the temperature is between 21 and 40. Among quarterbacks with 10 or more games in the cold, it’s one of the larger drop offs. Only his brother, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning and Carson Palmer of the Arizona Cardinals, saw greater discrepancies in their performances. But Manning’s rating of 92.6 is still the third highest of the 14. Only Brady and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers are better. All three are considered elite players and future Hall of Famers. For the record, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has a quarterback rating of 93.6 in two games in cold weather. Our ruling For the purpose of this analysis, we’re fact-checking some of the many tweets we saw this week about Manning and his struggles in the cold weather. So is Peyton Manning worse in the cold? Overall trends say yes, though the sample size is small. Manning’s numbers go down the colder it gets. But we also found that’s typical throughout the league. And since joining the Denver Broncos, Manning has been quite fantastic in conditions close to what we’ll see in the Super Bowl. And even at his worst, he’s still Peyton Manning. Claims that Manning struggles in cold weather are accurate, but require additional explanation. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09921	"Yes, this would be the same congressman (Rep. Pete Hoekstra) who last year Tweeted the whereabouts of a top-secret mission to Iraq."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/24/keith-olbermann/olbermann-says-rep-hoekstra-tweeted-whereabouts-to/	Once again, U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., is embroiled in a twitterversy. It centers on his Tweet likening the messages of disgruntled Republicans during a congressional squabble with the messages from bloodied Iranian protesters who say they were disenfranchised. Keith Olbermann, host of MSNBC's Countdown , noted on June 18, 2009, that this wasn't Hoekstra's first Twitter controversy. "This would be the same congressman who last year Tweeted the whereabouts of a top secret mission to Iraq," Olbermann said. Here's the background on that: Back in early February (not last year, as Olbermann said), Hoekstra was part of a legislative delegation that went to Iraq. The delegation included House Minority Leader John Boehner; House Minority Whip Eric Cantor; John McHugh, R-N.Y.; Jo Bonner, R-Ala.; and Tom Latham, R-Iowa. Some media learned or were told about the trip beforehand, but for security reasons agreed to keep the story embargoed until the group returned. But while on the trip, Hoekstra sent several Tweets. "Just landed in Baghdad," one said. And another: "Moved into green zone by helicopter. Iraqi flag now over palace. Headed to new US embassy. Appears calmer, less chaotic than previous." A Congressional Quarterly reporter took Hoekstra to task with a Feb. 6 story headlined, "So Much for Embargoed." That story, and a follow-up on Feb. 10, questioned whether Hoekstra broke protocol for such trips by providing sensitive information that could pose a security risk. The story of Hoekstra's Tweets got picked up in media outlets around the globe. "Generally speaking, we encourage the members to hold off any communication until they are wheels down at Andrews," Courtney Littig, spokeswoman for Democrats on the intelligence committee, told the New York Times . Hoekstra called the controversy "nonsense," and noted that similar trips by congressional delegations had been preceded by news conferences. Some legislators have even invited the public to sign banners they could give to the troops. Hoekstra's staff provided reporters with citations showing instances in which Democrats have issued press releases prior to legislative trips to combat zones (including one from Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2005 prior to a trip to Iraq); or even held live press conferences from war zones (including one from then Sen. Barack Obama in Afghanistan in 2008, and a 2005 interview with then Sen. Hillary Clinton in Baghdad in 2005). "The only difference is the technology," said Dave Yonkman, a spokesman for Hoekstra. "He was trying to give his constituents as much information as he could about his congressional activities." Nonetheless, Hoekstra's Tweets prompted the Pentagon to review its policy on congressional delegations traveling to war zones. And on March 13, 2009, Department of Defense Legislative Affairs distributed this policy to all services: "In order to protect the movement of the CODEL (congressional delegation) and all of the associated supporting personnel in the combat zone, it is important to maintain strict operational security. Adherence to operational security complicates the enemy's targeting process by ensuring they do not have flight plans, travel times, or party composition specifics, all elements needed to prepare a successful attack on U.S. personnel. In addition to the individual losses, the enemy could easily exploit any successful attack against key U.S. lawmakers for propaganda purposes, possibly extending the conflicts. "To this end, CODELs or staffdels should not communicate — via any means — their movements in advance of the trip, communicate their current locations, or communicate future movements or method of movements while in the AOR (area of responsibility) . . . Again, DoD's goal is to ensure members are offered the opportunity to present their initial observations in the combat zone while ensuring the safety of everyone in the traveling party and those who are supporting the group." In other words, congressmen shouldn't be Tweeting about their whereabouts or where they are heading in a combat zone. And if they do want to make public statements — including live press conferences — those should be coordinated with military officials. But Olbermann is wrong to characterize the delegation's trip as a "top-secret mission to Iraq." The term "top-secret" means something in military and government circles. There is a hierarchy of classified information, beginning with "confidential," graduating to "secret," "top-secret" and "special classified information." You need varying levels of security clearance in order to be privy to classified information. This trip was none of those. But more to the point, "top-secret mission to Iraq" conjures images of rifle-toting troops on a highly sensitive military operation. This wasn't a military mission, it was a congressional visit. In fact, many in the news media knew about the trip, but just agreed to keep it embargoed. Hoekstra's staff knew about it. His wife knew about it. "We're not talking about something that was classified," said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Les Melnyk. "Not at all. Top-secret? No. We see these reported all the time in the press." So Olbermann hasn't just exaggerated, he's incorrectly described the visit as a "top-secret mission." Without knowing the background, you might think Hoekstra spilled the beans on some covert military operation. We rule Olbermann's statement False.

pomt-14615	"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have the identical position on health care, which is they want to put the government in charge of you and your doctor."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/31/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-false-claim-trump-clinton-and-sanders-ha/	One day before the Iowa caucus, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas slammed Republican rival Donald Trump on NBC’s Meet the Press by lumping him in with the Democrats. "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have the identical position on health care," Cruz said on Jan. 31. "Which is they want to put the government in charge of you and your doctor." Trump, who’s leading Cruz by almost six points in Iowa, called Cruz a liar on ABC’s This Week. But is Cruz right that the Republican front runner has the health care plan as the two leading Democrats? Not exactly. Trump, Clinton and Sanders all seem to support one particular health care policy: allowing the government to negotiate drug prices. Beyond that specific proposal, however, the three candidates’ overarching positions on health care are not at all "identical" and, one could argue, actually contradictory. Let’s examine each candidate’s health care plan, starting with Sanders'. Sanders’ single-payer system One of the central platforms of Sanders’ agenda is his proposal for universal health care under a single-payer system. Sanders seeks to expand Medicare — the health safety net that covers those over 65 — to all Americans. The plan, which is described in detail on Sanders’ website, "will cover the entire continuum of health care." "As a patient, all you need to do is go to the doctor and show your insurance card," the proposal reads. "Bernie’s plan means no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges." To pay for the $1.38 trillion plan, Sanders is proposing a 6.2 percent payroll tax, a 2.2 percent income-based premium tax and a slew of taxes for higher income households. Sanders argues that a single-payer system would give the government leverage to trim administrative costs and drug prices. But it’s not clear those significant tax increases and cost reductions would cover the costs of his plan. Clinton to defend Obamacare Clinton, who says single-payer "will never, ever come to pass," proposes instead to hold up and build upon the Affordable Care Act. According to her website, Clinton will defend President Barack Obama’s 2010 landmark health care law, also called Obamacare, from efforts to repeal it. She also wants to expand health care access for rural Americans and work to lower the costs of deductibles, copays and prescription drugs. Specifically, she proposes: • Exempting three doctor's visits per year from deductibles; • Providing a refundable tax credit (up to $2,500 for individuals, $5,000 for families) for Americans whose out-of-pocket health care expenses are more than 5 percent of their income; • Blocking or modifying unreasonable insurance rate hikes. Trump’s ambiguous plan Trump, who once voiced admiration for single-payer, has yet to release a health care plan or propose anything beyond vague suggestions. But Trump consistently has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act — a position contradicting Clinton’s vow. Obamacare would be replaced with "something terrific" that "takes care of everybody," Trump promises but swears now that it wouldn’t be a single-payer system — a position antithetical to Sanders’ plan. What that "something terrific" would actually look like is unclear. His comments over the past few months suggests he’s been adding to a grab bag of sometimes contradictory ideas. Trump has suggested a health care system in which insurance companies deemed financially stable can offer plans across state lines. He’s also advocated for the government to negotiate with hospitals and drug companies for lower prices and to provide coverage for lower income Americans. Here are some examples of what he’s proposed: • Jan. 31, 2016, This Week: "We're going to work with our hospitals. We're going to work with our doctors. We've got to do something. …But that's not single payer and as far as Obamacare is concerned, one of the staples of my speech — and you can ask any of my many supporters — is repeal and replace Obamacare. It's a disaster. • Jan. 25, 2016, Farmington, N.H., rally: "Drugs, with Medicare — they don’t bid them out, they don’t bid them out. They pay like this wholesale incredible number. They say like $300 billion could be saved if we bid them out. We don’t do it. Why? Because of the drug companies, folks." • Oct. 25, 2015, This Week: "I'm okay with the (health) savings accounts. I think it's a good idea; it's a very down-the-middle idea. It works. It's something that's proven. The one thing we have to do is repeal and replace Obamacare. It is a disaster." • Oct. 14, 2015, WHO Radio: "If we get rid of the artificial lines drawn around each state and companies from Iowa can bid in New York … you’ll get these great plans. And the only thing the government should be involved in is they have to be really solvent companies in case there’s a catastrophic event or whatever. As far as the other group, as far as what we can do, I don’t want to see people doing in the streets." • Sept. 27, 2015, 60 Minutes: "Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced. ...I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now. ...The government's going to pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most part, it's going to be a private plan, and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition, with lots of competitors, with great companies, and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything." Our ruling Cruz said, "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have the identical position on health care, which is they want to put the government in charge of you and your doctor." While Trump, Clinton and Sanders have all proposed to reduce prescription drug prices, that one policy is a far cry from having "the identical position on health care." Cruz’s description of that position (putting the government in charge of you and your doctor) can only reasonably be applied to Sanders’ single-payer system. Clinton has proposed specific ways to defend and expand Obama’s health care law. Trump, whose exact plan is unclear, has said repeatedly that he’d repeal and replace Obamacare with a market-based alternative. To suggest that Trump, Clinton and Sanders have the same health care proposal is inaccurate. There are many specific differences between the three plans. We rate Cruz’s statement False.

pomt-04222	Says President Barack Obama "did not come into office with the economy in a free fall."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/26/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-says-economy-was-not-free-fall-whe/	The nation’s persistent unemployment and weak job growth were a focus of the 2012 presidential campaign, with Republicans arguing the problems showed flaws in how President Barack Obama tackled the economy. In many ways, the Democratic argument was previewed more than a year before the election, when strategist David Axelrod described the situation Obama walked into: "I think he came to office at a time of tremendous challenge in this country," Axelrod said. "The economy was in free fall and we had two wars and someone said to me the other day, ‘You know his slogan should be GM is alive and bin Laden is dead.’ " We thought of that statement when we heard this one from first-term Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson: "The reason we're not creating those jobs is because of the choices, the policies, that President Obama took," he said in an Oct. 10, 2012 appearance on CNN’s "Starting Point" show. "You know, because here is the fact: he did not come into office with the economy in a free fall." Johnson continued: "We were losing jobs, but the fact is, within two months, we entered the second quarter, we only lost 0.7 percent GDP (Gross Domestic Product). But the economy bottomed out and then we started recovery the third quarter." The show’s host, Soledad O’Brien, asked Johnson: "You don't think the economy was in free fall then?" Johnson responded: "No. The economy began to recover in the third quarter. It'd basically flattened out by the second quarter and it actually grew close to 4 percent the next three quarters. But then President Obama's policies took effect and they started scaring consumers and business owners and as a result the economy totally stalled." While the comment came before the election, with Obama’s win it seems relevant to take a look at where things stood when he started. The numbers The National Bureau of Economic Research determined that the recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. So there’s no argument that Obama took office while the economy was in the midst of the downturn. Matters worsened in the fall of 2008, before he took office, when credit markets seized up and companies and consumers found it virtually impossible to borrow money. The housing crisis accelerated, and job losses escalated dramatically. One barometer of the economy is an index of 85 economic indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. A reading less than zero means below average growth. In January of 2009, the Chicago Fed index was -3.99, the lowest level reached during the months of the recession. Graphically, it’s the point on the bottom of a deep V shape. Another measure is unemployment. The Labor Department said that in December 2008, the economy lost 661,000 non-farm jobs, in January 2009, that number reached 818,000. Finally, there’s the Gross Domestic Product, a broader, quarterly measure of the economy. The change in GDP for the last three months of 2008 was -8.9 percent, and for the first three months of 2009 it was -6.7 percent. Of course, that figure includes more than the month of January. Johnson’s case When we asked Johnson about his statement, he did not dispute any of those numbers. Rather, he said, they prove his point. "Yes we had a severe recession," he said. "But by the time the president started governing, that recession had pretty much bottomed out." Johnson noted that many important economic indicators don’t function in real time -- they lag behind actual activity. That means that the Obama’s actions had little immediate impact on the economy, and when they were reflected, they showed a drag on the recovery. "The economy began to recover in the third quarter," he said. "It has basically flattened out by the second quarter. And it actually grew close to 4 percent in the next three quarters. But then President Obama’s policies took effect and started scaring consumers and business owners. And as a result, the economy totally stalled." Other views Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls and an associate professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College, said the "free fall" characterization was a poor analogy to choose. "It's probably more fair to simply say things were bad and to leave it at that," he said in an email. "The economy isn't a ball hurtling through space. It's not an engine that runs out of a gas. It is not a ship that needs steering. These are all analogies that can be useful and colorful at times, but like all analogies, they have their limits." Jacobsen added: "In short, I'd say that Ron Johnson was literally correct: The economy was not in free fall. It was bad and many people probably didn't know whether things were going to get better or much worse. In hindsight, we now know that things continued to ‘go down hill,’ but wasn't dropping like a rock." Aldo Laurenti, deputy chief economist for Mesirow Financial, noted that stock market losses in the fall of 2008 continued into 2009. "The Dow lost about 400 points in January 2009, following losses on the tunes of 2,100 points in October 2008 and another 1,000 in the two central weeks in November 2008,"he wrote in an email. Laurenti said that the decline in gross domestic product was $313 billion in the last quarter of 2008, and $153 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Households lost assets of $2.4 trillion in that period of 2009, "after losing a shocking $12.7 trillion for the whole year 2008," he said. Those assets included financial holdings, and also property, including real estate. Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody’s Analytics, wrote about the housing part of the downturn in September 2012. He noted: "The Obama administration deserves credit for quickly ending the housing free fall. In particular, Obama empowered the Federal Housing Administration to ensure that households could find mortgages at low interest rates even during the worst phase of the financial panic. When banks were making few loans of any kind, mortgage borrowers could still obtain credit because of the FHA." Let’s add it up. Johnson disputed Obama’s assertion that the economy was in "free fall" when he took office. Was the economy plunging downward, hit bottom, or had it hit and was on the upswing? As Jacobsen notes, it’s hard to call January 2009 a time of free fall in a technical sense. Cratered might have been a better way for Team Obama to describe it. Johnson is correct on the lagging nature of economic indicators and agrees that the economy was in rough shape at the time. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-11072	Says May 2018 marked the 401st straight month of global temperatures exceeding the 20th century average.	/texas/statements/2018/jun/20/jim-spencer/jim-spencer-may-2018-marked-401st-month-global-tem/	A reader inquired about an Austin weathercaster saying the planet has sweltered through hundreds of months of consecutive record temperatures. "Last week, Jim Spencer said during his weather forecast that record-breaking heat has been going on for over 400 months," the reader said by email. KXAN-TV’s Spencer, the reader said, had called April 2018 the 400th straight month with global temperatures above the 20th century average and that when May data was official, that would mark month 401, the reader said. We didn’t track down such a broadcast. But when we asked Spencer about making the statement, he pointed by email to his June 18, 2018, blog post stating that May 2018 "marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with" global land and ocean "temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average." All those months? We launched this fact-check. NOAA conclusion Spencer told us he relied on information posted online the day of his post by the National Centers for Environmental Information, which is in the authoritative National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. According to the centers, the report, "Assessing the Global Climate in May 2018," was developed by its scientists as "part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making." In May 2018, the assessment states, Earth’s temperature across global land and ocean surfaces ran 1.44 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average of 58.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The report also says: "The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.58°F above average. May 2018 also marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average," the report states. That 20th century average, USA Today said in a May 2018 news story, serves climate scientists as a benchmark for global temperature measurements. That's because it's fixed in time, the story said, "allowing for consistent ‘goal posts’ when reviewing climate data. It's also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability." Land temperatures alone, the centers’ assessment says, ran 2.05 degrees Fahrenheit above the comparable 20th century average of 52 degrees Fahrenheit. In May 2018, the report says, record "warmth was observed across parts of North America, Europe and Asia as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Record cold May temperatures were limited to northeastern Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean, off the southern coast of Greenland." An accompanying text box says: "As a whole, North America had its highest May temperature since 1998 and the second highest since continental records began in 1910. The contiguous U.S. had its warmest May since records began in 1895." State climatologist For another perspective, we asked John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist based at Texas A&M University, about Spencer’s citation of the global temperature analysis. By email, Nielsen-Gammon credited Spencer with accurately rendering NOAA’s 401-month finding though he also noted that other researchers analyze changes in temperature over time, reaching varied consecutive-month conclusions. Nielsen-Gammon said that in response to our inquiry he checked several other analyses. "NOAA happens to have the longest streak of temperatures above the 20th century average, which may be why that particular statistic seems to be quoted most often with the NOAA data," Nielsen-Gammon wrote. The climatologist said other analysts reported ongoing streaks ranging from 399 months per figures compiled by British researchers to as few as 291 months, according to figures analyzed by Berkeley Earth, a California-based nonprofit. "So speaking scientifically, it has almost certainly been at least 291 consecutive months of global temperatures above the 20th century mean, and probably much longer, with 399 or 401 months being the best estimates," Nielsen-Gammon said. "If you believe the NOAA estimate, it's 401 months." Nielsen-Gammon elaborated: "What this means is that average global temperatures have increased so much that not even natural variability can produce a month colder than the 20th century average, and hasn't been able to do so for some time. The global warming signal is well above the noise level. At this rate, about the only thing strong enough to cancel out global warming for a month would be a volcanic eruption much stronger than Krakatau." Federal official reaffirms 401-month mark We also heard back by email from Derek "Deke" Arndt of the NCEI, who reaffirmed its 401-month finding which, he said, traces to the NOAA Merged Land Ocean Global Surface Temperature Analysis Dataset containing monthly readings all the way back to January 1880. Asked why other researchers have indicated fewer months of global temperatures exceeding the 20th-century average, Arndt said he believes those others draw on different datasets. We also alerted Spencer to the alternate findings of fewer months in a row when the planet’s temperature outpaced the 20th-century average. By email, Spencer noted that Nielsen-Gammon described 399 or 401 months as the best estimates. Our ruling Spencer wrote that May 2018 marked the 401st straight month of global temperatures exceeding the 20th century average. This claim accurately echoes the findings of respected NOAA researchers. Missing: Clarification that other entities have reported fewer consecutive months that this pattern has held, possibly as few as 291 months. We rate Spencer's claim Mostly True.

pomt-04632	Under Obama, home values in Florida collapsed, construction jobs were lost and the state had a high foreclosure rate.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/14/mitt-romney/romney-ad-blames-obama-florida-housing-woes/	A new Romney campaign ad poses the "Are you better off?" question to a particularly hard-hit population: Florida homeowners. Against a black and white image of Obama, a narrator says, "Here in Florida, we’re not better off under President Obama. Home values collapsed, home construction jobs lost, high rate of foreclosure." Mitt Romney, the ad promises, will provide an antidote to all these ills: alternatives to foreclosure, an end to the mortgage lending freeze and 700,000 new jobs for Florida. (We contacted both campaigns for comment on the ad, but didn't hear back.) In a state where homes lost more than half their value in the recession, it’s a handy line of attack. But we found that the claim -- faulting Obama for depressed house values, lost jobs and high foreclosures -- oversimplifies a problem with many layers and puts too much blame on the president for a crisis that began before he took office. 'Home values collapsed' We’ll start by examining home values. The ad cited Zillow, a real estate website, as backup for the claim. We talked to their head economist, Stan Humphries, who shared some interesting statistics. Home values in Florida began rising in earnest in 2003 and 2004. That accelerated through 2005, hitting a peak in May 2006. The median home value in Florida that month: $257,800. Since that time, the median value has plummeted by 51.2 percent through July 2012, to $125,700. So yes, home values have declined during Obama’s term. But there’s more to the story. Humphries pointed out that the decline under Obama so far amounts to 22.3 percent. Under his predecessor, George W. Bush, Florida home values fell 35.5 percent. "More of those declines happened on Bush’s watch than on Obama’s watch," Humphries said. Here’s another thing to note about the Obama years: Home values in Florida bottomed out in October 2011. (Median price: $122,400). They’ve been climbing since, and in the past year they inched up 1.3 percent. Zillow forecasts an appreciation rate of 6 percent in Miami, 2.3 percent in Tampa and 2.8 percent in Orlando. That’s better than the expectation for the nation as a whole, Humphries said. 'Home construction jobs lost' For data on construction jobs, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the past decade, construction jobs in Florida enjoyed steady growth, hitting a peak in June 2006 of 691,900. They began to steadily decline at that point, shedding 100,000 jobs by October of 2007 and another 100,000 by September 2008. The most recent jobs figure is for July 2012: 308,800. But a closer look at those numbers reveals this: • Jobs lost from the peak until Obama took office: 231,000 • Jobs lost since he took office: 138,200 Notice too that the timeline for construction layoffs parallels the decline of home values -- a peak in mid 2006, followed by a steady drop-off. "When housing prices started to fall, (there was) no need to build new homes," said Ken Thomas, an independent bank consultant and economist in Miami. "It was the housing crisis, the collapse of the housing bubble, that basically did in the construction workers." 'High rate of foreclosure' According to RealtyTrac, a website that collects and tracks foreclosure data, the Florida foreclosure wave crashed ashore about a year after home values collapsed. In May 2006 (the month home values peaked), Florida had 7,455 new foreclosure filings. In May 2007, that figure leapt to 17,000, a 128 percent increase. Filings didn’t slow down for a long time. Several months in 2009 saw more than 30,000 new cases. Only in mid 2010, when the robo-signing scandal among banks came to light, was there a noticeable drop-off. Banks ceased new filings as they re-assessed their practices. And since then? Foreclosures are on the way up again. RealtyTrac found that Florida’s foreclosure rate in August 2012 jumped to second highest in the country, with 14,726 new filings. That means one in every 328 housing units under a foreclosure notice. Here's how the foreclosures appear relative to Obama: • From May 2007 (beginning of the increase) to January 2009 (when he took office): 519,977 new filings • From February 2009 (his first full month in office) to August 2012: 866,938 new filings "Unlike other foreclosure cycles in the past, this wasn’t the result of a bad economy. It was the excesses in the housing market in terms of prices and overbuilding," said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. Added Humphries: "The foreclosure rates are a natural consequence of home value loss of 50 percent. That leaves a huge amount of negative equity. That is what fuels a lot of foreclosures." Blame game So who’s a weary homeowner to blame? Here’s Ken Harney, a syndicated real estate columnist: "Blaming Obama for property value declines that were underway during the Bush administration, and caused in part by financial regulators who were asleep in the cockpit during the Bush years, is ridiculous," Harney told PolitiFact. "The Obama administration is open to criticism for the poorly designed, timid and poorly executed foreclosure-prevention and loan modification efforts it created following the housing bust, but had nothing to do with the underlying problems that took down Florida's hyperinflated property values." So while it’s clear Obama didn’t cause these troubles, what did he do to fix them? As we’ve previously reported, he pursued a number of remedies, with only modest success. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, which Obama signed in 2009, makes it a federal crime to make a materially false statement on a mortgage application or to willfully overvalue a property to influence any action by a mortgage lending business. PolitiFact's Obameter gave that a Promise Kept on our Obameter. And new standards for helping people understand their mortgage were included in the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul passed in 2010, another Promise Kept. But he's had limited success with efforts that would have provided the most help to homeowners. A temporary foreclosure moratorium in early 2009 halted filings while banks waited for the new administration to get its plan in place to address the crisis. It’s not clear, though, that it ultimately kept many people out of foreclosure. Analysts say a change in bankruptcy law that Obama sought to allow judges to modify individual loans could have made a significant difference, but it died in Congress. A foreclosure prevention fund was the heart of Obama’s promise. He originally pledged $10 billion but ended up setting aside $75 billion, using TARP funds. He predicted the money would assist 9 million homeowners. But after three years, far fewer have won permanent mortgage help. We rated that Promise Broken. Our ruling Romney’s ad claims that under Obama, home values in Florida collapsed, construction jobs were lost and the state’s foreclosure rate soared. This much is true: The median home value in Florida has dropped by more than half; 300,000-plus construction jobs have disappeared and the Sunshine State continues to rack up a large number of foreclosure filings. But each one of those trends began well before Obama was elected. Analysts say they have been driven by a natural and inevitable market correction much more than by any government policies. But since the ad draws a cause/effect relationship -- the cause being Obama’s presidency, the effect being a sour housing market -- it’s worth noting that more of the decline in home values happened on Bush’s watch, and in the last year Florida housing has again begun to appreciate. At PolitiFact, claims that cite a true statistic but apply misplaced blame on a politician or office holder are commonly rated Half True. We think this three-part claim stretches the truth even further. Homeowners in Florida who have watched their property value sink and their neighbors’ houses abandoned in foreclosure know this didn’t start when Obama walked into the White House. They’re in at least year seven of this grim reality. Romney’s ad leaves out many critical facts to create a misleading impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00302	Says he "did not try to leave the scene of the accident" that led to his arrest for driving while intoxicated.	/texas/statements/2018/sep/25/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-claim-he-didnt-try-leave-drunk-drivin/	Nearly a month after a police report surfaced on his 1998 arrest for driving while intoxicated, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O’Rourke fielded a follow-up question during his Sept. 21, 2018 debate with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Gromer Jeffers of the Dallas Morning News said to O’Rourke: "You have addressed your 1998 DWI arrest numerous times during your public career. But not this question: As the Houston Chronicle pointed out recently, a witness said in that accident that you tried to leave the scene of the accident. Did you and should voters be concerned about this incident?" O’Rourke replied at the Southern Methodist University debate: "I did not try to leave the scene of the accident--though driving drunk, which I did, is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense and I will not try to provide one. I can only tell you that I was able to have a second chance in my life." O’Rourke went on to tick-tock his subsequent opening of a business with friends in his hometown of El Paso where, he said, he met his wife with whom he’s raising three children. Also, O’Rourke said, he won election to the El Paso City Council and, in 2012, to the U.S. House, which he’s leaving after this year. "I made the most that I could with my second choice and my opportunity," O’Rourke said. Readers asked us if O’Rourke tried to leave the scene of his accident and arrest. Houston Chronicle news story cites police report The Chronicle, in an Aug. 30, 2018, news story, said a police report shows that the incident was a more serious threat to public safety than previously reported. The newspaper, citing the report, said that O’Rourke was driving drunk at what a witness called "a high rate of speed" in a 75 mph zone on Interstate 10 about a mile east of the New Mexico border. He lost control and hit a truck, sending his car careening across the center median. The story said that the witness, described as stopping at the scene, later told police that O’Rourke had tried to leave the scene. The report, the story says, refers to an unnamed "motorist’s description of O’Rourke’s dark-colored Volvo passing him quickly about 3 a.m. on I-10." The story says that O'Rourke reportedly struck a truck going in the same direction and crossed a grassy median into the opposite lanes. The story says that according to the police report, "O’Rourke then attempted to leave the scene but was stopped by the same motorist he had just passed. The unidentified motorist ‘then turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to try to get the defendant (O’Rourke) to stop,’ the report says." The story says that O'Rourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. He was arrested at the scene, the story said, and charged with DWI, but completed a court-approved diversion program and had the charges dismissed, post-arrest developments we confirmed for a previous fact-check confirming the September 1998 arrest and a previous one, when O’Rourke was a college student, for getting past a fence to enter the University of Texas at El Paso campus in the wee hours. Police agency confirms report's authenticity By email, we asked the Anthony Police Department to review the 12-page partially-redacted police report posted next to the Chronicle story. In response, a department officer, Linda Hartt-Goggin, said the posted report "appears to be a true redacted copy of the original report." Hartt-Goggin said by phone she couldn’t find the department’s report on the accident itself. She speculated that it was lost when a room was flooded. According to APD Investigator Richard Carrera’s report, filed three days after the accident, O’Rourke said after his 3 a.m. arrest that he’d been driving to Los Alamos in New Mexico. The officer’s report says that he met at the scene with a witness--called the "reporter" in Carrera’s report--and his partner, the driver of "the American Medical ambulance." By phone, Hartt-Goggin told us the ambulance company serves private clients out of Las Cruces, NM. Our attempts to reach a Las Cruces official with American Medical Response, a Colorado-based company, didn’t draw an immediate response. Carrera’s report says the witness said that he initially saw a green Volvo pass his vehicle at a high rate of speed westbound on I-10. "The vehicle then lost control moments later and struck a truck traveling the same direction," the report says. "After the driver/defendant struck the truck, it sent the defendant’s vehicle across the center median and to a complete stop facing east bound," the report says. "The defendant/driver then attempted to leave the scene," the report says. But the witness "turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to get the defendant to stop." The report says that when the officer engaged O’Rourke in conversation, he wasn’t understandable due to slurred speech. The report says the officer asked O’Rourke to step out of the vehicle and "upon doing so the defendant almost fell to the floor," the report says. Separately, the Austin American-Statesman asked the Texas Department of Public Safety for agency reports on file about the incident. M.L. Calcote said in a September 2018 letter sent by email that the agency didn’t have responsive records. O'Rourke stands by debate statement We asked O’Rourke’s campaign about the witness telling Carrera that O’Rourke tried to leave the accident scene. By email, Chris Evans said O’Rourke stands by what he said at the debate about not trying to leave. Evans noted that the "police report shows he was arrested for a DWI, not for leaving or attempting to leave the scene." Our ruling O’Rourke said he didn’t try to leave the scene of his 1998 DWI accident and arrest. Records indicate O’Rourke was arrested at the scene and wasn’t charged with trying to flee. But the September 1998 Anthony Police Department report on the incident says a witness said O’Rourke tried to leave the scene before police arrived and the witness kept him from doing so.

pomt-11645	"Oprah tells Fox News host ‘all white people have to die.’"	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/16/americannewscom/oprahs-comments-about-race-2013-bbc-interview-dist/	Oprah Winfrey gave a speech at the Golden Globes Jan. 7 that focused on race, gender, injustice and the importance of speaking the truth, all of which fueled talk about Winfrey running for president in 2020. The speculation has led to numerous claims about her past statements recirculating on Facebook including her alleged comments about white people in 2014: "Oprah tells Fox News host ‘all white people have to die,’ " stated an Oct. 12, 2014, headline on American News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the headline distorts what Winfrey said — and where she said it. While the headline said that Oprah made the comment about white people on Fox News, Winfrey’s comments came in an interview with the BBC. Winfrey was interviewed by the BBC’s Will Gompertz on Nov. 13, 2013, to coincide with the release of her film The Butler in which she played Gloria Gaines, the wife of a White House butler. Gompertz asked Winfrey to weigh in about whether racism still exists. Winfrey said that society has evolved on race relations, but there are still places where people are terrorized because they are black. "As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, the problem is not solved. There is a whole generation -- I said this for apartheid South Africa, I said this for my own community in the south -- there are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die." Winfrey’s overall point during the interview is that race relations have improved from decades ago, but there are older people in the United States and other countries who grew up surrounded by racism. The inference of her comments is that when older racists die out, that particular type of racism will die out. Note that Winfrey didn’t say "all white people have to die" — she didn’t say "white people" at all. While some on the left have shown some support for Winfrey’s 2013 statement, her comments drew criticism from conservatives. About a week after her BBC interview, her comments were criticized on Fox News' The Kelly File by former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., a Fox News commentator. West criticized Winfrey and Obama for trying "to use the race card to talk about the failures and the faults not in his racial content but in the content of his character and the failure of his policies." We emailed American News and did not get a reply. Our ruling A headline on American News said that "Oprah tells Fox News host ‘all white people have to die.’" We found multiple versions of this story circulating with similar headlines. The headline gets key details wrong and twists Winfrey’s words. She did not say that all white people have to die. What Winfrey actually told a BBC interviewer in 2013 was that some older people grew up surrounded by racism. When she said "they just have to die," she seemed to be suggesting that a certain type of racism will have to die out when this generation dies. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00507	ISIS reaches "about 100 million people a day" through social media.	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/25/stanley-mcchrystal/stanley-mcchrystal-isis-reaches-100-million-people/	We’ve analyzed ISIS’s infamous ability to reach people on social media before, and found the claim that ISIS posts 90,000 social media messages each day to be Mostly True. Retired U.S. Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal upped the ante recently on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show. McChrystal, former commander of the U.S. and International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan appeared on Hewitt’s show to discuss his new book, Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World. At one point, McChrystal talked about the successes of ISIS's strategy. "ISIS, I think, is a 21st Century manifestation of information technology. Think about their agility on the battlefield … but think about how many people they influence every day with their information operations. They reach about 100 million people a day through various things. They only have (to) recruit a tiny percentage of those to have a real impact." 100 million people? That’s more than the population of Germany. On a daily basis. PunditFact attempted to reach McChrystal through his book publisher, his consultancy and through Twitter but did not hear back. However, according to experts, 100 million seems to be giving ISIS a little too much credit. Earlier this year, PunditFact reached out to J.M Berger, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, to comment on ISIS’s Twitter posts. During that interview, Berger referenced a study he and his colleague, Jonathon Morgan, had been working on. Since then, the full study has been published. In the ISIS Twitter Census, Berger and Morgan uncovered an estimated 46,000 Twitter accounts tied to ISIS supporters. These accounts were found in a time period from September to December 2014. The study also includes that each account had an average of 1,004 followers. In PunditFact’s previous article, Berger placed the estimated total number of tweets per day at about 200,000 (including retweets). In theory, if ISIS-backed accounts sent up to 200,000 tweets a day, and each went to 1,000 people, that would be more than 200 million people reached. But that’s not how it works. For starters, many of the followers overlap. Second, just because someone posts a tweet doesn’t mean it reaches every follower. Lastly, Twitter has been trying to identify and suspend ISIS-supported accounts. The New York Times reported in April that Twitter had suspended 10,000 ISIS accounts "for tweeting violent threats." "A whole lot of those followers overlap, so you can't draw a really reliable conclusion," Berger said. "Also that data is from October, and tens of thousands of accounts have been suspended since then. The numbers are wildly different now." VOICES from the Blogs, a spin-off of the University of Milan, also confirms this. In its study, Luigi Curini, associate professor of political science, Stefano M. Iacus, professor of probability and mathematical statistics and Andrea Ceron, assistant professor of political science, have tracked "the aggregate level (of) sentiment toward ISIS by monitoring (Twitter) posts written in Arabic language." "Assuming that the followers of each ISIS Twitter account are completely unrelated to each other ... is quite unrealistic," said Curini. Curini also pointed to the importance of considering the content of the tweets issued by these accounts. "Some of those tweets are jokes, personal conversations, or contain content that does not express any opinion. That is, not all the 100,000 to 200,000 tweets per day on average are tweets of ‘ISIS propaganda.’ " Berger also acknowledges that not all tweets influence people. He describes a metric called "impressions," which are a count of "how many people have a message cross their timeline or how many times a message is otherwise seen or glimpsed. "It is feasible that ISIS could rack up to 100 million impressions a day, but it's not certain. … Scoring an impression is not the same thing as reaching or influencing an audience member," Berger said, "but impressions are how people discover content, so they do count for something. But not necessarily a one-to-one impact; impressions can include the same person returning to content repeatedly." So not only do followers’ accounts overlap, but the content of messages might not even leave an impact the user who sees it. McChrystal, in his quotation, seemed to be talking about the actual influence ISIS exerts via social media. But what about other social media accounts? "ISIS has a presence on virtually every social media network that is worth having a presence on, including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, VKontakte and Google Plus, in significant numbers. They even pop up with the occasional odd account on LinkedIn," said Berger. Unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be data available yet to measure just how much of an impact ISIS has on these other sites. "Getting data on the presence of ISIS supporters on other social networks is for a number of reasons more complex," said Curini. "According to our monitoring (of Arabic public profiles), Twitter weights between 80 percent to 90 percent of the total presence of ISIS discussion on the net. And we also know that on the other channels on the net, the average support for ISIS is considerably less than on Twitter." Our ruling McChrystal said ISIS reaches "about 100 million people a day through various things." ISIS certainly has taken its war to social media, and experts agree that their strategy has some bite. But saying ISIS social media posts reach 100 million people a day is, at best, a high-end guesstimate, researchers say. And there are lots of caveats to consider. Thousands of ISIS social media accounts have been shut down in recent months. Followers of ISIS accounts often overlap. And not all the messages sent actually reach every follower, or leave a lasting impression. McChrystal’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-11051	Says Hillary Clinton once "supported a border wall until she ran for president in 2016."	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/27/cal-thomas/did-hillary-clinton-support-border-wall-mexico/	As President Donald Trump continues to press an aggressive border enforcement policy, some conservatives have said Democrats’ expression of sympathy for children separated from their parents is a more about political expediency than sincere concern. As evidence of Democrats’ calculating approach to immigration, syndicated conservative columnist Cal Thomas argued Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton supported a border wall prior to her 2016 White House bid, when "build the wall" became a Trump rallying cry. "Need proof that the current controversy over children of undocumented immigrants is more political than humanitarian?" Thomas wrote June 20. "Hillary Clinton said she was ‘adamantly against illegal immigrants’ and supported a border wall until she ran for president in 2016." We decided to revisit Clinton’s record to see if she once backed a wall along the lines of what Trump proposed during the election. We found that while Clinton supported more border security, the plans back then were not the kind of wall Trump has proposed, and Trump himself said that what Clinton supported was inadequate. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 Thomas’ column linked to a video clip of Clinton discussing her voting record on immigration while a senator. "I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in," Clinton told an audience at a campaign stop Nov. 9, 2015. "And I do think you have to control your borders." Clinton voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which President George W. Bush signed after the measure cleared the Republican-held Congress. It authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Then-Sen. Clinton voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. (Notably, then-Sen. Barack Obama and New York Sen. Chuck Schumer voted for it, too.) Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Fence versus wall So how does the fence-building measure Clinton supported compare to Trump’s wall? For her part, Clinton sought to distinguish the two after TV news anchor Jorge Ramos put the question to her at a campaign event. "What is the difference between your idea and Donald Trump’s idea on building a wall with Mexico?" Ramos asked at the Jan. 11, 2016 Iowa Black and Brown Forum. "So we do need to have secure borders and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barrier," Clinton said. "You want a wall then," Ramos interjected. "No, we’ve —" she said. "You said that," he said. "Well, I voted for border security, and some of it was a fence," Clinton said. "I don’t think we ever called it a wall. Maybe in some places it was a wall." On one hand, the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence may not seem too significant because both block people. However, there are significant differences between the fence Clinton voted for, and the wall Trump pitched during the campaign, which he promised would be an impenetrable, physical, tall and "beautiful" wall that Mexico would pay for. The plans Trump articulated for the wall during the campaign were somewhat vague and inconsistent. He said the wall didn't need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. In any case, Trump himself criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 election. "Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad," Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) Our ruling Thomas said that Clinton "supported a border wall until she ran for president in 2016." Clinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. But the fence she voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump proposed. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a "nothing wall." Thomas’ statement is partially accurate, but ignores important context. We rate it Half True.	None	Cal Thomas	None	None	None	2018-06-27T10:57:26	2018-06-20	['None']
pomt-02466	"Most folks’ wages haven’t gone up in over a decade."	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/23/barack-obama/even-adjusting-inflation-most-americans-havent-see/	After giving his fifth State of the Union address, President Barack Obama hit the road. One of his first stops was a GE gas engines plant in Waukesha, a city about 20 miles west of Milwaukee. In both the House chamber and on the factory floor, the president insisted that over the past four years, corporate profits and stock prices soared while wages fluttered. In the State of the Union, Obama claimed that "average wages have barely budged." PolitiFact National rated his statement True, finding the average had risen no more than 1.7 percent above inflation from 2008 to 2012. In Waukesha on Jan. 30, 2014, the president alluded to a slightly different statistic and was more bold. He said: "Because the truth is -- and you know this in your own lives, and you see it in your neighborhoods among your friends and family -- even though the economy has been growing for four years, even though corporate profits have been doing very well, stock prices have soared, most folks' wages haven't gone up in over a decade." We wondered: Even taking inflation into account, is it true the majority of Americans haven’t seen their wages increase in more than 10 years? Obama’s evidence Income inequality was a big topic in the weeks leading up to the State of the Union. So, one thing to make clear upfront is that in his Wisconsin remarks, the president singled out wages -- the paycheck you get from your job. That’s a narrower category than income, which can include money taken in from other sources such as investments or government benefits. When we asked for evidence to back the president’s wages claim, a White House spokesman cited a database from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows the median weekly earnings for full-time workers in the final quarter of each year from 1999 through 2013. The median wage means half of workers earned more than that amount and half earned less. From the database, we assembled the following table. The wage figures are adjusted for inflation. Year Weekly wages, 4th quarter of each year 1999 $335 2000 334 2001 340 2002 336 2003 337 2004 337 2005 332 2006 337 2007 332 2008 340 2009 344 2010 341 2011 335 2012 334 2013 334 So, the inflation-adjusted median wage during the final quarter of 2013 was $334 -- $1 lower than during the final quarter of 1999, more than a decade earlier. However, the table also shows that the median wage went up in some years and down in others during the period cited by the president. It was as high as $344 and as low as $332. Outside experts We put Obama’s claim and the database to four experts: economist Aparna Mathur of the conservative American Enterprise Institute; economist Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, who served as a deputy assistant Treasury secretary under President Ronald Reagan; Michael Tanner, senior fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute; and Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance research director Dale Knapp. They agreed that it’s not possible to track the wages of actual individuals over a period of more than a decade, and so it can’t be known whether most of them had a higher wage in 2013 than in 2009. But the experts also agreed the median wage figure cited by The White House is the best available. As Steuerle told us: "Looking at the median tells us what is happening across the economy, but not what is happening to each individual worker over time." Two other points, neither of which bears directly on the accuracy of Obama’s wage claim: Mathur said the broader measure of income gives a better picture of the standard of living of low- and moderate-income people, since it includes assistance such as the earned income tax credit, food stamps and Medicaid. And Tanner said total compensation, including things such as health and retirement benefits, has risen in recent years even if wages haven’t. Our rating Obama said: "Most folks’ wages haven’t gone up in over a decade." It’s not possible to know, considering all Americans, whether most of them saw a wage increase in the period cited by the president. But he cites the best-available figure, which shows the median weekly wage, adjusted for inflation, was $1 less at the end of 2013 than it was in 1999. We rate the president’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-11423	Shoes on the Capitol lawn represent 7,182 students who were killed in U.S. schools since 2012.	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/16/blog-posting/facebook-post-incorrectly-says-7182-students-were-/	Thousands of pairs of shoes dotted the lawn of the U.S. Capitol this week, prompting photos and media coverage about what it meant. Global activist group Avaaz set up the demonstration of 7,000 pairs of shoes on March 13 to represent child deaths from gun violence since the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. Many major news outlets including CNN and USA Today shared striking images of the shoes, but some Internet bloggers were confused about what the shoes really symbolized. Take, for example, Equality House, one of many blogs that shared this post on their Facebook page: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The image says that shoes on the Capitol lawn represent 7,182 students "killed in U.S. schools since 2012." (The image offers a comparison to deaths from overseas wars since 2001, which is a safer estimate.) But that’s the wrong interpretation. It’s been more than five years since Sandy Hook, so the display featured 7,000 pairs of shoes. That total includes children who are killed at home, in neighborhoods, and by suicide. Far fewer children have been killed in schools. The estimate for 7,000 child gun deaths traces back to a June 2017 study by Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed journal. It found that 1,300 children die from gunshot wounds every year. The study looked at children from birth to 17 years of age. The Avaaz news release stated that the shoes symbolize the children who have been killed by all gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting, not children killed in U.S. schools. There isn’t one uniform way of tracking school shootings and deaths, but no matter which what you look at it, the 7,000-figure isn't accurate. The New York Times published an analysis of the number of people who have been shot in school shootings on Feb. 15, the day after the Parkland school shootings. Using data from the Gun Violence Archive, the Times found that 138 people have been killed in school shootings since Sandy Hook. That total includes school personnel who are not students, so the number of students would be even smaller. The Gun Violence Archive defines a school shooting as an incident that occurs on the property of an elementary, secondary or college campus and only included incidents in which people were injured or killed. So, even if you count all of the other instances of a student being killed on a school campus (for which there is no official count) it’s likely it would not come anywhere near 7,182. Equality House, for its part, noted the difference between the image and the way Avaaz described it in the caption of its post. But the group still circulated the flawed information and did not delete it. Our ruling Bloggers said shoes on the Capitol lawn this week represented 7,182 students killed in U.S. schools since 2012. That’s not accurate. The pairs of shoes symbolized more than 7,000 children who had been killed by gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting. The number of children killed in school violence, while fluid, is certainly smaller than that total. We rate this claim False.

pomt-15122	Says Scott Walker rejected legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible and the result was "to raise taxes on students."	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/09/hillary-clinton/scott-walker-rejected-bill-make-student-loan-payme/	Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign will make its first stop in the Badger State on Sept. 10, 2015. The visit, with a private fundraiser and a public event at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, comes one month to the day after Clinton proposed a 10-year, $350 billion college affordability plan. That plan aims to reduce the cost of four-year public schools, make two-year community colleges tuition-free and cut student loan interest rates. Speaking about the plan the next day, Aug. 11, 2015, the Democratic frontrunner took a swipe at the Republican White House contenders and singled out Gov. Scott Walker. "I think this is a major challenge and I want us to address it. Not one word from the other side," Clinton said during a campaign appearance in New Hampshire. "And you take somebody like Governor Walker of Wisconsin, who seems to be delighting in slashing the investment in higher education in his state." She added: "And most surprisingly to me, rejecting legislation that would have made it tax deductible for you, on your income tax, to deduct the amount of your loan payments. I don't know why he wants to raise taxes on students. But that's the result when you don’t look for ways to help people who are not sitting around asking for something, who are actually working hard every day to get ahead." Some of the national press coverage of her speech focused on the claim. Politico’s headline was: "Hillary accuses Walker of raising taxes on students." The response of Walker’s campaign at the time wasn’t a denial, but rather an emphasis on how he had frozen tuition in Wisconsin for four consecutive years. So, did Walker reject a bill to make college loan payments tax deductible, and in doing so did he raise taxes on students? The legislation Clinton’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests for information to back her statement. But a bill introduced by Democrats in the Wisconsin Legislature in 2013, and two similar measures introduced in 2015, proposed creating a state authority to refinance student loans and allow Wisconsin student loan borrowers to deduct student loan payments from their state income tax. The maximum benefit for the tax deduction was estimated at $531 a year for single filers in top tax brackets and $1,062 for married couples. The 2013 bill was introduced in the GOP-controlled state Senate but died in February 2014 without a vote. Democrats have since tried twice to push the measure forward. In May 2015, as an amendment to the state budget, the measure failed on a party-line vote in the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee. Separate legislation mirroring the 2013 bill also was introduced in June 2015. The bill has been referred to a Senate committee, but no further action has been taken. The state Department of Revenue estimates the deduction would reduce tax revenue to the state by $79.5 million per year. So, a tax deduction measure has never made it to Walker’s desk. Walker’s position As for Walker’s position on the deduction, we addressed that in October 2014 when the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee stated that Walker "opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans." The reference was to the Democrats’ 2013 legislation, which included the tax deduction. We rated the claim False. The group contended that since Walker didn’t speak, or take action, in favor of the measure, he opposed it. But as we noted, no votes were ever taken by a committee or the full Legislature, so the bill never reached Walker’s desk. And while Walker didn’t move to advance the bill, we found no evidence that he expressed opposition to it. We also noted that Walker had been quoted as saying he would be willing to look at measures like the Democrats’ refinancing bill, but that he questioned whether the proposal was "more than just politics." "If it was a good idea, I’m sure they would have passed it four years ago when they controlled the Assembly and the Senate and the governorship," Walker said at the time, referring to 2010, when Democrats controlled state government. One of the backers of the legislation, state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, told us that although Walker has never been asked to approve or reject the measure, his opposition to it is apparent. "It’s pretty clear, if he wants a piece of legislation, it comes to his desk," Larson said. Perhaps. But it's unknown what action Walker might have taken had the bill made it to him. As for the rest of Clinton’s claim, it’s clear that because the tax deduction measure didn’t become law, student loan borrowers didn’t get the benefit of a deduction. But that didn’t mean their taxes were raised as a result, which is what Clinton claimed. Rather, the status quo remained in effect. Inaction means nothing changed, positively or negatively. Our rating Clinton said Walker rejected legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible and the result was "to raise taxes on students." The Republican governor hasn’t stated support for Democratic-sponsored measures that would have provided the tax deduction, but he has never rejected such legislation, either.

pomt-04969	"Gov. Romney's plan would cut taxes for the folks at the very top."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romney-tax-plan-would-cut/	After a flurry of attack ads in the past two weeks, President Barack Obama this week released a TV ad in which he spoke directly into the camera and discussed how his policy approaches differed from Mitt Romney’s. He cited taxes as one area where they had different philosophies. Obama said, "Gov. Romney's plan would cut taxes for the folks at the very top." We’ll check whether this is an accurate characterization of Romney’s plan. Romney has posted some key elements of his tax plan on his campaign website. Here’s a summary of the provisions for individual taxpayers: • Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis • Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000 • Eliminate the estate tax • Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax To analyze the Romney tax cut, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. The Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romney’s tax proposal. We will use the analysis of the more recent of Romney’s two plans, which the group published in March 2012. The Tax Policy Center ran two sets of numbers, one that gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax and one that doesn't. Under the analysis that gives Romney credit for extending the Bush tax cuts and the AMT, people in each of the 11 income ranges in the center’s study saw a tax cut, with after-tax income increasing by anywhere from 0.3 percent for people who earn less than $10,000 to 19.8 percent for people earning more than $1 million per year. Under the other measurement, which we find is more appropriate, people in eight of the 11 income ranges got cuts -- all except the income ranges below $30,000. For those earning more than that, after-tax income would increase by anywhere from 0.8 percent for those in the $30,000 to $40,000 range to nearly 12 percent for those earning more than $1 million. So Obama is telling part of the story. Yes, there are substantial benefits for people at the top, but he ignores that most people in the middle and lower reaches of the income ladder would benefit as well. Using the calculation that does not give him credit for the Bush and AMT extensions, people earning from $40,000 to $50,000 would see a cut of $512 on average, while taxpayers in the $50,000-to-$75,000 range would see a cut of $1,122. Still, there is support for Obama's point because the Romney tax cuts are tilted toward the wealthy. The biggest winners under Romney’s tax plan are those earning more than $1 million. That group accounts for less than 1 percent of all taxpayers, but would receive 26 to 31 percent of the Romney plan’s tax benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center's calculations. Our ruling Obama is correct that Romney’s plan does indeed cut taxes for high-income Americans -- quite heavily in fact -- but the rich aren’t the only ones who would see a cut. Taxes would be reduced in lower income ranges, too. Still, the plan gives a large share of the benefits to higher income taxpayers. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.

He criticized fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic contrast to John McCain, the apparent Republican front-runner. In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues. Among Obama's points: "It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq." Obama is referring to the 2002 vote authorizing the use of force in Iraq, widely considered to have given President Bush the authority for the invasion. Clinton voted for the measure, as did McCain. Obama was not in the U.S. Senate at that time, though he did give a speech opposing the war while an Illinois state senator. Obama is right: Clinton and McCain were on the same side in voting for the use of force in Iraq. We find this claim to be True.

pomt-02203	Capital Metro originally said MetroRail's yearly operating costs would be "about $2.5 million. Last year ... it cost $13 million to operate."	/texas/statements/2014/apr/24/bob-cole/austin-rail-lines-costs-more-double-2004-estimate-/	When it comes to proposed passenger rail, KOKE-FM talk host Bob Cole of Austin said recently, "Austin has been just like every other city in the country: The facts and figures they give you to sell it are far from the truth." Take the MetroRail commuter trains that Austin transit agency Capital Metro started running from Leander to downtown in 2010. Cole said on his March 31, 2014, morning show, "They told us that the annual amount to operate this thing’s going to be about $2.5 million. Last year ... it cost $13 million to operate it." Is the 32-mile Red Line costing five times more than expected? Worth bearing in mind: As we noted in a 2012 fact-check, the commuter train isn’t supposed to pay for itself; it’s considered a public service. Capital Metro opened the diesel-powered MetroRail service to passengers in March 2010, has expanded it somewhat and plans a major overhaul to provide more capacity -- the trains are mostly packed during rush hour, as we explored in a 2013 fact-check. Also, MetroRail is separate from a proposed electric-powered urban passenger rail line, decades in the making, that the City of Austin might take to voters in November 2014 for authorization of several hundred million dollars in bonds. Cole's backup information Big electric-rail proposals like that, Cole told us by phone, are why he initially supported MetroRail, a smaller diesel-train project on existing freight track -- as a less-costly way to test the waters. He was later dismayed, he said, to see MetroRail’s costs exceed Capital Metro’s initial predictions. Cole told us he drew his dollar amounts from memory, having tracked the project since before voters approved it in November 2004. Capital Metro cost calculations We found no instances of Capital Metro giving a $2.5 million annual operating costs figure, or any estimate other than $5 million, in 2004. Then again, that $5 million estimate included $3 million a year for lease-purchase of the required rail cars. By phone and email, Capital Metro spokeswoman Francine Pares told us something surprising: The 2004 estimate solely covered the expected cost of a rail contractor, including service delivery, dispatching, supervision, vehicle maintenance and right-of-way maintenance. She said the estimate left out costs including "fuel, track maintenance, bridge maintenance, signal maintenance, communication system maintenance, signal crossing maintenance, inspections" and "administrative costs." The "full system had not been designed yet, so no estimates could be made as to how the full system would be built out," Pares wrote. Pares stressed, too, the estimate emerged six years before trains started running and before how often trains run was stepped up. A timeline she provided indicated the trains, originally penciled in to have 5,100 service hours a year, are projected to exceed 14,200 service hours in the fiscal year through September 2014. "Operating costs have increased as the inflation, labor, fuel and service hours have increased each year," she said. Before voters acted in 2004, Capital Metro issued an estimate of likely operating costs without specifying what the estimate left out: From August 2004 Capital Metro presentation: Accounting for rail cars About the rail cars: Before the November 2004 vote, an Aug. 17, 2004, Austin American-Statesman news story reported details of the final recommended version of the $60 million plan. On operating costs, the story said, "Not included in the $60 million is the upfront cost of the six self-propelled hybrid-diesel rail cars the agency thinks it would need initially to provide rush-hour service at 30-minute intervals when the line opens in 2007 or 2008. Those cars would probably cost about $3 million a year for a lease-purchase. Even including that lease cost, Capital Metro estimates initial annual operating costs of $5 million," the story said. That $5 million in 2004, adjusting for inflation, projects out to $5.8 million in 2010 dollars and $6.2 million in 2013 dollars. But after the 2004 vote, Capital Metro decided to buy the train cars instead of leasing to own and took out a loan in 2006 for the purchase. Statesman news stories in 2008 and 2011 said the agency was spending $4.4 million a year in debt payments on the loan (comparable to the $3 million annual lease-purchase payments projected in 2004). Cole said that because of that change, "they no longer include the train cost in operating (costs)," and the figures of $2.5 million and $13 million that he gave on the air were operating costs that excluded the lease or purchase costs of the train cars. If he’d included the car payments, Cole said, he’d have been able to say annual operating costs went from a projected $5 million to actual $15 million. MetroRail costs from 2011 on Costs have gone up, Capital Metro's Pares said, as have service hours. By email, she sent figures from fiscal 2011 -- the line’s first full fiscal year of service, ending Sept. 30, 2011 -- through the actual costs for 2013 and the projected amount budgeted for fiscal 2014: 2011: 10,731 train service hours. Direct operating costs $9.1 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $4.4 million; total $13.5 million. 2012: 11,502 train service hours. Direct operating costs $10.3 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $1.7 million; total $12 million. 2013: 11,466 train service hours. Actual operating expenses $10.5 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $2.9 million; total $13.4 million. (Direct operating costs were still being finalized, Pares said.) 2014: 14,100 train projected service hours. Operating budget $12.6 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $2.9 million; total $15.5 million. So, with the car lease or loan payments included, Capital Metro originally estimated $5 million operating costs, which projects out to $6.2 million in 2013 dollars. The agency ultimately spent $13.4 million to operate the line and make debt payments on the rail cars in 2013. Excluding the car payments, 2004’s estimate was $2 million (equal to $2.5 million in 2013 dollars) and 2013’s costs were $10.5 million. Some context: In an April 22, 2010, news story, the Statesman reported that a Texas Sunset Advisory Commission report found mismanagement at Capital Metro, including poor planning that caused MetroRail to cost $140 million plus $8 million in loan interest on the cars. MetroRail’s financial picture subsequently improved. In December 2011, the agency reduced its car payments by refinancing the loan, and a Feb. 3, 2013, Statesman news story said that, thanks largely to a $9 million federal grant, "the commuter line is much closer to covering its $14.5 million annual operating cost than in its first two years." Our ruling According to Cole, Capital Metro originally said MetroRail annual operating costs "would be about $2.5 million. … last year, it cost $13 million to operate." He’s correct, even conservative, on the 2013 costs. But Cole understates MetroRail’s initial projected operating costs of $5 million, or $6.2 million in 2013 dollars, which Capital Metro told us didn’t roll in fuel and other costs. The rail line’s 2013 operating costs, including payments on the rail-car loan, were about $13 million--more than double the inflation-adjusted 2004 estimate, perhaps in part due to trains having more service hours than initially envisioned.

pomt-02330	"Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-high-schoolers-are-graduating-al/	During his 2011 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama warned Congress that the American education system was putting millions of students at a disadvantage in the 21st century job market. "Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree. And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school." But recently, a politician gave a speech in Orlando claiming the school system was on a roll. "Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record. Absolutely," the politician said. "More young people are earning college degrees than ever before." So who had the nerve to test the president’s assessment of the U.S.education system? The correct answer: Barack Obama. Yup, just three years after Obama used the high school graduation rate as a call to action, he’s now using it to proclaim the achievements of his administration. We gave Obama a Mostly True in 2011 when he claimed up to 25 percent of Americans drop out of high school. So how does his current statement, that the graduation rate is at a record high, stack up? Counting diplomas Tracking the number of Americans earning a high school diploma seems like a simple task, but it has proven to be a tough stat to track. The U.S. Education Department utilizes a stat called the Average Freshman Graduation Rate. It’s an estimate of the number of high school students who graduate on time in four years, and it’s used by looking at enrollment data from year to year. States and local school districts for years used various methods to determine the percentage of students who graduate high school. Maine in 2007 and 2008, for example, counted students who graduated from private schools with publicly funded tuition in their state tallies. The statistic mostly measures public school students, another major hole in the national data. As a result, national figures had flaws and year-to-year comparisons were difficult because so many schools count degrees differently. "It does seem like dropout rates should be easily and unambiguously measured, but for a million reasons they’re not," said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education. "Until recently many schools have been pretty casual about record keeping," he said. "At what point is a kid a dropout? When he doesn’t show up for a month? A semester? What if he moves to a different city and enrolls there and nobody tells the original school? Or a kid drops out at 15 and gets a GED at 19? All of these little things can turn out to be pretty significant." More recently, the federal government has worked with states to get everyone on the same page with a new more vigorous statistic, the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate, that will create a uniform method for tracking high school graduation rates in public school students moving forward. "Basically the feds have thrown their hands up in the air and said, ‘Let’s get it right from here on, and not worry about stuff in the past that we can’t fix,’ " Bills said. What the numbers say Nevertheless, when we talked to experts, they still thought graduation rates were improving and they pointed to a number of markers. The White House sent us toward numbers from the National Center for Education Statistics at the Education Department, which put the graduation rate at 81 percent in 2011-12. The previous high was in 1969-70, when the graduation rate was 78.7 percent. Again, comparing stats collected in 2012 versus 1970 isn’t apples to apples, but it does show trend lines, said Jim Hull, senior policy analyst at the Center for Public Education. "These are really just estimates, but you can get an accurate description of what’s going on," Hull said. "It might not be 80 percent are graduating, but we know the trend is definitely going up, and it’s a lot more than in the 1990s." Other methods for calculating graduation rates exist, and not all of them say recent years are the highest on record. Editorial Projects in Education, publishers of Education Week, put the graduation rate at 74.7 percent in 2009-10. "That’s pretty good, by historical benchmarks and the rate has been moving up in recent years," said Christopher Swanson, vice president of research and development. But at 77.1 percent, 1969 remains the watermark in their calculations, he said. Despite differences in methodology and problems collecting consistent data, there is general agreement that high school diplomas are on the rise. "All of (the measurements) show the same general trend toward a higher proportion of kids finishing high school," Bills said. Our ruling Obama said, "Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record." On paper, it’s an accurate claim using the federal government's metric, but that only accounts for public school students and states and local school districts collect the data differently, creating inconsistencies. We also found another trusted model that puts the high point at 1969. Still, the general sense in the education industry is that rates are on the rise and considerably higher than 20 or even 10 years ago. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. Correction, April 9, 2014: The initial version of this story incorrectly stated that the Education Department had changed how it calculated the Average Freshman Graduation Rate, citing a March 2013 press release. However, that release was referencing a different statistic, the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate, which Obama was not referencing in his speech. The story has been adjusted to reflect this correction. This does not change our rating of Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-03-26T10:15:56	2014-03-20	['None']
pomt-02833	"The reason we have a national debt is not because of defense spending. What is driving our long-term debt are Medicare and Social Security programs."	/florida/statements/2013/nov/22/marco-rubio/medicare-and-social-security-not-defense-are-drivi/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gave a speech about foreign policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute Nov. 20. After his speech, a Floridian in the audience asked him a question about how to convince Americans to support consistent defense spending. During part of his answer, Rubio made some claims about the debt. "The reason we have a national debt is not because of defense spending. What is driving our long-term debt are Medicare and Social Security programs that are structured in unsustainable ways." We decided to check in with several economists across the political spectrum and ask if Rubio’s assessment about the debt was correct. Medicare, Social Security and defense The economists we interviewed generally agreed that Medicare and Social Security account for huge chunks of our long-term debt. However, they also said that defense spending is also a factor, and some experts noted that Rubio left out a couple of other important factors: interest payments on the debt and Medicaid. Rubio didn’t quantify the role of defense in our national debt or specify a timeframe, he simply said that debt isn’t due to defense spending. But it’s a bit too simplistic to let defense spending entirely off the debt hook. "It is incorrect to say our current debt has nothing to do with defense spending, because we spend a lot of money on national defense every year, and we have large deficits -- therefore defense spending is one of the causes of our debt increase," said Josh Gordon of the centrist Concord Coalition. Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute sent us numbers which showed that based on 2014 total spending, "defense is 17 percent of the problem, Medicare is 17 percent of the problem, and Social Security is 24 percent of the problem." Rubio zeroed in on the long-term debt and Medicare and Social Security -- and there is evidence to support his claim. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that spending as a percentage of gross domestic product for entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security will grow much faster than defense. Defense spending will also grow, but at a far slower rate. Here’s a chart we found from the CBO that illustrates that general point; the CBO includes other health programs in the top line in addition to Medicare: By 2023, "the share of total spending by the entitlements will be much more than defense, and thus increasingly the entitlements are more drivers of deficits and debt than defense," Edwards said. While entitlements are more of a problem, "defense and other areas of spending are problems as well." All of our spending is responsible for the debt, said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow in the Economic Studies program at the Brookings Institution and a past senior adviser on welfare policy for President George W. Bush. "However, if you look at the most expensive and rapidly growing items as the major culprits, which seems reasonable to me, then Social Security is the biggest item, and Medicare in particular and health care in general the most rapidly growing in most years," Haskins said in an email. "Rubio’s list does not include a huge item, and that is interest payments. Over the next few decades, interest payments are likely to be the biggest single item in our budget and the most rapidly growing." Romina Boccia, a fellow in federal budgetary affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, cited spending growth in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Obamacare subsidies for our long-term deficit. "Social Security is the largest federal spending program and has held this position since surpassing defense in 1993," she said. Dean Baker, a liberal economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, argued that Social Security can’t drive the debt. "Under the law it can only pay benefits insofar as it has money in the trust fund," he said. "This means that it cannot possibly spend more than was collected in Social Security taxes." (We should note that the questions around the Social Security trust fund are particularly complex. Earlier this year, we rated a claim that the Social Security trust fund is "sound" as Half True.) So what’s the solution to reducing our debt? "Reversing the upward trajectory of the debt will require taking a look at ways to control health costs and reform Social Security," said Jason Peuquet at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "But that doesn't mean other savings can't play a vital role. Reforming the tax code to raise more revenue and reducing other spending will be vital elements in actually getting the debt under control." Our ruling Rubio said in a speech, "The reason we have a national debt is not because of defense spending. What is driving our longterm debt are Medicare and Social Security programs." Rubio is correct that Medicare and Social Security are drivers of our debt -- but there are other factors, too, including Medicaid and interest, economists said. Also, defense spending isn’t entirely off the hook. While Medicare and Social Security are projected to grow as a percentage of GDP, defense is projected to shrink by the same measurement -- but defense is a factor in our debt, albeit a far lesser one. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2013-11-22T14:06:39	2013-11-20	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
pomt-03359	"Women still earn about 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for working the same job."	/virginia/statements/2013/jul/15/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-women-earn-77-percent-mens-pay-same/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe is pledging to increase penalties against Virginia employees who discriminate against women in terms of pay. "The gender wage gap is real, and women still earn about 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for working the same job," McAuliffe says in a video on his his campaign website. McAuliffe, in his statement, became the latest in a growing list of Democrats to mischaracterize an actual figure on the gender wage gap released by the U.S. Census Bureau. Other notables include President Barack Obama and former President Jimmy Carter. McAuliffe is wrong to say that the 77-cent figure describes the actual pay difference between men and women "working the same job." The 77-cent figure compares the median pay of all full time, year-round male and female workers, regardless of occupation. Many experts say some of the gap is likely caused by discrimination, but most of it is due to career choices. "One of the big factors explaining why women earn less than men is that jobs typically done by women have lower earnings than jobs typically done by men," said Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. A 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh concluded that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by trends common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; they tend to have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; they tend to have a shorter work history; and they take more time off from work for childbirth and child care. The American Association for University Women issued a report this year that offered similar explanations for the pay gap, saying it is partly due to "men’s and women’s choices, especially the choice of college major and the type of job pursued after graduation." "For example, women are more likely than men to go into teaching, and this contributes to the pay gap because teachers tend to be paid less than other college graduates," the report said. Pamela Coukos, a senior program advisor at the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, said in a July 2012 blog post that "economists generally attribute about 40 percent of the pay gap to discrimination -- making about 60 percent explained by differences between workers or their jobs." Is there a way to drill down on pay difference for men and women doing the same job? The Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles figures on median weekly earnings by men and women with the same occupation. They show that women’s pay lags men in nearly all professions that are measured. For example, women credit counselors and loan officers in 2012 earned 79.1 percent of men. Women accountants and auditors earned 73.8 percent of their male counterparts. Women computer programmers earned 84.2 percent of what men earned in that field. But even those broad occupational categories don’t provide an apples-to-apples comparison of people "working the same job," said Karen Kosanovich, an economist with the BLS. The BLS, she explained, can look at the weekly earnings of men and women in the general category of "physicians and surgeons" -- but that doesn’t mean they’re the same type of doctor. Within that broad category are general practitioners and cardiologists, department heads and physicians who have just started their careers. "We can’t do same-job analysis," Kosanovich said. A final note: Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said his boss got the information for his statement on gender gap pay discrimination from a web post by the National Partnership for Women & Families. That posting, however, does not say the census data compared the pay of men and women doing the same jobs. Our ruling By saying women earn 77 percent of what men earn for "working the same job," McAuliffe took a valid figure and blew it out of proportion. Contrary to McAuliffe’s assertion, the 77-percent figure is not a comparison of the earnings of women doing the same jobs as men. It is a broad comparison of the median annual pay for men and women regardless of occupation. It does not factor in that men tend to chose higher paying professions than women and work more hours. We rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.	None	Terry McAuliffe	None	None	None	2013-07-15T06:00:00	2013-06-18	['None']
pomt-09505	“In this judicial race, special interest groups have demanded money from me, in exchange for endorsement and support.”	/texas/statements/2010/feb/20/eve-schatelowitz-alcantar/judicial-aspirant-eve-schatelowitz-alcantar-says-d/	Deep inside a voters guide circulated in the Austin area by the League of Women Voters of Texas, a judicial candidate makes a sit-up-quick claim. Eve Schatelowitz Alcantar, seeking the Democratic nod for Travis County’s 299th District Court, says: “In this judicial race, special interest groups have demanded money from me, in exchange for endorsement and support.” Demanded? That got our attention. Schatelowitz Alcantar told us her claim traces to the first question asked of candidates on a written survey distributed before a Jan. 28 forum at which Austin Democratic groups weighed endorsements. Such endorsements can be pivotal; they're touted by candidates in their advertising. Schatelowitz Alcantar said she didn't get any at the forum, which involved more than half a dozen Democratic clubs. In the question singled out by Schatelowitz Alcantar, the Travis County Democratic Party notes that the party pays for a coordinated campaign benefiting the Democratic ticket on the November ballot. It doesn't pussy-foot in asking candidates to pitch in, saying the party “would like to know if you, a 2010 Democratic primary candidate, will be willing to fully contribute to the coordinated campaign and if you are willing to make that pledge right now. This is a yes or no question.” The amounts sought, per office, range from $2,500 for justice-of-the-peace candidates up to $7,500 for candidates for district judge and county judge. Schatelowitz Alcantar conceded the survey question made no direct link between a candidate's commitment to give money and endorsements from Democratic clubs. “There is nothing explicit,” she said. “But let me ask you this: Why do you think they ask that question in the first place?... The purpose of asking that question was to gain the endorsements of those clubs.” We didn't find any clubs that acknowledged such a quid pro quo at work. Natomi Austin, president of the Black Austin Democrats, said answers to the question did not affect her club's endorsements. "When it comes to asking for money, people always consider it to be heavy handed," Austin said. Fred Cantu, president of the Austin Tejano Democrats, said the only complaints he heard about the question came from "people who had never participated in the process or had never contributed.... Schatelowitz Alcantar is maybe a little naïve about the process, if anything. If she was to get nominated and she had a Republican opponent, I guarantee she’d feel very different in the fall." Schatelowitz Alcantar said two other candidates for state district judgeships were appalled by the question: William Gammon and Keith Lauerman. Both reported getting no endorsements at the forum. Gammon said he found the donation question heavy-handed, but didn’t assume his negative reply would drive endorsement decisions. “The implication is you either pony up or nobody’s going to like you,” Gammon said. “It wasn’t a demand. That would be overstating it.” Lauerman said the question initially confused him because he thought it meant he was expected to donate before knowing if he’d won the March primary. He said he agreed to the pledge after a consultant assured him otherwise. Austin lawyer Andy Brown, who chairs the Travis County Democratic Party, said candidates' answers to the question don't affect the party's support: “There’s no action we’re expecting because of it. The bottom line is we (the countywide party) don’t endorse in the primary." Brown noted that in 2008 about one third of some $560,000 raised by the party was donated by candidates. “The goal here is for people to realize that the campaign in the fall does not run itself," Brown said. "Travis County is not inherently a Democratic county unless we put a lot of resources into getting the vote out this fall." Neither Brown's predecessor as party chairman, Austin lawyer Chris Elliott, nor leaders of several of the Democratic clubs that made endorsements in connection with the forum, saw anything inappropriate in asking candidates if they'd pledge to pitch in for the fall campaign. Elliott said: "Maybe that's a good way to get people committed." Clearly, Schatelowitz Alcantar didn't soft-pedal her objections to the way the Democratic Party's question puts a squeeze on candidates to contribute to the fall campaign. But Schatelowitz Alcantar overreached in saying the query was a demand for money in return for endorsements. No one we contacted--including the judicial aspirants recommended by Schatelowitz Alcantar--shared her interpretation. We rate Schatelowitz Alcantar's statement as False.

pomt-08896	"The first professional baseball team was from an Ohio city."	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/30/yvette-mcgee-brown/ohio-first-state-professional-baseball-team/	OK, so it probably won’t make or break the governor’s race in 2010, but a recent speech from Democratic lieutenant governor candidate Yvette McGee Brown touched on an oft-repeated piece of baseball lore to establish the importance of Ohio’s cities. While speaking on urban issues June 22, McGee Brown reeled off a list of accomplishments born in Ohio, including the widely-repeated claim that "the first professional baseball team" was formed in an Ohio city. But is baseball’s professional lineage so clearly rooted in the Buckeyes State? It was time to take a 7th inning stretch from serious politics and see if this claim was a hit or an error. In a timeline for his acclaimed documentary on baseball, filmmaker Ken Burns asserts that the first professional baseball team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869, which finished its tour of the National Association of Base Ball Players matches with a sparkling 70-0 record. An open and shut case? Not so fast. A history of the Red Stockings compiled by the Society for Cincinnati Sports Research suggests that the club’s secretary John Joyce knew that "all the top Eastern clubs were paying their star players" but not admitting it when he set out in 1869 to pursue a team of the best players at every position. Clearly, there were professional baseball players prior to the Red Stockings season of 1869. Gabriel Schecter, a researcher at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, said the key is that the Red Stockings were the first all-professional team where the players were openly paid — payroll records tally $9,400 for 10 players. "That’s the distinction that has to be made," Schecter said. "Prior to the Red Stockings, there were players here or there who were paid or who were given jobs, but it wasn’t a full team being paid above board." For example, a powerhouse team from Washington that toured in the late 1860s prior to the Red Stockings turning pro was stocked with players on the federal payroll. "All or most of the players had those jobs that basically subsidized them so they could play ball," he said. "The question is how much work those federal employees actually were doing," he said. A timeless question no doubt, but it probably doesn’t equate to professional in the sense we use it today. Still, was it possible that an entire team of players was being paid under the table prior to the Red Stockings? "I can’t say that I’m 100 percent sure," Schecter said. "I think that’s very unlikely because it would have been uncovered by now." Because it appears that no other team fielded a lineup of fully-professional players prior to the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869, we rule this claim to be True. If only all the calls made on the diamond were so clear-cut. Comment on this item.	None	Yvette McGee Brown	None	None	None	2010-07-30T09:10:00	2010-06-22	['Ohio']
pomt-06827	The United States has "the longest surviving constitution."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/08/jon-huntsman/oldest-surviving-one-document-text/	As he toured New Hampshire last week, Jon Huntsman wore his patriotism like a lapel pin. Even as he condemned President Barack Obama over what he labeled failed policies and leadership, Huntsman, the former Republican governor of Utah, saluted the American work ethic and the United States Constitution, which he touted as the world’s oldest. "We've got some great things going for us here that we forget sometimes," Huntsman told workers during an August 2, 2011 tour of Cirtronics Corp., a manufacturing firm in Milford, New Hampshire. "We have rule of law. We have the longest surviving constitution. … What we don't have is leadership." The rule of law in America is hard to question, and as for presidential leadership, we'll leave that to the candidates to debate. But, does America really have the world's longest surviving Constitution? That sounded like a question for PolitiFact. To start, we went straight to the source, the National Constitution Center, located on Independence Mall in Philadelphia. At 222 years old, America’s governing document is broadly considered the world’s longest surviving constitution, according to Dr. Steven Frank, the Constitution Center’s chief historian. Ratified in 1789, it beats out Norway’s constitution, which took effect in 1814 and Belgium's, implemented in 1831, according to a list compiled by Tom Ginsburg and Rosalind Dixon, constitutional law professors at the University of Chicago. "It's the most durable constitution in the world today," said Frank, of the Constitution Center. "Historians agree. It's been around longer than any other written constitution." But, that left us to wonder, what constitutes a constitution? The definition of the term is a significant question in political theory, according to Ginsburg, the University of Chicago law professor. But the term is loosely defined as a collection of laws or governing statutes that "sets fundamental norms about the structure of government and its relationship with citizens," Ginsburg wrote in an e-mail. He also serves as one of the lead investigators for the Comparative Constitutions Project, a research project launched at the University of Illinois to analyze governing documents around the world. In their study, project researchers have found that enduring constitutions are usually made easy to amend to allow for growth and re-interpretation, Ginsburg said, and they are typically written by large cross-sections of people to encompass many points of view. "The funny thing is, the things which make constitutions endure aren't really found in the U.S. one," he said, pointing out that the United States Constitution was written by 100 rich, white men. "It seems to be very exceptional, the reason it endures." Elsewhere around the globe, many countries don’t follow a single constitution but instead operate under what historians call a "multi-text approach," in which national laws are based on different documents and statutes, many of which pre-date the United States Constitution. The United Kingdom, for instance, derives its constitution from a large number of documents, including the Magna Carta, which dates back to 1297, according to Jef Ruchti, editor-in-chief of World Constitutions Illustrated, a publication of William S. Hein, & Co. "All told, it is traditional to consider that the U.S. Constitution is the oldest surviving one-document constitutional text. However, the others models do outdate it," Ruchti wrote in an e-mail. "And that is not even getting into the continuing debate as to whether the form of government of the Iroquois Nations had an impact on the writing of the U.S. Constitution or not." The republic of San Marino is often considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect. The republic, an enclave surrounded by Italy, has no formal constitution, but instead is governed by the Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini, a series of six books, written in Latin in the late 16th Century that dictates the country’s political system, among other matters. Our ruling: Historians and legal scholars alike may debate the definition, but most of us are clear in our concept of a constitution as a single governing document. As long as that’s the case, there is little room for argument. The U.S. Constitution is the longest surviving constitution in the world. Still, there are other countries that have multiple governing documents that are older than the U.S. Constitution. We rate Huntsman’s claim Mostly True. Update: After this item comparing the longevity of the U.S. Constitution to others around the world appeared, two readers noted that the Massachusetts state constitution is even older. Ratified in 1780, it served as a model for the authors of the U.S. Constitution, which was written seven years later, according to an account provided by the Massachusetts Judicial Branch.

pomt-11164	Says "Nancy Pelosi came out in favor of MS-13."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-nancy-pelosi-came-out-fa/	President Donald Trump cast Democrats as supporters of MS-13 gang members and uninterested in fighting crime. Trump routinely brings up brutal crimes committed by MS-13 members while highlighting his administration’s goal to incarcerate or deport them from the United States. At the May 22 Susan B. Anthony List’s Campaign for Life Gala, Trump claimed Democrats want open borders and don’t want to stop illegal immigration. "And the other day — just the other day — Nancy Pelosi came out in favor of MS-13," Trump said. "That’s the first time I’ve heard that. She wants them to be treated with respect, as do other Democrats." Trump repeated the charge against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on May 23 during a roundtable discussion on MS-13, saying: "I noticed recently where Democrats, Nancy Pelosi as an example, are trying to defend MS-13 gang members. I called them animals the other day and I was met with rebuke. They said, ‘they are people.’ They are not people. These are animals." We wondered about Trump’s claim that Pelosi "came out in favor of MS-13" and that she has defended gang members. Trump distorted the facts. Pelosi said "calling people animals is not a good thing," but did not focus her comments on MS-13 gang members. Trump’s ‘animals’ remark Trump made headlines earlier this month after labeling some people who come to the United States as "animals." His comment came during an immigration meeting with California officials. While Trump did not specifically mention MS-13 gang members in the "animals" sentence, his statement came after a sheriff spoke about "bad guys" and MS-13 gang members. (Here’s the full context.) Some interpreted Trump as saying all immigrants are "animals." Trump went on Twitter May 18 to fight back that assessment: "Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, ‘Animals.’ Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as ‘Animals,’ a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual!" Trump tweeted. What Pelosi said Pelosi clearly chose the interpretation of Trump’s words at the roundtable that was least favorable to Trump. But that doesn’t mean she was embracing violent gang members. At a May 17 press conference, the day after Trump’s "animals" comment, Pelosi said "calling people animals is not a good thing" and defended "undocumented immigrants." She did not mention MS-13 gang members. Pelosi said "we're all God's children" and spoke about "a spark of divinity in every person on Earth." "And so when the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, ‘These aren't people. These are animals,’ you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person? ‘These are not people. These are animals.’ The president of the United States," Pelosi said. White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in an emailed statement, "Pelosi either is peddling an out-of-context quote that mainstream media outlets have corrected or retracted (AP and CNN), or defending MS-13 gang members whose motto is rape, control, and kill." The White House said the "animals" term is language Trump has used before when talking about MS-13 gang members. Still, Pelosi did not defend MS-13 gang members or come out in their favor, as Trump claimed. She centered her comments on "undocumented immigrants" and rebuked using the word "animals" to refer to people. Our ruling Trump said Pelosi "came out in favor of MS-13." Trump’s claim is based on Pelosi’s criticism of Trump for using the word "animals" during an immigration meeting with California officials. Trump used that term after a sheriff spoke about MS-13 gang members. A day after Trump’s comment, Pelosi said "calling people animals is not a good thing" and defended "undocumented immigrants." Pelosi did not mention MS-13 gang members in her comments. While Trump blasted media reports and others for missing the context of his remarks, he did just that with Pelosi’s comment. We rate it False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We updated this story on May 29, 2018 to include reaction from the White House after the story published, emphasizing that Trump has previously used the term "animals" to refer to MS-13 gang members.

pomt-01638	"Over 60 percent of the provisional ballots cast in [the 2012] election were disqualified because those folks were not duly registered as voters."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/26/john-carlevale/john-carlevale-60-provisional-ballots-2012-ri-elec/	The issue of voter identification continues to percolate through the political campaign season. It surfaced again when John Carlevale, a Republican running for secretary of state, was interviewed on the Aug. 10 edition of WPRI's "Newsmakers" program. Carlevale said he supports the state's current -- and controversial -- voter ID law, which requires voters to present photo identification. He contended that evidence for why it is needed surfaced during the 2012 election, the first in which the law was partially in effect. "Those folks who were not able to show valid ID were given a provisional ballot," he said. "And what did we learn from that? Over 60 percent of the provisional ballots cast in that election were disqualified because those folks were not duly registered as voters." (Voters may also be issued provisional ballots if they show up at the wrong polling place or didn’t register 30 days before the election. Such ballots are later counted if the voter’s registration is confirmed.) We wondered whether 60 percent of the folks who got a provisional ballot weren't actually registered to vote. We emailed Carlevale to ask for supporting evidence. Meanwhile, we called the state Board of Elections, where executive director Robert Kando reported that 2,357 provisional ballots were issued in 2012; 1,189 of those were ultimately disqualified because the person had not registered. That's 50.4 percent, not 60 percent as Carlevale reported. When we heard back from Carlevale, he reported getting slightly different numbers from the Board of Elections: 2,231 provisional ballots with 1,188 (53.2 percent) not counted because they were disqualified. Kando said Carlevale was given incorrect numbers. Whether it's 50.4 percent or 53.2 percent, that's well below the "over 60 percent" Carlevale claimed. He said in an email that he had misread his notes, apologizing for the error. It turns out that the number can vary. In the 2010 non-presidential election, where the turnout was much lower, there were 918 provisional ballots statewide and only 197 of those -- 21.5 percent -- were disqualified because the person was not registered. That was before the Voter ID law had been implemented. We also checked Providence's numbers. Kathy Placencia, administrator of elections for the Board of Canvassers, said the city gave out 449 provisional ballots for the 2012 general election and 98 were rejected because the person had not registered by the deadline. That's 21.8 percent. In 2010 it was 38.3 percent. Our ruling Secretary of State candidate John Carlevale said, "Over 60 percent of the provisional ballots cast in [the 2012] election were disqualified because those folks were not duly registered as voters." Data from the Rhode Island Board of Elections shows that the actual total was 50.4 percent. He's off the mark, but close enough to earn a Half True.

pomt-01731	"25 percent of all drug-related fatal vehicle accidents in the U.S. involve marijuana."	/florida/statements/2014/aug/05/dont-let-florida-go-pot/medical-marijuana-opponents-say-drug-often-involve/	Medical marijuana opponents are taking to the streets to oppose Amendment 2, citing statistics that drugged driving would be a major side effect to legalizing cannabis. Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot, a coalition of more than 40 organizations fighting against the proposed medical marijuana amendment, says on its website that the drug is implicated in a fourth of all fatal accidents. "Twenty five percent of all drug-related fatal vehicle accidents in the U.S. involve marijuana," the group says under the header "Statistics" (the number is repeated on an infographic on the site). Was marijuana a factor in a quarter of all fatal car accidents involving drugs? PolitiFact Florida hit the books to see what Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot was driving at. For the record First of all, we have to note this check began when we noticed on Aug. 4, 2014, that the Statistics page actually had the sentence, "25 percent of all fatal vehicle accidents in the U.S. involve marijuana." That certainly sounded like too much to us, so we asked the group about it. Eric Pounders, spokesman for the Florida Sheriffs Association, responded to our questions that evening by saying the statement included the phrase "drug-related." That’s not what we read, but it’s what the site says now. Pounders concluded that although the prior phrasing had been used as recently as three months ago, it had been clarified to be more accurate. He told PolitiFact Florida we may have "encountered a previous version of the site that had been temporarily restored to fix an issue." In any event, he said the 25 percent stat came from an October 2011 White House Office of National Drug Control Policy report that measured the rate of positive results among drivers that had been tested for drugs in fatal crashes between 2005-2009. The study used National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System data of accidents across 50 states in which the driver was killed and subsequently tested for drugs. The report noted that of the roughly 127,000 fatal crashes in that time frame, almost 78,000 drivers were tested for drugs. Winnowing down those results, positive tests for cannabinoids rose steadily from 22.6 to 26 percent between 2005 and 2008, dropping slightly to 25.3 percent in 2009. There are some problems with that data. First of all, there is no set procedure or uniform level of toxicity for drug testing among the states, as laws and protocols vary widely. The report says "a positive test result does not necessarily imply impairment or causation," and says testing often is inaccurate. Furthermore, data in which a driver may have been using drugs but survived a crash in which someone else died is not included. There is often no universally accepted threshold of impairment for illicit drugs, the White House report says. There also is some question as to whether the specific presence of cannabinoids, including the main psychoactive chemical component, tetrahydrocannabinol, is an accurate indicator of impairment. The NHTSA states, "It is difficult to establish a relationship between a person's THC blood or plasma concentration and performance impairing effects." That’s in part because cannabinoids linger in a person’s system long after they’ve ingested the drug. "Marijuana, unlike alcohol and most other drugs, stays in a person’s system for up to 30 days," says Ben Pollara, spokesman for United for Care, the group promoting Florida’s Amendment 2. "So its presence in a person’s blood is not an indicator that they were impaired at the time of the accident." That 25-percent figure seems to track with other studies of drug-related fatal crashes, however. One 2011 study from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Calverton, Md., examined fatal single-vehicle accidents between 1998 and 2009 that involved speeding, failure to obey or yield, inattention and failure to use a seat belt. That study found about 23 percent of those crashes involved cannabinoids, although the study adds the caveats that the drivers’ drug levels were not available, and those deaths most often involved speeding and the driver not using a seat belt. When you change the parameters of the research, the numbers vary. A 2014 Columbia University study looking at six states reported marijuana was present in 12 percent of accidents in 2010, up from 4 percent in 1999. A University of Colorado School of Medicine study released in May 2014 comparing Colorado to 34 other states concluded marijuana was present in 10 percent of fatal accidents by the end of 2011, as opposed to 4.5 percent at the beginning of 1994. But yet another study from 2012 from universities in Oregon, Montana and Colorado measured crashes in medical marijuana states. The study found that while instances of drugged driving went up in those places, total fatal accidents dropped somewhere between 8 and 11 percent overall. The possible reason, in a nutshell? Most people probably smoke their weed at home instead of driving home drunk from a bar, the study’s authors hypothesized. Alcohol still remains the most abused substance involved in fatal drug-related accidents -- as high as 60 percent, depending on the year and study. Montana State University economics professor D. Mark Anderson, one of the authors of the study showing a decrease in fatalities, said that the numbers didn’t supply a direct link between marijuana use and accidents. Indeed, none of the research PolitiFact Florida cited above claimed to establish a definite cause and effect. "Maybe 25 percent of all people involved in fatal vehicle accidents also drank milk for breakfast," Anderson said. Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot said, "25 percent of all fatal drug-related vehicle accidents in the U.S. involve marijuana." Some other research backs up that number, although the studies are limited in scope and descriptiveness. Reports usually don’t show whether marijuana use was the cause of the accident or how long ago the drug was ingested, and are limited in several other ways. Marijuana, for example, can be detected in person’s system for weeks after ingestion. The study cited by the group also only measured drivers that died and were tested for drugs, a very specific scope that doesn’t tell the whole story. Experts warned it’s not wise to imply causation among marijuana users in fatal crashes, but a 25 percent rate of involvement has been established in some studies. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-06966	"POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job."	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/15/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-says-obamas-economists-/	Republicans in Congress were not functioning independently of one another on their first workday after the Independence Day holiday. Shortly after noon on July 5, House Speaker John Boehner’s "tweeted" a July 3 blog posting from the conservative Weekly Standard’s website, labeling it "POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job." Around 4 p.m., the National Republican Congressional Committee followed suit with multiple press releases that used the same Weekly Standard blog item to target dozens of Democrats in Congress, including Ohio’s Betty Sutton. Its headline: "New Report Shows Dems’ Failed Stimulus Cost $278,000 Per Job As Economy Got Worse." It went onto claim that Sutton’s "government spending spree" "delivered little except skyrocketing debt owed to foreign countries like China." By 4:55 p.m., the National Republican Senatorial Committee had recycled the Weekly Standard blog posting to attack Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. This time the claim was: "President Obama’s own top economists estimate that the Obama-Brown stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average $278,000 per job." PolitiFact Ohio thought the concerted GOP effort made it worthy of a look. Since Boehner kicked it off on Twitter, we’ll use his tweet. The Weekly Standard blog item that spawned the statistic cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which states the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act "saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011." It also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill’s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion. The $278,000 per job figure doesn’t appear anywhere in the White House report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars per job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000. The blog item contends this statistic "provides further evidence that President Obama’s ‘stimulus’ did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt," and insists "the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus’ and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead." After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokesman Jay Carney said its conclusions were "based on partial information and simply false analysis." White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn issued a statement that noted the Recovery Act bolstered infrastructure, education, and industries "that are critical to America’s long-term success and an investment in the economic future of America’s working families." The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn’t just fund salaries - as the blog item implies - it also funded numerous capital improvements and infrastructure projects. Lumping all costs together and classifying it as salaries produces an inflated figure. Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report’s low end jobs estimate. Had it instead gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure. Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A "fact check" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math "satisfyingly simple but highly misleading." "Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers’ output - a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped form a factory floor, railroad tracks laid," the 2009 Associated Press item noted. The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually "has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs." It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs - or 288,000 more than it has now. Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data. "It’s not that ARRA [the stimulus] is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA’s help," Zandi told TPMDC. "This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery." The day after the White House responded to the GOP’s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but "rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000." Yet, his original item did say taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead if the government had simply "cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus?" So where does that leave Boehner’s tweet that said "POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job." The figure attributed to the president’s economists does not appear anywhere in the White House report. Rather, the Weekly Standard attributed the number to economists at the White House after it made its own calculations and conclusions. The methodology used to get that number was previously termed suspect because it lumps all costs associated with stimulus projects together as if they are wages, suggesting it would have been cheaper to just "cut a $100,000 check" to each person who found work as a result of the stimulus. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Boehner’s tweet (and the subsequent variations of his claim) as False. Comment on this item.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2011-07-15T06:00:00	2011-07-05	['None']
pomt-13973	Says Hillary Clinton "plans to massively increase admissions (of Middle East refugees) … including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-let-500-pe/	The mass shooting inside an Orlando nightclub is even more evidence that the United States needs to restrict the number of foreigners coming into the country, Republican Donald Trump argued in a speech attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton. Refugees are potential terrorists, Trump said, and when it comes to refugees, "our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions, without a screening plan, including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. Tell me. Tell me, how stupid is that?" Trump’s claim that there is no screening plan rates False; there is a screening plan. But we also wondered if Clinton wanted to bring in that many more Syrian refugees from Syria, a country devastated by warring factions. When the refugees began making their way to Germany and other European countries, with many men, women and children dying in the process, there was concern that the United States was not helping European countries deal with the influx. During a Sept. 20 appearance on CBS' Face the Nation, Clinton was asked if President Barack Obama's plan to increase the number allowed into the United States to 10,000 was enough. (The United States had accepted about 2,000 in 2015.) "Look, we’re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more, and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in," Clinton said. Clinton said she would be "looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women." A jump to 65,000 would be a 550 percent increase. To put this in context, Clinton has also made it clear that, under her administration, the United States wouldn't blindly accept anyone from Syria. The Clinton campaign pointed us to a Dec. 15, 2015, speech she made at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis. "We also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals," Clinton said. " Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it’s a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months." "It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones," she said. "So after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing Syria." Our ruling Trump said Clinton "plans to massively increase admissions (of Middle East refugees) … including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country." Clinton has, in fact, said that in response to the refugee crisis she would raise Obama's limit of 10,000 to 65,000. That's 550 percent more, a bit higher than what Trump said. But Clinton has also made it clear that they would have to first be vetted by a screening process, an important detail in the context of Trump's larger point that would-be terrorists have to be kept out of the country. Because the statement is mostly accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c1af08da-8464-444e-8305-88bf395617a0	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-13T17:55:19	2016-06-13	['Middle_East', 'Syria']
pomt-13708	"Just on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between (Donald) Trump and Congressman (Joe) Heck."	/nevada/statements/2016/jul/28/catherine-cortez-masto/nevada-senate-candidate-not-ideological-soul-mate-/	National and state Democrats are trying to tie Nevada Republican Senate candidate Joe Heck to the controversial immigration policies of Donald Trump,including Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto. In a recent news release, Cortez Masto’s campaign called the two Republicans "ideological soul mates." "Just on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between Trump and Congressman Heck," stated Cortez Masto’s release. With immigration being a top concern for Nevada’s sizable Hispanic population, we thought it was worth comparing the two candidates to see if it really is "next to impossible" to find a policy difference. Priorities On the surface level, there are many policy differences on immigration between Heck and Trump. Trump’s immigration platform is detailed on his campaign website, and centers around three topics previously distilled by PolitiFact: Build a border wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, and require Mexico to make a one-time $5 to $10 billion payment to pay for it. Increase enforcement of immigration laws, including ending birthright citizenship and ending funding for so-called sanctuary cities. Focus on American workers, including halting green cards for foreign workers until more domestic workers are hired and increasing the minimum prevailing wage for H-1B visa program recipients. Heck’s campaign and House websites acknowledge a "broken" immigration system but focus on different policy solutions. While echoing Trump in calling for implementing a mandatory E-verify system for employers and calling for increased border security, Heck says he’s open to granting citizenship or legal status to people not legally in the country if his other proposals are addressed in a "meaningful" way. Both campaigns sent lengthy responses to PolitiFact. One thing is clear: There is daylight between Heck and Trump on a number of immigration policies. Birthright citizenship Democrats claim Heck and Trump share identical positions on wanting to "end birthright citizenship and repeal the 14th Amendment." It’s true both Republicans have mentioned re-examining the concept of jus soli — extending citizenship based on place of birth, not parental nationality — but Heck and Trump differ on rhetoric. Trump explicitly calls for an end to the policy, calling it the "biggest magnet for illegal immigration." (He also cites Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid’s 1993 bill "clarifying" the concept, though Reid later called it the "low point" of his legislative career.) Heck has also called for a similar re-examination of the policy, but in a less direct tone. His most pointed comments came in 2012, where a tracker captured Heck saying he supported changing the concept. "My personal opinion is that if you’re gonna be a citizen – be considered a citizen – you should be born to at least one parent that’s a U.S. citizen," he said at the time. Heck generally hasn’t gone as far since then, most recently telling a Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter that "it needs to be part of the discussion" but stopping short of a full endorsement. Legal scholars generally agree that birthright citizenship is on solid constitutional ground, but several believe it would only take a congressional act to "clarify" citizenship for children born of people not legally in the United States, and point out that the court has never fully adjudicated the issue. 2013 immigration bill Cortez Masto says Heck and Trump both opposed the 2013 bipartisan immigration legislation, commonly referred to as the "Gang of Eight" bill. That glosses over important parts of the story. In 2013, Heck described the legislation as having positives and negatives but ultimately said he’d vote against the Senate bill as written, pointing to concerns over border security and wanting to toughen the education requirements for the children of people not legally in the country looking to apply for citizenship. The bill never received a House vote, but Heck still took independent action on the immigration bill. The Republican worked on draft legislation providing a pathway to citizenship for people illegally brought into the country as children, and publicly criticized House leadership in 2013 for failing to vote on any immigration legislation. Trump, on the other hand, told Bloomberg that he only really started following the immigration debate since he started running for president in 2015. "When I made my (announcement) speech at Trump Tower, the June 16 speech, I didn’t know about the Gang of Eight. … I just knew instinctively that our borders are a mess," he said in May. This is contradicted by several tweets and interviews Trump did in 2013, calling the legislation a "death wish" for the Republican Party. Trump later criticized primary rival Marco Rubio’s involvement in the legislation, calling it "nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties." DREAMers/DACA One of Heck’s most notable forays into the immigration debate was a failed attempt to bring forward a Republican version of the long-languishing Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. Heck worked for around six months to try to find a compromise path supported by both parties, businesses and immigration activists before trying to roll out the measure in December 2013. Heck’s version of the legislation, which had a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought unlawfully into the country as children, fell flat after immigration activists and several other stakeholders declined to back the proposal over concerns that it only addressed part of the problem and wanted to hold out for a more comprehensive immigration plan. Additionally, Heck has voted against funding for Obama’s executive orders allowing undocumented children and their parents to receive work permits and exemptions from deportation. He’s on the record voting for several amendments that would strip the program’s funding and voted in 2015 to block funding for an expansion of the program while joining with 25 other House Republicans to support the existing program. In the past, Heck has tried to frame his mixed voting record on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in terms of his stated opposition to the president’s use of executive orders establishing the programs. Trump is clearly opposed to the issue, and in 2015 called for the full rescission of executive orders protecting DREAMers from deportation, as well as the mass deportation of the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country. He’s also publicly opposed the DREAM Act itself. Heck has routinely called Trump’s proposals unrealistic. "I don’t think they can find, round up and afford to deport 11 million people," he told reporters in March. The wall/border security Heck also differs on Trump’s signature piece of immigration policy — building a massive border wall with Mexico. The Heck campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to constituents who ask about the proposed border wall. The letter stresses Heck’s commitment to border security while gently dismissing Trump’s plan for a massive, thousand-mile concrete wall as being inefficient. "Physical barriers are certainly effective in areas with high cross-border traffic; however, there are vast stretches of our border that have relatively few crossings, and preventing these crossings could be more easily achieved through other methods," he says in the letter. Part of Heck’s stated reasoning for opposing the 2013 immigration bill had to do with border security — the Republican specifically called for additional border fencing and for more manpower along the border to stop illegal crossings. H1-B visas Trump and Heck also differ on what to do with temporary H1-B visas for skilled foreign workers. Trump’s plan explicitly calls to increase the minimum prevailing wage (an averaged wage paid to workers in a similar field) for H1-B recipients over fears that the program depresses wages for American workers. It also makes an unspecified point of forcing companies to hire American workers before foreign workers in the visa program. Heck’s campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to voters who ask about limiting the visas, which details Heck’s concerns that scaling back the program could hurt economic growth. "By restricting H-1B visas, growth in the U.S. in STEM fields could be restricted," Heck says in the letter. Sanctuary cities Another area of immigration policy overlap for Trump and Heck is in defunding so-called "sanctuary cities," or areas where local law enforcement doesn’t routinely report undocumented migrants to immigration authorities. There’s no agreed-upon or legal definition of a "sanctuary city," and use of the moniker is somewhat fluid. Trump seized the issue after the shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco last year by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times, and has forcefully called for cutting off federal grants to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement. While he hasn’t been as vocal as Trump, Heck did vote to block federal law enforcement funds from sanctuary cities as part of a House bill in July 2015. The White House promised to veto the measure, which has defeated in a procedural vote by Senate Democrats. Our ruling Cortez Masto claims that "on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between (Donald) Trump and Congressman (Joe) Heck." There are areas where Heck and Trump overlap on immigration policy: mandatory E-verify for employers, upping border security and questioning birthright citizenship. However, Cortez Masto made it sound like Heck and Trump are lockstep on the issue, and that's clearly not the case. There are major stated policy differences between the two Republicans — Heck opposes mass deportation, which Trump campaigned on during the primary season. And Heck has supported a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country, as well as supported a version of the DREAM Act. It wasn't "next to impossible" to find those differences.

pomt-10516	"You don't even have to go outside Obama's campaign to find advisers who are anti-Israel."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/14/tennessee-republican-party/anti-israel-not-even-key-advisers/	A news release from the Tennessee Republican Party titled "Anti-Semites For Obama" seeks to cast doubt on Sen. Barack Obama's public pronouncements of support for Israel, alleging that some of the Obama campaign's key Middle East advisers are anti-Israel. Two names getting the most discussion are Zbigniew Brzezinski, a national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981, and Robert Malley, once a special assistant to President Bill Clinton for Arab-Israeli Affairs. These men ring alarm bells for some pro-Israel people who follow Israeli-Palestinian relations. Whether either is anti-Israel as described is a matter of opinion. More important, the Obama campaign claims neither is a formal adviser. The news release from the Tennessee Republican Party is direct. "You don't have to go outside Obama's campaign to find advisers who are anti-Israel," states Bill Hobbs, communications director for the Tennessee Republican Party, in the release. "Robert Malley, a principal foreign policy adviser to Obama, has advocated negotiating with the Iranian-funded radical terrorist group Hamas and urged that Hamas — which sends suicide bombers to kill innocent women and children — receive international assistance." The comments appear to parrot several articles written by Ed Lasky for the American Thinker, a conservative daily Internet publication. In a Jan. 16, 2008, article titled "Barack Obama and Israel," he claims that Obama "has assembled a body of foreign policy advisers who signal that a President Obama would likely have an approach towards Israel radically at odds with those of previous presidents (both Republican and Democrat)." Lasky claims that "Brzezinski is well known for his aggressive dislike of Israel" and that he "has been an ardent foe of Israel for over three decades." Marc Zell, co-chairman of Republicans Abroad in Israel, stated in an article in the Jerusalem Post that Brzezinski heads up Obama's "problematic" Middle East team. Brzezinski is faulted for advocating dialogue with Hamas prior to the November 2007 Middle East peace conference in Annapolis, Md. In a meeting with Cleveland Jewish community leaders on Feb. 24, Obama stated that he does not share Brzezinski's views with respect to Israel. Moreover, Obama said, "He's not one of my key advisers. I've had lunch with him once. I've exchanged e-mails with him maybe three times. He came to Iowa to introduce (me) ... for a speech on Iraq." Brzezinski, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, echoed that in an e-mail to the St. Petersburg Times. "I am a private supporter of Sen. Obama, and by not being part of the campaign as such I retain the right to continue advocating publicly my own views regarding policy issues — which I have done for years and on the record," Brzezinski wrote. "My views have been supported by Israelis who desire peace and I have frequently consulted them. The McCarthy-like comments you cite emanate from the fanatical right which for years has opposed any serious effort to end the tragic Middle Eastern conflict." Malley's chief offense among many pro-Israel activists is a letter he penned to the New York Times in which he claimed all sides, including Israel and not just the Palestinians, were to blame for the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit. The furor against Malley reached such a pitch that five former Middle East policy leaders (including Sandy Berger, former national security adviser, and Daniel Kurtzer, former ambassador to Israel) wrote a statement on Malley's behalf. In part, it read, "Over the past several weeks, a series of vicious, personal attacks have been launched against one of our colleagues, Robert Malley. ... They claim that he harbors an anti-Israeli agenda and has sought to undermine Israel's security. These attacks are unfair, inappropriate and wrong. They are an effort to undermine the credibility of a talented public servant who has worked tirelessly over the years to promote Arab-Israeli peace and U.S. national interests. They must stop." Obama's campaign states that while Malley has offered advice and opinions on a couple occasions, he is not a formal adviser either. "The truth is that Obama did ask for advice from some people who might be considered not the most enthusiastic pro-Israel policy wonks in Washington," said Shmuel Rosner, chief U.S. correspondent for Haaretz, a leading Israeli paper, who has written extensively about Obama's Middle East advisers. "However, these people are not in any way formal advisers that help shape Obama's policy on Israel-related topics." The day-to-day Middle East policy advisers with Obama's campaign, as confirmed by U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, who co-chairs Obama's Florida campaign, and other campaign staffers, are: Dan Shapiro, a member of Bill Clinton's National Security Council; Eric Lynn, a former foreign policy adviser to Rep. Peter Deutsch; Tony Lake, a former national security adviser to Clinton; and Dennis McDonough, foreign policy adviser to former Sen. Tom Daschle. These advisers are considered centrist Middle East policy wonks, Rosner said, and certainly not anti-Israel. "I don't think their advice would be much different than what Hillary Clinton would get from her advisers, or that (John) McCain would get from his Middle East advisers," Rosner said. Consider that in position papers and interviews, Obama has said he does not think the United States should be talking to Hamas. "Either he (Obama) didn't ask Malley for his advice, or he did ask for his advice and didn't accept it," Rosner said. While some would argue that it is problematic for Obama to even talk to people are who are not seen as pro-Israel, Rosner said, "I think it's all a bit hysterical." The allegations that Obama has surrounded himself with advisers who are anti-Israel are largely based on two men who, according to Obama's campaign, are simply not key advisers to Obama. Those who do comprise the heart of Obama's Middle East advisory team are described by most as centrists and pro-Israel. We rate the claim from the Tennessee Republican Party news release False.

pomt-07126	Says the state budget includes spending on commercials for Fortune 500 companies.	/texas/statements/2011/jun/17/david-simpson/state-rep-david-simpson-says-state-budget-includes/	State Rep. David Simpson says the state budget lawmakers sent to Gov. Rick Perry spends money in the wrong places — such as on Walmart commercials. "Despite conservative boasts of cost cutting, not raising taxes and not using the Economic Stabilization Fund, or ‘rainy day fund,’ the budget still preserves about $500 million of pork for special interests including film and music makers, video games and commercials for Fortune 500 companies," the Longview Republican said in a June 5 op-ed in the Longview News-Journal. It’s well-reported that the state promotes music, film and even video games. But this is the first we’ve heard about funding TV spots for the top 500 U.S. companies that Fortune magazine ranks by revenue every year. To back up the statement, Simpson aide Michael Bullock noted that the 2012-13 budget the House approved on May 28 appropriates $32 million for film and music marketing, a program overseen by the governor’s office. The budget provides $16 million each year to "market Texas as a film location and promote the Texas music industry," according to the May 26 House-Senate conference committee report. What does that have to do with Fortune 500 TV spots? Bullock pointed us to a March report by the Texas state comptroller analyzing the state’s economic development incentives for 2010. According to the report, lawmakers in 2007 revised the Film Industry Incentive Program, created in 2005, so its grants could be extended to companies working in "the entire moving image industry," sweeping in makers of commercials, TV programs and video games. In 2009, the Legislature appropriated $64 million in incentives for the biennium. According to the report, from April 2009 through August 2010, the Texas Film Commission approved 152 applications to help fund the production of commercials, awarding $2 million to grantees who, all told, said they’d spend $37.4 million in Texas. And did any of the commercials promote Fortune 500 companies? The report lists a handful. As of Aug. 31, the company Action Figure No. 1. Inc., had received more than $8,000 for an AT&T television commercial, which was one of three commercials made for AT&T, a Fortune 500 company, by three different companies using state grants totaling about $25,600, the report says. Also, the company Radical Media received $32,000 in grant money to make a commercial for Walmart, another Fortune 500 company, and the company Modern Times received $11,133 to make a commercial for the TV show "Friday Night Lights." That show aired on NBC, a network owned by the Fortune 500 company General Electric. We wondered if each Fortune 500 company benefits from grants going to separate production companies. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us the grants can go to either the production company, advertising agency or the client — such as a Fortune 500 company — involved in a supported TV ad. Lastly, we turned to the Texas Film Commission, which says on its website that certain commercials — such as ads for state agencies or those that portray Texas negatively — aren’t eligible for incentives. Otherwise, state law permits incentives for a TV commercial project of up to 5 percent of the amount spent on the project in the state, according to the commission. To qualify, the maker must spend at least $100,000 in Texas, at least 60 percent of its shooting days must be completed in the state and at least 70 percent of the paid crew, cast and extras must be Texas residents. Nashed told us TV commercial projects will continue to be eligible for incentives in 2012-13. We rate Simpson’s statement True.

pomt-02667	"What do Rutgers University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey City University, Stockton College, Rowan University and William Paterson all have in common? They all graduate less than 50 percent of their students within four years."	/new-jersey/statements/2014/jan/12/joseph-cryan/joe-cryan-claims-four-year-graduation-rate-7-unive/	New Jersey has a long history of spending heavily on education. The state for years has spent money on urban school districts and federally mandated programs to help youngsters in need. Now, says Assemblyman Joe Cryan, the time has come for public colleges and universities that accept state funding to be more accountable for its graduation rates. "What do Rutgers University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey City University, Stockton College, Rowan University and William Paterson all have in common?" Cryan (D-Union) asked during a Dec. 19 Assembly session in which he discussed a new state panel formed to study the affordability of higher education. "They all graduate less than 50 percent of their students within four years." That statistic seemed a bit startling to the Truth-O-Meter, but we found that Cryan is correct. Cryan’s statistic is based on data reported by the schools themselves, as required, to the state. That data then goes to the U.S. Department of Education, where it can be accessed on the website for the Institute of Education Sciences. The institute’s website shows data for students starting in fall 2004 and fall 2006. Cryan’s claim is based on 2004 data. Here’s a breakdown of the graduation rates for each of the schools Cryan mentioned, based on a first-year, full-time equivalent student graduating with a bachelor’s degree in four years. It’s worth noting, though, that the graduation rates increase if students take six years to complete their degree: SCHOOL FOUR-YEAR RATE, STARTING FALL 2004 SIX-YEAR RATE, STARTING FALL 2004 Rutgers University 48 percent 77 percent Kean University 17 percent 47 percent Montclair State University 31 percent 62 percent New Jersey City University 8 percent 37 percent Richard Stockton College 40 percent 64 percent Rowan University 44 percent 70 percent William Paterson University 17 percent 49 percent Sources: Asm. Joe Cryan’s office; U.S. Department of Education website, Institute of Education Sciences College Navigator, Retention and Graduation Rates Cryan noted that he didn’t include some schools, such as the New Jersey Institute of Technology, because its curriculum requires five years to earn a bachelor’s degree. We reached out to each of the schools cited by Cryan. Not all responded but some that did said that there’s more to graduation rates than numbers. "There’s a big difference between a kid going to Harvard and a kid going to New Jersey City University, a big difference between going to William Paterson and to Rutgers," said Joe Cardona, vice president of university relations for Rowan University in Glassboro. "Their preparedness profile, their economic profile -- all of those really tie in to your ability to excel and to be able to achieve whatever the degree program is." Comparing schools with different missions, populations and demographics is akin to comparing apples and oranges, Cardona added. Taking six years to complete a bachelor’s degree has become a more accepted timeframe, according to Cardona and Steve Manas, a spokesman at Rutgers New Brunswick. "The current national standard for graduation rates is six years, and Rutgers' rate is 75 percent, comparable to AAU (Association of American Universities) peers," Manas said in an e-mail. "The latest graduation rate for four years is 52 percent." Maryjane Briant, a spokeswoman for Stockton College, confirmed Cryan’s graduation rate number for the Atlantic County school for students starting in 2004, but noted that the number has climbed significantly since. The four-year graduation rate for Stockton students starting school in fall 2009 was 53 percent, she said. To reiterate, Cryan’s numbers are accurate for students starting their degrees 10 years ago, but schools that spoke with us generally pointed to higher graduation rates from more recent timeframes. Cryan said many families that save money to send their children to college plan or expect it to be a four -year program, not six. And he re-emphasized his concern that institutions accepting state money for higher education need to be more accountable for on-time graduation rates. He also disagreed that it’s unfair to compare students attending schools that may have different missions and demographics. "What demographic is allowed not to graduate on time?" he said. "What students do you favor over others as a result? Our ruling Cryan said, "What do Rutgers University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey City University, Stockton College, Rowan University and William Paterson all have in common? They all graduate less than 50 percent of their students within four years." Cryan cited statistics reported by the schools he names for first-time, full-time students starting a four-year program in 2004. The graduation rates trend upward, though, for more recent years, and the rates jump substantially for students who took six years to earn their bachelor’s degree. Still, Cryan’s claim is technically accurate and we therefore rate his claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04356	Says Mitt Romney was clear that he "would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/23/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-opposed-any-government-help-resc/	The recovery of the American auto industry offers proof of the old saw that success has a thousand fathers while failure is an orphan. Mitt Romney has said that President Barack Obama followed the plan Romney laid out in 2008. For his part, Obama has said Romney would have let General Motors and Chrysler fend for themselves as they went through bankruptcy. In their final debate before the election, Obama repeated his charge against Romney. "You keep on trying to, you know, airbrush history here," Obama said."You were very clear that you would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy. You said that they could get it in the private marketplace." In a spirited back and forth, Romney insisted the president was wrong. "I said that we would provide guarantees," Romney said. "That was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy. Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet." In this fact-check, we’ll examine Obama’s charge that Romney would not provide government assistance to the car companies, even if they went through bankruptcy. Early in 2008, Romney said in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club that, "I am not open to a bailout, but I am open to a workout. Washington should not be a benefactor, but it can and must be a partner." Later that year, Romney wrote a now well-known New York Times op-ed called "Let Detroit go bankrupt." Both men encouraged voters to look at that. We did, and here is what Romney wrote: "The federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk." Romney’s campaign said this referred to the government providing a guarantee to private lenders who stepped in to keep the carmakers running while they went through bankruptcy. Such a guarantee would have drawn in private lenders even at a moment when conventional credit markets were frozen. In bankruptcies, it is not uncommon to allow companies to continue to operate because this gives the creditors the best shot at getting more of their money back. By definition, a bankrupt business is short on money, and in order to make payroll and pay suppliers, there is something called debtor-in-possession or DIP financing. But Romney did not speak of DIP financing directly. We asked Laura Beth Bartell, a bankruptcy law professor at Wayne State Law School, if the term he did use, "post-bankruptcy financing," would mean the same thing. "I can’t read Romney’s mind as to what he meant when he used the phrase," Bartell said. "But most bankruptcy lawyers would interpret ‘post-bankruptcy financing’ to refer to DIP financing." However, Romney’s term "post-bankruptcy financing" has been used in a different sense as well. Sometimes it means the financing a company receives once the bankruptcy is completed. (For example, a 2007 article in CFO with the headline "Delta receives post-bankruptcy financing" described a multibillion dollar package for the troubled airline that took effect after the company was out of bankruptcy.) Steve Rattner, the former auto bailout chief in the Obama administration and a vocal critic of Romney, said Romney was using the term in this second sense - the longer-term loans that sustain a business after it exits bankruptcy. "He was referring to the practice on Wall Street of providing ‘exit financing’ to companies coming out of bankruptcy," Rattner said. "But because there was not DIP financing available, the companies would have never come out." Bartell disagreed. She said the term can have both meanings but noted that Romney was writing about a managed bankruptcy. "I cannot imagine why he would be discussing the ability of the car companies to get financing after they emerged from bankruptcy when all the talk at the time was about their ability to get financing to allow them to operate during a bankruptcy." Total certainty of Romney’s intent may be elusive. John Pottow, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said the term was used loosely in the op-ed. "I'm not sure what it meant because the logical thing is for it to mean DIP financing," Pottow said. "But the contextual thing means exit financing, because he's implying we shouldn't do anything during bankruptcy, only after bankruptcy." We asked the Romney campaign for any comments the governor made in 2008 that would clarify his meaning. The staff said they did not know of any. Romney’s op-ed deals almost entirely with how GM and Chrysler ought to function after restructuring. He said almost nothing about the process of bringing the companies to that point -- some nine words out of more than 800. This adds to the uncertainty surrounding his intent. Our ruling Obama said Romney would not provide government assistance to the car companies, even if they went through bankruptcy. Romney’s term "post-bankruptcy financing" can have two meanings. It can refer to money used during bankruptcy and money used right afterwards. The distinction has great practical significance in this case, because without the loans in the middle of a bankruptcy, there might be no automakers to lend to on the other side. We can't know for sure which meaning Romney had in mind. However, Obama made a strong assertion. He said Romney would offer no government aid even if the carmakers went through bankruptcy. Romney’s words were vague and quite limited in number but he did speak of a government guarantee, and that would be the case whether he meant for loans during or after bankruptcy. We rate Obama's statement Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-23T15:13:32	2012-10-22	['United_States']
pomt-12837	"It would take $135 billion to eradicate global poverty."	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/07/blog-posting/135-billion-enough-end-global-poverty-no/	Twitter followers of the cheekily named What the F*** Facts got some bold guidance recently. "The world spent $1,735 billion on war in 2012," the outfit tweeted on Jan. 24, 2017. "It would take $135 billion to eradicate global poverty." This claim has been popping up on the web since at least February 2013, but the 5.5 million followers of WTF Facts has to count as one of the widest audiences yet. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to vet the numbers. The takeaway is while $135 billion wouldn’t hurt, the statement glosses over a host of problems that undercut the core promise to end poverty. It isn’t central to this fact-check, but the military spending figure largely checks out using data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Now to assess the money needed to lift people out of poverty. We started with the number of people living on less than $1.90 a day, which is the current global poverty line. Estimates vary, but economists at the World Bank put the 2012 figure at 880 million people. Then we calculated how much more the average poor person in that group would need to make to get above $1.90 a day, with the help of World Bank economist Christoph Lakner. The approximate answer for 2012 is it would have taken about $187 billion to lift each person out of poverty that year, or $50 billion more than the $135 billion in the tweet. That’s a lot, but on the other hand, the economists we reached said none of the figures are rock solid. "The numbers are approximate for several reasons," said Indermit Singh Gill, professor of public policy at Duke University. "One is the correction for purchasing power. These are based on surveys every five years or so, done by different agencies in various parts of the world. The second are corrections within countries for cost of living — especially between rural and urban areas." Whatever the right amount it would take to eradicate poverty, economist Charles Kenny at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C., said the concept of giving the world’s poorest people more cash has a lot of merit. "All the evidence is that if you give them money they spend it wisely on things that can increase their long-term earnings — better nutrition, health care, education, investments in equipment and so on," he said. But Kenny also said the practical challenge of getting the money to the right people is enormous. "We have estimates of global poverty, but we don’t know which households are actually poor on this standard, and who they are changes a lot over the course of a year," Kenny said. Skeptics of simple cash tranfers abound. International development researchers David Steven and Ben Oppenheim at the New York University Center on International Cooperation emphasized that much more than a lack of income makes people poor. "$135 billion is roughly the same as current overseas development aid, and it hasn't ended poverty yet," Steven said. Oppenheim said the quality of government makes a big difference and donor nations can’t "buy development." "If we could do that, Afghanistan would look more like Switzerland by this point," Oppenheim said. "The central lesson from decades of semi-successful efforts at poverty reduction is that effective institutions are absolutely critical. And the ingredients for that are time and political will, not just capital." The tweet didn’t say that the money had to come from the wealthiest nations. Laurence Chandy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote recently that in many nations, local billionaires could make a big dent in their home country’s poverty. They note that the task is easier today than in 2012 because the world has far fewer poor people. Chandy and his colleagues Christine Zhang and Lorenz Noe asked what would happen if the uber-rich gave away half their wealth over a span of 15 years. The results varied from place to place. In Colombia, Georgia and Swaziland, they wrote, a single billionaire’s gift could end extreme poverty immediately. In other countries, it would take the generosity of all of their billionaires. "This would end poverty in China, India, and Indonesia — countries that rank first, second, and fifth globally in terms of the absolute size of their poor populations," they said. An article from the Center for Global Development calculated that about three-quarters of global poverty could be eliminated if developing countries gave cash to the poorest by raising taxes on their wealthiest citizens, eliminating subsidies for fuel and reducing their military spending. Our ruling What the F*** Facts said that in 2012, $135 billion would eradicate global poverty. In 2012, there were about 880 million people living on less than $1.90 each day. Using World Bank numbers, the one-year price tag back then would have been closer to $187 billion. While the data are far from perfect, the tweet’s figure falls short by about 25 percent, which is a significant gap. But the bigger problem is the idea that a cash transfer alone would eradicate poverty. The experts we reached emphasized that good governments and other institutions were essential to eliminating poverty in the long-run. While money would help, it couldn’t deliver the desired results on its own. The statement has some superficial accuracy, but it suggests a simple fix to a much more complicated problem. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/78722821-2985-4d39-9fb5-b31d18702078	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-02-07T14:09:49	2017-01-24	['None']
pomt-08449	"Sharron Angle voted to protect sex offenders."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/15/harry-reid/harry-reid-blasts-sharron-angle-vote-against-bill-/	Last week we checked an ad in which Republican Sharron Angle attacked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., for voting "to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders." We rated Angle's charge Barely True. Now Reid is parrying the sex-offender charge through an ad of his own that essentially accuses Angle of protecting sex offenders with a vote she once cast against a Nevada Assembly bill. The ad opens with a statement by Roberta Vande Voort, a family therapist in Las Vegas. "I work with kids who have been abused, and their stories break my heart," Vande Voort says. "But when the Assembly created a program to weed out sex offenders by helping youth and church groups do background checks on volunteers, it passed with only two members voting no. Sharron Angle was one of them. She said background checks were an invasion of privacy. Sharron Angle voted to protect the privacy of sex offenders instead of the safety of our kids." Narrator: "Sharron Angle: Ideas so extreme, they're dangerous." Naturally, we thought it imperative to check Reid's sex-offender-coddling allegations as thoroughly we did Angle's. The ad refers to Assembly Bill 239 from 1999. As introduced, that bill would have set up a $200,000 account designed to cover the costs state agencies incur while doing criminal background checks of volunteers who work with children. The first stop for the bill was the Judiciary Committee, of which Angle was a member. In introducing the bill to the committee, the bill's sponsor, Republican Assemblyman Dennis Nolan, explained to fellow legislators that during the previous two sessions, he had sought to pass legislation that would allow nonprofit organizations to better screen potential volunteers who would be working directly with children. He said that past efforts had failed because opponents said that "the $40 cost associated with performing a background check would have a chilling effect on volunteerism." So AB 239 focused on providing money for background checks, with the idea of removing the cost problem from the equation. According to minutes of the committee's March 1, 1999, meeting, Angle expressed some concerns about the bill -- including the one on privacy grounds cited in Reid's ad. "Ms. Angle expressed concern with the possible invasion of privacy and liability issues included in the bill," the minutes say. "She stated voluntary programs always stepped up to become mandatory, and she did not want to see the state get involved with things of a First Amendment nature." Angle asked Nolan to discuss the risk of a "chilling effect" from the bill. Nolan responded that there would be a chilling effect if an expense was mandated upon the nonprofit organization -- but he added that AB 239 "was not a mandate of background checks but an attempt to assist with the costs if an organization wanted to utilize the option." Nolan added that keeping information confidential was crucial, and as to her point about liability, he said that liability existed whether or not background checks were performed. On the First Amendment issue, Nolan said that "the legislature continually dealt with First Amendment issues and that he believed there was a balance. ... The rights we are weighing here are the rights of innocent children who participate in organizations under the supervision of adults and the need to make sure those children are protected." Ultimately, the committee approved an amended version of the bill that changed the $200,000 from a guaranteed appropriation into a funding source consisting of "donations, gifts, grants, and any appropriations the legislature saw fit to make." At the end of the meeting, the committee unanimously sent the bill to the floor. This is important because, despite the concerns Angle stated in committee, she did not object to the measure going to the floor. By April 15, the bill came to a vote before the full Assembly. Despite her assent in committee, Angle did vote against it when it came to the floor, and the measure passed, 40-2. (We did not receive a response from Angle's staff explaining why she voted against the bill.) Having cleared the Assembly, the bill then went to the Senate, where it was amended further. On May 20, the newly amended version passed the Senate by a 20-1 vote. (Interestingly, the one Senate dissenter was future U.S. Rep. Dina Titus -- a Democrat and an ally of none other than Harry Reid. When we contacted Titus' staff for an explanation, a spokesman said that Titus voted against the bill because the amendments in the Senate had "watered down" the measure so much by protecting nonprofit groups from liability that it "removed any incentive for organizations to use it." Now that the Senate had approved the amended version, AB 239 had to go back to the Assembly so that an identical version of the bill could be sent to the governor. On May 24, the Assembly approved the new version of the bill, though not through a roll call vote. If Angle had found two fellow Assembly members to back her, she could have requested a roll call vote, but she did not, according to the minutes. Ultimately, on May 31, 1999, the bill was signed into law. Angle's camp did not get back to us, but in comments published Aug. 30, 2010, in a Las Vegas Review-Journal blog, a spokesman addressed AB 239 as well as two other bills that Reid was touting as evidence of Angle's indifference to law enforcement. "Sharron agrees with the spirit of those bills and the need for law enforcement to have the proper tools," the spokesman said. "However she had concerns with the execution. At the time, Sharron raised questions in committee regarding the unintended consequences in regards to personal privacy and costs." So where does this leave us? The ad is correct on the substance of the bill, and it's correct that on the most important vote she took on the bill -- the roll call vote on the Assembly floor -- Angle was indeed one of two legislators who voted against it. The ad is also correct that Angle cited privacy as a concern during the debate. But the ad glosses over a few bits of context. When the identical bill came up in committee, Angle did not vote against it, nor did she demand a roll call vote on the amended version when it came back to the Assembly from the Senate. In addition, she cited other concerns beyond privacy that may have played into her decision to vote against the bill, including legal liability (which was addressed in the bill's final version), the possibility that such programs could one day become mandatory and First Amendment concerns. These failures, in our view, do not greatly undercut the ad's argument, however. The notion that Angle "voted to protect the privacy of sex offenders instead of the safety of our kids" is an oversimplification. But Angle did vote against it at least once for reasons including concerns about invasion of privacy, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2010-10-15T17:30:44	2010-10-07	['None']
pomt-11933	The NFL is "getting massive tax breaks."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/12/donald-trump/nfl-getting-massive-tax-breaks-donald-trump-said/	President Donald Trump continued his challenge of the National Football League in a tweet, this time to push tax reform. "Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!" Trump tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What tax breaks is the NFL receiving, and what tax law is Trump referring to? There are ways that Trump’s tweet is both right and wrong. But the bottom line is that the NFL continues to benefit from major tax breaks, especially in the construction of its stadiums. The White House first directed us to a press release by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who is re-introducing legislation to end professional sports leagues’ tax exempt status. "The NFL League Office has received a special tax carve-out since 1966, when the tax code first listed ‘professional football leagues’ as trade organizations," the statement read. "Though individual teams are not tax-exempt, the NFL League Office is." It’s true that in order to allow the NFL and AFL to merge in 1966, legislative maneuverings grouped professional football leagues with trade associations under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, thus exempting them from paying taxes as not-for-profit organizations. However, amid public criticism, the NFL decided to drop the not-for-profit status in 2015 and file regular taxes. "The owners have decided to eliminate the distraction associated with misunderstanding of the league office’s status, so the league office will in the future file returns as a taxable entity," Robert McNair, the chairman of the league’s finance committee, said in an April 2015 statement. The tax exemption was only applicable to the league’s administrative office anyway, rather than the 32 individual teams, or even the subsidiaries that control the NFL’s licensing, sponsorships, marketing, publicity, promotion, broadcast, merchandise and distribution. So tax law could be changed to repeal an exemption that is no longer being used by the NFL. It is, however, still in use by other sports leagues, like the NHL, PGA Tour and LPGA. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn’t provide any details on the tax reform Trump was calling for in a press conference, though she did acknowledge the change in the NFL’s tax status, and pointed to another tax issue affecting the NFL. "While the NFL may have given up its tax-exempt status a few years ago, it's been well-documented that billions of taxpayer dollars continue to subsidize the construction and renovation of professional sports stadiums," Sanders said. "If this industry is going to use money from American taxpayers to build the very fields they play on, is it really too much to ask that they show respect for the American flag at the beginning of the game?" The experts we spoke with disagreed on whether to call it a subsidy, as the federal government isn’t pumping money to team owners to build stadiums. Rather, it’s not taxing the bonds issued by local governments to help build stadiums. While it might not be a subsidy, the experts agreed that it still qualified as a tax break. Cities want to have stadiums in their backyard (though the economic results aren’t too convincing), so they issue bonds to help pay for them. And thanks to the 1986 tax code reform, if a municipality finances over 90 percent of a stadium, those bonds enjoy the same tax exemption as would a public project like a road or bridge. Brookings Institution took a closer look at these numbers in a 2016 study and estimated that over a 15-year period since 2000, the federal government lost a potential tax revenue of $1.11 billion on bonds issued by local governments to finance NFL stadiums. Major League Baseball stadiums benefitted more, though, resulting in a loss of $1.41 billion. Combining football, baseball, basketball and hockey stadiums, the federal government lost $3.2 billion over the 15-year period. "That’s a drop in the bucket for how much our federal budget over 15 years is," said Ted Gayer, vice president and director of the Economic Studies program at Brookings who led the study. "But we think it’s an egregious misuse of federal dollars." The researchers found that sports stadium financing is costing the federal government only 25 percent, on average, of what it’s costing the local governments who are issuing the bonds, but Trump was referring to the federal tax break. Assessing Obama’s 2016 budget, which tried to repeal tax-exempt bond financing of professional sports facilities, the Office of Management and Budget estimated it would save $542 million on all sports stadiums (not just the NFL) between 2016 and 2025; but Congress didn’t approve the change. Two bipartisan bills addressing the issue have also been introduced in the House and Senate. Our ruling Trump said the NFL is "getting massive tax breaks." Since 2015, the NFL hasn’t benefitted from a not-for-profit tax break enjoyed by many professional sports league offices. However, it does enjoy tax exemptions on municipal bonds used to build stadiums. Other sports leagues also benefit from this tax code loophole, sometimes to a greater extent. We rate this statement Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-10-12T18:10:30	2017-10-10	['None']
pomt-07509	Proposed fees for Rhode Island beaches will still be "less than some of the town beaches."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/apr/10/richard-licht/licht-says-proposed-fees-ri-state-beaches-are-stil/	After an unusually cruel winter and chilly spring, we couldn’t stop dreaming of hot summer days at the seashore. Then Governor Chafee proposed nearly doubling fees at state beaches. It hit us like a bucket of ice water. Under the plan, the price for a season pass would increase to $60 for Rhode Islanders from $30. Daily rates for state residents would jump to $10 from $6 during the week and to $14 from $7 on weekends and holidays. Fees for out-of-staters would also increase. While discussing the proposed fees on WJAR-TV’s "10 News Conference" on April 3, Richard Licht, director of the Department of Administration, asserted they weren’t out of line. "For $30 more, you are getting a season pass to one of the greatest sets of beaches in the country. …You still, at $60, are less than some of the town beaches charge … I don’t think that’s an inordinate burden on the people of Rhode Island," Licht said. Could the fees at state beaches still be lower than town beaches — even if doubled? When we inquired where Licht got his information, the governor’s spokesman, Michael Trainor, told us we’d hear back by the next day. While we waited, we made some phone calls and found 14 coastal communities that charge admission to their beaches. Most of the beach fees have been set for the season. Like a beach ball on a breezy day, the fees are all over the place. And there are many different categories, covering residents, non-residents and seniors. (The Chafee administration ultimately referred us to the state Department of Environmental Management, which cited many of the same figures we found in our survey.) We decided to focus on the fee that the majority of state residents -- who don’t live in beach communities -- would pay for a season pass or a single day at the shore. If they visit a state beach, they’d all pay the new fees. If they visit a town beach, they’d pay that community’s non-resident fee. The most expensive non-resident season pass costs $175 for Little Compton’s South Shore Beach. Middletown’s Sachuest Beach, also known as Second Beach, charges $140. Next comes Charlestown, at $90. Passes go for $80 at Newport’s Easton’s Beach and South Kingstown Town Beach and $70 at Wuskenau Town Beach in Westerly. So how does the state’s proposed $60 season pass compare? Of the eight towns that offer passes to non-residents, the state fee would be less than all but Portsmouth, which collects $50 for a pass to Sandy Point Beach, on the Sakonnet River. So far, so good for Licht. But what about daily fees? (Remember, we’re comparing state fees to local non-resident fees, setting aside favorable pricing for residents.) Let’s begin with weekdays. The Chafee administration wants to increase the $6 daily state fee to $10. Three towns -- Warren, Bristol and Tiverton -- charge just $5 per day. Westerly charges $6 and Portsmouth charges $7. Prices are higher at the ocean beaches: $10 in Charlestown, Narragansett, Middletown and Newport; $12 in Little Compton; and $15 a day in South Kingstown and Jamestown. (Narragansett also charges a separate fee to walk onto the beach.) Two towns -- Barrington and North Kingstown -- don’t allow non-residents to park at their beaches. So the $10 state fee would be less than 5 of the 12 towns that welcome out-of-towners. On weekends and holidays, the state’s new fee would be $14 -- less than fees in 8 of the 12 beach towns. So when Licht says the new state fees are less than "some" of the town beaches, we can’t disagree. In fact, the state fees are lower in many instances. We won’t kick any sand at Licht on this one. We rate his claim True.	None	Richard Licht	None	None	None	2011-04-10T00:00:01	2011-04-03	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-02863	"The $3.6 billion deficit we inherited has turned into more than a half-billion-dollar surplus."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/15/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-turned-36-billion-deficit/	Barely weeks old, the 2014 governor’s race already is producing a downpour of conflicting claims about Gov. Scott Walker’s budgeting record. He turned a big deficit into a surplus! No, he turned a surplus into a big deficit! Walker makes the first claim early and often in his new book, "Unintimidated," at one point writing that "the $3.6 billion deficit we inherited has turned into more than a half-billion-dollar surplus." Meanwhile, Democrat Mary Burke, Walker’s lone challenger so far, tells reporters: "You've seen where we're now going from a $700 million surplus to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit." Is one or both correct? Are they both all wet? Today, we’ll just look at the claim by Walker. We’ll examine Burke’s another day, but here’s a partial spoiler alert: Burke and Walker are talking about budgets from different years. The governor’s $3.6 billion number is one of his favorites. We fact checked it in February 2011, when Walker pointed to the big budget hole as he prepared to unveil a budget covering mid-2011 to mid-2013. We rated False a claim by Democratic state Rep. Mark Pocan, who is now a member of Congress, that Walker’s $3.6 billion estimate was "a bogus figure." Outside experts agreed that Walker’s number was reasonable. What about the second figure cited by Walker -- the "more than a half-billion-dollar surplus"? A footnote in "Unintimidated" indicates Walker relied on a media account of a January 2013 report by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which predicted that Walker’s first budget would end with a $484 million surplus. The surplus number actually grew after Walker submitted his book (it’s due out Nov. 19, but we obtained an advance copy). An October 2013 memo from the same source documented an official surplus of $759 million in the state’s main account at the end of Walker’s first two-year budget (June 30, 2013). This memo was not available when Walker submitted the book, a spokeswoman for the publisher, Penguin Group, told us. So, Walker’s numbers are on target or close, based on what he knew when he wrote that passage. But there’s a problem lining them up next to each other and suggesting a positive swing of more than $4.1 billion. Fruit salad The two figures measure different things. It’s a classic case of apples and oranges. The $3.6 billion "deficit" is actually not a deficit at all in a concrete accounting sense. It’s a pre-budget estimate designed to illustrate the size of the shortfall or challenge the governor faces when putting together a budget. "Actually, it's more like apples, oranges and coffee beans," Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry said. "The term 'deficit' has been used to describe multiple fiscal conditions, past, present, and future, that are actually quite different from one another. Both sides of the aisle know this and will interchangeably use these various definitions to spin things any way they want." The pre-budget "shortfall" is a soft number, Berry noted, in that it includes state agency spending wish lists, many of which are destined for the circular file. In any event, here’s bottom line #1: That $3.6 billion shortfall that preceded Walker’s first budget is best compared to the projected shortfall Walker faced in his second budget. That number was actually a positive one -- $177 million, according to Walker administration reports. That underscores Walker’s success at reducing budgeting tricks in the first budget. So, the swing isn’t more than $4.1 billion, it’s more like $3.77 billion. The apples-to-apples view still favors Walker, just not quite as much as he portrayed. Our rating Walker says in his book that "the $3.6 billion deficit we inherited has turned into more than a half-billion-dollar surplus." There’s some truth here, in that Walker cites accurate or close-to-accurate numbers that show a turnaround from red to black in two years. But his claim has a context problem because it mixes two different ways to define the size of the turnaround. When viewed properly, the turnaround falls a little short of what he says. We rate his claim Half True. To comment on this item, please go to JSOnline.com.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-11-15T05:00:00	2013-11-13	['None']
pomt-05113	Says the Constitution "specifically states the Congress shall write legislation for immigration policy," so Barack Obama lacks the authority to defer the deportation of young illegal immigrants.	/texas/statements/2012/jun/27/john-carter/john-carter-says-xxx/	John Carter, among Republican critics of an Obama administration move potentially enabling hundreds of thousands of young illegal residents to avoid deportation, sees a constitutional hitch. On June 18, 2012, the Round Rock congressman told Austin’s KLBJ, 590 AM: "The Constitution of the United States... specifically states the Congress shall write legislation for immigration policy in the United States." Carter added that the Democratic president did not have the authority to act as he did. Is that right? In telephone interviews, lawyers versed in the Constitution and U.S. immigration laws told us that while there is no explicit language in the Constitution saying immigration policy shall be set by Congress, Article I, Section 8 has long been interpreted as giving Congress that role. The fourth clause of the section says Congress shall have the power to establish a uniform "Rule of Naturalization," as in determining who can legally be in the country. By email, Carter spokesman John Stone agreed the same section was the basis of Carter’s claim. That authority settled in gradually, according to a 2009 primer on U.S. immigration laws published by the Federal Judicial Center, which promotes research and education related to the federal courts. States often imposed their own restrictions, the primer says, until Congress began regulating aspects of immigration in 1875. "Over the next forty years, Congress created broad categories of excludable aliens, a narrower class of deportable aliens, and the beginnings of an immigration bureaucracy," the primer says. In 1921, Congress added numerical restrictions, and in 1952, Congress codified immigration laws; this was followed by a comprehensive overhaul in 1980 and actions in 1986 enabling millions of illegal immigrants already in the country to attain legal status while establishing sanctions on employers of illegal immigrants, according to the primer. So, Congress has the power to write immigration laws, as Carter says. Is it also correct, as Carter told KLBJ-AM, that the Obama administration overstepped its constitutional authority? Stone, Carter’s spokesman, said by email: "I assume you would agree that the president has absolutely no authority to change any law. If you contend a president has authority to interpret and enforce law as they see fit, Congress and the voters be damned,... you have just endorsed a dictatorship to replace our republic, and destroyed the American rule of law." According to a half-dozen legal experts we consulted, the administration’s move can be legally justified. At issue is a June 15, 2012, memo from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano directing immigration officials not to try to deport young immigrants illegally in the country who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. "As a general matter, these individuals lacked the intent to violate the law," Napolitano’s memo says, adding that her directive, based on the government’s authority to apply "prosecutorial discretion," is needed to "ensure that our enforcement resources are not expended on these low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on people who meet our enforcement priorities." As a result of that action, hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30 already in the country illegally could be permitted to apply to stay for two-year, renewable intervals, also qualifying to apply for work permits. Napolitano’s memo refers to this status as "deferred action." Napolitano closed with language that strikes us as insistent there is no new law being written by the executive branch: "This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights. It remains for the executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of discretion within the framework of the existing law. I have done so here." Similarly, Napolitano said in a June 15, 2012, interview with CNN that none of the beneficiaries would be put on paths to citizenship. "Not at all," Napolitano said. "In fact, that's where Congress needs to act. We continue to urge the Congress, you know, pass the DREAM Act," which would create a path to citizenship for certain young illegal immigrants. The lawyers we interviewed by phone told us that while Congress makes immigration laws, the executive branch has the authority to enforce the laws by applying prosecutorial discretion -- in this instance, directing officials to grant young low-priority illegal residents "deferred action" standing. Ben Winograd, a staff attorney with the American Immigration Council, which favors an expansion of legal immigration, said: "The president certainly had the authority to act as he did. He didn’t create any new laws." Jamin Raskin, an American University law professor, said: "The president has not sought to change the citizenship status or legal residency status of the young people he’s talking about. All that he’s done is to prioritize the enforcement agenda of the executive branch." Disclosure: Winograd told us he personally supports Obama but speaks to the law mindful that he advises the non-partisan council. Raskin described himself as an Obama supporter poised to serve on the rules committee at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Neither man said his personal politics controlled his judgment on this issue. Michael Olivas, a University of Houston law professor, said the Obama administration is offering to defer removal actions against qualified immigrants just as previous administrations have done so. He forwarded a link to his paper being published by the William & Mary Bill of Rights Journal quoting research by Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a Penn State University professor expert in immigration law, indicating that according to records obtained through open-record requests, President George W. Bush’s administration employed "deferred action" an average 771 times in the years 2005-2008, while the pace dropped to 661 per year on average during the first years of the Obama administration. Philip Bobbitt, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas School of Law, pointed us to a June 22, 2012, blog post by Washingon appellate lawyer John P. Elwood in which Elwood says that presidents generally have the power to categorically enforce laws. Yet, Elwood is uncertain that specific provisions of immigration law allow Napolitano to exercise her discretion as announced in her memo. His post closes with his hope that the Office of Legal Counsel, the U.S. Justice Department’s arm devoted to providing "authoritative" legal advice to the president and executive branch, issues an opinion on the legal basis for the administration’s action. In a telephone interview, Elwood, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, told us that deferred action has been offered in the past to categories of individuals who share similar plights such as Chinese immigrants who were in the U.S. in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or immigrants fleeing civil war in Liberia. "I don’t think you can say as a general matter, the president doesn’t have such authority," Elwood said. "The bigger question is whether this exercise" by Napolitano "differs from the past categorical exceptions, if it is a bridge too far." Disclosure: Elwood told us he has donated to Romney’s campaign, though his personal political interests do not influence his opinion on this topic. Our ruling Congress has the power to make immigration laws, as Carter says. Less clearcut is Carter’s interpretation that Obama has overstepped his authority. Most legal experts we consulted thought Obama was on solid ground. We rate Carter’s statement Half True.

Tammy Baldwin compared the payers of the tax to the most selective group in the nation — the United States Senate. Baldwin tweeted this from her account (@SenatorBaldwin) on May 5, 2015: "There are more members of the US Senate than the number of WI families who would benefit from GOP estate tax break." That same night, Baldwin took the Senate floor to talk about the Republican budget, which had just been approved. She voted against the budget, and voiced her disdain for the elimination of the estate tax. "The Republican budget continues the same, failed, top down economics where Washington rigs the rules in favor of special interests, in favor of millionaires and billionaires," she said. Republicans support the elimination of the estate tax saying the tax discourages saving and investment that could help others in the economy. Democrats see the tax as a way to level the playing field between rich and poor and maintain tax revenue. Some form of an estate tax has been on the books since 1916. The tax is imposed on the transfer of a deceased person’s estate. Only estates valued at or above the exemption amount — $5.43 million for 2015 — are required to pay. Republicans repealed the estate tax for 2010, but Congress reinstated the estate tax starting in 2011. The new Republican budget would abolish the estate tax entirely. In January, we rated Baldwin’s statement that middle-class Americans "pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires" as Half True. Turns out, some do and some don’t, depending upon the source of a person’s income. We wondered if Baldwin was right this time. Would fewer than 100 state families really gain from the tax break? Digging into the numbers The Tax Policy Center estimates that the estate tax kicks in for two out of every 1,000 deaths. In 2013, the latest year for which data is available, 49,917 people died in Wisconsin. By that math, some 100 Wisconsin families would have paid the estate estate tax that year. But, just 63 estates paid the tax in that year. Looking back, the last year for which more than 100 estates paid the tax in Wisconsin was 2009, when the exemption amount was much lower — $3.5 million. That year, 290 estates paid. Each year since then, the exemption amount increased and the numbers of families paying the tax in Wisconsin decreased. When we asked Baldwin’s office for backup, staffers directed us to a report by the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. That report made state-by-state estimations for the number of estate tax payers in 2016. Sure enough, the center estimated that in 2016 just 70 families in Wisconsin would face the estate tax, well below the 100 family mark Baldwin established in the tweet. The report made projections for 2016 because it would be the first full year that the estate tax would be repealed, if the measure is also passed by House Republicans and signed by President Barack Obama. The report created the estimate based on numbers from the IRS and Congress’ own Joint Committee on Taxation. For 2016, the Joint Committee on Taxation projects that 5,400 estates nationally will pay the tax. To create a state-by-state estimate, the report used IRS tax data from 2013. The center assumed the proportion of families from Wisconsin paying the estate tax in 2016 would be the same as in 2013. According to 2013 IRS data, 63 Wisconsin estates paid the tax out of 4,687 total. Applying the same ratio to the 2016 estimate, about 72 families would pay the estate tax from Wisconsin. The report rounded each estimate to the nearest 10 because so few estates pay the tax each year. That put the state estimate at 70. The math adds up, but what about the report’s methodology? Matthew Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, called the estimation "pretty rock solid" and said the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities used a sensible starting point. "To be able to do anything differently, you would have to know exactly how many people were going to die in 2016," Gardner said. Bob Williams, a fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said the "back of the envelope" calculation made sense. Williams did cite a concern about the use of a single year the projection for 2016. What if 2013, he asked, was an outlier? After all, the number varies from year to year. To account for that point, we calculated a new ratio for Wisconsin estate tax payers using the average for a period covering four years, 2010 to 2013. The new figure was lower than the one just for 2013. By that measure, 50 state families would pay the estate tax in 2016. But Baldwin was a bit imprecise in how she made the claim. She did not provide a time frame for the figure and, if imposed, the elimination of the tax would be ongoing. That is, each year more estates would benefit from it. In just the six years of Baldwin’s term, some 400 families would benefit. Our rating Baldwin claimed that "There are more members of the US Senate than the number of WI families who would benefit from GOP estate tax break." The experts we consulted said the estimate cited by Baldwin was a reasonable one. But Baldwin’s claim did not provide a time frame for when the families would be affected, and many more than the 70 she cited would benefit over time. We rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08259	Says that the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993.	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/11/george-voinovich/sen-george-voinovich-suggests-25-cent-increase-rev/	Gasoline prices are climbing, nudging $3 a gallon in Ohio. If a politician was bent on self-preservation, this would not be the best time to propose a tax that would raise the price a little more. But before you suggest firing U.S. Sen. George Voinovich, remember that he’s retiring at the end of the year. Before then, the Ohio Republican wants to start raising the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents -- one cent a month, for 25 months. This would create more than 750,000 jobs by funding road and bridge construction projects, he says, and a portion of the tax could be used to reduce the federal deficit. The general proposal is not new; Voinovich has been pushing it for months. But Voinovich and a Democrat, Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, trotted it out again on Nov. 5 with a letter to the co-chairmen of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission, appointed by President Barack Obama, is working toward a Dec. 1 deadline on a proposal to reduce the deficit and address looming fiscal issues. It is not PolitiFact’s mission to say whether Voinovich’s proposal is sound, though there are opponents to his idea. Nor will we take bets on the likelihood of it passing in the very short time Voinovich has left in office. But in a news release announcing the letter, Voinovich on Nov. 8 stressed that the federal fuel tax has not been raised since 1993. Seventeen years without an increase seems like a long time. Has it really been that long? According to the Congressional Research Service, it has. The reasons include not only the long-term nature of highway funding bills and the projects they pay for, requiring years of planning, but also a political distaste among many lawmakers for higher gasoline taxes. Some key dates in the heated history of fuel taxes provide a sense of the challenge. These come from the Congressional Research Service, which provides in-depth analysis for both houses of Congress: 1932: The federal government levied its first fuel tax, at 1 cent per gallon. 1941: The federal tax became permanent under the Revenue Act of 1941. 1973 to 1980: Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter considered gas taxes for a variety of reasons, from fighting inflation to spurring alternative energy development to reducing oil imports. None of these increases passed Congress. 1982: President Ronald Reagan proposed a gas tax to improve the nation’s highways, and Congress agreed. This raised the tax from 4 cents a gallon to 9 cents a gallon. Reagan was a hero to many conservatives, and Voinovich has cited Reagan’s gas-tax initiative while arguing for his own. 1990: With President George H. W. Bush’s signature, Congress raised the gasoline tax to 14.1 cents a gallon, saying it would reduce the federal deficit. 1993: President Bill Clinton failed to get support for a broader energy tax, but Congress passed an alternative, raising the gasoline tax to 18.4 cents a gallon. The purpose was deficit reduction. That’s where the tax stands today: 18.4 cents a gallon. It is charged to refiners but passed along to consumers at the pump. The good news for drivers is that the tax stays flat regardless of how much they pay for gasoline. If the per-gallon price at the pump is $2.00, it includes 18.4 cents worth of federal gasoline taxes. If the price jumps to $3 a gallon, the federal gas tax share is still only 18.4 cents. But Congressional Budget Office projections show that the 18.4 cents a gallon isn’t enough to keep pace with planned highway and transit projects, let alone with the possible rate of inflation. That’s even before considering proposals like Voinovich’s to ramp up road and bridge repairs. "The Interstate Highway System is more than 50 years old and many roadways and bridges are reaching the end of their useful life," he and Carper wrote in their letter to the fiscal reform commission. Starting in 2014, the Highway Trust Fund will go into the red, according to CBO projections, which note that its figures are strictly for illustrative purposes -- because under law, the fund is not allowed to incur negative balances. Unless the gas tax is raised or highway projects cut, the fund will have to draw money from the general treasury, with negative budgetary consequences, CBO figures show. Voinovich notes that that has happened before -- in 2008, 2009 and this year. Altogether, Congress had to transfer $34.5 billion from the general treasury so it could maintain a positive balance in the Highway Trust Fund. The fund fell short those years because of the recession and the high cost of gasoline -- Americans cut out some of their driving -- and from better fuel efficiency, which reduced gasoline consumption. While arguably good for the environment, this created a shortfall for the fund that pays for highway repairs. The trust fund needs $34 billion over the next six years, Voinovich says, and if it doesn’t get it from gasoline taxes, Americans will face the choice of higher deficits or fewer road repairs -- which in turn "will create additional unemployment and continued deterioration of infrastructure." The Congressional Research Service agreed with the need in general, saying in an April 2010 report: "The Highway Trust Fund is in need of an increase in funding." But the report ended with a dose of political reality: "However, a gasoline tax increase is also likely to be unpopular with consumers. It might also drain purchasing power, especially from an economy that is weakened by recession." Voinovich has a difficult case to make. He’s been pushing it for months. But he’ll apparently have some sympathy from the debt commission; in a draft report released Wednesday, Nov. 10, the commission proposed a higher gasoline tax -- raising it gradually by 15 cents beginning in 2013 -- as a way to pay for transportation improvements without raiding the general government treasury. That’s less than Voinovich proposed, and it’s unknown if the provision will be included in the commission’s final report. Also unknown is whether a super-majority of the commission will agree with the full extent of commission proposals -- which include an array of discretionary spending cuts and an eventual raise in the Social Security retirement age -- and whether Congress then will approve the recommendations or shelve them, putting off decisions for another day or year. But when it comes to the history of gas-tax hikes, the facts are on Voinovich’s side, so we rate his statement True. Comment on this item.

pomt-13112	The media "never show crowds."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/03/donald-trump/trump-says-media-doesnt-show-his-crowds-rallies-he/	Time after time, Donald Trump has complained that the media doesn’t show show the magnitude of his crowds at rallies. "I have to put up with some of the most dishonest people in the world — the media," Trump told a crowd in Pensacola, Fla. "They never shows crowds like that — look at that, it goes all the way back. They never show crowds. They don't show crowds." We wondered if the media really never showed Trump crowds, so we turned to the archives and a former CBS photojournalist to figure it out. The coverage Most rally coverage shown on television focuses on the candidate speaking behind the podium, rather than showing the whole crowd. There’s a reason for this. At campaign events, one television network organization is responsible for controlling the head-on pool camera, and other cameras are responsible for wide shots and reaction shots. Les Rose, a professor at Syracuse and former field producer and photojournalist for CBS, said whoever is working the head-on pool camera is not working for the employer, but working for every television network or station in America. Of course, local news stations and national stations bring their own camera equipment to cover the event, but media outlets are dependent on the footage that is shot on these head-on pool cameras. The cameraperson in charge of the head-on pool camera has a very specific goal: get a shot of the candidate walking onto the stage, a shot of the candidate walking off the stage and the candidate saying the speech. "If (Trump’s) looking strictly at that feed (from the head-on camera), then you’re never going to see a crowd because that’s not the gig," Rose said. The reason news outlets often show the head-on pool footage is because the audio is the most clear in comparison to the other camera responsible for the reaction shots. Rose said the other cameras pick up natural sounds like applause that can make it harder to hear the actual speech. Still, this doesn’t mean the media doesn’t show crowds at Trump rallies. A quick Google search quickly debunked this. Reporters have shown Trump’s crowds through photos. See examples here, here, here, here and here. News stories: "More than 15,000 fired-up Donald Trump fans turned out Monday night to cheer on the presidential nominee heading into the final two weeks of the campaign," reads the lede of a story from the Tampa Bay Times from his Oct. 24 rally in Tampa. "His supporters routinely pointed, as the nominee did, to the huge crowds still flocking to see him as evidence that his campaign remains strong," reads a line from a New York Times article from Trump’s rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. The Washington Post even wrote a story about Trump’s crowds that looked into the actual size of crowds at Trump rallies. "Ever since Trump launched his presidential campaign in June 2015, he has attracted massive crowds to rallies across the country," reads the article. "During the primaries, Trump’s head counts were nearly always larger than those of his Republican rivals or Clinton’s, whose audiences back then usually topped out at 1,000. But instead of celebrating the actual size of these crowds, Trump has routinely exaggerated the already large numbers." They also wrote a story about large crowds and how they don’t necessarily correlate with large vote totals. Social media Many reporters have documented Trump’s crowds on Twitter. Ashley Killough, a CNN reporter covering Trump, tweeted a photo of his crowds at a Cinncinati rally with the caption: "Massive crowd at Trump's rally in Cincinnati." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Adam Smith, Tampa Bay Times political editor, tweeted this photo of a Florida rally with the caption, "Trump to 7k crowd promises to pump up NASA and more space exploration." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com BuzzFeed News political reporter Rosie Gray tweeted a video of Trump’s crowd in Newton, Pa., booing the media. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com New England Cable News reporter Danielle Waugh tweeted a photo of the crowd with the caption: "Here's a look at the packed gym for Trump rally in Lisbon, Maine - in case he says media never shows crowds:" See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com CNN Producer Noah Gray tweeted a few shots of a Trump crowd in Geneva, Ohio. The caption: "Pano of crowd at Trump Vegas rally." See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said that the media "never show crowds" at his rallies. This often repeated claim doesn’t take a lot of effort to debunk. The media has documented Trump’s crowds through stories, social media, photos and videos.

pomt-04482	Says U.S. Senate opponent Tommy Thompson favors raising taxes on small businesses.	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/07/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-wants-raise-taxes-small-busi/	When the first debate in the U.S. Senate race turned to government spurring job growth, Democrat Tammy Baldwin said spending on education, research and infrastructure could boost private-sector employment. Then she trained her criticism on her opponent, Republican Tommy Thompson: "Unfortunately my opponent is supporting a budget plan that -- because he's giving such huge tax breaks to the very wealthy and raising taxes on the middle class and small businesses -- they are slashing those very investments that I think are essential to growth." Thompson turned to Baldwin and responded: "When you don’t have a record you attack the other person. I’m not in Congress -- you are." Thompson then ticked off a list of positive Wisconsin jobs numbers and tax cuts approved during his governorship from 1986 to 2001. The two words -- "small business" -- jumped out for one reader, who asked us to check it out. We’ve dealt before with the other part of Baldwin’s claim, that Thompson wants to raise taxes on the middle class. We rated Half True a claim in a Baldwin TV ad that Thompson "wants to give a new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class." The budget plan offered by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., which Thompson has endorsed -- and some of Thompson’s own proposals -- would mean big cuts for upper-income earners. But we said the middle-class part drew a questionable conclusion based on worst-case-scenario assumptions about what tax deductions Thompson and Ryan would eliminate. Now, what about raising taxes on small business? When asked for backup, the Baldwin campaign pointed us back to the debate and Thompson’s statement that "we gotta do away with," the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which Republicans term "Obamacare." If you eliminate the law, her campaign said, you also eliminate the law’s income tax credit for hundreds of thousands of small businesses. In other words, Thompson would in effect raise taxes on small businesses. The reference to the federal health reform law was not part of the original Baldwin claim. She spoke broadly about the effect of Thompson’s plans on small business, so we have to take a broader view as well. First, it strikes us as legitimate for Baldwin to hold Thompson to his word on "Obamacare," and on the Ryan budget he has explicitly endorsed. And the health care law does contain a Small Business Health Care Tax Credit designed to cut premium costs and encourage businesses to offer insurance coverage to employees. It’s no small change, either. As of mid-2011, 228,000 taxpayers had claimed more than $278 million in credits, according to federal figures. Those numbers were well below expectations, due in part to some businesses saying credits were not worth the paperwork. But businesses taking the credits can get a break of up to 35 percent on premium payments, and up to 50 percent after 2013. Small businesses and tax-exempt employers can claim the credit for up to six years, as long as they pay at least one-half the cost of health insurance coverage for their employees. One limitation is that it applies only to businesses that pay lower-end wages. So is the loss of a tax credit the same as a tax increase? Experts take both sides, as PolitiFact Wisconsin and PolitiFact New Jersey have noted. In 2011, we gave Gov. Scott Walker a Promise Broken on his pledge to oppose all tax increases because he cut income tax credits related to property and income status. In that case the issue was settled by the official nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which called the changes a tax increase. Thompson, meanwhile, has pounded Baldwin as a tax-raiser because she wouldn’t make permanent for everyone the Bush tax cuts of 2001-’03 that are set to expire -- cuts that included a bevy of sweetened tax credits. At first cut, then, Baldwin’s camp makes a point. But there’s a lot more to this one. First, the federal health reform law includes multiple tax increases for individuals and businesses. Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s unfair to pick out just one side of the ledger and ignore the other. Edwards noted the legislation contained a new tax on medical devices companies, some of which are small businesses. Indeed, the tax hikes in the law are one of Thompson’s rationales for opposing the law. What’s more, Thompson has proposed replacing portions of the law with various reforms. One, it turns out, is a tax credit designed -- as in the original law -- to reduce premium costs for small businesses. In Thompson’s case, he would give the credit directly to employees of small businesses instead of the employers, but the goal is the same: To reduce costs. As we noted, there’s a bigger picture here as well -- the impact of Ryan’s federal budget plan and Thompson’s own RESTORE America tax plan on small businesses. Thompson’s plan, mirroring Ryan’s, calls for cutting the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. Thompson says he would create just one more bracket, at 10 percent. This would apply to businesses large and small. It’s impossible to calculate the net tax effect of Thompson’s positions on small business taxes, in part because he advocates tax simplification but hasn’t revealed which deductions he would end. But he clearly backs a much broader tax break for business -- something that also went unmentioned by Baldwin. Our rating Baldwin said Thompson favors raising taxes on small businesses. Her campaign cited Thompson’s call to repeal the federal health law, which would end a new small-business tax credit in that law. So there is an element of truth. But Baldwin ignores the tax increases that would also be eliminated by a repeal, as well as the fact Thompson would create a different version of the same tax credit. More importantly, she skates past Thompson’s emphasis on tax cuts -- in particular his broader support for dramatically lowering income tax rates for business -- to create an opposite impression among voters. We rate her claim Mostly False.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2012-10-07T09:00:00	2012-09-28	['Tommy_Thompson', 'United_States']
pomt-11754	Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison has a "66 percent recidivism rate," while "states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/dec/06/gordon-hintz/recidivism-rate-wisconsins-lincoln-hills-youth-pri/	For two years, Wisconsin’s youth prison for males has been under an FBI-led criminal investigation into allegations of prisoner abuse, child neglect, sexual assault, intimidation of witnesses and victims, strangulation and tampering with public records. Should the facility, Lincoln Hills School, be shut down? That question was posed to Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz in an interview on Nov. 21, 2017, the day after the Oshkosh Democrat toured Lincoln Hills. Responding to Wisconsin Eye TV host Steven Walters, Hintz said an alternative would have to be developed first. Then he made a statement that seemed to indict the facility, saying: We have a 66 percent recidivism rate for the kids there, in the three years after they get out. States like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent." So, 66 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates commit new offenses within three years of being released? And that’s eight times higher than in states such as Missouri, which has been held up as a potential model for Wisconsin? We’ll see that, as national experts have stated, comparing states on juvenile recidivism is not easily done. The trouble at Lincoln Hills Lincoln Hills generally holds inmates as young as 13 and as old as 25, with most inmates in their mid-to late-teens; some adults are being held for crimes they committed as juveniles. Incarcerating an inmate there costs more than $100,000 a year. Groups such as Youth Justice Milwaukee, which is calling for Wisconsin’s youth prisons to be closed, argue that conditions at Lincoln Hills can lead to higher recidivism -- inmates committing new offenses after they’re released. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has gone even further than Hintz, saying 75 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates fall back into criminal activity. Meanwhile, Missouri -- when facing problems similar to those at Lincoln Hills, such as fights between inmates, long stints in solitary confinement and injuries inflicted by guards -- replaced large institutions with small facilities, closer to young offenders' homes. But the contrast in recidivism between the two states is not how Hintz portrays it. Hintz’s partially accurate evidence To back Hintz’s claim, his office cited a January 2017 report by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It says that according to the latest available data, Lincoln Hills has a three-year recidivism rate of 63 percent. That is, 278 juveniles were released from Lincoln Hills in 2011 and 63 percent returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, by 2014. So, Hintz’s claim of a 66 percent recidivism rate at Lincoln Hills is high by only three percentage points. Missouri’s definition of recidivism is roughly similar to Wisconsin’s, but has four parts. It includes youths who are sent back to the juvenile system, are sent to adult prison, are put on probation, or are put into a 120-day program. But the latest State of Missouri figures show Missouri’s three-year recidivism rate, for 2013 to 2016, is 30 percent. That’s far less than Lincoln Hills’ 63 percent. But it’s also much higher than the 8 percent Hintz claimed. That lower rate applies only to the first part of Missouri’s recidivism definition -- youths who commit new offenses and are sent back to the youth system. Apples and oranges There are also other problems with comparing Lincoln Hills to Missouri: Lincoln Hills Missouri Latest three-year recidivism rate is 2011-2014 Latest recidivism rate is 2013-2016 Only male inmates Male and female offenders Inmates have committed serious, violent crimes — including homicide and robbery — or have had repeated run-ins with the law and didn’t turn their behavior around after being sent to group homes. Youths have committed a wide variety of offenses, from serious felonies to truancy and curfew violations. Those create a major apples-to-oranges problem for Hintz’s statement, particularly the fact Missouri’s count includes many less serious offenders than Lincoln Hills. Our rating Hintz says Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison has a "66 percent recidivism rate," while "states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent." He is essentially correct on Wisconsin. The latest figures show that 63 percent of Lincoln Hills offenders are returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, within three years of being released. But the comparison to Missouri misses on several counts. Missouri reports a three-year youth recidivism rate of 30 percent, not 8 percent -- and even that is misleading. While Lincoln Hills incarcerates only serious male offenders, Missouri’s youth correctional system includes males and females who commit offenses ranging from serious crimes to truancy. So, Hintz is comparing two significantly different populations. Hintz’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False. Related fact checks Federal Judge James Peterson: We’ve rated a claim that Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, "has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills." Mostly True. Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn: In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft "get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court" on holding suspects, "a stolen car gets zero points." Mostly False. State Sen. Leah Vukmir (R-Brookfield), a 2018 candidate for U.S. Senate: In 2016, there were 5,570 people in Wisconsin "who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked."

pomt-08696	"Boccieri voted to spend a billion dollars an hour, every hour, for his first 50 days in office"	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/08/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-rips-rep-john-boccieris-votes-spend-bi/	Republicans have been singing this campaign season about federal spending, hoping their charge that Democrats are spending too much money too fast strikes a chord with voters. Jim Renacci, who is challenging incumbent John Boccieri in Ohio's hotly contested 16th Congressional District, has joined the chorus. "Boccieri voted to spend a billion dollars an hour, every hour, for his first 50 days in office," Renacci's campaign website says. That's a serious Congressional shopping spree, one that PolitiFact thought we should check out. We started with the Renacci campaign, asking it to cite a source for its data. Campaign Manager James Slepian sent us to a posting on Politico by Mike Allen, who was reporting on a comment by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. McConnell, on the 51st day of Barack Obama's presidency, decried spending by the Democrat-controlled Congress, saying "In just 50 days, Congress has voted to spend about $1.2 trillion between the Stimulus and the Omnibus. To put that in perspective, that's about $24 billion a day, or about $1 billion an hour - most of it borrowed. There's simply no question: government spending has spun out of control." Here's how the math works. The combined totals of the the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or stimulus bill (about $787 billion) and the Omnibus Spending Bill for 2009 (about $410 billion) is about $1.2 trillion. The Senate passed the omnibus bill on March 10 -- Day 50 for the Obama administration (the stimulus package was approved in February). Divide $1.2 trillion by 50 days and you get $24 billion a day, or $1 billion an hour. But McConnell's statement used a slightly different time frame than Renacci's statement. The 111th Congress convened its first session on Jan. 6, two weeks before Obama's inauguration. But coincidentally, the House votes on the omnibus bill and the stimulus package also fit a 50-day window. The House approved the final version of the stimulus bill on February 13 -- Day 29 for the House to be in session. The omnibus spending bill was approved Feb. 25 -- Day 50. Boccieri voted in favor of both bills. So the calender works, and the math works, theoretically. But there is a point about the math that needs to be clarified. It is true that the total for those two bills is about $1.2 trillion. And that can be broken down to $1 billion an hour, every hour, for 50 days. And Congress voted to spend that total. But Congress did not vote to spend it by the hour, nor did it spend it within that 50 days. The omnibus spending bill provided money to fund the government for all of 2009. And as Michael Scherer noted in his Swampland blog for TIME magazine that March, even if John McCain had been the new president and Republicans had controlled Congress, most of that spending would have been approved anyway. "No Republican has proposed not funding the government. ... And Republicans would still have needed to find a way to pass the omnibus in the first weeks of the new year." As for the stimulus money, it was projected to be spent over several years, although the bulk has been awarded at this point. As of Aug. 20, $505 billion of the $787 had been awarded in tax benefits, entitlements and contracts, grants and loans. We rate Renacci's statement as Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Organized labor has protested the use, claiming it is a way for the city to avoid paying benefits. Portland city commissioner Amanda Fritz, who is up for re-election in May, opposes privatization of city jobs and recently claimed credit for reducing the number of workers on contract at parks. "At my urging, Commissioner (Nick) Fish reviewed contracting out in Parks. As a result, the number of contracted employees dropped from over 100 to under 40 in the three years I've been in office," she wrote in response to a questionnaire by Occupy Portland. She repeated the claim in another primary election questionnaire: "My advocacy questioning contracting out in Parks, despite not being the Commissioner in Charge of that bureau, delayed and altered the renewal of the Brooks contract, and reduced the number of contracted employees in Parks from over 100 to fewer than 40." The questions for PolitiFact Oregon are straightforward. Did the number of workers on contract at parks drop? And, more importantly, was Fritz responsible for the reduction? Parks spokesman Mark Ross confirmed that in 2009, the bureau had on average between 60 to 120 workers through S. Brooks and Associates. In February 2009, there were 57 workers. By July 2011, the number was 36. So Fritz is correct on the numbers. But was she behind the drop in contracted hires, as she claims? Pinning down this part proved challenging for PolitiFact Oregon. Fritz’s office says yes, and that but for her intervention the numbers would not have declined. However, Parks and Recreation and the city’s Human Resources director both credit a rule that went into effect in January 2008, allowing seasonal city employees to work more hours, thereby reducing the need to hire workers on contract. (A representative for Brooks did not return phone calls or email requesting comment.) "The number had started to dramatically decrease in 2008 once we made the charter change and it has continued to decrease as a result of the charter change and as a result of the types of programs and activities that parks is running," said HR director Yvonne Deckard. Previously seasonal workers could work at most 860 hours in a year. The rule change increased the maximum to 1,200 hours a year. Fritz, we should point out, joined the City Council in January 2009. She had nothing to do with the new hours. So, what is Fritz’s office talking about? Well, in February 2009, the City Council considered renewing the Brooks contract for another five years. This was a sore subject with Laborers’ Local 483, the union that represents many parks workers. Leaders there raised the issue of contract workers with Nick Fish soon after he inherited the bureau in January. Fritz also lobbied Fish to reconsider the contract. "I do recall strongly that she had a concern about that contract," Fish said. "She wanted to know more about it. She did in fact meet with me about it. She's the reason it got scaled back." The City Council eventually agreed to a one-year renewal, not five years. But we still wanted to know how renewing a contract for a shorter period of time reduced the use of Brooks workers. Tim Crail, a spokesman for Fritz, explained that the shortened time period prompted Fish’s office, the parks bureau and labor leaders to "negotiate moving classifications, which has resulted in a reduced reliance on the Brooks contract to fill certain job classifications. Thus the reduction from 100 to 40," he wrote. "But for Commissioner Fritz questioning the five year extension on February 25th, 2009, the changes would not have occurred." Yet that’s not what happened. Crail didn’t have the number of positions recategorized. The contract and its amendments, which we requested, did not change. And Fish told us that talks between parks and labor didn’t result in a new agreement on when to use contract workers. Fish can’t recall how the parks bureau came to reduce its reliance on Brooks. It may have been a combination of concerted effort and scheduling as allowed under the 1,200-hour rule. (By the way, the maximum is now 1,400 hours a year.) "It was both my belief, her belief and, ultimately, the bureau position that we would lessen our reliance on these positions," Fish said. "It’s clear we did not want it used as much." So, how do we rule on Fritz’s statement? The commissioner accurately states that she questioned the use of contract employees at the bureau. It’s also accurate for her to say that from 2009 to 2011, the number of contract employees used by the parks bureau went from 100 to 40. What Fritz has not showed is that but for her questioning, the changes would not have occurred. After all, Fish had concerns about the use of contract workers. Labor had concerns. The terms of the Brooks contract did not change materially after 2009. The city, notably, did not reclassify positions to favor direct hires, as her office claims. Certainly Fritz’s questioning helped prompt a council-level discussion about an issue dear to the union and troubling to the parks commissioner. But the mechanism to reduce the use of contracted temps was a rule change, which stemmed from a charter change, in effect a year before Fritz took office.

pomt-04045	Says state workers have not had across-the-board raises in six years.	/florida/statements/2013/jan/29/michelle-rehwinkel-vasilinda/state-workers-have-gone-six-years-without-raises-s/	Unlike recent years, Florida leaders aren’t talking about budget cuts and layoffs and pay cuts. This year, they’re talking raises. Gov. Rick Scott, facing a tough reelection bid in 2014, wants the state’s projected budget surplus to go toward $2,500 raises for every public school teacher. The Legislature’s Republican leaders reacted with reserve. Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said teachers are deserving of a raise but so are other state workers, such as correctional officers. House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, said teacher performance should be part of raises, in line with the merit pay plan Scott signed into law in 2011. Then there’s Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, who filed a bill that would award 7 percent raises to all state employees, many of whom live in Tallahassee. She calls it the "State Employee Fairness Act" and says it would cost the state $487 million. "I think the guy or the woman who sweeps the floor and the folks who test the water for (The Department of Environmental Protection) deserve raises across the board," Rehwinkel Vasilinda told the Tallahassee Democrat. "Those people haven't seen raises in six years." A reader recently emailed PolitiFact Florida wondering if state employees have really gone that long without a raise. We looked at the issue two years ago, when then-newly inaugurated Scott toured state agencies and gave employees a chance to ask him questions. A Department of Corrections employee told Scott, who had campaigned on shrinking the state workforce and requiring workers to contribute to their pensions, that public employees have already made sacrifices to help the state’s bottom line. We rated the worker's claim that "state employees haven't received a raise in five or six years" Mostly True. At the time, it had been almost four years and five months since the last general pay adjustment for state workers in 2006. And in 2006, state employees got a lump-sum $1,000 bonus in 2007. With that precedent in mind, we checked in again with the Department of Management Services. The last across-the-board raise the Legislature approved for all state employees was a 3-percent raise on Oct. 1, 2006, a little more than six years ago. "Across the board" is an important distinction. A few state agencies have given pay raises within their departments since 2006, said DMS spokesman Ben Wolf. The Florida Highway Patrol implemented a 5 percent pay increase in 2008, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission issued a 3 percent raise for its law enforcement officers on Jan. 1, 2011, he said. "Other individual employees have received pay increases since 2006 for exemplary performance," Wolf said. Rehwinkel Vasilinda, who represents thousands of state employees who work in the capital city, wants all workers to have a 1 percent raise for every year they did not get a raise, plus 1 percent going forward. "A one-time bonus is not a raise," she said. Florida leaders anticipate a budget surplus this year, but they’re not sure how much will be on hand until estimates are completed in March. That has not stopped interest groups from already clamoring for funds after a years-long dry spell. Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee, told the Tallahassee Democrat he will introduce a 4 percent salary hike for state workers. Rep. Dwayne Taylor, D-Daytona Beach, introduced a bill that would give state employees a 2 percent raise, and Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, is co-sponsoring the measure in the Florida Senate. Two percent may be what’s feasible, Rehwinkel Vasilinda said, but it does not go far enough. "(Taylor) was doing what he thought was probable and that it would not be a radical departure than what’s gone on the past six years," she said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida. Scott has said he will again ask the Legislature to provide money for agency heads to dole out performance-based raises to high-performing employees, but we won’t know the details until he releases his 2013-14 budget recommendations, which will be released by Feb. 3. The Senate’s budget chief, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, has said he would rather address pay inequities at certain agencies than give across-the-board raises. Rehwinkel Vasilinda’s bill uses statistics to bolster the case for Florida workers getting a salary bump. Florida may be on track to be the third-most populous state, but in 2011 its state worker-to-resident ratio was the lowest in the nation. At 112 workers to 10,000 residents, Florida’s ratio was 47.4 percent lower than the national average. Florida also spends less money on its state government workforce than any other state. According to DMS, Florida’s 2011 payroll expenditure per state resident was $37, which is 50 percent less than the national average of state government payroll expenditures of $74. Our ruling Rehwinkel Vasilinda claimed state workers have not had a raise in six years. She’s correct that they have not had an across-the-board raise since Oct. 1, 2006. The context of her quote makes it clear she was referring to raises for all state workers, so we rate her claim True.

pomt-05240	"Forty years ago ... about half of congressional districts were genuinely competitive. Today, only about 10 percent of House races on Cook Political Report are listed as ‘toss-ups’ or ‘lean’ to one party."	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/04/john-barrow/barrow-election-competitiveness-down-congress/	Life for moderate Democrats has grown so lonely that Blue Dog U.S. Rep. John Barrow has taken to singing the blues. Barrow warbled his lament in The Washington Post, where he blamed gerrymandering for squeezing moderates out of Congress in a May 17 op-ed. Georgia Republicans drew the Blue Dogs’ co-chairman out of his district in 2011, putting him into heavily Republican territory. He has since moved from Savannah to Augusta as part of a bid to keep his seat in the upcoming election. "Forty years ago, when I was an intern on the Hill, about half of congressional districts were genuinely competitive," Barrow wrote. "Today, only about 10 percent of House races on Cook Political Report are listed as ‘toss-ups’ or ‘lean’ to one party." Congress has been unfriendly territory for moderates lately. The 2010 election culled half the Blue Dog membership, and the partisan fervor that helped kill those congressional careers shows no sign of letting up. But have things changed that much in 40 years? PolitiFact Georgia contacted Barrow spokesman Peyton Bell for more information. Bell said Barrow was going by memory on the statistics from 40 years ago. We searched for data to see whether we could confirm his claim. But first, we checked Barrow’s take on the Cook Political Report numbers. Politicos use this publication widely for odds on political races nationwide. It classifies congressional races into three categories: lean, tossup and likely. "Tossups" are races where either party can win. "Lean" races are competitive, but one party has an advantage. "Likely" races are the least competitive. Cook lists 23 Democratic and 32 Republican seats as "lean" or "tossup" in its May 17 analysis. This means that nearly 13 percent of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives are in play. This is close to the 10 percent that Barrow used. Barrow’s statement about congressional races 40 years ago was much weaker. Gary Jacobson is a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies Congress and congressional elections, especially voters and partisan polarization in Congress. The data he sent us stretches back to the end of World War II. Jacobson assessed the competitiveness of House races by tabulating election results. He calculated the proportion of those that were won with less than 55 percent and 60 percent of the vote. By these definitions, very few races are competitive. Forty years ago, in 1972, only some 15 percent of House races were won with less than 55 percent of the vote. Only 28 percent were won with less than 60 percent. "By neither standard were anything like half the seats competitive," Jacobson said. These rates have gone up and down in the past 40 years. In the 18 years after World War II, the number of races won with 60 percent of the vote or less hovered between 35 percent and 45 percent. The number of those won with 55 percent or less ranged between 20 percent and 28 percent. Since then, the numbers have fluctuated greatly, according to Jacobson’s data. Races were particularly noncompetitive in 1988 and the early 2000s, but they show no clear trend, Jacobson said. The proportion of races won by 60 percent or less of the vote rebounded and broke the 35 percent mark within four to six years of those declines. Those won by 55 percent or less rose above 20 percent. This isn’t to say that moderates are having an easy time. Congressional districts do appear to be getting more partisan, according to other data Jacobson has compiled. But this trend does not appear to be related to redistricting, he said. Half of Barrow’s statement is accurate and the other half isn’t. Barrow’s assessment of Cook Political Report numbers is on target, but House races four decades ago were not as competitive as he recalled. We therefore give Barrow a Half True.

pomt-14705	Canadian-born Ted Cruz "has had a double passport."	/texas/statements/2016/jan/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-incorrectly-says-ted-cruz-has-had-dou/	New Yorker Donald Trump told The Washington Post that uncertainty over whether Ted Cruz of Texas satisfies the citizenship requirement to be president puts Republicans in a precarious position. Hold on. Legal scholars concur that the Canadian-born but mostly Texas-reared Cruz, battling Trump and others for the Republican presidential nomination, likely fulfills the constitutional imperative that the president be a "natural-born citizen." But there’s a note of uncertainty because the Supreme Court has never directly ruled on the citizenship provision for presidential office holders. The question circulates because Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, on Dec. 22, 1970, to his Delaware-born mother Eleanor Darragh and Cuban-born father. If Darragh was an American, then under American law, Cruz was an American at birth. We were curious about Trump’s claim in a Jan. 5, 2016, interview with the Post -- offered by the candidate without documentary evidence -- that Cruz has had more than one passport, implying the Houston lawyer spent some time trying to pass as a citizen of either Canada or the U.S. Prior to a Trump rally in Lowell, Mass., the Post asked Trump about Cruz’s Canadian roots. Trump replied: "Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question: ‘Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?’ That’d be a big problem. It’d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he’d be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision. You don’t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head." Trump went on: "I’d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it, and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport." There’s no such thing, far as we could tell, as a "double passport." We suspect Trump was suggesting Cruz had obtained both one U.S. and a Canadian one--though our requests for factual backup drew no replies from Trump representatives. Meantime, when we asked Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler about Cruz ever having a "double passport," Tyler replied that Cruz had "never" had a Canadian passport or, he said by email, applied for one. Whether he knew it or not, Cruz for much of his life had dual citizenship, meaning citizenship in Canada and the United States. A Canadian government website says: "You do not apply for dual citizenship and there is no related certificate. Canadians are allowed to take foreign citizenship while keeping their Canadian citizenship." In August 2013, when the Dallas Morning News reported Cruz’s dual status, Cruz said that it came as a surprise to him and his parents. "Nothing against Canada," Cruz said, "but I’m an American by birth and as a U.S. senator, I believe I should be only an American." That News’ story said that unless Cruz "formally renounces that citizenship, he will remain a citizen of both countries, legal experts say. That means he could assert the right to vote in Canada or even run for Parliament. On a lunch break from the U.S. Senate, he could head to the nearby embassy — the one flying a bright red maple leaf flag — pull out his Calgary, Alberta, birth certificate and obtain a passport." (We checked a Canadian government web page; it says an adult in the United States seeking a new Canadian passport must apply by mail.) In 2013, Cruz reacted to the News’ story by vowing to shed his Canadian citizenship, which he successfully renounced as of May 14, 2014, the News reported in June 2014. Our ruling Trump said Cruz "has had a double passport." Trump didn’t provide and we didn’t find evidence that Cruz, who relinquished his dual citizenship in 2014, ever carried passports for the U.S. and Canada--nor, Cruz’s camp advises, did he ever apply for a Canada passport.

pomt-07948	The United States has "one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-us-corporate-tax-rat/	In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama brought up the idea of simplifying the tax code. "Over the years," he said, "a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change." In noting the nation’s high corporate tax rates, Obama offered a statistic that is more often raised by Republicans. But is it right? We checked this fact before, when it was offered by newly elected Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa. On the Jan. 2, 2011, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, host David Gregory asked Toomey for areas where Obama and congressional Republicans could work together. "I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities," Toomey said. "Simplify the code, lower rates. We should be lowering corporate tax rates, because we have the highest in the world right now." Using the most straightforward definition of "corporate tax rates," Toomey is right. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the "combined corporate income tax rate" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services. We found that for 2010, the U.S ranked second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point -- 39.54 percent for Japan to 39.21 percent for the U.S. But that figure is already outdated: Japan has moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations. Still, the issue is complicated, so let’s delve a bit deeper. The OECD rate is the "statutory" rate -- that is, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But as Obama indicated, many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the "effective tax rate." The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand imposed a higher effective rate, according to the World Bank study. And Japan's number should fall by the time next year's study comes out. The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden. This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky. There's also broader context that Toomey doesn't get into. In a previous item, we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden. Taking into account these complexities, we rated Toomey’s comment Mostly True. Obama’s statement is actually more accurate than Toomey’s, because he hedges a bit by saying that the United States has "one of" the highest corporate tax rates in the world. He's right that the U.S. does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books, at least among the biggest industrialized democracies, which is most economists' typical yardstick. And U.S. tax rates also are among the biggest by more nuanced measures. So we rate Obama’s statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-01-25T23:02:57	2011-01-25	['United_States']
pomt-07127	"Do this research … watch how much crime picks up if you take away [football]."	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/17/ray-lewis/ray-lewis-crime-claim-gets-flagged/	For more than a decade, Ray Lewis has been one of the most fearsome players in professional football. Lewis, a 12-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, recently offered a prediction if the ongoing National Football League lockout continues through this season that sounded scarier than getting tackled by him. There’s talk that NFL owners and players are closer to a labor agreement, but if not, Lewis says watch out. "Do this research," Lewis told ESPN. "If we don’t have a season, watch how much evil, which we call crime, watch how much crime picks up if you take away our game." Lewis, to be clear, was talking about fans committing more crime, not players. Lewis, as some Atlantans remember, has a criminal history in this city. In 2000, Lewis and some friends got into an argument at a Buckhead nightclub with two men who were fatally stabbed. Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstruction of justice and was sentenced to probation. Lewis now speaks of his Christian faith and is one of the sport’s most popular players. Thus far, many bloggers and others have laughed at Lewis’ comments. Considering his size and hitting ability, we won’t. Still, we decided to be game and, as Lewis advised, do some research. We tried to talk to the former Super Bowl MVP or one of his representatives, but our efforts were unsuccessful. Our first thought was to look at past NFL work stoppages and see whether crime did increase. In the Super Bowl era, there have been two work stoppages during the regular season. In 1982, the 16-game season was cut down to nine games because of a 57-day labor dispute from late September to mid-November. There was a 24-day strike in 1987. We thought it would be more interesting to see whether there was an increase in crime in 1982 than 1987 because the work stoppage in the earlier year was almost two months long. The nation’s violent crime rate in 1982 was slightly lower than it was the year before the work stoppage, according to FBI crime data. The violent crime rate dropped more significantly the following year, the data show. Northeastern’s Sport in Society center examined Lewis’ claim after a call from us and also focused on the 1982 NFL work stoppage. It, too, reached a similar conclusion. "There is very little evidence supporting Lewis’ claim that crime will increase the longer the work stoppage lasts," the center told us. The Baltimore Sun also looked at crime in 1982 and found an increase during the strike in only one category: homicides. The Sun tried some other methods to tackle Lewis’ claim. The newspaper’s Crime Beat blog looked at crime data last season when the Ravens had their bye (off) week. The Sun found there was slightly more crime during the bye week. The Sun looked at crime in Baltimore the four weeks before the season started and the first four weeks of the season. There was the same number of crimes. The Sun also examined the crime rate there at the end of the Ravens’ season and what happened afterward. What did it find? There was less crime after the season ended in early January. The Sun stressed several times that its findings were unscientific. We tried the Sun’s approach and examined Atlanta crime statistics during the Falcons’ bye. The Falcons’ bye weekend in 2010 was Sunday, Oct. 31, and Monday, Nov. 1, just like the Ravens’. Again, it may be unscientific, but the data do not help Lewis’ argument. They show crime declined around that time. Two weeks beforehand (Oct. 17-23), there were 771 Part I offenses reported. Part I crimes include murder, rape, robbery, auto theft and aggravated assault. There were 755 of those crimes Oct. 24-30. Between Oct. 31 and Nov. 6, there were 736 of those crimes. There were 683 Part I crimes Nov. 7-13. We decided against comparing crime from the last week of the Falcons’ season and the week after. The last week of the Falcons’ season was also the week a snow and ice storm kept much of the region’s population at home. "[The storm] caused a decrease in crime, since there were very few people on the streets," Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. The FBI says crime typically decreases during football season, but it doesn’t see a correlation, according to a newspaper account provided to us by the Sport in Society center. The FBI believes criminals prefer to strike when the weather is warmer. Some current and former NFL players have argued Lewis has a point, including his quarterback, Joe Flacco. One criminologist we interviewed had a different take. Northeastern University professor James A. Fox heard Lewis’ comments and did a study. He looked at key FBI data from the last three years available, 2006 through 2008, focusing on the week before the Super Bowl because there were no games that week and there was intense interest in football around that time of the year. Fox, who was referred to us by the FBI, found no increase in crime the week there was no football. "I took the Ray Lewis challenge and I don’t see any evidence of [a crime increase]," said Fox, the author of several books on crime who also writes a crime and punishment blog for the Boston Globe. We, too, took the challenge and found no substantive evidence that Lewis has a point. Hopefully, we won’t see this fall whether Lewis is right. For now, we’re throwing a flag on this claim. Our rating is False.	None	Ray Lewis	None	None	None	2011-06-17T06:00:00	2011-05-25	['None']
pomt-07793	Oregon Health Plan rations "covered procedures under certain circumstances"	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/19/wesley-smith/one-pundit-says-oregon-health-plan-rations-covered/	UPDATE, Feb. 21, 2011 -- When we researched this claim, we made three attempts to reach Wesley J. Smith, the author of the Weekly Standard article. He did not respond to our messages, so we researched the claim on the assumption that he was referring to rationing of covered services that the state had previously said it would pay for. After our item was published and rated False, Smith contacted PolitiFact Oregon and said he was misinterpreted. He said he he never meant to imply -- nor did he write -- that the Oregon Health Plan declines to pay for treatment it has previously indicated it will cover. Rather, he says, he meant simply to say that while the Oregon Health Plan does cover some chemotherapy, there are certain treatments that fall under that broad umbrella that would not be covered. "I wasn't saying that she (Barbara Wagner) thought the plan would have permitted her to have the drug. I never meant to imply that. All I was trying to say was that sometimes ... there will be a time when a treatment can be denied under the plan." He added that the claim that we chose to focus on surprised him. He said he would have been a "little more precise" has he known that sentence, in particular, would garner so much attention. The assertion that the Oregon Health Plan rations "covered procedures under certain circumstances" can be read a few different ways. Our take initially, absent Mr. Smith's comments, was that he was implying that the plan could ration treatments that it had previously purported to cover. His clarifications, however, indicate to us that there is a certain amount of underlying truth to what he argued. As such, we've moved the Truth-O-Meter to Half True. Our updated article is below. Also, Barbara Wagner's name was misspelled when this analysis was initially published. The spelling has since been corrected. ----------------------- You might think that naming something "Lie of the Year" would put an issue to rest. Apparently, you’d be wrong. PolitiFact National called Sarah Palin’s assertion that Barack Obama’s health care overhaul would lead to "death panels" Lie of Year back in 2009, but the term keeps cropping up. In a recent Weekly Standard article one writer, Wesley J. Smith, applied the label to Oregon’s own Medicaid program. "‘Single payer’ and ‘death panels’ go together like ‘See’s’ and ‘candy,’" he writes. Smith takes aim at several targets -- Wisconsin, Canada’s Medicare, Britain’s National Health Service and, of course, "Obamacare" -- but here’s what he says about the Oregon Health Plan: Oregon, a decidedly liberal state, provides an unequivocal example. In 1993, the Clinton administration gave permission to the Oregon Health Plan, the state’s Medicaid program, to introduce rationing. The system involves a treatment schedule that lists 649 potentially covered procedures. The state pegs the number of procedures the state will cover to the available funds. Patients requiring procedures above the cutoff line are out of luck. As of October 2010, only the first 502 treatments were covered. But even that low number doesn’t tell the full story of rationing in Oregon. The Oregon Health Plan also rations covered procedures under certain circumstances. Chemotherapy, for instance, is not provided if it is deemed to have a 5 percent or less chance of extending the patient’s life for five years, meaning that a patient whose life might be extended a year or two with chemo may not receive it. Worse, even though it is not a formally ranked procedure, assisted suicide is covered under state law. Thus, when two recurrent cancer patients were rationed out of receiving potentially life-extending chemotherapy in 2008, an administrator wrote a letter assuring them that the state would pay for the costs associated with their assisted suicides. Talk about a death panel! There’s a lot to take in here. Did Oregon really start rationing in 1993? Did we really deny lifesaving chemotherapy to a patient? Ultimately, we decided to fact-check one statement that, on its face, might seem a little tame, but, in fact, seems to speak to the implications of Smith’s piece. So, here it is: Does the Oregon Health Plan ration "covered procedures under certain circumstances"? Before we jump into that question, however, we wanted to take this opportunity to correct some factual errors that Darren Coffman, director of Oregon’s Health Services Commission, pointed out when we called to chat with him about the article. 1) The Oregon Health Plan has a list of 679 potentially covered lines of treatment, not 649. The word "procedure" isn’t very accurate when used here, either. Each of those entries is a medical condition with a corresponding treatment plan that could include dozens of procedures. Some conditions are repeated multiple times, Coffman said. Cancer of the liver, for instance, has several lines of treatment. 2) Smith writes that chemotherapy isn’t covered if it has a "5 percent or less chance of extending the patient’s life for five years, meaning that a patient whose life might be extended a year or two with chemo may not receive it." That rule was changed two years back, Coffman said. Now, it’s less cut and dried. Instead there are four conditions under which chemotherapy might be denied. For example, a treatment that has less than a 50 percent chance of extending life, on average, six to 12 months, based on the "best available published evidence" would not be covered. Still, the basic concept remains: If there’s a small chance the treatment will extend life significantly, the state will not cover it. Next, let’s look into this idea of Smith’s that the Oregon Health Plan started "rationing" after 1993 when the Clinton administration gave then- and current-Gov. John Kitzhaber permission to change the way the Medicaid program worked. Kitzhaber did change the way the state’s Medicaid program worked in 1993. And it was a significant change. Here’s the before and after: Before 1994, Oregon’s Medicaid program worked the way most any other state’s program worked. The program covered individuals and families who were either so high risk that private insurance companies would not cover them or who were making a certain percent of the federal poverty level. That option left tens of thousands of Oregonians uninsured. If you made too much to get into the state’s program but not enough to afford a private insurance package, you simply went without. Furthermore, if the state’s budget dipped, officials simply reset the bar at which people were eligible for the program, essentially cutting off people who made too much. After 1994, the state began to prioritize health care treatments. Kitzhaber created a commission that developed this much-talked-about prioritized list. The list gave higher priority to the most effective treatments as indicated by the latest research. At the top, you have preventive care for children and maternity care; at the bottom, plastic surgery, which is, of course, not covered. Every two years, the Legislature draws a line, saying, essentially, we can cover treatment option 502 and up. Or whatever government income might allow. Legislators do not pick which services to provide; they simply draw a funding line. After 1994, the number of treatments covered shrank, but by limiting the services provided -- and therefore the costs -- Oregon could afford to include more folks in the program. Under the new guidelines, the health plan added some 55,000 people who would have otherwise been ineligible, according to state numbers. So which of the above options are rationing? Well, Susan Tolle, the director of Oregon Health & Science University’s Center for Ethics in Health Care, says both are. The way most states work -- and the way Oregon worked before ‘94 -- is if you don’t meet the poverty level stipulated "you’re thrown out. You get nothing. You’re ineligible. You don’t receive benefits of any kind. It’s not a discussion of what’s fair or not fair," Tolle said. "I believe that is rationing. And it’s what we did before the Oregon Health Plan." Now, she says, "the Oregon Health Plan has created much more transparency about rationing than before … we are much more public about what people are getting and not getting." Coffman puts it this way: "We’ve chosen to try to cover more people and limit some of the services according to treatments that have been shown to be ineffective or have lower impact on personal health." This is actually what private insurance companies do, as well. We’re convinced by what Tolle says. It may be that the Oregon Health Plan’s current configuration seems more like rationing, given that there’s a prioritized list. But any Medicaid program "rations," whether by denying some services, or denying all services. Oregon takes the former route. This is important, because the idea that Oregon is somehow fundamentally different in the way it denies care is central to Smith’s argument that the state rations even those services that it purports to cover. Let’s move on to his proof: He says Oregon denied life-extending care and instead offered physician-assisted suicide to two cancer patients. This story has roots in a controversy that erupted in summer 2008. According to an Associated Press story and an editorial in The Oregonian from the time, Barbara Wagner, a 64-year-old Springfield woman with lung cancer, was told that the Oregon Health Plan would not cover a prescribed cancer drug, but that it would cover end-of-life care, including physician-assisted suicide. Now, as the editorial from the time pointed out, Wagner had received thousands of dollars worth of care through the Oregon Health Plan in the previous years. And she would continue to do so. However, a specific drug she had been prescribed cost some $4,000 a month and did not meet the standard -- in place at the time -- that the drug should have a 5 percent chance of extending her life by five years. (Under the revised standard, according to Coffman, the outcome would have been the same: the state would not pay for the chemotherapy drug.) At the time, Kitzhaber co-wrote an opinion piece along with the then-chairman of the Oregon Health Services Commission. Here’s how they explained what had happened: "The Oregon Health Plan covers nearly all chemotherapy prescribed for cancer patients, including the multiple rounds of chemotherapy that the woman in this case received. The request for second-line treatment was denied because of the drug’s limited benefit and very high cost." It’s true, Kitzhaber continued, that the Oregon Health Plan covers doctor-assisted suicide but "weighting the cost of end-of-life treatment against the voter-approved Death With Dignity Act was never part of those discussions. No treatment has ever been denied because death would be more ‘cost effective.’" So, with that all sorted out, the question remains, did the Oregon Health Plan decide to ration previously covered treatment? Well, in the case of the woman mentioned above, that doesn’t seem to be the case. From the get-go, the medication she requested would not have been covered. There are clear guidelines for what sorts of treatments should and should not be covered. This drug was never one of them. This wasn’t the case just for the cancer patient in question. It’s the case for all covered under the Oregon Health Plan. So this situation aside, can the Oregon Health Plan suddenly restrict covered treatment lines? It cannot. The process is clear: A commission, every two years, prioritizes treatment plans based on the most current research. There are some 679 of these lines. The state Legislature then draws a funding line -- currently at treatment line 502. That line, and all those above it, are covered, Coffman says. Period. We read Smith’s comment that the plan rations covered procedures to mean that the plan denies patients care it has previously said it covers. However, Smith says that’s not how his words should be interpreted. Instead, he was trying to indicate that while chemotherapy is generally covered under the health plan, there are instances when it’s not. He’s right to a certain extent. Chemotherapy is included in several of the 502 treatment lines currently covered, but the type of chemotherapy covered and the situations under which it is covered are clear and immutable. We understand what he’s saying, but it somewhat confuses and ignores the way in which the prioritized list works. The list is not one of broadly covered procedures -- chemotherapy, organ transplant, physical therapy, etc. -- but one of medical conditions and very specific treatment plans. Smith’s clarification is welcome. It’s also necessary to understanding his argument. As such, we find his claim that the Oregon Health Plan rations "covered procedures under certain circumstances" to be Half True -- the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important, clarifying details.

pomt-03863	Research found that "over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/11/edward-flynn/milwaukee-police-chief-edward-flynn-says-use-assau/	Coming off his emotional congressional testimony backing legislation to renew a ban on military-style assault weapons, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn appeared on MSNBC. Asked about criticism alleging that the previous ban had almost no impact on the nation’s homicide rate, Flynn cited studies on the ban done for the U.S. Department of Justice. Researchers, said Flynn, found that "over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two-thirds. " He added: "Now, they couldn’t prove causation. Police implemented and embraced a wide variety of strategies and tactics during those 10 years as well. But it’s foolish not to see that there was a correlation. And to demand perfect social science causation proof before we can say that something had an impact on a phenomenon is foolish, it’s rhetorical and it doesn’t relate to the reality of policing." As Congress debates tightening gun controls after the Newtown school massacre, we thought it was worth checking Flynn’s assertion about assault-weapon use during the ban that began in 1994 and expired in 2004. Did a study show a two-thirds drop off in use of assault weapons in crimes? The claim is in wide circulation, having found its way into talking points that U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) offers for the renewal of the assault weapons ban. The National Rifle Association, which is fighting the ban, disputes the number. At issue is a 2004 study, sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, an arm of the U.S. Justice Department. Its author, Christopher S. Koper, also did the federally sponsored report for Congress on the short term (1994-1996) effect of the ban. Koper is a veteran criminology researcher, formerly of the Police Executive Research Forum. At the time of the 2004 study he was a professor affiliated with the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. He is now at the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University. The 1994 ban was aimed at semiautomatics, including rifles and pistols, with features "that appear useful in military and criminal applications but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defense (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers)," the study said. Flynn and Feinstein point to a conclusion in Koper’s 2004 report that found a big decline in the percentage of assault weapons among the guns seized by law enforcement and sent to federal officials for tracing. That percentage dropped by 70 percent between 1992-’03 and 2001-’02. That is, the percentage went from 5.4 percent to 1.6 percent of guns seized, the study found. The percentages are low because the guns are rarely used in gun crimes. That 70 percent drop is the main evidence for the "two-thirds" claim. There’s another piece of data from Koper’s study that suggests such a major decline. It’s the experience in Boston pre-ban (1991 to 1993) and post-ban (2000 to 2002). There, police saw a 72 percent drop in assault weapons among all guns recovered by police. Let’s take a closer look at both. "The overriding point is that we found consistent evidence across multiple national and local data sources that the use of (assault weapons) declined substantially during the ban years," Koper said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The apparent drop was mainly in assault pistols, not assault rifles. In addition, Koper wrote, based on figures collected in six metro police department "there were indications in the data that (assault weapons) were becoming increasingly rare over time." Koper, however, made clear that he did not try to come up with one definitive number that illustrated the decline in assault weapons seen in the data. A reading of the study shows why. It cautions in great detail that data that shows a 70 percent decline nationally is not conclusive. First, a large majority of guns recovered by police are not sent to federal authorities who trace the gun from its manufacture to sale. So those guns may not be representative of the types of firearms seized by police, the study noted. In addition, the drop may be attributable "in large part" to changes in tracing practices, the study noted. Still, Koper noted in the 2004 study that the dramatic decline started in the year of the ban. Ultimately, he concluded that the trace data "suggest" an actual decline in use of assault weapons in crimes. Koper told us the national tracing data "may overstate the drop, but it's understandable that people cite that number since it's a national figure." He added: "At any rate, there are lots of subtleties in this and no one right answer." The National Rifle Association critique of the Flynn-Feinstein claim is that "traces are not synonymous with crimes." The study acknowledges that, but cites a variety of reasons why guns recovered by police should serve as a "good approximation" of the types of guns used in violent crime, even though many are not clearly linked to such crimes. When we asked Flynn about this, Police Inspector WilliamJessupwrote back saying: "While there are limitations with any type of data, Chief Flynn does consider the 70 percent drop in ATF traces on assault weapons to be a reasonable proxy for the level of crime involving assault weapons during that period." Local findings Koper told us that people who refer to a "two-thirds" drop might also be referring to the study’s finding of a 72 percent reduction in assault weapon use in Boston based on police data about crime guns there. Other metro areas in the study also saw a decline, but only Boston’s dropoff was in the two-thirds range. Milwaukee County was in the study. Data collected here -- just on guns used in homicides -- showed a 17 percent drop from 1995 to 1998 compared to before the ban. That was the smallest reduction among weapon trends studied in Baltimore, Boston, Miami-Dade, St. Louis, Milwaukee and Anchorage. The reductions generally were between 32 and 40 percent, the study said. The Koper study concluded by finding "mixed" success at reducing criminal use of banned guns -- as well as ammunition feeding devices known as large capacity magazines. The decline suggested by the national trace data and the experience in several cities "was offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns" equipped with large capacity magazines, based on data studied in Baltimore, Milwaukee, Louisville, and Anchorage, the study found. There was an immense stock of exempted pre-ban magazines and it grew as more imports came in, it noted. Bottom line, the study said, was that "because the ban has not yet reduced the use of (large capacity magazines) in crime, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence." The ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban weapons and magazines ensured gradual effects that "are still unfolding and may not be fully felt for several years into the future," the study found. Our rating In a cable TV appearance, Flynn said researchers had found that "over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds." Flynn accurately quotes the 70 percent figure from an oft-cited study by a veteran researcher for the U.S. Department of Justice. The study makes no claim that the ban caused the apparent decline, but neither does Flynn. Flynn’s claim suffers somewhat, though, from an excess of certainty. The study and its author offer numerous and serious cautions that make clear the 70 percent figure -- while suggestive of a major drop -- is not a definitive figure. And the study makes clear that not all weapons traced by authorities are, as Flynn’s statement implied, used "in crimes." Those are important details that were missing. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Edward Flynn	None	None	None	2013-03-11T09:00:00	2013-03-01	['None']
pomt-13461	Says U.S.-Mexico border has "1 million legal border crossings each and every day."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/14/donald-trump/trump-says-1-million-legal-crossings-along-us-mexi/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump broke from his tough talk on immigration recently to highlight a more positive exchange between Mexico and the United States: legal border crossings. "The United States and Mexico share a 2,000-mile border, a half a trillion dollars in annual trade and 1 million legal border crossings each and every day," Trump said during his visit to Mexico Aug. 31. "We are united by our support for democracy, a great love for our people and the contributions of millions of Mexican Americans to the United States." Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto during that same press conference also cited legal crossings, saying, "We share the most travelled border through which every day, legally, more than a million people cross it and over 400,000 vehicles." Given the focus on illegal crossings, we decided to take a look at the flip side: Do 1 million people cross the border legally every day? Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for information. Border patrol processings We couldn't find definitive figures pointing to the 1 million estimate. But experts said it sounds reasonable based on figures we do have for U.S. entries and how intertwined cities are in the border region. A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told us that along the southwest border, the daily average number of inbound legal crossings of pedestrians, passengers and crew into the United States has increased in recent years. Legal crossing were 462,793 in fiscal year 2013, 483,501 in 2014, and 507,767 in 2015. CBP said 1 million daily crossings seemed accurate when taking into account outbound crossings, which the agency does not track. An entry is recorded for every visit into the United States from Mexico, so one individual could represent multiple crossings in one day. Transportation Department data, compiled from the Homeland Security Department, reflect similar border flows. Pedestrians and passengers on buses, trains and personal vehicles accounted for about 474,686 entries into the United States per day in fiscal year 2014, according to the department’s border crossing/entry data. In fiscal year 2015, that grew to about 496,660. Reasons for travel The border region includes four U.S. states (California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas) and six Mexican states and is home to about 14 million people, according to December 2014 data from the Mexican government. The 2014 figures also say one million people cross the U.S.-Mexico border daily. Border cities like El Paso/Juarez and San Diego/Tijuana "are really single urban entities divided by an artificial border," said Douglas S. Massey, sociology and public affairs professor at Princeton University and director of the university’s Office of Population Research. "People often live on one side of the border and work on the other and vice versa, with huge movement in both directions," Massey said. "There are also many, many daily trips in both directions for shopping, business and recreation." The U.S. government also allows Mexican citizens to use Border Crossing Cards to enter the country from Mexico "by land, or by pleasure vessel or ferry." Border crossing cards allow people to go back and forth at will, Massey said. Many of the entries from Mexico to the United States also are Americans coming back into the country, Massey said. Crossings have increased since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, he said. "Legal border crossings at the dozens of ports of entries located along the U.S.-Mexican border significantly benefit both the U.S. and Mexican economies, which is why the numbers continue to rise," said Noe Garcia, president of the Border Trade Alliance, a nonprofit advocating for improved border affairs and trade relations among Canada, the United States and Mexico. Trade between the United States and Mexico in 2015 totaled about $583.6 billion, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Commerce Department figures show United States exports of goods and services to Mexico also supported about 1.1 million jobs in 2014. We emailed Mexican officials for their entry tallies, but didn’t get a response. Our ruling Trump said the U.S.-Mexico border has "1 million legal border crossings each and every day." Border patrol and Transportation Department data show there are around half a million daily border crossings from Mexico into the United States. While that number doesn’t necessarily represent unique individuals (rather total crossings), the border region is home to about 14 million people, many who cross back and forth between the nations to go to school, work and for recreational purposes. So while there isn’t a hard number pointing to the 1 million total crossings, experts believe it’s a plausible estimate given the needs of the millions of people who live in the border region. With that caveat, we rate Trump’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2ea495f3-90ef-4d42-acec-8dc9edc98939	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-14T10:53:12	2016-08-31	['None']
pomt-06501	"Every worker pays 15.3 percent payroll tax."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/12/herman-cain/herman-cain-said-workers-now-pay-153-percent-payro/	Herman Cain’s 9-9-9 plan was the talk of the debate held Oct. 11, 2011, in Hanover, N.H., with Cain’s Republican opponents for the presidential nomination assailing the plan as unworkable. At one point, moderator Charlie Rose warned other candidates that mentioning the plan meant more rebuttal time for Cain. "If you keep mentioning 9-9-9 and Herman Cain, I'm going to have to go back to him every other question," Rose said. Basically, Cain’s plan would replace the existing laws on income taxes, payroll taxes and corporate taxes with flat tax rates of 9 percent -- a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent national sales tax and a 9 percent corporate tax. Cain’s opponents focused on the proposed new sales tax. "We're not going to give the federal government, Nancy Pelosi, a new pipeline, a 9 percent sales tax for consumers to get hammered by the federal government," said Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania. "How many people believe that we'll keep the income tax at 9 percent? Anybody?" Cain’s plan seems to have struck a chord with some voters because it appears easy to understand, particularly compared with the current tax code and its mish-mash of different rates, deductions, credits and loopholes. But would voters be better off? The day after the debate, Cain was grilled by NBC’s Chuck Todd, who wanted to know how the plan would affect working people. Todd quoted an analysis by economist Bruce Bartlett that said, "At a minimum, the Cain plan is a distributional monstrosity. The poor would pay more while the rich would have their taxes cut." "First of all, the fact that I got attacked so much and my plan got attacked so much last night, that's a good thing," Cain said. "Because it gives me an opportunity to correct some of those misperceptions. "For example, here's what a lot of people missed, including Bruce Bartlett. ...Start with the 9-9-9 and the fact that every worker pays 15.3 percent payroll tax. Now they're going to pay 9 percent, okay? That's a 6 percentage point difference. The 9-9-9 plan replaces payroll tax, capital gains tax, corporate income tax, personal income tax and the death tax. So, five taxes we replace with those three. We start with throwing out the current tax code." Cain is suggesting that the new national sales tax would be a smaller percentage than today’s payroll taxes. But the 15.3-percent number he mentioned didn’t sound quite right to us, so we decided to check it out. What we found is that Cain is counting both worker and employer contributions to payroll taxes to arrive at the 15.3 percent number. First, here’s a quick primer on how payroll taxes work: If you work for an employer, the employer deducts payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and then sends the money on to the federal government. The taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. That’s a total of 7.65 percent in payroll taxes for workers making less than $106,800. But the employer also has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. That means total payroll taxes for each worker reach 15.3 percent, the number Cain mentioned. So most workers see only about half the amount Cain mentioned deducted from their paychecks. (And for every tax rule now in place, it seems like there are exceptions. The exception in this case is on the self-employed. They are required to pay the worker’s share of payroll taxes and the employer share. So that group would be paying the 15.3 percent Cain mentioned.) Also in Cain’s defense, many economists believe that if the government were to end payroll taxes, it would mean higher pay for workers -- maybe not immediately, but at least over the long run, because it’s part of the cost of labor. Still, there’s no rule or law that would require employers to give workers a raise equal to the employer's share of payroll taxes previously paid to the government. The taxes paid now are not considered part of workers’ wages in any formal or legal sense. We have to add one other note of explanation that’s particular to the current economic downturn. In 2010, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most workers are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. That means the current overall number isn’t 15.3 percent, but 13.3 percent. One final note on the 9-9-9 plan itself: In our review of the commentary on Cain’s tax plan, we saw that economic analysts have said the Cain campaign needs to release more detailed information on the plan so that it can be properly modeled, to find out how much revenue it would generate and how it would affect taxpayers of different income levels. Cain said in the interview with Todd that he intended to release more information on the plan soon. Our ruling Cain said, "Every worker pays 15.3 percent payroll tax." That's not accurate. Workers only pay half that, with the exception of the self-employed, as we mentioned above. The worker contribution is normally 7.65 percent, and thanks to the payroll tax rollback of 2010, the number this year is 5.65 percent. You can reach that number only by including the half of the tax that employers pay. Some economists say that if the employers’ half of payroll taxes were ended, workers would see a proportional rise in wages over the long run. But whatever the case, Cain was talking about the reality today. Workers don't pay a 15.3 percent payroll tax, so we rate Cain's statement Mostly False.

pomt-10365	"I didn't say" it doesn't really matter whether Gore or Bush is president.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/30/ralph-nader/nader-almost-said-gore-bush-but-not-quite/	In a recent radio interview , newscaster Amy Goodman challenged Ralph Nader for saying in 2000 that it didn't matter whether Gore or Bush won. Nader denied saying that, which immediately raised our interest here at PolitiFact. We could've sworn we remembered Nader repeatedly saying there was no difference between the two. In fact, we thought it was a central theme of his 2000 campaign. Here's the full exchange, from the June 18 broadcast of Democracy Now!: Goodman: "Ralph Nader, you said in 2000 it doesn't really matter whether Gore or Bush is president. Do you feel that way today?" Nader: "I didn't say that. I said the similarities between Bush and Gore tower over the dwindling real differences that they're willing to argue over." We scoured hundreds of news reports from 2000 looking for an instance of Nader saying Gore and Bush were the same, or that it didn't matter which was elected, or any equivalent phrase. We didn't find those words, but we did find many instances of supporters, opponents, reporters and commentators characterizing Nader's position in those terms. For example, in a New York Times opinion piece in August, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote: "While I admire Mr. Nader's high-minded ideals, his suggestion that there is no difference between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush is irresponsible." Nader took exception to this paraphrase of his position, as he did from time to time throughout the campaign. "I have indicated that there are 'few major differences' between the two parties," Nader responded in a letter to the Times, "not that there is 'no difference between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush,' as Mr. Kennedy wrote." There's a reason Kennedy and so many other observers were left with this impression. Again and again throughout the campaign, Nader implied that he thought Bush and Gore equally objectionable. "It doesn't matter who is in the White House, Gore or Bush, for the vast majority of government departments and agencies," Nader said in a news conference in September 2000. "The only difference between Al Gore and George W. Bush is the velocity with which their knees hit the floor when corporations knock on their door," he told supporters in California a month later. "It's a Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum vote," Nader said in Philadelphia four days before the election, repeating a favorite refrain of his. "Both parties are selling our government to big business paymasters. ...That's a pretty serious similarity." Nader also failed to challenge Sam Donaldson on ABC's This Week when Donaldson said, "You don't think it matters. You've said it doesn't matter to you who is the president of the United States, Bush or Gore." Nader replied, "Because it's the permanent corporate government that's running the show here ... you can see they're morphing more and more on more and more issues into one corporate party." A few other news reports quoted Nader saying outright that it didn't matter whether Gore and Bush got elected, but these reports didn't provide enough context for us to feel comfortable pinning the sentiment on Nader. For example, here's a line from a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette piece on Oct. 26, 2000: "In comments as hostile to Gore as to Bush, Nader said it 'doesn't matter' which of them wins because both parties are mired in 'decay.' " Maybe he said that, but without a fuller quote, we have to allow for the possibility that he stopped just short of saying it, as he did in most of his campaign appearances. So no, Nader never explicitly said "it doesn't really matter whether Gore or Bush is president." But his talk of "Republicrats," "Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum," and "one corporate party" left many people — friend, foe and impartial observer alike — with the impression that that's what he believed.

pomt-12023	"Long gas lines forming in North Korea."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/19/donald-trump/are-gas-lines-forming-north-korea/	As North Korea continues to try the West’s patience with a series of nuclear and missile tests, President Donald Trump is touting the success of tightening sanctions against the rogue nation. Referring to a conversation he had with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, Trump tweeted on Sept. 17, "I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!" Is it true that there are "long gas lines forming in North Korea"? We checked with several experts and reviewed the fragmentary news reporting out of Pyongyang. Gasoline supplies do seem to be short in North Korea these days, and the White House provided one article that cited long lines in April. But the unusual nature of the country’s top-down system of control and its minimal levels of car ownership suggest the idea of "long gas lines" is exaggerated. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What’s the evidence? The White House told us that the remark referred to the sanctions package against North Korea approved by the United Nations on Sept. 11 that, in part, "reduces about 30 percent of oil provided to North Korea by cutting off over 55 percent of refined petroleum products." It’s unclear whether these particular sanctions could have acted quickly enough to show up on North Korean streets within a week. But they did provide one article citing long gas lines in North Korea, well before the most recent round of sanctions. It was an Associated Press dispatch from April that said in the wake of the initial gas shortage, "lines at other stations were much longer than usual and prices appeared to be rising significantly." There is strong evidence that North Korea has been facing gasoline shortages this year. NKNews, an independent news outlet with operations in Seoul, London and Washington, reported that petroleum and diesel prices are "far higher than usual" in North Korea this year. The April price spike began amid "rumors" that China had been considering a halt of all crude oil sales, NKNews reported. The publication also reported that the government in September imposed "new restrictions against customers filling up jerry cans to buy extra supplies, while a number of gas stations were reported as being closed in the city." All told, gas prices have more than doubled this year, data from NKNews shows. That said, more recent coverage suggests that lines at gas stations aren’t widespread. The NKNews article cautioned in its headline, " ‘Long gas lines’ not forming in North Korean capital, sources say." The Washington Post concurred, writing that Trump’s long gas lines claim "has residents puzzled." So how can gasoline be in short supply in North Korea without many signs of lines forming at the pump? To explain, let’s take a look at the hermit kingdom’s unusual relationship with the automobile. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com A "traffic lady" in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 2008. (Wikimedia commons) Cars in North Korea Personal automobiles in North Korea are rare. They are primarily for government or military use, or by the very richest members of the elite. Private citizens typically can’t own cars unless they have government ties. "You are more likely to know somebody with a private jet than a North Korean is to know somebody with a car," Car and Driver magazine wrote in 2010 There is some anecdotal evidence that the number of cars in North Korea has risen in recent years, possibly due to a spike in the registration of privately purchased vehicles under the name of state enterprises, according to the publication DailyNK. But car ownership rates remain low in comparison to most countries. The combination of legal obstacles and high costs put cars out of the reach of ordinary North Koreans, who live in one of the world’s poorest nations. So, despite the increase in automobile use, the Associated Press reported from the capital of Pyongyang in December 2015 that "it’s unusual to have more than a dozen or so cars waiting behind a red light at any time of day, in any part of the city. At night, the roads remain virtually empty." The size of the vehicle fleet in Pyongyang is so modest that it’s easy to spot examples from a 1974 purchase of Volvo 144 sedans that are still puttering around the city. (North Korea never ended up paying for them, and Sweden is reportedly still tabulating interest on the purchase in the vain hope that the debt will be settled one day.) See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com A billboard for Pyonghwa Motors in a Pyongyang park in 2007. The ad shows a Pyeonghwa Hwiparam, the North Korean version of the Fiat Siena. (Wikimedia commons) Not that North Korean drivers would have many places to go if they did have access to cars. By land area, North Korea is about 20 percent bigger than South Korea, yet it has less than 1 percent of South Korea’s paved-road mileage. Even adding in unpaved roads, the North has only 26 percent of the road mileage that the South has. "Public transport in the major cities is done by electrically driven buses, and many trucks in the countryside are converted to wood burning," said Erik van Ingen Schenau of the China Motor Vehicle Documentation Center in France. "Outside Pyongyang, people have no cars, and the cars in Pyongyang are (driven by) the upper class, except for some taxis and government vehicles." Because of this, gas lines in North Korea mean something different than ones in the United States. "They indicate not enough supply for non-regime elite ‘luxury’ use," said Joseph DeThomas, a former ambassador who now teaches at Penn State’s School of International Affairs. "It is not meaningless, but it may be less meaningful than would shortages of diesel for ground transport, kerosene for heat and air transport, and heavy fuel oil for power generation, industry and other similar needs." See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump referred to "long gas lines forming in North Korea." North Korea does appear to be facing a gasoline crunch, with prices rising in recent months. But experts we contacted, along with media reports that appeared in response to Trump’s tweet, uncovered little evidence of lines at the pump, likely because the North Korean government exerts such control over gasoline and automobiles that the impact of such shortages are far narrower than they would be in the United States.

pomt-13695	Says "Donald Trump has defended" World War II internment camps.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/29/joaquin-castro/joaquin-castro-says-donald-trump-defended-world-wa/	U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, used his speech on the final night of the Democratic National Convention to share the story of his grandmother, an immigrant from Mexico. His grandmother didn’t always feel welcome in the United States, he said, but she believed her sacrifices would pay off with opportunity for herself and her family — much like immigrants from other countries. "This room is filled with many proud Americans who can tell similar stories about their own families. Great-grandchildren of Irish immigrants who came to cities like New York and Boston and saw signs that read 'No Irish Need Apply' and just worked harder," Castro said. "Grandchildren of Americans who suffered in World War II internment camps — the same camps that Donald Trump has defended — and grew up to be business owners, war heroes, and public servants. Children of immigrants who have contributed to our country as doctors, police officers, and — guess what — even impartial judges." Castro’s jab at Trump caught our attention. Did he really defend internment camps during World War II? Trump did not explicitly defend the internment camps. But he made a lot of people think along those lines by not outright condemning the World War II detention of Japanese Americans during multiple interviews. Trump has said he needed to be there to truly say. We reached out to Castro’s team for more information on that statement, but did not hear back. Trump’s campaign also did not respond by deadline. ‘Racial prejudice, wartime hysteria’ Amid fears about national security after the Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued several executive orders, including Executive Order 9066. The order was to remove people of Japanese ancestry (citizens and immigrants) outside the Pacific military zone. About 120,000 people (including many who were native-born U.S. citizens) were placed in internment camps. Some were detained for up to four years in remote camps surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. The United States did not formally apologize for the internment camps until 1988, when President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act, which said the World War II actions toward Japanese Americans "were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership." "The experience of mass imprisonment devastated the Japanese American community," said Eric L. Muller, Dan K. Moore Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, who has written books about Japanese Americans during World War II. "The financial losses were vast. Families were torn apart both emotionally and physically," Muller said by email. "A stigma and shame attached to the community that it took decades to shake." Trump’s comments on internment camps Seventy-four years to the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, Trump made his first call to ban Muslims from entering the country. "Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on," his statement read, citing (shaky) research that "there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population." This idea was, and has continued to be, very controversial. Asked about the ban the next day on Good Morning America, Trump defended his proposal by comparing it to the actions of Roosevelt, "one of the most highly respected presidents." "What I'm doing is no different than FDR," Trump said. ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, "I take it you are praising the setting up of internment camps for Japanese during world War II?" Trump repeated, "No, I’m not." A similar back and forth occurred on MSNBC that morning when host Joe Scarborough asked Trump, "You certainly aren't proposing internment camps, are you?" "I am not proposing that," Trump said. "It was tough stuff, but it wasn't internment. We're not talking about the Japanese internment camps. No, not at all. But we have to get our head around a very serious problem, and it's getting worse." Also on Dec. 8, Time magazine reported that Trump had waffled on internment camps in a recent interview. Trump told Time that he "would have had to be there at the time" to give a proper answer on whether he would have supported or opposed the internment of Japanese Americans. "I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer," Trump told Time. He continued to tell the magazine that wartime sometimes requires tough decisions. A week later, the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, Calif., issued a statement cautioning against provocative rhetoric deliberately provoking fear "of any one group." "To cite the unlawful incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II as an appropriate action and one that could be emulated today is to completely misunderstand that shameful chapter of history," the museum said. On March 27, ABC’s Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would "rule out" the idea of internment camps for American Muslims, noting that Trump had not proposed internment camps. "I would rule it out, but we would have to be very vigilant," Trump said. "We're going to have to be very smart. We're going to have to be very rigid and very vigilant. And if we're not very, very strong and very, very smart, we have a big, big problem coming up." Since announcing the Muslim ban in December, Trump has slightly shifted his position, telling the Wall Street Journal in June that instead he would temporarily suspend immigration from "regions that have been a major source for terrorists and their supporters." Our ruling Castro said Trump has defended World War II internment camps. Trump likened his proposed Muslim ban to how Roosevelt handled World War II. When pressed by journalists if he supported the internment camps for Japanese Americans under Roosevelt’s order, Trump said he was not praising that exactly. In another interview, Trump said he hates the "concept" of internment camps, but "would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer" on whether he supported or opposed Roosevelt’s action. So Trump’s comments are not as specific as Castro claims, but Trump never mounted an affirmative defense. Sometimes he declined to defend them, other times he has said he would have had to be present when the internment camps were in use.

pomt-10204	"Through competition as governor, I got agreements to build a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/15/sarah-palin/there-is-no-agreement-to-build-and-its-not-40-bil/	In her early campaign appearances, Gov. Sarah Palin has repeatedly boasted about her role in advocating a new natural gas pipeline in Alaska. And she has not always stuck to the truth, as we explain in a story here . This is her at a campaign appearance in Fairfax, Va., on Sept. 10, 2008: "I'm ready to join John McCain in Washington so we can end the corrupt practices of the abuse of earmarks once and for all. We'll do that. Through competition as governor, I got agreements to build a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline. That's going to help all of you." A commitment to build new natural gas pipeline from Alaska's remote but resource-rich North Slope would indeed be quite an accomplishment. Alaskans have been seeking it for some three decades. As Palin campaigned for governor, she sharply criticized her predecessor's plan to have major oil companies build the pipeline. After she was elected governor, she sought competing proposals. In August 2008, the Legislature accepted one from TransCanada Corp., a Calgary-based company. Under a plan Palin spearheaded, TransCanada will get $500-million in state funds to design and seek approvals for the pipeline. But they are not obligated to build it. Financing and approvals are far from certain, and the company can back out even if those contingencies come through. Several experts we spoke to were skeptical that TransCanada's plan would come to fruition. "I'll believe it when I see it," said Sarah Ladislaw, a fellow specializing in Western Hemispheric energy issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Palin has repeatedly mischaracterized the agreement with TransCanada. In a news conference in Alaska on Aug. 1, 2008, she said the state never before had "commitments to build this line. Now we do." In its news story the next day, the Anchorage Daily News wrote: "That's incorrect. TransCanada has not promised to actually build the gas line, one of the state's grandest and most frustrated economic development dreams. The state license ... is not a construction contract and does not guarantee a pipeline will be built. Rather, it's an exclusive deal under which the state will provide up to $500-million plus other incentives, such as a coordinator to speed up permits, in exchange for TransCanada doing its best to secure the customers, financing, and U.S. and Canadian regulatory clearances." Palin also frequently says the pipeline would cost "nearly $40-billion," as she did in this claim. We're not sure where she got that figure — neither her office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign returned our calls to tell us. TransCanada estimates the cost at $26-billion. Yes, there could be cost overruns. But experts were skeptical the price could reach Palin's estimate. Palin's accomplishment sounds impressive in her words — far more than it actually is. The agreement she reached — with the help of the Alaska State Legislature — is not a commitment to build, but rather a commitment to begin planning the massive project. Palin's claim suggests that construction is assured, but that's just not true. And if it were, it wouldn't be a $40-billion pipeline. Those are two significant flaws in this claim Palin makes repeatedly. Still, there is a new agreement that was forged with Palin as governor, so we rate her boast as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01934	"Under Governor Crist, 3,000 teachers laid off."	/florida/statements/2014/jun/26/rick-scott/scott-ad-blames-crist-3000-teachers-laid/	Former Gov. Charlie Crist often tells voters that he saved thousands of teachers’ jobs when he accepted federal stimulus dollars during the recession. But Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s political committee, Let’s Get to Work, slams Crist for the loss of thousands of teacher jobs in a TV ad. Here is part of the script: "Governor Crist cut education by $300 million. Under Governor Crist, 3,000 teachers laid off," says the narrator, as text on the screen cites the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "Governor Crist allowed college tuition to go up 15 percent every year. Our schools and students paid the price." Here, we will fact-check if 3,000 teachers were laid off under Crist and if he was to blame. The ad launched in the Orlando, Tampa and West Palm markets starting June 24. (We’ve already fact-checked claims about the 15 percent college tuition differential.) Spoiler alert: State data shows the number of teachers statewide dropped between the 2007-08 and 2008-09 school years by a number slightly larger than what the ad reports. But determining how many were laid off is tricky, and if the Republicans want to blame Crist, then they should also blame the Republican-dominated Legislature that signed off on the cuts amid a recession. How Florida cut education during the recession In the years leading up to Charlie Crist winning the governor’s race in 2006, the Florida economy was booming, pushing up funding for education. The K-12 budget when Crist took office was nearly $18 billion, including state and local dollars. But in 2007, Florida’s tax collections sagged as the economy crumbled. The Legislature held a special session in September to determine how to fill a $1.1 billion hole in a $71 billion state budget. Education and health care, two of the largest expenses ended up taking huge hits. Crist promised if voters approved a property tax cut in January 2008, it wouldn’t diminish school funding. He proposed a budget plan that called for a $1 billion increase in funding. But in 2008, the state continued to suffer from a recession that led to more cuts. Republican leaders rejected Crist’s call to expand Lottery games and a property tax hike to pay for schools. "No Tax Increases," declared a sign on the House floor as lawmakers debated the final budget bill in 2008. By the end of the session, lawmakers cut K-12 by more than $300 million. Democrats, the minority party in Tallahassee, and the teachers’ union opposed the cuts. "We all want to do more," said Crist, a Republican at the time, at the end of the session. "You just do the best you can." Amid shortfalls, the Legislature continued to slash the budget in 2009. But then the state got some help from the feds. In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the $787 billion federal stimulus bill that saved jobs for teachers and other government workers nationwide. Crist proudly touts his support for the stimulus -- saying that he stopped "the layoffs of some 20,000 school teachers during the global economic meltdown." Without stimulus dollars, there could have been massive teacher layoffs, though it’s difficult to pinpoint the precise number. State data indicated that about 19,000 full-time equivalent jobs for instructional personnel were saved by the stimulus. Crist was a big-time cheerleader for the stimulus (literally embracing President Barack Obama over it) but the main credit for passing it goes to Obama and Congress. We rated Crist’s claim that he stopped 20,000 teacher layoffs Half True. Republicans cite report for teacher layoff numbers The ad attacking Crist for 3,000 teacher layoffs relies on a September 2009 report by the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research that tallied jobs shed from state and local governments during the recession. The report includes a list that shows the lost teacher jobs in Florida added up to about 3,700. Here’s the problem with the way the ad uses that report: it doesn’t explain that it was based on news articles about layoffs or potential layoffs. The report explains that caveat clearly: "This list shows press accounts of government planned job cuts. In some cases, the cuts may not have actually been implemented because of subsequent budget adjustments. Also, the job losses may have been met through attrition rather than actual layoffs." For example, one article cited in the report stated that Miami-Dade, the state’s largest district, "cut nearly 1,000 teaching positions." But the Miami Herald reported that many teachers were moved into other jobs, and a district spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that no teacher was laid off. Broward initially cut about 400 teachers, but rehired about 75 percent of them. While Marion County announced it would cut about 500 workers, the stimulus "saved us from having to lay a single person off in 2008 or 2009," a school district spokesman told PolitiFact Florida. Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties -- none of which were cited in the report -- didn’t lay off any teachers. (The report only cited about 15 percent of Florida’s school districts.) State data doesn’t show reasons for teacher declines School districts report to the state Department of Education the number of teachers they have each year. That data showed 3,282 fewer teachers in the fall of 2008 compared to 2007 -- about a 2 percent decline. There was a smaller drop the next year. It’s fair to assume that some of those declines were due to layoffs, but the districts don’t tell the state how many of the declines were due to layoffs or other reasons such as teachers who retired, quit or were fired. "There were some layoffs during the steep downhill dive of the state economy, but there was a strong effort in school districts to avoid teacher layoffs," said Ruth Haseman Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association. In some districts that meant other support workers -- such as custodians or bus drivers -- absorbed the bulk of the layoffs, she said. Our ruling A TV ad by Scott’s political committee says that under Crist, 3,000 teachers were laid off. The ad omits some key points. The number was derived from media reports about possible layoffs, not all were actual layoffs. Also, Crist accepted federal stimulus money that preserved thousands of teacher jobs. Finally, Crist was not solely responsible for teacher layoffs. Crist and the Republican-led Legislature signed off on budget cuts amid a national recession -- and no single politician is responsible for that economic meltdown. Clearly, some teachers were laid off statewide, but the ad lacks evidence that it amounted to 3,000 positions. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-02340	Says he "forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/24/mark-begich/mark-begich-ad-says-he-forced-dc-open-arctic-oil-d/	As a Democratic senator from Alaska -- a state that President Barack Obama lost by 14 points in 2012 -- it’s been in Mark Begich’s best interest to distance himself from many of the president’s policies as the midterm elections approach. But there’s one topic where Begich has been touting his ability to influence Obama -- oil drilling, a crucial issue for Alaskans, whose economy is heavily dependent on oil production. In Begich’s latest statewide TV ad, the narrator -- Begich’s wife, Deborah Bonito -- highlights his commitment to fighting for Alaskan issues, including drilling. ‘There’s nowhere he won’t go to listen and stand up for Alaskans," the ad says. "He forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling." We thought we’d take a closer look at Begich’s involvement in the Alaska Arctic drilling. When Royal Dutch Shell started fighting to drill in the Arctic, Begich wasn’t yet in office. By February 2008, Royal Dutch Shell held leases to drill in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, portions of the Arctic Ocean near the Alaskan mainland. No one had drilled there for two decades. But lease-holding companies can’t drill without first clearing a number of other procedural hurdles. Once it had sold Shell leases, the government still needed to grant dozens of technical approvals, including exploration plans, water permits and air permits. That’s where Begich, the only Democrat elected statewide, came in. After getting elected in November 2008, he made his priorities known to the White House. The New York Times reported that when Begich and Obama first met in 2008, Begich said of oil drilling issues, "If I’m elected, this is what I’m going to focus on." Begich -- a Democrat working with a Democratic administration -- may have had more sway than his colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in pushing along the permitting process. Peter Van Tuyn, whose law firm Bessenyey and Van Tuyn LLC has fought against oil drilling in the Alaskan Arctic, agrees that Begich has had a key role on the issue. "His biggest influence has been picking up the phone or having those people into his office or in hearings and saying ‘Dammit, we need to get this done,’ " Van Tuyn said. Begich told the Times that "any time (Obama) initiated a call, I felt that was carte blanche to make my case" for Arctic drilling. As of 2012, Begich had assembled a six-page chronology of contact on oil drilling between his office and the White House. Eventually, in September 2012, Shell began drilling in the Chukchi Sea. However, it didn’t go according to plan. After spending $5 billion on the project, Shell wasn’t able to fully drill any wells that season. In March 2013, an Interior Department report found that Shell had violated permits, didn’t test certain systems in advance and lost a drilling rig. After that, Shell said it still planned to drill during the summer of 2014. But the company backed out in January after a court sided with environmental groups in ruling that in 2008, the federal government had underestimated how much oil drilling would happen when awarding the lease. This ruling didn’t block all drilling, but it did put more legal obstacles in Shell’s way. The administration could choose to appeal the decision, which only directly affects one lease sale, not all Arctic lease sales. Shell’s CEO said there was too much uncertainty to move forward with drilling in 2014. Other companies have leases to drill in the area as well, but experts told us they’ve hung back and waited to see how Shell does. So, in 2014, no companies are drilling in the Alaska Arctic, despite the efforts of Begich and others. Our ruling Begich’s ad claimed that "he forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling." Begich wasn’t in the Senate when the government awarded leases to Shell, but the leases were only the first step toward drilling in the Arctic Ocean. Numerous other federal permits were required before Shell could drill there, and by multiple accounts, Begich played a key role in pushing the administration from the time he began serving in the Senate. Shell did drill in 2012 -- the first activity in that region of the Arctic in decades -- though after complications arose, including legal ones, the company hasn’t done so again. So Begich can rightfully take credit for helping advancing Shell’s oil-drilling permits in the Arctic Ocean, but there’s currently no drilling taking place. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12107	"Rosa Parks’ daughter praises (President Donald) Trump’s response to Charlottesville."	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/23/blog-posting/fake-news-rosa-parks-had-no-daughter-could-praise-/	A fake news story that said civil rights icon Rosa Parks’ daughter lauded President Donald Trump’s comments on clashes in Charlottesville, Va., was easily identifiable as fake news, because Parks didn’t have any children. The headline on an Aug. 20, 2017, post on ForFreedomWorld.com read, "Breaking: Rosa Parks’ daughter praises Trump’s response to Charlottesville." The story was posted a week after Aug. 12 clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters over efforts to take down Confederate monuments. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake story is obviously designed to shock readers that the child of a civil rights hero like Parks could embrace controversial comments by Trump, who had called the violence in Charlottesville a result of "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides." The post quoted someone named Muriel Parks-Rosenberg speaking at an event at the Kennedy Center. "President Trump’s reaction has been criticized by the Left, but I don’t see what he did wrong," she is quoted as saying. "He strongly spoke out against hate both from those who make racial animus their primary cause and anarchists who showed up hoping to watch the world burn." "My mother would have been proud of the President’s words," she allegedly told the crowd. "Liberals who seek to use this rally to further their cause and attack President Trump need to go away and never come back. To me, Donald Trump is a modern civil rights icon." Parks is credited as helping spark the civil rights movement after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955. Parks died in 2005 at age 92. But she didn’t have a daughter who spoke in support of Trump, because Parks never had any children. The photo with the story is actually of Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner. The story was originally posted on Aug. 19 on OurLandOfTheFree.com, a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we’ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories. OurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site’s creators "make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not." Its About Us page noted, "All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not." Stories from sites like OurLandOfTheFree.com often are shared on other outlets, with no indication they are made up. Notably, the Republican Party of Virginia was fooled by this story. A volunteer for the group posted the original link on the party’s Facebook page, but it was eventually removed. This claim came from a website that fabricates all of its content.

pomt-03089	"According to the Congressional Budget Office, repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit."	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/sep/25/carol-shea-porter/carol-shea-porter-says-repealing-obamacare-would-i/	Since the health care law proposed by President Barack Obama passed in 2010, Republicans have made it a top priority to dismantle the program. The latest attempt involves a House spending bill, which would keep the federal government running through mid-December, but also strip all funding for the Affordable Care Act. Obama has already threatened to veto the bill, but as the proposal was being debated, U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, was quick to denounce it. When it came up for a vote on Sept. 20, 2013, Shea-Porter joined nearly every other member of her party in voting against the resolution, which passed the House, 230-189. In a written statement, Shea-Porter called the resolution (H.J.Res.59) an "irresponsible political ploy," and said repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit. She cited information from the Congressional Budget Office, which provides nonpartisan analysis of the federal budget and the economy to Congress. "I agree with most Americans that we should keep the government open, but Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are threatening to shut it down unless Congress defunds the Affordable Care Act, a law that was passed by Congress, signed by the President, and upheld by the Supreme Court," Shea-Porter said in the statement. In addition to risking a government shutdown, she added, "according to the Congressional Budget Office, repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit." We wondered if her claim was true, so we checked the CBO’s published research. We found that the CBO has been asked to estimate the cost of repealing Obamacare twice previously. First, in July 2012, CBO projected that repealing the new health reform law would increase the deficit by an estimated $109 billion over a decade. CBO was asked to study repealing Obamacare a second time in May 2013. The office determined it didn't have enough time to do a full study, and referred Congress to its earlier projections from 2012. A closer look at the CBO’s research shows that repealing Obamacare would increase the deficit because the net savings from eliminating new insurance mandates would be offset by spending increases and revenue reductions. Here’s a broad look at the CBO’s calculations: • The health care law expands health insurance coverage, but not without increasing some costs for the federal government. The law provides subsidies for some people who buy health insurance through new exchanges. It also increases spending on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and establishes tax credits for certain small employers. Repealing the new coverage provisions would yield a net savings of $1,171 billion over 10 years. • The new health care law would also bring in new revenue, mostly by increasing a payroll tax for Medicare hospital insurance and extending it to net investment income for high-income taxpayers. The law also imposes new excise taxes on some equipment manufacturers. Repealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over 10 years. • CBO has also calculated that the Affordable Care Act would produce major savings in health care costs, primarily through reductions in Medicare spending. Repealing those efforts would increase direct spending by an estimated $711 billion over 10 years. We should note a few caveats, however. First, the CBO acknowledges those projections are only estimates, since it’s still highly uncertain what the effects of the Affordable Care Act will be. Second, the CBO analysis referenced above was based on a 2012 proposal to repeal Obamacare. In her press release, Shea-Porter blurs the difference between defunding and repealing Obamacare -- two approaches that sound similar but actually are somewhat different. Unlike a repeal of the law -- that is, completely striking it from existence -- defunding it would leave all of the provisions in place. Because defunding is a more complicated proposal to analyze than a simple repeal, the CBO did not do a full analysis of the defunding proposal. So the most recent numerical CBO estimate of the impact on the budget deficit is one based on a prior proposal to repeal the law, not the more recent proposal to defund it. Our ruling Shea-Porter said that, "according to the Congressional Budget Office, repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit." She phrased her press release carefully -- she said "repealing" the law would increase the deficit. The CBO did indeed make that projection more than a year ago. However, it’s worth noting that her release targeted a different legislative approach -- defunding Obamacare, rather than repealing it -- and that’s an approach about which the CBO has not yet passed judgment. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05227	"District 22 includes about 80% of the district I have represented since 2010. District 20 includes about 20% of the area I have represented since 2010."	/florida/statements/2012/jun/06/jack-latvala/new-pinellas-redistricting-maps-trip-jack-latvala/	Sen. Jack Latvala wants to be president of the state Senate in a few years. To do it, the Clearwater resident needs the support of two kinds of people: a majority of his Republican colleagues and a lot of new voters in his re-election bid. Latvala, who returned to the Senate in 2010, tried to explain to his constituents just how many new voters he would face in two "sensible-looking" Pinellas County-dominated districts drawn by the Legislature during the redistricting process. "District 22 includes about 80% of the district I have represented since 2010," he wrote in a June 2012 newsletter to constituents. "District 20 includes about 20% of the area I have represented since 2010 as well as much of the area in North Pinellas County that I represented in the Florida Senate from 1994 to 2002." Latvala decided on June 6, 2012, to enter the District 20 race. A reader asked us to review his comments from the newsletter. We decided a graphic -- a first for PolitiFact -- could do most of the talking. Latvala’s current District 16 sprawls across Tampa Bay and includes the west coast of Tampa, the northwest corner of Hillsborough County and the eastern half of Pinellas County. In all, 431,916 residents live there, according to our analysis of Senate redistricting data. This year, the Legislature operated under new voter-approved restrictions to draw districts that are compact and more in line with county boundaries. So lawmakers divided District 16 into four new districts around Tampa Bay -- 17, 19, 20 and 22. About 277,692 of those District 16 residents, or 64 percent, are now in District 22, which covers central Pinellas County, the southern Pinellas beaches and hops the bay to encompass south Tampa. It’s not 80 percent, as Latvala claimed. About 19 percent of District 16 residents are now in District 20, which blankets the northern Pinellas County cities of Largo, Clearwater (where Latvala currently lives), Safety Harbor and Oldsmar. This part is in line with what he told newsletter recipients. The point Latvala was trying to make, he told us, is that he has one of the highest percentages of taking on new territory as a result of redistricting. Basically, he knew that District 20 included only 20 percent of the population of his old District 16, which is correct. But he wrongly assumed that the remaining 80 percent of his old district would be moved into new District 22. (We're talking about people here, not land area.) Latvala’s newsletter is wrong about District 22 but right about District 20. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Jack Latvala	None	None	None	2012-06-06T13:58:21	2012-06-01	['None']
pomt-02374	Says 50 percent of millennials don’t associate with "any political party."	/florida/statements/2014/mar/17/rock-vote/half-millennials-dont-associate-democrat-or-republ/	Millennials are not big fans of professing commitment, according to a recent poll. They’re not ready to declare a lifelong love for a political party (or a spouse, for that matter). In Facebook lingo, they might say "It’s complicated" or claim to be in an open relationship with political parties. "They should call us the ‘party pooper’ generation," tweeted Rock the Vote, an organization focused on increasing young registered voters, on March 11, 2014. "50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party." After hearing about the youth vote helping elect President Barack Obama, we wondered if that statistic could be correct: Do half of millennials not associate with a political party? Identification and voting aren’t the same In the tweet, Rock the Vote linked to a study released by Pew Research Center in March. Pew conducted the telephone survey of 1,821 adults nationwide in February, including 617 millennials ages 18 to 33, and analyzed previous surveys. This survey asked a variety of questions, ranging from whether they know what a "selfie" is to their thoughts on the tea party. As for millennials, Pew concluded: "They are relatively unattached to organized politics and religion, linked by social media, burdened by debt, distrustful of people, in no rush to marry — and optimistic about the future." The survey showed that 50 percent of millennials describe themselves as political independents, up from 38 percent in 2004. Meanwhile, 27 percent identify as Democrats and 17 percent as Republicans. But a follow-up question shows how they tilt: The 50 percent who self-identified as independents were then asked if they leaned more to either party. Among those 50 percent, 44 percent lean Democratic and 31 percent lean Republican. That leaves about 25 percent who either mentioned another party or say they are independents and don’t lean. When Pew included "leaners," they found that half of millennials identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, which is 16 points greater than the percentage who identify or say they lean Republican. A Democratic leaner "behaves like a Democrat, thinks like a Democrat, votes like a Democrat," John Petrocik, a University of Missouri political science professor, told PolitiFact Florida. Many voting experts told us that when stated in isolation, describing half of millennials as independents is misleading because it omits their partisan leanings and voting behavior. "A substantial proportion of self-described independents vote consistently Democratic or Republican; they just don’t like to use a party label," said Peter Levine, professor of citizenship and public affairs at Tufts. "True independents -- those who really don’t know which party they’ll support -- are few, and they tend to have low turnout." In the past, millennials have overwhelmingly voted Democratic. In 2008, 66 percent of voters age 18-29 voted for Obama -- that fell to 60 percent in 2012. Other surveys The Pew survey isn’t the only recent poll to look at millennial party identification. A 2012 survey done by American National Election Studies, a collaboration of Stanford University and the University of Michigan, divided respondents into strong and not very strong Democrats and Republicans; independents who lean Democratic or Republican; and flat out independent. Not surprisingly the number of true independents drops -- and it’s far below 50 percent for respondents ages 18-33. Strong Democrat 16.47% Not very strong Democrat 19.77% Independent-Democrat 11.81% All Democrats and leaners 48.05% Independent 16.36% Independent-Republican 11.26% Not very strong Republican 13.37% Republican 10.96% All Republicans and leaners 35.59% Partisan leanings and voting behavior, "demonstrate quite clearly that millennials are by far the most Democratic age group in the American electorate today," said Alan I. Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. Independents in Florida So what about here in Florida, where about 25 percent of the electorate is independent? In the ages 18-29 category, 40 percent were registered Democrat, 27 percent Republican and 29 percent no party affiliation as of August 2012, according to University of South Florida professor Susan MacManus. "They see themselves as neither (Democrat or Republican) but when push comes to shove, depending on the candidate, they tend to lean Democratic," MacManus told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Rock the Vote said "50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party." The group quoted a Pew study that showed half of millennials don’t self-identify with either major political party. However, that statement could create a misleading impression that their vote is up for grabs and they have no leanings, and that’s not the case. Half of millennials identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, which is 16 points greater than the percentage who identify or say they lean Republican, Pew found. Other data and polling experts suggest millennials lean decisively toward Democrats, even when they identify as independents. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03247	Says President Franklin Delano Roosevelt "felt there wasn’t a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/13/scott-walker/Did-FDR-oppose-collective-bargaining-for-governmen/	Reaction was swift and strong after Republican Gov. Scott Walker said the curbs he enacted on the collective-bargaining power of public-employee unions were philosophically in line with principles espoused by President Franklin Roosevelt, the liberal Democratic icon. Walker drew the comparison in a July 29, 2013 speech at the Governmental Research Association policy conference hosted by Milwaukee’s Public Policy Forum. The governor, whose Act 10 law wiped away most subjects of bargaining for most public unions and shifted more pension and health-care costs to workers, argued the changes helped balance government budgets and made merit more important than teacher seniority in schools. "We think it has a dynamic impact going forward on how we perform, and that is putting power in the hands of the people duly elected at the state and at the local level," Walker said. "It’s why -- some people are surprised to know this -- the position I pushed is not unlike the principle that Franklin Delano Roosevelt, not exactly a conservative, pushed as well when it came to public sector collective bargaining," Walker added. "He felt that there wasn't a need -- and others like him, (former New York Mayor Fiorello) LaGuardia and others -- felt there wasn’t a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people. We are the people." Did Roosevelt -- the patron of the post-Depression boost in organizing by industrial unions in the private sector -- really take the position that when it came to federal government employees, there "wasn’t a need" to have collective bargaining? Before we check Walker’s claim, let’s stipulate the obvious: There are dramatic differences between Walker and the architect of the New Deal, from their approaches to governing in times of economic distress to their views on the proper size and role of the state. In the labor realm, when it came to private-sector unions whose cause he championed, FDR called collective bargaining a "fundamental individual right." Walker, meanwhile, has not ruled out signing "right to work" limits on private-sector unions, though he’s not pushing it now. That’s one reason the comparison so riled Democrats and union leaders. "FDR brought us out of the Great Depression with strong investment in workers and jobs programs that worked," Wisconsin State AFL-CIO leader Phil Neuenfeldt said. "Scott Walker is drowning in a jobs deficit and to compare himself to FDR is laughably delusional." But Walker in his speech made a claim on a very specific historical point: FDR’s views on collective bargaining for public employees. And that is the claim we are examining. Where Roosevelt stood Compared to the mountain of evidence on FDR’s sympathetic stance on protections and rights for private laborers, the historical record on his attitude toward public-sector unions is less than a few inches high. Walker cites an on-point and oft-quoted FDR letter that conservatives frequently highlight when arguing for limits on unions in the government sector. That letter, we found, dominates scholarly debate over Roosevelt’s views on this issue. And it’s easy to see why: The president’s Aug. 16, 1937 correspondence with Luther C. Steward, the president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, is bluntly worded -- to say the least. Roosevelt was responding to an invitation to attend the organization’s 20th jubilee convention. In the letter, FDR says groups such as NFFE naturally organize to present their views to supervisors. Government workers, he observed, want fair pay, safe working conditions and review of grievances just like private-industry workers. Organizations of government employees "have a logical place in Government affairs," he wrote. But Roosevelt then shifted gears, emphasizing that "meticulous attention should be paid to the special relationships and obligations of public servants to the public itself and to the Government." Then, the most-famous line and the one directly on point to Walker’s comment: "All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service," he wrote. "It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management." Roosevelt didn’t stop there. "The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations," he wrote. When Walker claimed FDR said "the government is the people," he had Roosevelt’s next line in mind. "The employer," Roosevelt’s letter added, "is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters." Roosevelt concluded with a strong stance against strikes by unions representing government workers, noting that NFFE’s bylaws rejected strikes. The letter, the FDR Presidential Library site points out, was released publicly by the Roosevelt White House and became the administration's "official position" on collective bargaining and federal government employees. Roosevelt had previously laid out his views on public-sector unions at a July 9, 1937 news conference. His statements there add more weight to Walker’s claim. A reporter directly asked Roosevelt "whether he favored government employees joining unions to the extent of collective bargaining with the government." Roosevelt’s response made clear he thought managers should listen to worker concerns, whether raised by union representatives or not. Federal workers are free to join "any union they want," he said. But he recalled that in 1913, when he was Navy assistant secretary, he told a union official the Navy would not enter into a contract with the union because it had no discretion under federal law. "The pay is fixed by Congress and the workmen are represented by the members of Congress in the fixing of Government pay," Roosevelt said. His thinking then still applied, Roosevelt told the reporters in 1937. At the end of news conference, Roosevelt was asked, after making the point that Congress sets compensation: "In other words, you would not have the representatives of the majority as the sole bargaining agents?" Roosevelt: "Not in the government, because there is no collective contract. It is a very different case. There isn’t any bargaining, in other words, with the government, therefore the question does not arise." Taken together, the letter and news conference remarks positioned Roosevelt as deeply skeptical of the need and wisdom of collective bargaining power for unions in the federal system. When he wrote that the unique circumstances would make it "impossible" for government officials to make a binding deal on behalf of the government, that didn’t leave a lot of ambiguity. Same with the phrase "insurmountable limitations." What the scholars say Perhaps because of the strong wording of his views, the 1937 letter remains -- nearly 75 years later -- the best piece of evidence on this topic. Even scholars and union officials who chafe at Walker linking himself to FDR have acknowledged the letter’s significance. "Roosevelt absolutely did not favor collective bargaining for federal workers and especially did not favor the right to strike," public-sector labor scholar Joseph McCartin told Salon.com shortly after Walker’s dramatic action in 2011. And the current head of the National Federation of Federal Employees says Roosevelt’s words meant he "believed that there should be no right to federal bargaining over wages and benefits." The union chief, William Dougan, told us Roosevelt feared that dealing with multiple unions could lead to pay disparities. To be sure, Roosevelt’s views were in part a product of his time. At the time, government unions had no collective bargaining rights, and it was not uncommon for elected officials to stand against union bargaining rights for government employees. Even in the private-sector, labor rights were still developing, their constitutionality still under debate in the courts. The notion of expanding those powers to the government sector had not yet taken hold -- and it would not under FDR. It wasn’t until 1962 that President John F. Kennedy’s executive order allowed bargaining, and then just over working conditions. Federal unions still cannot bargain over pay and benefits. Still, there are prominent scholarly voices who think Roosevelt’s 1937 letter has been misinterpreted, at least in part. One such voice is McCartin, the Georgetown University history professor who told Salon that "Roosevelt absolutely did not favor collective bargaining for federal workers and especially did not favor the right to strike." When we asked McCartin about that interview, he said he had spoken prematurely. He and other historians note that Roosevelt wrote that collective bargaining, "as usually understood," cannot be transplanted into the public service. Historians and union officials have parsed the phrase for decades, debating its meaning, and sometimes disagreeing with each other. The phrase, some say, leaves open the possibility that Roosevelt supported a modified form of collective bargaining, different from what private workers had created. They note that in the letter, Roosevelt directed his opposition most specifically at the right to strike. Dougan, the union official, believes Roosevelt appeared open to bargaining over working conditions. Several scholars emphasize that Roosevelt later praised a union contract negotiated between the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority and unions representing workers for the electric utility created by the federal government in 1933. The TVA’s board, appointed by Roosevelt, chose as a matter of policy to recognize the unions and bargain with them. The TVA Act signed by Roosevelt did not direct or discourage such bargaining. The TVA episode is "the only effective rebuttal" offered to the words in FDR’s letter, wrote Wilson R. Hart, a longtime labor relations adviser in the federal government who examined Roosevelt’s thinking on unions. Hart felt that the apparent contradiction between FDR’s TVA comments and his 1937 letter strongly suggested that Roosevelt was not denouncing all elements of collective bargaining in the letter. How Walker’s action compares Scholars, including McCartin, believe FDR’s views might have evolved in favor of public sector bargaining -- and against what Walker did. We won’t judge that for this item, but we’ll end with a few observations regarding the two situations, separated by nearly three-quarters of a century. In substance, Walker’s move dramatically limited, but did not completely end, collective bargaining by most public employees. His Act 10 allowed the state to cut benefits and try to limit pay increases. He argued that unions had become too powerful and that elected representatives of the people should have more control over taxpayer-funded compensation. Roosevelt said in the 1937 press conference that compensation levels for federal employees should be set by Congress and the president, not through bargaining with unions. So both men -- decades apart -- envisioned a limited role for unions in the public sector. But the differences in context make the two men’s views hard to compare. Walker acted after 50 years of collective bargaining between the state and its employees -- in the birthplace of public collective bargaining -- while FDR expressed his views before labor won that toehold into that arena. Our rating Walker said FDR "felt there wasn’t a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people." The governor relies -- to good effect -- on Roosevelt’s 1937 letter, which, along with other primary evidence, lays out in striking language FDR’s deep reservations about the need for and wisdom of public-sector bargaining. While Roosevelt was open to discussion with represented and unrepresented employees over working conditions, he seemingly had major concerns about a formal, contractual bargaining process. Scholars cite Roosevelt’s positive comments on the Tennessee Valley Authority labor contracts, and debate certain phraseology in FDR's writings, but it’s limited evidence compared to the clear impression left by the letter and press conference remarks. Roosevelt saw a "logical place" for unions in government affairs, but the most compelling evidence suggests he drew the line at collective bargaining with them.

The article fabricated quotes by British film producer and co-chairman of the production company Working Title Films Tim Bevan, who is co-producing the film. A coroner named Bradley Cyril is also quoted as saying Ronan died at Beausejour Medical Center of blunt force trauma due to her fall, passing away shortly after being placed on a ventilator. We found a similar Beausejour Health Centre in Canada, but we did not find any facilities by the name of Beausejour Medical Center, and none in St. Lucia. Consequently, we couldn’t find anyone named Bradley Cyril who works as a known coroner. Also mentioned in the story are supposed injuries suffered by actress Charlize Theron, the "irreplaceable star" for Mary Queen of Scots. Not only is Theron injury-free, she is not in the film.

pomt-08188	Letting the Bush tax cuts expire would raise taxes on small businesses.	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/26/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-expiration-bush-tax-cuts-will-rai/	It’s the worst economy in 80 years and Democrats want to raise taxes on small businesses. That’s the way Rep. Eric Cantor and other Republican leaders describe efforts to let some Bush-era tax cuts expire. During post-election interviews this month, Cantor vowed the GOP will use its newly won majority status to insist that all of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, including those for the wealthy, be extended past their scheduled expiration at the end of the year. Cantor, like many Republicans, says raising the highest income bracket will penalize small businesses. "The question is are we going to raise taxes on small businesses right now, when we’re looking at those very individuals, those small businesses, to create jobs," Cantor, the soon-to-be House majority leader, said on CNN. "I don’t think many people think that’s a good idea." In addition, Cantor wrote in a Sept. 20 Op/Ed in the Wall Street Journal "roughly half of small business income in America will face a higher rate" if the Bush tax cuts die. Since Cantor is playing a huge role in the national debate on taxes, Virginia PolitiFact examined his claims. First, a little background. Cantor’s assertion focuses on the top bracket of income taxpayers: individuals with earnings more than $200,000 a year and families making more than $250,000. President Bush cut the top tax rate to 35 percent. President Obama wants to raise it to its previous 39.6 percent level, saying it would lower the deficit. How does that tie into small businesses? The GOP for years has pointed to a 2007 Treasury Department report which found that about 75 percent of the wealthiest tax filers are "flow through-business owners" who report some type of non-wage income, such as money from a sole proprietorship, a partnership or an S Corporation (which chooses to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credit through to its shareholders for federal tax purposes). But that doesn’t mean all these wealthy taxpayers are small business owners. In the words of PolitFact National, which also has vetted this issue: "This kind of income could be reported from anyone who earned money from a source other than a regular job, such as consulting or public speaking. It could also be reported by those who make most of their income from partnerships, such as law firms and medical practices. And it could include investors who have very little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company." It’s impossible to know how many of these taxpayers are small business owners. Federal tax law does not provide a standard definition of "small business." About 155.4 million individuals and families file income taxes in the United States. The Tax Policy Center, a research group started by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, analyzed IRS figures this summer and found that 2.2 percent of all taxpayers reporting business income -- 540,000 filers -- would be affected if Congress increases the tax rate on top earners. The debate narrows to how many of these wealthy taxpayers should be considered small business owners -- a determination, as we’ve said, that’s impossible. Although there’s no concrete definition of a small business owner, it seems reasonable to us that he or she would make half of his or her income from business ventures. The Tax Policy Center found that 272,000 of the wealthiest filers do that. The average adjusted gross business income -- the money they keep after all deductions -- for these taxpayers is $718,827. "The spin-miestering version of the argument doesn’t mention this," said William Ahern, director of policy and communications for the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group in Washington. "The viewer would think we’re talking about the appliance store owner on the corner." Cantor’s math wrongly assumes that the non-wage income of all top earners comes from small businesses. Cantor bases his Wall Street Journal claim that "roughly half of small business income in America will face a higher rate" if the Bush tax cuts die on a July 12 congressional report. "According to the Joint Committee on Taxation," deputy press secretary Megan Whittemore told us in an e-mail, "raising taxes only on those owners of small businesses with incomes above $200,000/$250,000 would still subject approximately 50 percent of small business income to a tax increase." But that’s not what the report says. It says 50 percent of all flow-through business income in the top bracket would be subject to a higher levy if the Bush tax cuts expire. And it adds this caveat: "These figures for net business income do not imply that all of the income is from entities that might be considered `small.’’’ Whittemore, in her e-mail explaining Cantor’s claim, also said "half of those in the top bracket get at least 25 percent of their income from small business sources." She referred to another analysis by the Tax Policy Center, done in 2008. We found Cantor’s office was again misinterpreting the results. The study said slightly more than half top earners made at least 25 percent of their net income from business profits. The statistical table Cantor’s office sent us makes no reference to small business. Let’s summarize: Would ending the Bush tax cuts raise levies on small businesses, as Cantor’s says? Sure, some extremely successful small businesses would be affected, but probably not many. The IRS does not offer a standard definition for a small business. Cantor consistently takes IRS data on the percentage of top earners who report some business income and says it comes from small business. You can’t make that leap, as one of the reports cited by Cantor says. What we know is that a sizable percentage of the nation’s top earners make some of their money from business profits. Their business income could come from any number of places, including stores or partnerships in law firms, medical practices or Wall Street trading houses. About 272,000 Americans in the highest income tax bracket report more than half of their earnings come from business profits. Their average business income is $718,827, according to the Tax Policy Center, whose figures Cantor sometimes uses. That hardly sounds like a corner shop owner, whose image Cantor seems to invoke when he says Democrats are trying to raise taxes on small businesses. We rate the claim Barely True. (Cantor’s wife, Diana F. Cantor, is a member of the board of directors of Media General Inc., parent company of the Richmond Times-Dispatch). Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10790	"We spent $223-million on a bridge in Alaska to an island with 50 people on it."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/12/john-mccain/half-baked-alaska/	Make that almost spent. For critics of the earmarking process, in which lawmakers can assign federal money to favored projects, the so-called "bridge to nowhere" had it all. The bridge money was written directly into the 2005 highway bill by just one person, then-House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Don Young, R-Alaska. The law set aside $223-million to build a bridge in Young's home state that would connect the Alaska town of Ketchikan to Gravina Island. Gravina Island has 50 people living on it. Critics seized on the project as a prime example of how the earmark process invites wasteful spending. There was such a firestorm of criticsm that in November 2005 Congress removed the earmark requirement. Alaska still got the federal transportation money, but the state no longer was required to use it on the bridge. Nonetheless, McCain continues to speak as if Congress still is requiring that the bridge be built. He says $223-million was "spent" on the bridge, but that's not true. The "bridge to nowhere" never was built.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2007-10-12T00:00:00	2007-07-25	['Alaska']

An Oct. 31 Facebook post from the Conservative Daily Post carries the headline, "Just In: Migrant Invaders Set Fire To Facility, Open Fire On Police." Clicking the link takes readers to a story on conservativedailypost.com with the headline, "Caravan Violence: Invaders Shoot At Police, Set Fire To Immigration Checkpoint; The violence is ratcheting up as firearms, firebombs and rocks are being used by the caravan." The website says the story has been shared over 3,300 times. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Several elements of this story suggest that it is factually challenged. The arson It’s hard to find a lot of information about the referenced arson, but here’s what we know. A link in the Conservative Daily Post story takes readers to an Oct. 30 Breitbart report that, in turn, relies on an Oct. 29 story from Televisa News, which says a fire broke out in the area of an immigration checkpoint in Pijijiapan, Chiapas, which is located in Mexico, 90 miles by road to the Guatemalan border. The Televisa News story does not say when the fire happened. At the time of the arson, the checkpoint was housing 21 men who were being detained and awaiting deportation to Guatemala, the Televisa story says. The fire caused minor damage and no injuries. In addition, according to Televisa, the fire seems to have been caused by one or more migrants who had already left the caravan and were planning to go home, but were detained by Mexican officials. Though the date of the fire is not included in the story, we know based on news reports, including the timeline in this USA Today story, that the beginning of the caravan was about 90 miles from Pijijiapan on Oct. 28, the day before the story was first published online -- and at a time when the caravan was traveling about 40 miles per day. Additionally, the photograph that accompanies the Conservative Daily Post story shows a U.S. Border Patrol facility at night, a stock image found on Shutterstock and other stock image sites. The caption reads, "An immigration checkpoint facility was set on fire and police were shot at as the migrant invasion force becomes more violent." Together, the image and caption could give the impression that the arson happened at a U.S. border facility, which is not what the Televisa story states. A Nexis search of U.S. news and wire clips for the period of Oct. 12, when the first caravan formed, to Nov. 7, turned up no stories about an arson at a border checkpoint. The shooting Conservative Post Daily says the shooting occurred when two men "saw the officers guarding the group of trespassers and decided to open fire." Trespassers refers to the migrants. The best information we have about this incident indicates there was only one gun. An Oct. 29 statement from the Ministry of the Interior says only one of the two Hondurans was armed and the man fired while attempting to flee from police. The news release does not suggest why the pair, ages 22 and 17, were fleeing or why they would shoot officers guarding the caravan. The gun jammed with nine .380-caliber bullets still in the weapon. Nobody was hurt. The location of the shooting: the town of Ignacio Zaragoza in Chiapas, Mexico, near the Guatemalan border where a second caravan was forming and roughly 230 miles from the leading edge of the main caravan. Our ruling The Conservative Daily Post reported, "Caravan Violence: Invaders Shoot At Police, Set Fire To Immigration Checkpoint." Combined with the photograph of a U.S. border patrol facility, it gives the false impression that the fire and shooting involved U.S. officials and an American facility. The evidence shows it did not. The fire was in southern Mexico, it was reportedly caused by men who had left the caravan and were returning south, but were detained by Mexican officials. There were no "invaders" (meaning more than one person) shooting at police, unless it took both of the arrested males to fire the same gun. If they were part of the caravan, it's not clear why someone would shoot at police guarding them. And the incident occurred in Mexico far from the U.S. border. Because the statement contains elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03879	"We have over 300,000,000 weapons, firearms in this country. That’s almost as big as the population."	/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/07/james-florio/jim-florio-claims-number-guns-us-almost-big-popula/	As the gun violence debate rages on across the nation, a former New Jersey governor is offering a statistic about the prevalence of weapons in the United States. "We have over 300,000,000 weapons, firearms in this country. That’s almost as big as the population," Florio said during an interview for Governors’ Perspective, an occasional segment for "On the Record" with Michael Aron on NJTV that aired Feb. 16. Former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman also participated in the interview. Florio’s statistic seems pretty high – there are almost as many firearms as people in the United States? He’s correct. First, let’s review population totals. As of Monday, the U.S. Census Bureau’s POPClock lists the nation’s population as 315,433,299. Now let’s look into that guns figure. Florio, a Democrat, told us he got the number from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition. "All of the gun control organizations use it," Florio said. "No one has really refuted it." The coalition of more than 850 mayors from across the country works to prevent criminals from getting guns illegally while also supporting legal gun ownership, according to its website. It’s worth noting that the National Rifle Association even cites the statistic, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. "The number of privately owned guns in the U.S. is at an all-time high, upwards of 300 million, and now rises by about 10 million per year," the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action said in a firearms safety fact sheet released Jan. 17. Donna Sellers, a spokeswoman for the ATF in Washington, said there is no national firearms registry, except for those firearms defined in the National Firearms Act, and instead pointed us to manufacturing and import/export reports maintained on the ATF website. "We would have no way of knowing how many firearms there are," Sellers said. Florio also is correct that other gun-control organizations cite the 300 million figure. The Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence directed us to a September 2010 Gun Control Facts report that looks at population, gun manufacturing in the United States, ownership, crimes and more. "As of 2009, the United States has a population of 307 million people. Based on production data from firearm manufacturers, there are roughly 300 million firearms owned by civilians in the United States as of 2010," the report by James D. Agresti and Reid K. Smith stated. "There’s no perfect estimate of firearms in the U.S. because creating a national registry of firearms is prohibited by federal law," Alex Katz, a spokesman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. "But academics and interest groups across the political spectrum broadly agree on the 300 million figure." A November 2012 report titled "Gun Control Legislation" from the Congressional Research Service also supports that number. As of 2009, the report states, "the estimated total number of firearms available to civilians in the United States had increased to approximately 310 million: 114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns." Our ruling Florio said during a recent television interview, "We have over 300,000,000 weapons, firearms in this country. That’s almost as big as the population." Data from a variety of sources including the Congressional Research Service, NRA and others confirm the 300 million figure. While population and firearms figures have fluctuated over the years, Florio’s point is clear: there’s nearly one gun for every person in the United States. We rate his claim True.

pomt-07927	Says President Barack Obama revealed in his State of the Union address that he "now is against earmarks."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/28/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-tea-party-pushed-barack-obama-shift/	In the first-ever meeting of the Senate Tea Party Caucus on Jan. 27, 2011, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., shot a rhetorical barb at President Barack Obama over earmarks. An earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics have long argued that earmarks are likelier to serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group than the national good. At the Tea Party Caucus meeting, Paul said, "Before we were even sworn in, the Republican caucus got together ... they forswore and said, 'No more earmarks.' Are they going to co-opt us? I went to my first State of the Union the other day, and guess who is now against earmarks? The president of the United States has been co-opted by the tea party!" We decided to see whether Paul was correct that Obama had changed his stance on earmarks. First, here’s what Obama said during his Jan. 25, 2011, State of the Union address. To the applause of lawmakers, he said, "And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it. I will veto it." Now let’s look at what he said during the 2008 campaign. As a candidate, Obama spoke out several times against earmarks. In fact, our Obameter has been tracking no fewer than three earmark-related promises. They are: • Through the "Transparency and Integrity in Earmarks Act, will shed light on all earmarks by disclosing the name of the legislator who asked for each earmark, along with a written justification, 72 hours before they can be approved by the full Senate." (We rated this one a Compromise.) • "And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely." (We rated this a Compromise.) • "Barack Obama is committed to returning earmarks to less than $7.8 billion a year, the level they were at before 1994." (We rated this one Promise Broken.) As our promise ratings indicate, his record on earmarks as president has been less than consistent. In March 2009, for instance, Obama said he would sign a $410 billion omnibus spending bill containing a reported 8,570 earmarks totaling $7.7 billion. ABC News’ Jake Tapper wrote at the time that Obama seemed a little embarrassed about it, refusing to sign the bill in public or even to release a photograph. Appropriations bills covering fiscal year 2010 contained 9,499 congressional earmarks worth $15.9 billion, according to the nonpartisan group Taxpayers for Common Sense. His inconsistent opposition to earmarks convinces Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, that Paul’s observation is accurate. "Given the huge number of earmarks signed into law by Obama, I think his subsequent back-pedaling is a testimony to the power of the tea party, or at least a testimony to the broader grassroots revolt against big government," Mitchell said. Mitchell added that Paul may be guilty of "a bit of puffery in his rhetoric." We also asked Steve Ellis, a veteran earmark-watcher for the nonpartisan group Taxpayers for Common Sense, for his interpretation. "While the president hasn’t called for the outright abolishment of earmarks before, he has been for earmark reforms and reductions," Ellis said. Ellis said that, as a senator, Obama went through an "arc" in his views and actions on earmarks. In his first year, Obama followed the lead of fellow Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin. Durbin sat on the Appropriations Committee, a major institutional source of earmarks, and that year, Obama "got all sorts of earmarks." The following year, Ellis said, Obama did not pursue earmarks for any for-profit companies, and the year after that, he went further than the rules required and released all of his earmark requests since becoming a senator. In his final year in the Senate, Obama gave up earmarks entirely. "Of course he was positioning to run for president, but still," Ellis said. We think Paul is right to note that Obama’s State of the Union position was stronger than what he had expressed during the campaign, a point at which the tea party movement had not yet emerged. It’s also worth noting that, so far in his term, Obama has only inconsistently carried out his stated policies on earmarks. As president, Obama has signed legislation that included a significant number of earmarks. In his State of the Union address, he said would veto legislation with earmarks. Still, we think it’s an oversimplification for Paul to imply that Obama had done a wholesale change on the issue, whether due to tea party pressure or some other reason. It would be inaccurate to describe Obama as someone who uncritically supported earmarks, at least after his first year or so in the Senate. In fact, as a candidate, he made three separate promises to rein them in. On balance, we rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-03053	The growth in health care costs "has been reined in through the Affordable Care Act."	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/04/jim-moran/moran-says-obamacare-has-reined-growth-health-care/	U.S. Rep. Jim Moran says Obamacare is stunting the growth in health care costs. "Rising health care costs have handicapped consumers and choked family budgets," Moran, D-8th, said in a Sept. 12 statement. "Thankfully, that growth has been reined in through the Affordable Care Act." We asked for proof and Moran’s office pointed to a 2012 report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It said total U.S. health care spending in 2011 was $2.7 trillion. That was a 3.9 percent increase over 2010. The study said the growth rate was low by historical standards, as were the 2009 and 2010 growth rates of 3.8 and 3.9 percent respectively. The Kaiser Family Foundation wrote in April that health care spending is growing at the slowest rate since the government began keeping official tallies in 1960. Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, so the low growth rates somewhat match up with the creation of the law. But they also coincide with the nation’s slow recovery from the Great Recession, and many economists see this as the real reason for slowed growth in health care spending. The 2012 CMS report cited by Moran’s office doesn’t credit Obamacare for the slowed spending. It said the lagging growth rate "largely reflects the lingering effects of the recent recession and modest recovery." CMS said the downturn led to lower health spending as employers cut costs and the number of people with private insurance dropped. In a companion piece in Health Affairs, a policy journal, CMS officials said Obamacare had "no discernible impact" on overall health care spending in 2011. Shortly after Moran made his statement, CMS released its 2013 report on health care expenditures. It’s charts showed that, with or without Obamacare, costs would have increased by an average of about 3.9 percent a year in 2010 and 2011 -- the latest years for which conclusive research is available. Moran’s office also pointed to a pair of May reports by two separate teams of Harvard University researchers that examined the reasons beyond the economy to explain the slow cost growth in recent years. One paper said that various factors -- such as insurers shifting costs of benefits to people in employer-sponsored insurance -- drove the slowdown. The second paper found the recession accounted for only 37 percent of the slowdown while another 55 percent is "unexplained." David Cutler, a co-author of the second report who advised Obama’s 2008 campaign, told our colleagues at PolitiFact National that Obamacare is "one likely explanation" for the slowing cost growth. The Kaiser Family Foundation, in its April report, said the lackluster economy accounted for 77 percent reason the increase in health care spending has slowed. It attributed the other 23 percent to structural changes within the health care system, such as rising levels of patient cost sharing that discourage use of services. A co-author of the report, Larry Levitt, told ABC News he thinks Obamacare "is responsible, indirectly, for a good bit of what the economy doesn’t explain." But, Levitt added, "the precise impacts can’t be proven." Drew Altman, the CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, also said in an op-ed in Politico that the specter of reforms from the law means "it is entirely likely that Obamacare has played and will continue to play a role in the slowdown in health-care cost growth and accelerating market change." A May 2013 report from the Urban Institute, notes the slowdown in health care spending began in 2002, pre-dating the recession and Obamacare. The cause, the Institute said, could be related to a long-time slide in real incomes. Alwyn Cassil, a spokesman for the Center for Studying Health System Change, said Moran’s statement is "overly simplistic" and an "overly optimistic" view of Obamacare’s impact. Many of the law’s provisions haven’t even gone into effect yet, she said. In 2014, CMS is projecting health care costs will rise by 6.1 percent. The agency said the increased rate will be driven in part by expanded health insurance coverage under Obamacare. About 11 million people are estimated to gain insurance next year as the mandates on Medicaid expansions kick in and people start buying plans on state-based health exchanges. Over time, about 30 million uninsured people are expected to get coverage. The law requires efficiencies in the delivery of health care that supporters of Obamacare say will stunt the long-term growth in costs. But as we’ve noted before, it’s an open question whether those measures will be sustainable. Our ruling Moran said health care costs have been "reined in through the Affordable Care Act." Other Democrats have made similar statements. The rate of cost growth began to slow in 2009 -- the year before Obamacare was passed, when the nation was in recession. Many analysts say the slow economic recovery is the major reason health care spending have been rising at historically low rates. Research by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that Obamacare has played "no discernable role" in the slowed growth rate. That doesn’t mean Obamacare has played no role. Some analysts, including the CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, believe Obamacare has helped slow costs, but say they can’t quantify its impact. All told, Moran’s statement is highly exaggerated and we rate it Mostly False.	None	Jim Moran	None	None	None	2013-10-04T12:31:41	2013-09-12	['None']
pomt-08167	Says Sen. Sherrod Brown voted to keep "an extreme, job-killing Internal Revenue Service paperwork mandate."	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/02/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republicans-get-early-jump-2012-campaign-season-at/	You can always tell when one election cycle ends and another begins. The punches don’t stop, but the names of those being attacked change. So the 2012 election cycle is upon us already, and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is up for re-election to another six-year term. Brown, an Ohio Democrat, does not have a Republican opponent yet, but it’s early. Not wasting time, however, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, or NRSC, used a congressional vote by Brown on Nov. 29 to criticize him for what it called his "out of touch" and "extreme partisan" agenda. Brown, the NRSC said in a news release, voted to keep "an extreme, job-killing Internal Revenue Service paperwork mandate." The attack was no surprise. Republicans would love to defeat Brown. But we wondered whether this particular attack was fair. The vote was on an amendment to kill an unpopular paperwork-filing requirement for small businesses. Because of a provision in this year’s health-care law, businesses will have to report to the IRS all purchases exceeding $600 that they make to a single vendor. The requirement, which kicks in in 2012, was seen by its original sponsors as a way to boost federal revenue and help pay for the health-care overhaul by making sure that businesses that sell to other businesses report all their income and pay taxes on it. But in order to make sure the sellers pay their taxes, the provision puts a new onus on the buyers to report their transactions, whether a landscaping service is paying for lawn mowers or gasoline or an advertising agency is paying freelance artists. Small businesses say this will create a paperwork nightmare, especially for solo operators and mom-and-pop businesses that buy supplies in small batches. Many members of Congress agree. Yet two votes to kill it failed on Nov. 29. One was on an amendment by Sen. Mike Johanns, a Nebraska Republican who attached it to an unrelated food safety bill. Johanns’ measure would have repealed the controversial paperwork provision while directing the White House to recapture the lost tax revenue by taking back unspent money in various federal programs. The Office of Management and Budget would make those decisions. Every Senate Republican and 21 Democrats voted for the amendment, which failed to get the two-thirds majority needed for passage. Brown and 34 other Democrats voted against it, Brown’s objection was two-fold, according to discussions we had with him and his communications director. He said that decisions on program cuts should be made by Congress, not the executive branch. And he said that the cuts could have been too extensive, since the Johanns measure called for revoking "all available unobligated funds," specified in his amedment at $39 billion. That could include money approved by Congress but not yet spent for disaster relief, cyber-security investments and public housing rental assistance, according to a Senate Appropriations Committee list of unspent federal money. So Brown voted no. And Republicans slammed him in their press release. "Thanks to Sherrod Brown's out-of-touch Washington agenda, Ohio's small businesses will have to spend their time and money filling out mountains of government paperwork rather than doing business and creating jobs," NRSC Press Secretary Amber Marchand said in the release. "With Ohio's families suffering from high unemployment, Brown once again chose to put his extreme partisan agenda ahead of the best interests of his state, and that's why he will face an uphill battle in 2012." Never mind the over-the-top rhetoric, which is typical in political criticism regardless of which party makes it. There’s a more basic problem with the attack on Brown on the small business paperwork provision. About 22 minutes after voting no, Brown voted yes on a different amendment to do the same thing: kill the paperwork requirement. This amendment, sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, had 42 Democratic votes and two Republican votes in favor. But unlike the Johanns amendment, this one did not specify how the government would recoup lost tax revenue if the paperwork provision -- and the taxes it could bring in -- went away. It is fair to debate which of these amendments was better, and whether there should be spending offsets. Johanns said that the Baucus amendment would add $19 billion to the federal deficit. But that’s a broader economic debate. Democrats including President Barack Obama say they have heard the complaints about the paperwork provision and are pretty sure they’ll deal with it before it kicks in. You don’t have to agree with them, or to like Brown’s position or the Baucus amendment. But by saying Brown "voted in favor of an extreme, job-killing paperwork mandate," the NRSC exaggerates that single vote, distorts its context and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. One more critical fact: Brown separately co-sponsored the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act, another potential bill by Baccus to get rid of the paperwork requirement, on Nov. 18, 11 days before the vote on which he was slammed. We’d rule the NRSC’s claim False but for the fact that Brown did cast a "no" vote on the Johanns amendment. But with so much context missing, the Truth-o-Meter’s arrow stays in the low range: Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	National Republican Senatorial Committee	None	None	None	2010-12-02T06:00:00	2010-11-30	['None']
pomt-02497	Obamacare includes a "$700 billion cut from Medicare for seniors."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-obamacare-cuts-money-medicare-and-senior/	Since the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans and their allies have claimed the Affordable Care Act slashes funding for Medicare, the federal healthcare program for seniors. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made almost identical claims in the 2012 presidential election as well. It appears the GOP playbook for the 2014 midterms will be similar. An early indication is in Florida’s special election to replace the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., where the National Republican Congressional Committee is airing an ad hammering Democrat Alex Sink’s support of Obamacare. The ad says the law includes a "$700 billion cut from Medicare for seniors." We’ve tackled this claim repeatedly throughout the years. There’s some truth to it, but quite a bit of context is missing. Obamacare does not literally cut funding from the Medicare budget, but tries to bring down future health care costs in the program. Much of this is accomplished by reducing Medicare Advantage, a small subset of Medicare plans that are run by private insurers. President George W. Bush started Medicare Advantage in hopes the increased competition would reduce costs. But those plans are actually costlier than traditional Medicare. So the health care law reduces payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. The goal is get health care providers to increase their efficiency and quality of care instead of cutting benefits for seniors. The overall trend in Medicare spending is still expected to increase, even after the adjustments in the Affordable Care Act. How much are the spending reductions? That has changed throughout the years as estimates get updated. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper of fiscal legislation, estimated that the reductions in Medicare spending in the Affordable Care Act we about $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. A more recent estimate from 2013 anticipated about $716 billion in Medicare savings from 2013-2022. It’s also worth noting that the preferred plan of Republicans in 2012, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget, assumed the same cuts to Medicare. When asked to back up their claim, the NRCC pointed us to our own story from Nov. 2, 2012, about Young’s last Congressional race. In it, we fact-checked an ad in which Young claimed he "opposed $716 billion cut to Medicare." We gave it a Half True. Our ruling In its ad against Sink, the NRCC said the Affordable Care Act includes a "$700 billion cut from Medicare for seniors." There is reduction in spending to Medicare outlays, but it’s fueled by finding savings in the program, a move that Republicans actually supported in the Ryan budget. Medicare spending still increases in the coming years. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-00728	"I can tell you with certainty (cap and trade) would have a devastating impact on our economy."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/23/marco-rubio/rubio-cap-and-trade-would-hurt-economy-might-not-h/	It’s no secret that Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is skeptical of human-caused climate change. While he’s unsure of the effect humans have on the climate, Rubio is certain that addressing the problem would wreck the economy. "If we do the things they want us to do, cap and trade, you name it, how much will that change the pace of climates change vs. how much will it cost to our economy?" Rubio asked rhetorically on CBS’ Face the Nation April 19. "Scientists can't tell us what impact it would have on reversing these changes. But I can tell you with certainty it would have a devastating impact on our economy." We wondered about Rubio’s claim that it’s a "certainty" that cap and trade would "devastate" the economy. Rubio has a point in that scientists can’t say exactly how much of an effect cap and trade would have on climate change trends. But predictions about cap and trade on the economy carry the same level of uncertainty -- a lot depends on the specifics of the policy. Additionally, most estimations show a modest -- rather than "devastating" -- impact. We reached out to Rubio’s staff but didn’t hear back. Devastation? Cap and trade is a simple concept: The government sets a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. To comply, companies must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or purchase allowances to continue polluting. Proponents say that because emissions would cost companies more, it’s in their interest to find ways to limit their pollution, through new technology or otherwise. Critics say cap and trade would cause companies to slow down production or pass along additional costs to customers. Quite a few states already have cap-and-trade programs, such as the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative among 10 states, as well as the Western Climate Initiative, which includes several states (primarily California) and parts of Canada. The European Union has a cap-and-trade program among its member nations. Existing cap-and-trade programs haven’t devastated their local economies. For example, an independent consulting firm looked at the economic impact of the group of Northeastern states engaged in a cap-and-trade program that has lowered emissions by 40 percent since 2005, and the results were positive. The 2011 analysis found that the program created $1.6 billion in value added to the regional economy. It also created 16,000 jobs, and residents collectively saved more than $1 billion on energy bills. Depending on the policy specifics, different programs would have different effects on the economy and climate change, said Duke University energy policy professor Billy Pizer, though the ideal policy would seek to balance costs and benefits. "Europe, California, New England—they all have cap and trade and nothing has been devastated," Pizer said. "There is nothing about a generic cap and trade that is devastating." The European Union program has struggled over the past few years -- in part due to the global recession and falling carbon prices on the continent. However, a 2012 report out of the Environmental Defense Fund found that costs were significantly lower than predicted. The report cited another study that found the program "did not significantly affect" employment, profits or added value. Joseph Aldy, an energy policy professor at Harvard University, pointed out that former President George H.W. Bush established a cap-and-trade program designed to mitigate acid rain. A recent study out of Harvard found that the program created annual benefits of up to $116 billion, compared to just $2 billion in costs -- mostly as a result of public health improvements. For a national cap-and-trade program, estimates of economic impact are all over the map. Consider the analyses of a failed 2009 proposal for a federal cap-and trade program and their effect on household costs. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ independent research arm, found the bill would cost about $175 per household annually. The conservative Heritage Foundation predicted instead a much higher cost: $1,241 per household annually. On the other end of the spectrum, the American Council for an Energy-Efficiency Economy estimated that a family could save $750 after the bill had been in effect for eight years. Economic benefits from cap and trade could come from more energy-efficient technology and less climate-change related costs, according to advocates. For example, the 2010 Economic Report from the President said the 2009 congressional proposal could save the economy up to $2 trillion as a result of avoided damages from more intense climate change. The Energy Information Administration, a statistical office within the U.S. Energy Department, looked at the cap-and-trade proposal and found that the macroeconomic effects were minimal -- with the bill, economic growth by 2035 would be 0.3 percent less than it would be absent the bill. They also found that a later cap-and-trade proposal would have a similar effect. We should note that one expert -- Patrick Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science at the libertarian Cato Institute -- told us the 2009 proposal would have been "devastating" to the economy because it involved unacheivable goals and assumed the eventual invention of technology that doesn’t exist yet. Michaels, a climatologist, noted though that this wouldn’t be the case for every cap-and-trade policy. "It is political hyperbole to say that the impacts would be ‘devastating,’ " said Gilbert Metcalf, a professor of public finance at Tufts University. "I agree with Rubio that the economic impacts are probably easier to forecast than the climate impacts; (the economic impacts) are just not what he is saying they are." Our ruling Rubio said, "I can tell you with certainty (cap and trade) would have a devastating impact on our economy." Existing cap-and-trade programs have not proven to be "devastating" in their economic impact. While estimates for proposed programs vary, most experts and analysts have found modest potential impact on the economy; some even show a positive impact. Based on the evidence, Rubio can’t be certain about the potential impact of cap and trade. We rate his claim False.

pomt-09067	"Phoenix, Arizona, is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world."	/texas/statements/2010/jun/28/john-mccain/mccain-says-phoenix-second-kidnapping-capital-worl/	Will Congress answer President Barack Obama’s call to tackle immigration reform this year? "Not until we get the borders secure," said John McCain, R-Ariz., on NBC’s Meet the Press on June 27. "By the way, on that issue, why is it that Phoenix, Arizona, is the number two kidnapping capital of the world? Does that mean our border's safe? Of course not." PolitiFact Texas earlier checked a similar statement by Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who recently rallied delegates at the Republican state convention by commiserating with Arizona, which has come under fire for its law that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime. "Phoenix, Arizona, I'm told, is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City," he said. "That's unacceptable in America. We understand. We in Texas understand the frustrations people feel in Arizona." McCain’s office didn’t immediately respond to our query, but he’s made the claim before — and so have at least 20 news organizations, including the Associated Press, The Arizona Republic and United Press International. Far as we could tell, ABC News broke the story, reporting on Feb. 11, 2009: "Phoenix, Arizona, has become the kidnapping capital of America, with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone." Some media outlets attributed the news to ABC, while others just said Phoenix was "known as" the No. 2 kidnapping capital. The Los Angeles Times more specifically reported that Phoenix "police received 366 kidnapping-for-ransom reports" in 2008 and that they estimate "twice that number go unreported," according to a Feb. 12, 2009, article. But there's a hitch: None of the stories says how the kidnapping ranking was reached. Also, while all the stories specify the number of kidnappings that have occurred in Phoenix since 2008, none says how many kidnappings were reported in other cities. We asked ABC to elaborate on its report, a request that didn't immediately yield supporting evidence when we first published this item two weeks ago. Meantime, we kept digging. Neither the FBI nor the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that serves as the United States' representative to Interpol, could confirm that Phoenix has the second-highest frequency of kidnapping cases worldwide. LaTonya Miller, an Interpol spokeswoman, said the agency doesn't track local kidnapping rates. An FBI spokeswoman, Denise Ballew, suggested we call city police departments to compile a kidnapping count since unlike local authorities, the bureau tracks kidnappings that result in someone being taken from one jurisdiction to another, such as across state lines. Short of the time we'd need to call authorities in every medium- to big-size city in the world, we contacted Daniel Johnson, an overseas kidnapping operations consultant at ASI Global, a Houston-based company that coaches clients through kidnappings. You read that right: Say an insured family travels to Bulgaria and the father is kidnapped for ransom; ASI Global will deploy to Bulgaria to help the family negotiate with the abductor. Johnson said: "From our internal experience in the last year, Mexico by far has been the biggest location for kidnappings" followed by Honduras, Venezuela, Nigeria and the Philippines. The company has handled domestic cases but Thompson said they don't compare in volume to overseas incidents. Thompson said the company annually dispatches a consultant to handle about 50 to 100 cases a year. Mexico City, Caracas, Venezuela, and Tegucigalpa, Honduras are the three cities where they work on the most kidnapping cases, he said. Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company, separately chimed in: "According to our analysts, there is no way that Phoenix is the No. 2 city in the world for kidnapping and there are significantly more kidnappings in many other cities throughout Latin America," he said. "San Salvador, Guatemala City, Bogota as well as several cities in Mexico certainly have higher kidnapping rates than Phoenix." That said, Stewart said Stratfor doesn't track such kidnapping statistics, noting that it's "extremely difficult to measure given the fact that so many cases go unreported and that the record keeping in many of the most effected countries is inaccurate." The company bases its information on "intelligence that we gather through our network of human and open sources, as well as the experience of our analysts," he said. Johnson also said that generally, the problem with kidnapping statistics is there's "no reliable empirical data" and kidnappings are "inherently under-reported, anyway." Kidnappers nab someone and tell you not to tell the police, he said, adding that especially outside the United States, people typically don't report the incidents to law enforcement. Among countries that track kidnappings, Johnson said, the definition of "kidnap" varies. An "express kidnapping," for instance, can be classified as a prolonged robbery, he said. Someone takes to you against your will from ATM to ATM until your checking account is depleted. Robbery or kidnapping? Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a public information officer at the Phoenix Police Department, also said kidnappings are under-reported. "Herein lies the problem with the numbers," Thompson said. "Does Bogota, Colombia, keep records? Does Mogadishu, (Somalia), keep records?" He said Phoenix has been dealing with the issue for several years now, and the number of reported kidnappings have actually decreased since this story broke in 2009. There were 358 reported kidnappings in 2008 (10 fewer than reported by the LA Times, due to later reclassification of the crimes), 318 in 2009 and there were 105 from January through May 2010, he said, putting the city on track to sustain less than 300 this year. Mindful that "spillover violence" from Mexico has become a politically-charged term in the U.S., Thompson said almost everyone who is kidnapped in Phoenix is involved in criminal activities such as illegal border crossings and the drug trade. "Unless you're involved in the dope trade, there's a very very slim chance" that you'll be kidnapped, he said. "Everyone wants to tie it to their political agenda," Thompson said. "Again, the two overwhelming questions are, do they keep records elsewhere in the world and are there more people — other agencies — across the nation who are even willing to talk about such a problem?" "It was the media that said 'second in the world only to Mexico City,' and it was basically because we were open enough to say that we have an issue with kidnappings and not try to hide it," Thompson said. True, "Kidnapping capital" is a headline-grabbing label. But so far, we've seen no evidence that it's accurate, or even close. And since we first considered this claim earlier this month, no one has stepped forward with more information. Phoenix has experienced hundreds of kidnappings over the past few years. However, we couldn't find reliable around-the-planet evidence to confirm that only Mexico City experiences more of them. In fact, experts advise that such rankings can't be made based on available information. If they could, they speculate, other cities would prove to have more kidnappings than Arizona's capital. We found nothing confirming Phoenix as No. 2 in kidnappings worldwide. We'll reconsider our rating if compelling evidence surfaces, but for now McCain's statement is False.

pomt-04730	President Obama’s education "solution" includes an effort to "nationalize curriculum."	/florida/statements/2012/aug/30/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-obama-wants-nationalize-curricu/	Who should decide how to teach children to write a sentence or multiply numbers -- local leaders or the feds? Rick Santorum, who dropped out of the GOP presidential primary, touched on that theme in his Aug. 28 speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa: "A solid education should be the second rung on the ladder to success, but the system is failing. President Obama's solution has been to deny parents choice, attack private schools and nationalize curriculum and student loans. Mitt Romney believes that parents and the local community must be put in charge -- not the Department of Education." Has Obama tried to "nationalize curriculum"? We could not track down Santorum to ask him to explain his statement, but Education Week wrote that his statement was "an apparent dig at the Common Core State Standards, which are not an initiative of the federal government, but have been embraced by the federal Department of Education." ‘Common Core' standards The movement toward Common Core standards pre-dates Obama’s presidency. The Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Obama won the presidency. In 2009, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to create the Common Core State Standards, developed them with the help of teachers, parents, and experts, and unveiled them in 2010. The council’s website described it as a "state-led effort spearheaded by governors and school chiefs" to set expectations for language arts and math in order to help students prepare for college and work. To date, 45 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards in language arts and math, and one state, Minnesota, adopted only the language arts standards. Most of the states plan to implement the standards over the next few years. Texas, Virginia, Nebraska and Alaska did not adopt the standards. We should note that standards are not the same thing as curriculum, but the standards alone have sparked lots of debate. Critics say the efforts amount to federal overreach and question whether the standards were sufficiently rigorous. The Pioneer Institute, a Boston think tank that focuses on individual responsibility and limited government, wrote a paper in February arguing that the Common Core standards were a "road to a national curriculum." It also argued the federal government is herding states into accepting the standards (more on that in bit). Conservative Washington Post columnist George F. Will echoed the institute’s views in a widely distributed March column. The federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards. For states to get either federal Race to the Top grants or waivers from the mandates of No Child Left Behind, they have to prove they have standards to prepare students for college and work. They don’t have to adopt the Common Core Standards -- but that works as one way to qualify for grants or waivers. (A Center for Education Policy survey found that the rigor of the standards was the top consideration in states’ decisions on adopting the standards, although Race to the Top grants were also a factor.) So far, 33 states have received waivers -- and all but one of those adopted the Common Core standards. Though the standards were not written by the federal government, there is a perception among some that the feds are driving it. U.S. Secretary of Education Secretary Arne Duncan rejected that idea, telling South Carolina legislators "the idea that the Common Core standards are nationally-imposed is a conspiracy theory in search of a conspiracy." But he does favor the standards. "We have 50 different standards, 50 different goal posts," he said in 2009 before the Common Core standards were unveiled. "And due to political pressure, those have been dumbed down. We want to fundamentally reverse that. We want common, career-ready internationally benchmarked standards." Obama has appeared to take credit for states adopting the standards while avoiding the issue of whether states did that due to the financial incentives, reported Education Week in its Curriculum Matters blog. "For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, almost every state has now agreed to raise standards for teaching and learning—and that's the first time it's happened in a generation," Obama said in August 2012. The blog noted that Santorum’s comment about nationalizing curriculum "hit that local-control nerve that's so raw at the moment, raising the specter of little children everywhere turning the same page in their history books at the same moment on the same day in November, all because of ‘the feds,’ or, at the very least, ‘outsiders.’" Education experts We interviewed five education experts about Santorum’s claim and they all disagreed that Common Core standards nationalize curriculum. Our experts included education professors at the University of Florida, Columbia and Harvard; Chester Finn, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Education in the 1980s who is president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education; and Andy Rotherham, co-founder and partner at Bellwether Education Partners. All of them disagreed with Santorum’s claim. Experts generally emphasized that the standards are voluntary. And setting standards -- such as understanding decimals or reading comprehension -- isn’t the same as telling educators what curriculum to use to teach those standards. "It describes a destination -- again, voluntary for states -- not the means of getting there," Finn said. "Yes, if a bunch of states faithfully implement it (45 have signed up but many won't seriously implement them), it will bring greater commonality to what is taught across the country in those two subjects. In my view that's a good thing. Why should 5th graders in Portland, Maine, and Portland, Ore., be learning different math?" Columbia Professor Jeffrey Henig said the movement toward Common Core standards pre-dates Obama and has had considerable bipartisan support. "The Obama administration is broadly supportive of this movement and has used some of its ability to use grant funds to leverage state reforms, but it is not accurate to characterize it as leading the initiative," Henig wrote in an email. Our ruling Santorum said Obama has tried to "nationalize curriculum." Santorum appears to be adopting an argument from critics of the Common Core standards. But Santorum’s statement is misleading for several reasons. For starters, the discussion about common standards pre-dates Obama. Although the vast majority of states have adopted those standards, they are voluntary. The states don’t have to adopt the Common Core standards to apply for Race to the Top grants or waivers from No Child Left Behind, although that’s been the preferred route so far. Finally, it’s important to note that standards aren’t the same as curriculum. States can agree on a standard about multiplication or reading but create different curriculums to teach those skills. Santorum has oversimplified a complex topic and fed into the generic "federal takeover" argument. We rate this claim Mostly False. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.

pomt-06471	Says Barack Obama "never worked in the private sector" before he was elected president.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-barack-obama-has-no-private-sector-exp/	When Barack Obama was seeking the presidency in 2008, Republicans frequently derided his career experience, saying it was limited to a scant four years in the U.S. Senate, some time in the Illinois Senate, and having been a "community organizer" in Chicago. Today, with the unemployment seemingly stuck above 9 percent, the GOP is returning to that theme, asserting that Obama doesn’t have the business savvy and private-sector experience to lead the country out of the economic doldrums. At the Bloomberg/Washington Post debate held at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., on Oct. 11, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was asked how he would get the country moving again. Romney replied, "I’d be prepared to be a leader. You can’t get the country to go in the right direction and get Washington to work if you don’t have a president that’s a leader. And three years ago, we selected a person who had never had any leadership experience, never worked in the private sector, never had the opportunity to actually bring people together, and he hasn’t been able to do so. "He said he'd bring us hope and change. Instead, he’s divided the nation and tried to blame other people," Romney said. The Romney campaign did not respond to two e-mails seeking sources for his claim. But Obama’s work experience, or lack thereof, is well-plowed ground, and he clearly has worked outside of government. As PolitiFact reported two years ago when Joe Scarborough falsely asserted that Obama had never "received a paycheck from a profit-making business," the president does, in fact, have some experience outside of government, albeit not in the Fortune 500 world. In fact, the bulk of his income in recent years has come from royalties from sales of his books. Some of the relevant jobs in Obama’s work history include: — A stint in 1983-84 as a research assistant at Business International Corp. in New York City, where he helped write a newsletter. — Working from 1985 to 1988 as a community organizer for the Developing Communities Project in Chicago; — Working from 1993 to 2004 as an associate, and then a partner, at the Chicago law firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, where his work included employment-discrimination and voting-rights cases. The job also overlapped with his time in the Illinois Legislature. Obama himself in the past acknowledged that much of his experience was as a legislator, but during a meeting with the editorial board of the Valley News in West Lebanon, N.H., in November 2007, also noted that he had quickly built a $100 million political organization that at the time was rivaling the long-in-the-making Clinton machine. Asked at that 2007 meeting when he had first had to fire someone, Obama gave an answer that might hold water in any corporate boardroom. Obama said when he was 25, and working as a community organizer, he hired a woman who was "significantly older than me to help set up a college prep program for local young people" but that it "became clear after two to three months that she was poorly suited for the job." "It was brutal. She had left another job to take this one, and in some ways I realized it was my fault, not having recognized that she didn’t fit in this task," Obama said. "What I took from it was that you clean up your messes quickly. When you make a mistake you correct it, even when it’s hard." The ruling: Obama may not have the corporate chops of Romney, but he’s worked in several jobs in the private sector -- and had management experience. And if you count his best-selling books that have brought Obama millions of dollars in royalties, he also knows something about entrepreneurship. We rate Romney’s statement False.

pomt-04850	"(The Tax Policy Center) found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/12/new-jersey-democratic-state-committee/mitt-romneys-tax-cut-proposal-blasted-new-jersey-d/	Millionaires and billionaires could see trillions in tax cuts paid for by the middle class if Mitt Romney gets his way, New Jersey Democrats claim. Just as President Barack Obama has done in a recent campaign ad, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee has latched onto a new study from the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center. The study says that under the presumptive Republican presidential candidate’s proposals, wealthy taxpayers pay fewer taxes and middle- and lower-income taxpayers pay more. "The non-partisan organization found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires," the committee said in an Aug. 1 news release. The Democrats are right about the $2,000 tax hike on the average middle-class family, but they’re wrong in citing "$5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires." Those wealthy taxpayers would get a tax break, but not that much. First, let’s explain the purpose behind the study. Romney has proposed various tax cuts, including a 20 percent reduction in all federal income tax rates. But Romney’s plan also allows certain tax benefits for low-income households to expire. Those changes would mean lower taxes at most income levels -- but that’s before the candidate’s plan is paid for. The Romney campaign has not specified how the plan would offset that tax revenue loss, but the Tax Policy Center study gives it a shot. In short, those tax cuts would require eliminating or reducing certain tax deductions and write-offs, according to the study. Those items include mortgage interest deductions and education-related tax credits. Still, for wealthy taxpayers, the cost of losing those tax loopholes is less than the money gained from the tax cuts. That’s why they’re left with a net tax break. But for middle- and lower-income folks, it’s the other way around. They stand to lose more in tax loopholes than gain by the tax cuts, leaving them with a greater tax bill at the end of the day. So, the Democrats’ claim accurately makes that overall point, but wrongly compares the $2,000 and $5 trillion figures. Think of it as an apples-to-oranges comparison. After factoring in eliminating or reducing the tax loopholes, the average tax hike in 2015 would be about $2,000 for taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, who also have children. But the $5 trillion represents the potential tax cuts over a 10-year period before you account for eliminating or reducing those loopholes. Higher-income taxpayers would end up with a net tax break, but the total savings would be far less than $5 trillion. Here’s the number Democrats should have cited: taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1 million, on average, would get a roughly $87,000 net tax break in 2015. Take away those tax loopholes, and wealthy taxpayers would still get that amount. It’s also worth noting that Democrats are wrong to suggest only "millionaires and billionaires" would benefit from Romney’s plan. Those wealthy taxpayers would receive the greatest net tax savings, but other average taxpayers making more than $200,000 would benefit as well. For instance, taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000, on average, would receive a net tax break of roughly $1,800. Our ruling In a news release, the committee claimed the Tax Policy Center "found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires." But those two figures don’t relate to one another. The $2,000 tax hike accounts for eliminating or reducing the tax deductions and write-offs that pay for Romney’s plan, but the $5 trillion does not. The more appropriate comparison would be the average net tax break of about $87,000 for those wealthy taxpayers. Still, the Democrats’ overall point is correct: the study shows that high-income taxpayers would receive a tax break, while middle- and lower-income taxpayers pay higher taxes.

pomt-02575	"Of the 20 bills [Rep. David] Cicilline has sponsored in his three years in office, not a single one has advanced past the embryonic committee stage."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/30/ian-prior/republican-official-says-none-20-bills-us-rep-davi/	It's never easy being a member of the minority party. Ask the Republicans in the Rhode Island General Assembly or in the U.S. Senate. Ask the Democrats in the U.S. House. Ian Prior, of the National Republican Congressional Committee, raised that point in a Jan. 14, 2014, Providence Journal commentary, saying that voters in Rhode Island can’t afford to have an all-Democrat delegation to the U.S. Congress. If the Republicans retain control of the House and win the Senate in the next election, he wrote, "Rhode Island could well find itself with a complete loss of influence at the federal level." To make his point, he focused on the accomplishments of U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat. (Prior was campaign manager for Cicilline's 2012 Republican opponent, Brendan Doherty.) "To see what a lack of influence looks like, one need look no further than Representative Cicilline’s record in Congress. Of the 20 bills Cicilline has sponsored in his three years in office, not a single one has advanced past the embryonic committee stage. This is a testament to the lack of effectiveness a backbencher in the minority party has in Congress." We decided to see whether Prior was accurately describing the number and fate of Cicilline's proposals. When we contacted him, he said he was not counting legislation Cicilline has co-sponsored because it's easy to add your name to a bill someone else has drafted. Prior sent us to the website GovTrack.US, which showed Cicilline has sponsored 21 pieces of legislation, not 20. However, his count was accurate at the time he submitted his commentary. But that same website says not all of the legislation has remained stuck in committee. One bill, H.R. 2027, was reported out of the House Committee on Natural Resources on Nov. 17, 2011. It never received a vote by the House, according to the website. (That bill involved the boundaries of four coastal areas, in Newport and Middletown. It was resubmitted as H.R. 277 in the current Congress and sent back to committee on Jan. 15, 2013, where it remains.) When we asked Prior about that legislation, he said, "I did not say that he hadn't gotten a bill out of committee, but rather that it had not gotten past the 'committee phase' which includes the [House] Rules Committee." By his definition, if it doesn't get past the Rules Committee, it doesn't count as going past the "embryonic committee phase." But the database Prior used to prove his point -- and others we checked -- don't use that standard. And here's nothing "embryonic" about a bill that makes it through a committee, which is usually where most of the hard work on a bill is done. Cicilline's chief of staff, Peter Karafotas, said that if Prior "did understand the legislative process, he would know that the vast majority of bills that reach the House floor for a vote never go through the Rules Committee" and in the current Congress, "57 percent of the bills the House voted on never went through the Rules Committee. " Karafotas also argued that just looking at the number of sponsored bills reported out of committee can be misleading and oversimplifies a Congressman's influence. Karafotas said Cicilline had also sponsored 10 amendments to bills on the floor of the House, 4 of which passed. In addition, he cited 11 Cicilline amendments that were incorporated into legislation when it was in committee. He said those are just examples. Prior's larger point is that a Democrat in a Republican-controlled House or Senate will have trouble passing legislation. Darrell M. West of the Brookings Institution said there is little evidence that states with both Republicans and Democrats in their congressional delegations fare better. And he said nobody should be surprised that a Democrat can't get bills out of committee in a Republican Congress. "The Speaker (of the House) only moves bills from his own party, and that's true whether there's Republican or Democratic control," a fact that even more likely to be true "because of the extreme polarization and hyperpartisanship. Republicans never want to see a Democratic initiative see the light of day," he said. Our ruling Ian Prior said, "of the 20 bills [Rep. David] Cicilline has sponsored in his three years in office, not a single one has advanced past the embryonic committee stage." In fact, one did. In addition, 4 of the 10 amendments Cicilline offered passed. Prior’s point is that legislators in a minority party have no influence. That's true to some degree. But he is ignoring other evidence of influence that a member of Congress can wield, including amendments to Republican bills. Because his statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we rate it Half True.

pomt-11604	"The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, so okay, they’re at a record level."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/29/donald-trump/trump-gets-polar-ice-trend-backwards/	President Donald Trump, who once called climate change a hoax spread by China, downplayed concerns about global temperature trends in an interview with Piers Morgan. Morgan asked Trump if he believed that climate change exists. "There is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look – it used to not be climate change – it used to be global warming," Trump said in an interview broadcast Jan. 26. "That wasn’t working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, so okay, they’re at a record level." We looked at what’s been going on with the polar ice. Trump is wrong that the ice caps are at record levels. In March 2017, NASA published a news brief with the headline, "Sea Ice Extent Sinks to Record Lows at Both Poles." Researcher Julienne Stroeve with the National Snow and Ice Data Center said Trump’s claim was "odd." Stroeve said polar ice is at "a record low in the Arctic (around the North Pole) right now and near record low in the Antarctic (around the South Pole)." The National Snow and Ice Data Center gathers data under contracts with NASA, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps, the extent of the ice is down from the 30-year average. The key difference between the two polar zones is that the levels have bounced around more in Antarctica. This chart, based on National Snow and Ice Data Center numbers, shows the yearly averages back to 1979. In no way are the ice caps at record highs. Physicist Kent Moore at the University of Toronto said the satellite record going back to 1979 is well validated and reliable. For the Arctic ice certainly, but also broadly for the Antarctic too, Moore said "there is variability from year to year but the long-term trend is downwards." Moore did note though that some climate models are predicting a slower rate of loss than scientists have seen in the past. The White House press office pointed to a 2015 NASA report that found ice was forming in parts of Antarctica at a faster rate than it was being lost in other areas of the continent. In other words, there was a net increase in the ice mass on the continent. But a full reading of the report showed that the gains were slowing down and researchers said that in 20 to 30 years, losses would outstrip gains. We note that the study is not directly comparable to other data because it measures the ice in tons, while historically, researchers have tracked how far the ice is spread out, that is, its area, not its weight. Moore and Stroeve said the area measurements are more reliable because the observational data has been gathered over many decades. More accurate volume measurements have only recently come on line. Moore said recent work at the University of Washington suggests that even in terms of volume, the amount of polar ice has been falling. Our ruling Trump said that the ice caps are at record levels. They are not. The numbers show that the extent of the ice at both poles is smaller than it was decades ago. The shrinkage is more striking in the Arctic, but the overall trend is downward at both ends of the earth. By no means are the ice caps at record high levels. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-00277	Says New Jersey U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance was "rated among the most bipartisan in Congress."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/02/congressional-leadership-fund/new-jerseys-leonard-lance-bipartisan-least-perspec/	Labels like "conservative" and "liberal" provide a shorthand for understanding political positions. So does "bipartisan," conferring an air of grownup responsibility -- someone who won’t throw flames. A new TV ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to elect Republicans, says that GOP Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey was "rated among the most bipartisan in Congress." The ad seeks to draw a contrast with Lance’s Democratic challenger, Tom Malinowski, a former State Department official for human rights in President Barack Obama’s administration. Although there’s certainly some flame-throwing in this very ad, casting Malinowski as fiercely liberal and Lance as the adult in the room, it raised a good question: Is Lance really that bipartisan? To understand the answer, understand first that labels comes with certain conditions. Here’s how Lance got that label. Group rankings The Congressional Leadership Fund, which has no formal ties with Lance but wants to keep him in Congress, based its claim on rankings from the Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. They produce rankings of bipartisanship that are not based on single bills or issues -- say, the Affordable Care Act, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or gun rights. Instead, they assess the frequency with which a lawmaker sponsors bills that draw support from the opposite political party, and how often a member joins as a co-sponsor of a bill introduced on the other side of the partisan aisle. For all of 2017, Lance ranked 13th most bipartisan in the House of Representatives. When looking at the entirety of the previous Congress, factoring in 2015 and 2016, Lance ranked 75th. While not in the very top tier, it was high, considering the House of Representatives has 435 members (although only 427 were counted because some members served too short a time for the rankings). More groups These ranking do not count ceremonial bills or legislation to name a post office. They also are statistically weighted and standardized for such things political party, so as not to unfairly disadvantage scores of the current party in power. That’s because minority party members generally can’t move legislation without getting a sponsor from the party in power -- and therefore, they could appear to be more bipartisan. But this is just one set of ratings. So we checked others. Interest groups pushing specific agendas show different results, which is natural. For example, the League of Conservation Voters, which supports environmental legislation, says Lance voted for its positions 34 percent of the time in 2017, but he has only a 23 percent lifetime score. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, promoting a pro-business agenda, gave Lance an 86 percent score in 2017 but a 90 percent cumulative score. FreedomWorks, allied with the tea party movement, gives Lance a score of 44 so far this year, and 47 for 2017. That meant Lance had the highest tea party-related score in 2017 of anyone in the New Jersey delegation. For the sake of perspective, New Jersey isn’t a hotbed of tea party activism, and Lance has at times voted against its positions on taxes and health care. Yet the Tea Party Express recently announced it would endorse him anyway, saying Lance "has a stellar record of advocating policies that encourage economic growth, job creation, fiscal responsibility and a less intrusive federal government." Want a different viewpoint? The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, vowing to maintain reproductive and women’s health rights, gives Lance a rating of only 3 percent this year. The Human Rights Campaign, supporting legislation for LGBT rights, gave Lance a score of 48 for the combined two sessions of the 114th Congress in 2015 and 2016. That was a big leap from his score of 30 in the previous two-year session -- and only 15 in the two years before that. What a difference How does Lance stack up in New Jersey itself? GovTrack, a project that gathers data from across the partisan divide, ranked Lance second, not first, for bipartisan leadership in 2017, with Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey’s 4th Congressional District, ranked first. Yet the Lugar Center ranked Smith 24th nationally, which is not chopped liver, but it is below Lance’s rank of 13. The explanation: Different groups use different methodologies. We wondered how Congressional Quarterly, which closely follows the votes and actions of every member of Congress, summed up Lance. In a summary last updated in July 2017, Congressional Quarterly said Lance "is one of about two dozen moderate-to-mildly conservative Republicans, many of them from New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, who wield outsized influence since they can make the difference between victory and defeat for GOP leaders on high-profile legislation." He doesn't consistently vote with the party. For example, Lance was one of a handful of Republicans who voted against the repeal-and-replace health care bill in 2017 -- and thus, against his party’s position -- saying he worried it wouldn’t fully protect people with pre-existing medical conditions. Lance is also a member of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, a group equally divided between Republicans and Democrats who say they want to find bipartisan solutions to the nation's problems. Yet the website FiveThirtyEight said Lance votes in line with President Donald Trump’s positions 87.1 percent of the time. Our ruling How one views Lance can depend on ideology and agendas. There are plenty of partisan votes when he sides with his party, as the interest-group ratings show. Yet he crosses the aisle at times, especially on sponsorships and co-sponsorship, and sometimes on important messaging or substantive bills. How do we put all this together? The Congressional Leadership Fund did not say Lance was the most bipartisan member but, rather, that he was rated among the most bipartisan. Based on one standard -- sponsorships and co-sponsorships -- he was. Yet it helps to have this additional information, including the views of other rating systems and groups. We rate the claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Congressional Leadership Fund	None	None	None	2018-10-02T09:00:00	2018-09-27	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-08503	Says that "93 percent of the time John Boccieri voted with Nancy Pelosi."	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/08/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-bills-rep-john-boccieris-voting-record-pro/	Turning House Speaker Nancy Pelosi into an electoral boogeyman is all the rage this year among Republicans trying to gain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans have spent much of 2010 portraying Rep. John Boccieri as Pelosi’s clone. The GOP candidate for Boccieri’s seat, Jim Renacci, has repeatedy stated that Boccieri votes with Pelosi 94 percent of the time. The National Republican Congressional Committee label’s Boccieri as one of "Pelosi’s Puppets" on its website. It attacks his voting record in a television ad it began airing this week. "In fact, 93 percent of the time, Boccieri voted with Nancy Pelosi," the ad claims. "Nancy Pelosi can count on John Boccieri," concludes the ad, which pictures of both legislators. "What about us?" PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. The NRCC cites a Washington Post voting database to back up its contention. But Boccieri dismisses claims that he frequently votes with Pelosi as dishonest because House speakers seldom vote. The Washington Post voting database shows Pelosi has voted a mere 94 times in the past two years, while Boccieri has cast 1,550 votes. "That is just a tradition for Speakers -- they often don't vote," says Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly. " She votes on some bills, not all." The Washington Post says its database represents "the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members," rather than the frequency with which they vote with a particular party leader. It says Boccieri voted with his party 94 percent of the time over the past two years. The average party loyalty for all members is listed at 90.6 percent. Why does the NRCC claim the the Washington Post database represents how often Boccieri votes with Pelosi rather than how often he backs the Democratic majority? NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola thinks there’s no difference because Pelosi is the party leader. "Speaker Pelosi is the leader of John Boccieri’s party, and this non-partisan, independent database confirms that he votes with Speaker Pelosi and her Democratic party at almost every turn." said an email from Mazzola. The difference between the 94 percent statistic in the database and the 93 percent number in the ad may be because the Washington Post regularly updates the database, and extra votes were cast since the NRCC extracted its information. We don’t think it’s worth arguing over such a small difference. But how much would the statistic change if Boccieri’s votes were measured against the 94 votes that Pelosi actually cast? Did he vote with her 93 percent of the time? We decided to do the math. We exclude three quorum calls from our calculations because they’re noncontroversial votes where everyone says they’re "present." With those out of the picture, Boccieri voted with Pelosi in 77 out of 91 votes, an agreement ratio of 84.6 percent, which makes the Democrat from Alliance look somewhat more independent than Republicans maintain. And Boccieri differed from Pelosi on some key votes: He voted against the first incarnation of a health insurance reform bill that he ended up supporting after it was altered by the U.S. Senate. He backed an amendment designed to block tax dollars from funding abortions. He voted against a Pelosi-backed bill to restrict oil drilling after the BP spill. He supported a symbolic measure that would have blocked the government from using $350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Fund money. There still is a kernel of truth here. The NRCC’s underlying point is that Boccieri votes with the majority a lot. But the NRCC’s accuracy suffers because it chose to try to tie Boccieri to a politican it deems unpopular, rather than say what the Washington Post’s database shows. And when you look at how the House speaker’s votes match up with Boccieri’s, his support hasn’t been as lockstep as the Republicans claim. We rate the NRCC’s claim as Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04413	Paul Ryan "cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/16/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-paul-ryan-cut-embassy-security-300-/	In the vice presidential debate in Danville, Ky., Joe Biden and Paul Ryan sparred over embassy security in the wake of the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. "This lecture on embassy security — the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for," Biden said. When we checked with the Obama campaign, a spokeswoman said that the claim of a $300 million cut can be supported in either of two ways. One -- which was noted by several fact-checkers in the aftermath of the debate -- is that Ryan, as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, put forward such severe cuts in his budget proposal that, running the numbers, embassy security funding would suffer a cut of $300 million. The second was was to compare the relevant budget lines in the president’s proposed fiscal year 2012 budget to the amount passed by the House of Representatives last year. We’ll look at both of these justifications, but first, let’s outline what Obama proposed for fiscal year 2012 (figures are rounded): Worldwide Security Protection (ongoing operations): $1.45 billion Worldwide Security Protection (overseas contingency operations): $247 million Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance -- Worldwide Security Upgrades: $938 million Total: $2.64 billion Cuts from Ryan’s proposed budget The Obama administration’s Office of Management and Budget has run the numbers in the Ryan budget and argues that it will cut non-defense discretionary spending as a whole by 19 percent between 2013 and 2014. A 19 percent cut to a $2.64 billion line item works out to just over $500 million -- even more than the number Biden cited. Leaving aside whether this percentage is accurate, using it in this context is problematic. First, it’s not an immediate cut -- according to OMB, the 19 percent cut would happen in the second year of Ryan’s budget, with the first year representing a 5 percent cut. More importantly, as the Romney-Ryan campaign noted in an interview -- and as we have written in the past -- all of this is a speculative proposition. Ryan’s budget did not reduce federal expenditures across the board, and assuming that every item under Ryan’s budget would be cut equally isn’t the most accurate way to look at it. (That said, the lack of detail in Ryan’s plan has left the Romney-Ryan ticket open to such attacks.) Cuts in spending already passed by Congress Using the second justification -- comparing Obama’s request to what the GOP-controlled House voted to spend for fiscal year 2012 -- has the advantage of not being speculative. Here’s the amount passed by the House for fiscal 2012 (figures also rounded): Worldwide Security Protection (ongoing operations): $1.31 billion Worldwide Security Protection (overseas contigency operations): $247 million Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance -- Worldwide Security Upgrades: $755 million Total: $2.31 billion The difference between these two amounts is nearly $327 million -- a bit above the $300 million Biden cited. Ultimately, a final bill with slightly higher amounts than the House’s initial bill -- about $60 million more -- was passed by both chambers and signed by the president. But this approach has problems as well. For starters, Biden glosses over the fact that the president did ultimately sign the bill with the new lower funding amount, meaning he shares some responsibility for the lower level. (All presidential budget requests are opening offers that inevitably become subject to negotiation.) The main problem with Biden’s claim, however, is that it’s not really what he was referring to in his claim from the debate. Biden said Ryan "cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for," but what passed the House wasn’t Ryan’s budget blueprint -- it was an actual spending bill that emerged from the House Appropriations Committee. This may be a distinction of interest only to budget wonks, but by muddying the difference, Biden is able to hold up Ryan’s budget -- a long-standing target of Democratic attacks for its approach to Medicare and other federal programs -- as the perpetrator of the cuts, rather than the more obscure appropriations bill. Our ruling Both ways of defending the claim of a $300 million cut have some justification, but also come with problems. Extrapolating from Ryan’s budget is a speculative exercise, while the enacted appropriations figures were not directly shaped by Ryan's budget. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-14391	Says a YouTube video shows Thomas DiMassimo, the man who rushed Trump at an Ohio rally, "dragging the American flag on the ground like it was a piece of garbage."	/georgia/statements/2016/mar/17/donald-trump/trump-correct-about-video-showing-flag-desecration/	The American flag has always been an important backdrop to U.S. politics. And now it has been raised as an issue in the Donald Trump campaign, after 22-year-old Thomas DiMassimo jumped a barrier and rushed the stage March 12 at a Trump event in Dayton, Ohio. DiMassimo was promptly arrested. The DiMassimo incident and its aftermath captured much of the weekend news cycle amid concerns over repeated confrontations between pro- and anti-Trump factions. On NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd noted that after the Dayton rally, Trump tweeted a video that purportedly showed DiMassimo posing with a gun against the backdrop of an ISIS flag, with Arabic-language music playing in the background. Trump was referring to a video that, as it turns out, had been posted on YouTube in order to troll DiMassimo. PolitiFact previously looked at Trump’s DiMassimo-ISIS claim and rated it False. But Trump also made another point -- that DiMassimo had desecrated a U.S. flag. And, Trump said, there was a video to prove it. "He was walking, dragging the American flag on the ground like it was a piece of garbage," Trump told Todd. "I don’t like that, and a lot of people don’t like that." PolitiFact decided to check this claim as well. DiMassimo has numerous Atlanta connections. His mother works as manager of Atlanta’s infrastructure bond program, and his father is a metro area teacher. Cartersville attorney Lester Tate is representing the family and helped Thomas DiMassimo, who was released from jail the same day he was charged, retain an attorney in Ohio. Tate declined to comment when contacted for this fact-check. DiMassimo did not respond to an email request for comment. According to news reports, YouTube videos and his own Facebook page, DiMassimo has a history of using flag desecration as a form of protest. He ripped up a Confederate Flag at a Stone Mountain protest last year. One video, titled "Not My Flag" and uploaded by YouTube user "Tommy DiMassimo," shows DiMassimo taking part in a protest at Wright State University, where he was a student, in April 2015. The video shows him dragging a U.S. flag behind him and ultimately standing on it. The video had been viewed more than 311,000 times as of this fact-check. It had 270 likes and more than 2,300 dislikes. Mistreating the flag is an incendiary topic. There have been attempts to ban the practice throughout U.S. history, but it is not illegal, even to the point of damaging or destroying a flag. According to U.S. law, "desecration" of the flag applies to "whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States." The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Texas vs. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. vs. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), that it is unconstitutional for a government to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as symbolic speech. Text accompanying the DiMassimo video states the demonstration was held to support Valdosta State University student Eric Sheppard, who was arrested for bringing a gun on campus during a protest at the Georgia school. Sheppard also desecrated a U.S. flag in that protest. In the video of the Wright State University demonstration, a counter-protester confronts DiMassimo and the other protesters. The man is carrying a U.S. flag on a pole across his shoulder. "You need to learn respect," yells the man, who then references U.S. deaths in the Vietnam War. "I’ve got 58,000 of my brothers who died for this flag." One of the protesters yells, "You know what this stands for?" At that point, DiMassimo, who is standing on a U.S. flag, yells: "Racism, capitalism, imperialism." Our ruling Trump said Thomas DiMassimo had desecrated a U.S. flag by "dragging the American flag on the ground like it was a piece of garbage." He is correct. A YouTube video posted by DiMassimo shows him dragging a flag on the ground and later standing on it. This is offensive to many, but legal under the First Amendment. We rate Trump’s statement True.

pomt-13454	"When Moammar Gadhafi was set to visit the United Nations, and no one would let him stay in New York, Trump allowed Gadhafi to set up an elaborate tent at his Westchester County (New York) estate."	/virginia/statements/2016/sep/15/tim-kaine/kaine-accurately-recalls-time-gadhafi-had-tent-put/	Tim Kaine says Donald Trump has a fondness for dictators, including the late Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. During a speech in Wilmington, N.C., Kaine said Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, even was willing to host to the Libyan president, in 2009, two years before rebels killed Gadhafi during a NATO air campaign in that country. "When Moammar Gadhafi was set to visit the United Nations, and no one would let him stay in New York, Trump allowed Gadhafi to set up an elaborate tent at his Westchester County (New York) estate," Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said on Sept. 6. Sarah Peck, the Virginia communications director for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign, pointed us to a June 7 article in BuzzFeed News about the tent episode. BuzzFeed examined Trump’s rental of his estate to Gadhafi during the Libyan leader’s September 2009 trip to New York City, where the dictator gave a rambling address to the U.N. General Assembly. BuzzFeed noted that when Gadhafi traveled, he often did so with a North African-style tent where he could stay overnight. Before the New York trip, Libyan officials sought permission to put a tent in Central Park in Manhattan, but the North African dictator’s request was denied, according to press reports. They also sought to put the tent in Englewood, N.J., just outside the city, but local officials there balked. The tent instead was erected on Trump’s 213-acre Seven Springs estate in Bedford, a suburb north of New York City. The Journal News, a local newspaper covering that town, reported in a Sept. 24, 2009, article that Gadhafi’s plans were to entertain guests at Trump’s estate. The Libyan campsite there included the camel-patterned tent, a couch, chairs, a satellite dish and a fire pit. Those living quarters were put up without any approval from Bedford officials, who were miffed at the possibility that the notorious dictator was going to visit their town. Amid the controversy, the news media descended on the upscale neighborhood surrounding Trump’s estate to chronicle the tent flap. Bedford officials ordered the tent taken down, saying it violated zoning laws. Trump, through a spokeswoman, said in a statement that he had asked the Libyans to take down the tent. The Libyans complied but only for a while. They put it back up amid reports Gadhafi was planning to visit the estate. Town officials, under police escort, went onto the property and ordered the tent struck yet again. The tent was taken down again and hauled away the next day. Joel Sachs, Bedford’s town attorney, told us there’s no indication Gadhafi ever made it to the property. Local news reports said the Libyan leader never got to see the estate. Sachs told The Journal News in 2009 that officials at the estate said one of Gadhafi’s sons did venture to Seven Springs. Gadhafi ended up staying at Libya’s U.N. mission in midtown Manhattan. Sachs told us this week that Trump, in 2009, denied to town officials that he knew Gadhafi was the one renting space on his property, telling the town he thought it was being leased by some of his Middle Eastern business associates. Sachs said he didn’t find the denial plausible and told us that officials at the estate indicated Trump was aware of Gadhafi’s plans to use the property. The Associated Press has noted that in in the years after the episode, Trump acknowledged he rented the property to Gadhafi. "I made a lot of money with Gadhafi," Trump said in a June 5, 2016, interview on the CBS program "Face the Nation." "If you remember, he came to the country, and he had to make a deal with me because he needed a place to stay. And he paid me a fortune, never got to stay there. And it became sort of a big joke," Trump said. During an interview five years earlier on Fox News, Trump made similar comments. "I rented him a piece of land … and then I didn’t let him use the land," Trump said, according to the transcript of the March 21, 2011, Fox interview. "I don’t want to use the word ‘screw,’ but I screwed him. That’s what we should be doing. I rented him a piece of land in Bedford, New York. I rented him a piece of land. He paid me a fortune, and I didn’t let him use the land." Trump also addressed the issue in a 2011 CNN interview. "What did I do with Gadhafi? I leased him a piece of land for his tent," Trump said. BuzzFeed reported in its article that a Libyan entourage had stayed at Trump’s estate for weeks before Gadhafi’s visit to New York, as did members of a public relations firm representing Libya. Our ruling Kaine said, "When Moammar Gadhafi was set to visit the United Nations, and no one would let him stay in New York, Trump allowed Gadhafi to set up an elaborate tent at his Westchester County (New York) estate." There’s no doubt Gadhafi rented space at Trump’s estate to put up his tent. Trump acknowledges now that he leased land to Gadhafi, although he couches it as a boast to show he snookered the Libyan leader out of a lot of money.

pomt-04812	Says Gov. Scott Walker "raises the pay of inmates, but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/19/marty-beil/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-gave-raises-working-pri/	Wisconsin state employees union leader Marty Beil is no fan of Gov. Scott Walker. And his criticism has not relented since Walker survived an historic recall election in June 2012. Beil took aim at Walker on July 19, 2012 in an interview with John "Sly" Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host on WTDY AM-FM in Madison. Walker "raises the pay of inmates," Beil complained, "but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions." In 2011, Walker curbed state employees’ collective bargaining powers and cut their take-home pay by forcing them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance. He also put tighter restrictions on overtime for corrections workers. But has the Republican governor increased the pay of inmates who work in prisons, yet not given raises to the officers who work there? Beil's evidence Beil is executive director of the Madison-based Council 24 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, which represents corrections officers and a variety of other state employees. Asked for evidence to back his claim, he forwarded to us a May 2012 email from Lizzie Tegels, warden of the New Lisbon Correctional Institution, a 500-cell, medium-security prison 80 miles northwest of Madison. It says the prison would no longer pay a lower wage to inmates during their first 60 days of work. Paying new inmate workers a few pennies per hour less during their probationary period costs more -- in staff time to adjust pay rates -- than if the inmates received the regular wage, the email said. So, this isn’t giving any working inmates a pay raise. Rather, inmates new to working would get a higher starting wage than they would have previously, but only during their first two months on the job. Beil told us the change wasn't occurring only at New Lisbon, but suggested we contact the Department of Corrections for details. Since Beil's claim was aimed at Walker, we contacted the governor's office, as well as the Department of Corrections. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and DOC spokeswoman Linda Eggert confirmed that corrections employees have not received a general raise since Walker took office in January 2011. Indeed, lawmakers in November 2011 imposed a two-year pay freeze on state employees, although merit raises can be given. So, the second part of Beil’s claim, that corrections workers haven’t gotten any raises under Walker, is correct. DOC response As for inmate pay, the governor’s spokesman provided a response written by the office of Corrections Secretary Gary Hamblin. According to the memo: Wisconsin prisons can pay working inmates a lower wage during their probation period, but most don't; neither does Badger State Industries, which oversees the manufacturing of license plates and other goods made by inmates. Eliminating the lower pay rate at New Lisbon means that current and future workers now start at the regular pay grade. That ranges from 9 to 42 cents an hour (and 1 to 20 cents through Badger State Industries). About 1,000 inmates work at New Lisbon, with about 20 to 25 on probationary status at any given time. Eggert said DOC surveyed all prisons after we contacted her and found that none had given inmates any raises or eliminated lower probationary rates like New Lisbon did. So, the higher pay rate is limited to the relatively few working inmates at one prison, and only applies to their first two months on the job. Our rating Beil said Walker has raised the pay of working inmates, "but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions." Neither group, however, has received a pay raise. The pay rate at one prison is now higher for new workers during their two-month probation period, but that was done not to give inmates raises but to save money for taxpayers. Since Beil’s statement has only an element of truth, and leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14649	Says Donald Trump "thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/24/bernie-sanders/yes-donald-trump-really-did-tweet-climate-change-h/	For the second time in a week on national TV, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders attacked Republican candidate Donald Trump by citing Trump’s views on climate change. Trump "thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese," Sanders said Jan. 24 on NBC’s Meet the Press, echoing a similar statement he made in the Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, S.C. (Watch the clip.) Did Trump really say that? He definitely tweeted that view once in 2012, though he has since distanced himself a bit from that theory. The clearest example comes from a tweet sent by Trump on Nov. 6, 2012. "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." So Sanders certainly has evidence to support his claim. But Trump has somewhat backed off after Sanders' comments, calling the Chinese link a "joke." On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump’s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, "Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business." So Trump has said his 2012 tweet was a joke. However, he has used the word "hoax" repeatedly in describing climate change, although he doesn’t always fault China. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a "hoax" Pants on Fire.) Most recently, on Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., "Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it." That’s three times using "hoax" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since that 2012 tweet. On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, "NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?" On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: "Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!" That same day, he tweeted, "Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense." Trump also called climate change a "hoax" on Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. Trump said on Sept. 24, 2015, on CNN’s New Day, "I don’t believe in climate change." And as we noted earlier, even when calling his earlier tweet a joke, Trump on Jan. 18, 2016, said that climate change "is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change." Our ruling Sanders said that Trump "thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese." Trump did tweet that view in 2012. Whether Trump still feels that way is less clear. Asked about it recently, the real estate developer called it a joke. However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a "hoax" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China "invented" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change "is done for the benefit of China."

pomt-03653	Federal prosecutions for lying on background checks to buy guns are "down 40 percent" under President Barack Obama.	/virginia/statements/2013/may/01/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-us-prosecutions-lying-gun-backgroun/	U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, wants the Department of Justice to strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws before Congress adds more. He was part of a panel on ABC’s "This Week with George Stephanopoulos" on April 14 and criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for lax prosecution of people caught lying on federal background checks necessary to purchase to guns. "Enforcement is down 40 percent overall in his administration," Goodlatte said. U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., challenged the statement. "George Bush’s presidency had the same dismal record on enforcement of the background check as this presidency has during the last four years," he said. We decided to check whether enforcement is down 40 percent under Obama, a figure Goodlatte cited three days before gun control legislation failed in the U.S. Senate. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System began operating in 1998. It’s an automated system that enables a gun seller to instantly check a series of state and federal databases to determine whether a potential purchaser is eligible to buy a gun under national and state laws. A very low percentage -- about 1 or 2 percent -- are rejected each year, usually for a felony conviction or indictment. Other reasons, such as adjudication for mental illness or an outstanding order of protection, are also grounds for denial. Goodlatte’s spokeswoman sent us to TRAC, a Syracuse University website that collects monthly data from the Department of Justice. We looked there, as well as the department’s original reports. We focused only on prosecutions resulting from background checks -- as opposed to prosecution of other gun offenses -- because Goodlatte’s comments were directed at background checks. We also ignored prosecutions by state officials because the congressman’s statement referred to the presidential role. Federal prosecution data is available from 2002 through 2010, except for 2004. During the six years data is available for former President George W. Bush’s administration -- 2002-2003 and 2005-2008 -- a total of 628 federal cases were prosecuted as a result of failed background checks. That averages about 105 annually. Only two years of statistics are available for Obama’s administration: 77 cases were prosecuted in 2009 and 44 in 2010. That averages to about 61 annually. Another year of data should be released this summer. When we compare the administrations -- realizing there are years of data missing for each -- there has been a 42 percent decline in average annual prosecutions between the Bush and Obama years. So Goodlatte’s claim sounds right, but it’s missing important context: The Justice Department has never placed a high priority on pursuing perjury charges from background checks. There are about 70,000 denials for gun purchases a year. Under Bush, 15/100th of 1 percent of the cases were prosecuted. Under Obama, 8/100th of 1 percent of the cases were prosecuted. Goodlatte glossed over this fact as he assigned blame to Obama. He set up his statement with some quick statistics: "We have determined of the 76,000 people who were found to have lied on the background check in 2010, 4,700 of them were referred by the ATF for further investigation and prosecution, 62 of them were prosecuted," he said. (We should note that 62 prosecutions is inaccurate; the correct number is 44). "Every Republican on the House Judiciary Committee signed a letter to the president and the attorney general asking why that is and why there isn’t greater enforcement," Goodlatte continued. "Enforcement is down 40 percent overall in his administration. The answer we got about the background checks was, `those are paper crimes.’" Goodlatte didn’t respond when Gutierrez said the Bush and Obama administrations "had the same dismal record." Why is Uncle Sam reluctant to prosecute these cases? A 2004 reportfrom the Department of Justice’s inspector general provided several answers. It said agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms viewed the violations "as distracting from more important cases, such as those involving firearms, traffickers, gangs, arson and explosives" and "saw little purpose in investigating a standard case in which the NICS successfully prohibited a person from purchasing a firearm." The report also said that the cases lack "jury appeal" for prosecutors because it is difficult to prove that a prohibited person intentionally lied on the background check and in many parts of the nation "juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle." Our ruling Goodlatte said enforcement of laws against lying on federal background checks for gun purchases "is down 40 percent" under Obama. The congressman had the percentage right, but he glossed over the law’s history of lax enforcement. During the Bush and Obama administrations, only a tiny fraction of 1 percent of the violations was prosecuted. The Justice Department has seen little value in prosecuting cases in which background checks have already stopped prohibited people from buying guns. Goodlatte, in seeking to level partisan blame, offered a juicy statistic without context. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2013-05-01T06:00:00	2013-04-14	['None']
pomt-10312	John McCain will keep the estate tax at 0 percent, the same as it is now.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/chain-email/larger-estates-will-be-taxed-just-like-now/	A chain e-mail claims that Sen. Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false. Here, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about McCain and the estate tax, which it refers to as the inheritance tax. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read our full article here . The e-mail claims that President George W. Bush "repealed" the estate tax, and it now stands at 0 percent. Though Bush reduced the tax, he did not repeal it. Rather, under his 2001 tax cut package, the estate tax reduces every year and then goes away for just a single year — 2010 — before reverting back to higher rates. (See the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center on estate taxes for more details.) Currently, the estate tax generally applies only to estates worth more than $2-million (or $4-million for couples). Above those amounts, the tax rate tops out at 45 percent. Both Obama and McCain support renewing the current estate tax with a few changes. McCain proposes to increase the exemption to $5-million ($10-million for couples) and reduce the tax rate to 15 percent. Obama proposes to increase the exemption to $3.5-million ($7-million for couples) and leave the top rate at 45 percent. Although the e-mail captures the broad idea that McCain wants to reduce estate taxes more than Obama, it is wrong when it says McCain wants a "0 percent" estate tax, and it's also wrong that the estate tax is at zero percent now.

pomt-02966	"Woodrow Wilson borrowed $30 billion to fund World War I in 1917. That money has not been paid back. And we are still paying interest on it."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/23/andrew-napolitano/fox-news-andrew-napolitiano-says-us-still-paying-i/	The recent fight over raising the debt ceiling -- the limit on how much debt the federal government can carry at a given time -- has brought added scrutiny to the history of the United States’ reliance on debt to finance its operations. During a recent Fox News interview, legal commentator Andrew Napolitano offered an arresting factoid. "The government today will borrow money to pay debt on money it has already borrowed and spent," he said. "I’ll give you one statistic. Woodrow Wilson borrowed $30 billion to fund World War I in 1917. That money has not been paid back. And we are still paying interest on it. That’s 95 years ago." Really? We’re still paying off the cost of World War I? We checked with experts to see if Napolitano is correct. The United States government borrowed a fair amount during the World War I era. Hostilities related to World War I began in 1914, but the United States officially entered the war against Germany in April 1917 and against Austria-Hungary in December 1917. According to Treasury Department statistics on annual debt loads for the United States, the nation’s total debt rose by $23.8 billion between July 1, 1916 (the last available figure before war was declared on Germany) and July 1, 1919 (the first available date after the armistice that ended the war). That’s less than Napolitano said, but a different Treasury data source -- the department’s annual report from June 1920 -- said the U.S. had borrowed a total of $37 billion to finance the war. These two figures average out to about $30 billion, so we’ll accept Napolitano’s figure as a plausible estimate. To finance the war, the government sold Liberty Bonds and Victory Loans. Our first thought upon hearing Napolitano’s claim was that there were still Americans with fraying security certificates in their safe deposit boxes who receive periodic interest payments from the Treasury. But this is not the case. When we contacted the Treasury Department for this story, officials did some digging and found that there are actually still eight Liberty Bonds and two Victory Notes that haven’t yet been redeemed. However, these financial instruments have been mature since 1947, so they haven’t earned any interest for almost 70 years. (Their total value, however, isn’t shabby -- almost $4.2 million.) Napolitano told PolitiFact that he wasn’t referring to ongoing interest payments. Instead, he was referring to the fact that the World War I-era debt was "rolled over." For further explanation, we turned to Linda M. Hooks, an economist at Washington & Lee University. "The initial debt issued to pay for the war no longer exists," Hooks said. "However, Treasury debt gets ‘rolled over.’ That is, the Treasury sells new bonds to pay off the old bonds that are maturing. So those bonds did mature and get paid off, but the Treasury sold new bonds to pay them off, and then sold new bonds when the second batch matured, and so on." So, Hooks said, "in that sense, you could say the debt is still out there. However, it would be very hard to assign any specific current bond to that specific historical incident." Other experts are even more skeptical of Napolitano’s characterization of rolled-over debt as being "not paid back." Since the public debt has not been zeroed out since 1835, by Napolitano’s argument, "we are still paying off Civil War debt or even the cost of the 1848 Mexican War," said Franklin Noll, a historian of United States government financial and monetary history. And that, he added, doesn’t make sense. Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor who specializes in economics, agrees, calling Napolitano’s claim "obviously false." All rolling over debt means, he said, is that federal elected officials have decided that it makes more sense to borrow money to finance other priorities than to increase taxes. "Every well-run business does this," Buchanan said. "A company might borrow money to build a new office headquarters, and years later its total debt might be higher than it was when the headquarters was financed. That doesn't mean the company is still paying interest on the loans to build the headquarters. It means that the company found that it had better things to do with its money than reduce its debt. Any growing enterprise will do that, and the U.S. economy has been growing for over 200 years, with occasional setbacks." Our ruling Napolitano said that "Woodrow Wilson borrowed $30 billion to fund World War I in 1917. That money has not been paid back. And we are still paying interest on it." The original Liberty Bonds and Victory Notes stopped paying interest decades ago. But Napolitano argues that, because the United States has never subsequently zeroed out its debt, the original World War I debt has been rolled over countless times, leaving subsequent bondholders to pay off a small, ancestral fraction of that old debt. That’s one way of looking at it, but not a view that carries much weight with experts, who call the rollover method straightforward and uncontroversial. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10174	"You know, we spent $3-million to study the DNA of bears in Montana."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/bear-study-funding-actually-undersold/	A joke meant to highlight a serious issue about wasteful federal spending apparently went over well enough before an audience in Orange County, Calif., last month, that John McCain decided to trot it out before a national audience at the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008. "You know, we spent $3-million to study the DNA of bears in Montana," McCain said at the debate. "I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3-million of our taxpayers' money. And it has got to be brought under control." The bear study in Montana has become a go-to line in McCain’s stump speeches, and we fact-checked an almost identical line when McCain said it before an audience of evangelicals at Saddleback Church in Orange County, Calif., on Aug. 16, 2008. The U.S. Geological Survey is indeed conducting a study that involves the DNA of bears in Montana, but the Northern Divide Grizzly Bear Project actually has received more earmarked funding than McCain mentions — to the tune of $4.8-million, according to Katherine C. Kendall, the researcher in charge of the study. The study had received $3.1-million in earmarked money by 2003, the year McCain first started taking aim at the project (he mentioned it on the Senate floor as part of a speech criticizing earmarks). But apparently McCain's campaign rhetoric hasn't been updated to reflect the additional $1.69-million the study's gotten since 2003. And, strictly speaking, the point of the project isn't really to analyze the bears' DNA, it's to use their DNA to take a census. The researchers collect hair left when the grizzlies scratch themselves on trees, then use DNA extracted from the hair to identify individual bears. This helps researchers count the number of grizzlies that live in Montana, considered one of the last strongholds of this endangered species. Kendall said it's a much cheaper — and safer — way to count them than traditional methods, which involve capturing grizzly bears and saddling them with satellite collars. It also has resulted in doubling the previous population estimates. The new figures, when paired with the results of another study on population trends, may eventually lead to removing grizzlies from the endangered list. McCain's math is a little dated. And he clearly is suggesting "the study of bear DNA" is a frivolous use of federal money, but we won't argue the merits of the project. McCain claims $3-million in federal money has been used to study the DNA of bears, and that's Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-26T00:00:00	2008-09-26	['Montana']
pomt-00325	Since 2009, "millions of Americans have lost their health care plans."	/missouri/statements/2018/sep/20/josh-hawley/hawleys-claim-lost-health-care-plans-has-it-upside/	Josh Hawley, Missouri's attorney general and Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, is taking a strong stance on health care and the effects of the Affordable Care Act as he campaigns across Missouri. The act, signed into law in early 2010 by President Barack Obama, has a goal of providing accessible and affordable health insurance to more people. It also sought to expand Medicaid and provide support for medical research techniques aimed at decreasing health care costs. In an Aug. 20 op-ed for the Springfield News-Leader, Hawley again focused on the Affordable Care Act. "McCaskill told us that if we liked our healthcare plans, we could keep them. She said the cost of health insurance would go down. She said prescription drug prices would fall. She lied. Since then, millions of Americans have lost their health care plans." Because of the contradiction between Hawley’s assertion and the promises of the ACA to insure more Americans, we decided to take a closer look. Where do his claims come from? When we asked his campaign team about the claim, we were linked to a Washington Post blog by Sarah Kliff from 2013. This blog, along with several other supporting documents sent to us, focuses on cancellation notices sent out by insurance providers to those with plans that were grandfathered in when the Affordable Care Act took effect. "Grandfathered plans" are plans that didn’t meet ACA standards but were still allowed to be sold as coverage for a period of time after the ACA was enacted. The notices made people aware that their grandfathered plans were being phased out of the insurance marketplace, as explained by Kliff in her post. They also provided other coverage options and at least 90 days notice prior to the plan being discontinued, per government requirements for the individual health insurance market. On the surface, these notices can seem alarming, so we reached out to experts to see if they actually meant that people who received them lost health care coverage. Benjamin Sommers, associate professor of health policy and economics at Harvard University, said it is entirely possible that some people who received cancellation notices lost health care coverage, but only if they didn’t seek new coverage. Most individuals would have been able to obtain new coverage after receiving a cancellation notice. "Many of those individuals were likely eligible for subsidized coverage under the ACA and may have been able to switch onto those plans, in some cases at lower cost," said Sommers. How did the ACA affect the number of covered Americans? A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows that in the years following the enactment of the health care act, the percentage of uninsured Americans ages 18-64 has steadily dropped from 22.3 percent in 2010 to almost 12 percent this year. The biggest drop during the time when the main provisions of the ACA took effect was between 2013 and 2015. We spoke to expert Loren Adler, associate director for the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, about the number of Americans the policy incorporated. He noted that roughly 20 million more people gained health care coverage during this time period. Cicily Hampton, senior director of health science and policy at the Society for Public Health Education, said the uninsured rate is likely to rise after Congress dropped the individual mandate in its December 2017 tax bill. The individual mandate penalizes people who did not buy any health insurance although they could afford to by requiring them to pay a fee, subsequently causing more people to purchase insurance plans. By removing this, some Americans may not purchase health insurance because they will no longer be fined for doing so. Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Josh Hawley wrote in an op-ed for the Springfield News-Leader that "millions of Americans have lost their healthcare plans." He has focused in on this issue as a part of his campaign. But our experts and even the source provided by Hawley’s team contradicted this, clarifying that just because you received a cancellation notice doesn’t mean that you no longer have health insurance. Hawley’s claim is misleading because it asserts that coverage was automatically lost. Other options and a sizable time period were given to those experiencing cancellations. Coverage was only lost if a new plan was not sought out by the individual before his or her previous plan was phased out. For those reasons, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08328	Vows to keep Georgia's race for governor "civil" and focused on the "positive."	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/29/nathan-deal-and-roy-barnes/candidates-claims-run-civil-campaign-veer-track/	Well, everybody seemed to be on the same page when it all started. The 3-month-old race between former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, and former Congressman Nathan Deal, a Republican, to determine who will become Georgia's next governor was to be a civil affair, hard-focused on the key issues. Or, so said both campaigns at the outset. Just listen to Deal spokesman Brian Robinson in a Sept. 13 metro Atlanta television interview: "They [voters] want a positive vision and Nathan Deal will offer [that] in tone and in message." Or Barnes himself in an Aug. 11 TV interview: "You know, it’s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. … just because we have differences, doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names." Oh really now? We thought today -- four days before Election Day -- would be a good time to look back at those lofty campaign goals as the governor’s race nears the finish line. Voters go to the polls on Tuesday to choose between Deal, Barnes or Libertarian John Monds. And they’ll have to wade through a lot of noise from one of the nastiest campaigns in recent Georgia history to cast their ballots for the state's next chief executive. Here are a few of the campaign’s lowlights, brought to you by the campaigns and their Republican and Democratic surrogates: -- Dale Peterson, a failed GOP candidate for Alabama’s agriculture chief, weighs in with a YouTube video for Deal on behalf of the Republican Governors Association. Wearing a white cowboy hat and brandishing a vintage lever-action rifle across his shoulders, Peterson reminds viewers that Georgia voters fired Barnes in 2002 after one term in office: "He screwed things up so badly y'all chunked him out." Peterson adds: "He's just the same old amb’lance chaser he’s always been." -- The Barnes camp enlisted its own cast of colorful rural types in a television ad that featured two old geezers sipping coffee in a folksy cafe. They incrementally ramp up the trash talk as they bash Deal. Finally one of them delivers a zinger: "He’s slippery as a bag of snakes," one man intones as the pair breaks into howls of laughter. And those were just warm-up exercises in character assassination that prefaced what was to become outright fabrication by both camps. -- The Barnes camp conceded that it added fake audio questions to the soundtrack of a TV ad that shows Deal leaving a debate, apparently trying to evade reporters. "Why won't you answer questions?" a male reporter appears to yell at Deal in the ad. Then a woman yells: "Why won't you answer questions?" Trouble was, those reporters did not exist. The Barnes camp simply added audio to make the footage appear more dramatic. -- The Deal camp, meanwhile, ran a TV ad showing a "quote" from a Barnes campaign aide that was never uttered. The ad quoted Barnes spokeswoman Anna Ruth Williams saying, "Barnes represented the child molester." She never said those words. The Deal campaign later attributed the quote to an "Ann Williams." And then there were the just-plain-awful, highly misleading attacks by both camps on the other candidate’s voting records two decades back: -- In one, Barnes accused Deal of trying to weaken Georgia's rape shield law. PolitiFact Georgia earlier ruled that Half True because it left out critical context. A male narrator in the ad asks viewers to consider "How many rapes would go unreported?" if the rape shield law had been weakened. -- Deal, meanwhile, accused Barnes of trying to make it more difficult to convict child molesters. PolitiFact Georgia ruled that one Barely True, finding it contained only a trace of truthfulness. "Barnes voted against a bill in the state Senate that would have made it easier to gain convictions in child abuse cases," Deal said in a press release. University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said this year’s campaign is one for the books when you rate it on the Nastymeter. "It’s unprecedented for Georgia," Bullock said. "It’s been the harshest campaign we’ve seen for governor." Much of the uncivil behavior was predictable. Both campaigns had huge war chests, and well-heeled allies on both the Democratic and Republican fronts were more than willing to join the fray. Polls have shown the race relatively close, which always makes for a bruising campaign. And both Barnes and Deal have long political records each side can target. Kennesaw State University professor Kerwin Swint, who teaches a class on campaigns and elections, said Barnes and Deal have resorted to attack ads for a simple reason: They work. "It does with regular voters because they’re more likely to pay attention," said Swint. "It puts attention on the other candidate’s vulnerability." But it also leads to an uninformed electorate, numbed by the endless attacks and counterattacks. Somewhere amid it all, the real issues confronting Georgia get lost. Smoke is rising from this gubernatorial battleground, and it long ago obscured both camps' vows to run a "civil" and "positive" campaign. The race has been about as uncivil and negative as they come. We give both the Deal and Barnes campaigns our lowest rating: Pants On Fire.	None	Roy Barnes and Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-10-29T06:00:00	2010-10-28	['None']
pomt-03659	"One in five" women in the military "are receiving unwanted sexual contact," as are "3.3 percent of men."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/29/kirsten-gillibrand/kirsten-gillibrand-says-one-five-military-women-3-/	In an interview with MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand offered a striking statistic about sexual misconduct in the military. "We've had sexual assaults in the military forever," Gillibrand said on April 23, 2013, but "a new report the DOD published found is that one in five ... women are receiving unwanted sexual contact, but also 3.3 percent of men." We wondered if Gillibrand -- who is sponsoring legislation on the matter -- was reporting the numbers accurately. The report Gillibrand mentioned is the Health-Related Behaviors Survey of Active Duty Military Personnel from the U.S. Defense Department. (Gillibrand shorthands the agency as the DOD). The study, which samples tens of thousands of members of the military anonymously, is undertaken every three years. The just-released report covers 2011, addressing such issues as alcohol and tobacco use, mental health and other issues. The study found that 21.7 percent of women had experienced "unwanted sexual contact ... since joining the military, by someone in the military." (It found that 5.8 percent had experienced unwanted sexual contact by a civilian since joining the military.) The comparable percentage for men experiencing unwanted sexual contact was 3.3 percent (by a member of the military) and 2.4 percent (by a civilian). So Gillibrand has accurately reported the percentages. The only element of her claim that’s slightly misleading is that she referred to service members who "are receiving unwanted sexual contact." That makes it sound like they are currently having unwanted contact or had it in the recent past. In fact, the statistics refer to unwanted contact that happened "since joining the military," which, for some survey respondents with long tenures in the military, may have been years ago. It’s worth noting that the percentages have risen since the 2008 survey. That year, 12.4 percent of women and 2.2 percent of men had experienced unwanted contact. (The 2008 survey did not distinguish between contact by members of the military and civilians.) In addition, only a small fraction of these cases are reported to the authorities, and only some of those proceed to trial. The report is unclear about whether the increase from 2008 to 2011 stems from a rise in the number of incidents or fuller reporting of the incidents that do occur. Whatever the reason, the report did say that "reported rates of unwanted sexual contact, particularly among female service members, warrant attention and action." Our ruling Gillibrand said that "one in five" women in the military "are receiving unwanted sexual contact," as are "3.3 percent of men." Her phrasing is somewhat misleading because her words suggest more recent incidents than the survey indicates. The survey included incidents anytime since the person joined the military. Still, her numbers are correct. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Kirsten Gillibrand	None	None	None	2013-04-29T10:09:48	2013-04-23	['None']
pomt-06721	Says potential GOP U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson supported "Obamacare"	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/31/club-growth/club-for-growth-says-potential-Republican-US-Senat/	Ever since former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson surfaced as a potential candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2012, the conservative Club for Growth has waged a campaign to stop him from becoming the Republican nominee. The anti-tax group argues that rather than Thompson, who served as the health and human services secretary under GOP President George W. Bush, Wisconsin Republicans should support "a pro-growth conservative." In casting Thompson as not conservative enough, Club for Growth has focused on the signature legislation of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency: the federal health care reform law, which Republicans have labeled "Obamacare." Club for Growth launched its campaign on May 18, 2011, the day after Thompson was mentioned in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as a possible candidate for the seat being vacated by 23-year Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl. The group issued a statement saying Thompson "supported Obamacare," following it the next day with an Internet ad claiming he "was a champion of Obamacare." The attacks continued, with Club for Growth saying in late May 2011 that Thompson helped implement the law; in June 2011, that he is (rather than was) a champion of the law; and in mid-August 2011, that he supported "Obamacare." Then in a TV ad released Aug. 23, 2011, Club for Growth, as it did in its Internet ad, used a video clip in which Obama says Thompson supports health care reform. That’s quite a few statements. But the main claim is that Thompson, who is expected to launch a formal campaign committee after Labor Day, supported "Obamacare." That is the claim we’ll test. The health care reform plan is formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Signed into law by Obama in March 2010, it aims to expand health care coverage, control costs and improve delivery of services. We asked Barney Keller, a spokesman for Club for Growth -- which has a Wisconsin affiliate that has not joined in the criticism of Thompson -- for evidence to back the national group’s claim. He cited six developments: Oct. 4, 2009: The White House issued a statement from Thompson and Dick Gephardt, the former Democratic House majority leader from Missouri, saying the health care reform bill to be considered by the Senate Finance Committee has "some issues that remain troublesome and unresolved," but that it was "another important step toward achieving the goal of health care reform this year." The statement also said: "Failure to reach an agreement on health reform this year is not an acceptable option." Oct. 9, 2009: In his weekly address to the nation, Obama said the Senate Finance Committee version of health care reform would soon be merged with reform bills produced by other congressional committees. Obama also said Thompson was among Republicans who had "come out in support of reform." It was a video clip from that address that Club for Growth used in its ads. Oct. 13, 2009: Thompson wrote an article for the liberal Huffington Post website, saying health reform legislation before Congress "offers a big opportunity to lower our nation's health costs by expanding the use of "community health teams." He urged the bill being considered by the Senate be amended to "provide increased support for CHTs." So, looking only at Club for Growth’s first three points, Thompson expressed reservations about the health care reform legislation as it stood at the time, but also spoke favorably of it. Club for Growth’s other three points cited developments after the bill became law. June 30, 2010: Thompson was pictured with Obama’s health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, and other former federal officials in a photo on the White House website. Sebelius wrote in a blog post that Thompson and others who attended a meeting with her that day "offered some great ideas about implementation and outreach, suggestions about strategies to make sure that the Affordable Care Act is successful." So, Thompson participated in a meeting on implementing the law, but that isn’t evidence that he supported the law or all its provisions. Nov. 2, 2010: Asked why he didn’t think Republicans would try to repeal the law, Thompson said on CNBC: "I think because when you -- when it's all said and done, you're not going to be able to repeal health care because President Obama is not going to sign it and they don't have enough votes to override a veto. So why push a cart up hill when you know it's not going to be able to get to the top?" Thompson’s statement argues that repealing the law wasn’t possible, it doesn’t by itself express support for the law. June 27, 2011: In another Huffington Post article, Thompson urged governors to set up health insurance exchanges as a "market-based solution" that would allow insurance companies to compete in their states. If the governors didn’t act, he warned, the federal government would set up the exchanges. Again, Thompson’s statement itself doesn’t express direct support for the law, but rather warns what would happen under the law if governors didn’t set up the exchanges. So, that is Club for Growth’s case that Thompson supported health care reform. We asked Darrin Schmitz, a consultant to Thompson, for a response to the claim. He made six points in arguing that Thompson never supported what became law. "Thompson does support health care reform," Schmitz said. "He has never made a secret of that. But there is no evidence he supported Obamacare -- because he didn't." The points cited by Thompson: June 17, 2008: Thompson said at a forum on health care reform, nearly four months before Obama was elected: "I don’t want a mandate" forcing people to buy health insurance. That’s accurate, but Thompson also said moments later: "I’m not opposed to it, I just don’t think it’s the most practical way." So, it’s clear Thompson had reservations about a central component of health care reform, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance. But that doesn’t establish that Thompson opposed the entire plan. Sept. 23, 2009: Thompson told a Fox News affiliate in Washington, D.C.: "The problem is (Obama) is reaching for other items that divide us. And I’m trying to pull us back together as Americans to what really unites us." Thompson had been asked whether Obama was communicating effectively on health care reform. The quote is accurate, although Thompson preceded that comment by saying there should be hope that a health care reform bill can be adopted because "everybody can rally around" changes he advocated that "take up about 90 percent of health care." So, Thompson expressed support for a reform bill being passed, but he had differences with Obama. Oct. 14, 2009: After Democrats produced a TV ad that referenced Thompson and criticized other Republicans for not supporting health care reform, Thompson told Fox News he protested to the White House and the ad was taken down. He said had not given permission to be used in an ad that criticized Republicans. Asked whether he supported the reform bill, Thompson said: "Not this one." Thompson also said in the interview: "What I’m trying to do is bring the parties together, saying there’s 80 percent of this health care bill that both political parties can support, which would be good for America ....Let’s team up together, let’s get something done." So, Thompson voiced opposition to the legislation, although he said it contained many good elements and that he wanted some type of reform legislation approved. Dec. 20, 2009: Thompson said in another statement issued with Gephardt: "The bill before the Senate this week isn't and shouldn't be the final answer, but the status quo is simply unacceptable." The statement also said: "Let's work together on a bipartisan basis to make this a reality." That is Thompson again stating reservations about the legislation, but expressing opposition to the status quo, not to the legislation. March 20, 2010: On the day the House approved the reform bill, which had already been approved by the Senate, Thompson said the legislation "has the potential to change the current social services fabric because the health insurance transformation that will pass will be the beginning of a government-controlled health care system." Thompson had been asked whether the bill would "fundamentally alter the social safety net." His brief response certainly was critical of the final legislation. We found that in 2007, during his brief run for president, Thompson expressed opposition to a government-run health care system and support for market-based alternatives. He reiterated that position in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee in May 2008, prior to Obama’s election. June 15, 2011: Thompson said the law "has got to be repealed and replaced and re-written." Thompson’s opposition to the law, made to Republican donors after criticism of his stance on the reform law had escalated, is not evidence that he didn’t support the measure earlier. So, where has this review put us? Preferring that a more conservative Republican run for an open U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin in 2012, Club for Growth has repeatedly claimed that Thompson supported "Obamacare." It’s a potentially pivotal question, particularly among conservative voters in a primary election, should Thompson enter the race. The evidence shows he expressed both support and opposition to the health care reform legislation that eventually became law. On the one hand: Thompson described the measure, as it worked through Congress, as "another important step" toward achieving health care reform and as a "big opportunity" to lower health care costs. On the other hand: The day after calling the bill a "big opportunity," Thompson said he opposed the measure. Two months later, he said the bill wasn’t "the final answer," but that keeping the status quo was "simply unacceptable." Thompson never came out clearly for or against what became law, despite the fact that he now says he supports repealing it. He made it possible for Club for Growth to claim he supported Obamacare and for himself to deny he supported it. There is evidence to support both positions. We rate Club for Growth’s statement Half True.

pomt-05744	"In some communities, for $10,000 worth of (PIP) coverage it’s $1,500 a year."	/florida/statements/2012/mar/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-floridians-pay-1500-pip-premium/	Gov. Rick Scott says abuse of Florida’s auto insurance law is forcing drivers to pay more for their car insurance. He’s made reforming the law, also known as personal injury protection, or PIP, his second-highest priority this legislative session. He appealed to people’s purse strings in a recent interview with WTSP Tampa Bay. "It impacts the poorest families in our community the most. In some communities, for $10,000 worth of coverage it’s $1,500 a year," Scott said. "It’s just money out of families’ pockets that they could put into education, food, shelter." If Scott’s right, that’s a steep annual fee for not much protection. We wanted to know if it’s true, and for whom. A primer on PIP before we get rolling: The requirement is meant to guarantee treatment from injuries sustained during auto accidents, regardless of who is at fault. Over recent years, officials say, the system has been abused by people staging car accidents to collect money for treatment they do not need. We previously checked a claim from Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater that Florida is the No. 1 state in the country for staged car accidents. We rated that Mostly True. For this fact-check, we asked an array of people interested in the PIP fight if Scott’s figures are right. State officials and insurance industry representatives pointed us to a report from Florida’s PIP Working Group, coordinated by the state’s insurance consumer advocate at the request of her boss, Atwater. The 65-page report bills the information in its PIP review as the "most reliable and current insurance and claims data available." It offers average PIP premiums from two insurance companies for different kinds of motorists with mostly clean driving histories. It focuses on three cities with high allegations of PIP fraud: Tampa, Orlando, Hialeah. The working group only examined premiums from State Farm, which insures one in five vehicles in Florida, and Direct General, a "non-standard" company that typically takes on high-risk motorists. The other major state insurers -- Geico, Allstate and Progressive -- are not included. The report shows instances of high PIP premiums that match Scott’s estimate. For instance, a young Hialeah professional with State Farm and one minor violation and one not-at-fault accident paid $1,765 for PIP coverage in 2011. In Tampa, the premium for the same person was $1,077. According to the same report, an average family with teen drivers and two vehicles purchasing Direct General insurance would pay $1,571. The cost is even higher in some cases, escalating more than $800 over three years. In Hialeah, the average family with teen drivers and two vehicles and no accidents or violations on State Farm paid $2,450 in 2008 and $3,270 in 2011. We asked the state how many drivers might be included in each of these categories -- since the report targets specific insurance companies, specific cities and specific types of drivers -- but we did not receive an answer by our deadline. So while we do not know the sample size of the data, we do know that $10,000 worth of PIP coverage in Florida can cost $1,500 or more each year. But Scott made a broader claim in his WTSP interview -- that the cost of coverage is dependent on your community, not necessarily your personal situation, your insurance carrier or how large your deductible is. The information to substantiate that claim is much more difficult to pinpoint -- largely because insurance coverage is tailored to individual situations. We found a wealth of information on PIP premiums across the state from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. We received several spreadsheets from the office detailing average PIP premiums in 2010 from Florida’s top five insurers. The numbers are required of insurance companies when they file for rate requests, which has been pretty often lately. They’re broken down for different types of drivers by coverage areas. Our takeaway: There are plenty of good drivers who don’t pay nearly $1,500 a year. Through Geico, a Hialeah retiree with a clean driving history would pay $450 a year for $10,000 in coverage. A married, middle-aged couple who share two vehicles with their adult children and have a clean driving record would pay $406 a year in Central Orlando through Geico, anywhere from $327 to $860 a year in Hialeah and $253 a year in St. Petersburg. In rural cities and counties, the family would pay even less: Ocala, $179; Central Jacksonville, $193; Northeast Florida counties, $153; Panhandle counties, $128. With so much variance between drivers, driving histories, plans and location, pulling an average statewide PIP premium from this data wouldn’t be wise-- even if it was easily available. We requested a median premium but did not hear back from the Office of Insurance Regulation by our deadline. But consider this: In 2011, Insure.com determined Florida’s overall auto insurance premium costs were $1,476, below the national average ($1,561). Another measure used by the Insurance Information Institute found Florida’s average car insurance expenditure to be $1,006 (based on 2009 statistics). PIP is just one part of your car insurance bill. Our ruling Scott said, "In some communities, for $10,000 worth of coverage it’s $1,500 a year." A state report shows that in some instances, drivers pay $1,500 a year -- or even more -- for $10,000 worth of coverage. The report also makes clear that the instances of high premiums are in places where fraud allegations are highest. Still, those high premiums also depend on individual circumstances. People in Hialeah could pay $1,500 or more for coverage. But people also could pay less. What you pay depends on how many cars you own and what kind of driver you are. It doesn't depend solely on which community you live in. With that clarification in mind, we rate Scott's statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-03-02T13:47:49	2012-02-25	['None']
pomt-12960	"Breaking: Crew of Air Force One Refuses to Fly Obama 6000 miles ‘Just to Play Golf’ "	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/30/buzzfeedusacom/no-air-force-one-did-not-refuse-take-obama-hawaii/	The claims circulated on social media that Air Force One won’t transport the Obamas for vacation are flights of fancy. The website BuzzFeedUSA.com, which appears to be registered to an address in Macedonia and has no connection to the real BuzzFeed.com, posted an article on Dec. 20 with the headline, "Breaking: Crew of Air Force One Refuses to Fly Obama 6000 miles ‘Just to Play Golf.’ " The article states that the captain of the fleet had enough with the Obamas’ frivolous flights and wouldn’t take the president to Hawaii "just for the day" to play a round of golf with a friend. This is not true. The Obamas set out for their annual Christmas vacation to Hawaii — Barack Obama’s birthplace — the evening of Dec. 16, four days before the article posted. Here’s video of them departing on Air Force One that night. Per White House pool reports, Obama played rounds of golf on Dec. 17, 19, 21 and 23. The First Family has also spent time at the beach, walked a nature trail at a botanical garden, played escape the room and dined at a popular Japanese restaurant — all in Hawaii. On Christmas Day, the President and First Lady visited troops at a marine base, again in Hawaii. Several of the other claims made in the article are entirely fabricated. The Obamas never took Air Force One to Chicago for White Castle burgers. There is no Air Force Osprey specifically to transport the First Dog. (Here’s an article describing Bo walking up and down the aisle of Air Force One.) The article’s assertion that Air Force One is not obligated to fly anywhere "unless it was on official business" lacks critical context. Vacation trips fall under the official travel category as the president and vice president are assumed to be always on duty, according to the Congressional Research Service. The article also includes a picture of the First Family’s dog, Bo, departing a marine helicopter. As our friends at Snopes point out, the image was taken in 2013 during the Obamas’ vacation on the Martha’s Vineyard. Embed from Getty Images After the photo, the article then concludes with a wink: "It’s a fairly well-known fact that after about 150 words and a picture that may or may not be related, most conservative readers will stop reading and go comment that the Muslim should be executed for playing golf. Therefore, less than 20% of those who clicked this article will have made it this far." While BuzzFeedUSA.com’s article fetched no comments, many who read the same article posted on a different fake news site seem to have missed this disclaimer and praised the dissident pilot. If this kicker isn’t enough to convince you that the article is fake, or if you only read the headline, we’ll state it more emphatically: It’s Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3641530f-d560-42b8-be6f-23070da52b09	None	BuzzFeedUSA.com	None	None	None	2016-12-30T15:35:08	2016-12-20	['None']
pomt-03771	"It is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay."	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/02/progressohio/progressohio-says-ohio-lacks-law-prohibiting-emplo/	The U.S. Supreme Court put the focus on same-sex marriage when it heard cases challenging California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, but attention elsewhere fell on a wider range of rights issues. The liberal advocacy group ProgressOhio Education used the opportunity to send out a fundraising email highlighting its work "for the rights of all Ohioans" beyond marriage. "Did you know," the email asked, "it is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay?" The assertion took PolitiFact Ohio by surprise. We asked ProgressOhio for more information. Executive director Brian Rothenberg said the failure of state legislation prohibiting employment and housing discrimination left gay people without legal protection in those areas. He pointed to a recent legal case as underlining that point. The legislation he mentioned was the Equal Housing and Employment Act, House Bill 176, which would have added sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of classifications for which it is illegal to discriminate for housing, employment and public-accommodation purposes in Ohio. (It already is illegal in Ohio to discriminate against a person on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, age and ancestry.) Introduced in the 128th General Assembly, H.B. 176 was passed by the Ohio House in September 2009, but was never brought up for a vote in the Senate and died with the end of that legislative session. Similar legislation, House Bill 335, was introduced in the 129th General Assembly in October 2011. It suffered a similar fate, dying without a vote in either chamber. The legal case Rothenberg cited, Inskeep v. Western Reserve Transit Authority, was decided in March by Ohio's 7th District Court of Appeals. The court dismissed the suit of a man who claimed he was harassed on the job because of his sexual orientation, ruling that Ohio's employment discrimination statute does not protect "sexual orientation." The court said in its decision: "Several states have chosen to enact legislation prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals by adding sexual orientation as a protected status in their discrimination statutes. Because Ohio has not, it has been concluded that sexual orientation is not protected." We looked further and found that Ohio prohibited discrimination within state employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity under an executive order issued by then-Gov. Ted Strickland in 2007. After it expired, Gov. John Kasich issued an executive order in January 2011 prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, but not gender identity. Both orders applied only to public employees in state jobs. Twenty-nine Ohio cities and counties now have anti-discrimination ordinances, according to a tally by the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Ohio’s lack of protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation parallels both federal law and the law of 28 other states, according to Business Management Daily, the advocacy group Equality Ohio and the ACLU. On the Truth-O-Meter, the statement that it is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant for being gay rates as True.

pomt-03337	New school testing standards "will consume approximately twenty days of testing for elementary, middle and high school students."	/florida/statements/2013/jul/22/will-weatherford/new-tests-could-take-20-school-days-say-will-weath/	Florida is in the midst of implementing new, tougher academic standards to make its students more internationally competitive. To do that, the state needs to replace the well-known FCAT exam with a new set of tests. As the 2014-15 deadline approaches, though, questions are being raised about whether the new testing system, called PARCC, is the best choice. On July 17, Florida’s top lawmakers weighed in with a resounding "no." House Speaker Will Weatherford and Senate President Don Gaetz sent a two-page letter to education commissioner Tony Bennett urging him to withdraw from PARCC (the acronym stands for Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers) and instead craft a "Florida plan" for testing. They listed five key reasons, including cost, technology requirements and time spent testing. (We can only rate one person on our Truth-O-Meter, so we're rating Weatherford, but the ruling applies to both.) To that last point, they pointedly wrote, "According to information provided recently through PARCC and earlier by the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE), the complete PARCC assessments will consume approximately twenty days of testing for elementary, middle and high school students." That figure -- 20 days of testing -- puzzled some readers of the letter, which the lawmakers circulated widely. Were students going to be tested for a full 20 days? In fact, the leaders were on the mark — if not a bit conservative — to folks well versed in the language of high-stakes testing. But the number makes sense only if you understand that schools are given a window to test students. The current FCAT, for example, takes 12 days for schools to administer. It’s important to understand the broader context of this debate, too: The new testing system is meant to complement the Common Core State Standards, which have become increasingly debated across the country. Advocates like Bill Gates, Jeb Bush and the Obama administration say the system will create higher expectations for students and provide more rigor to propel them ahead. An odd combination of teacher unions and tea party activists, meanwhile, are pushing for states to abandon the model. The unions say that teachers and schools are not prepared for the change, while the tea party groups argue against a nationalized curriculum and testing. Setting that debate aside, it’s important to know that school testing is not typically a one-day thing for students or teachers. A Florida fourth-grader currently spends about 5 hours 40 minutes over four days taking FCAT exams in reading, math and writing, for instance, according to a state analysis. That same student would sit for 9 hours 20 minutes of PARCC year-end testing, over six to nine days. PARCC also would have mid-year testing, also with a 20-day window to get them all completed. And, the PARCC estimate does not include what the Florida DOE listed as "a set amount of additional time yet to be determined. ...This may in turn also increase the number of testing days." The days-long testing windows give schools time to cycle children through the computerized portions of the tests. Many schools do not have enough machines or bandwidth to test all children at the same time. That gives credence to the leaders’ choice of the word "consume" when writing about what tests do to the school day. Even under FCAT, many teachers have observed that testing season takes over school classrooms and computer labs. Gaetz and Weatherford are not alone in their concerns. Oklahoma state superintendent Janet Barresi, a Republican who had her state join PARCC as one of her first actions in office, three weeks ago announced she would abandon the tests. Like Weatherford and Gaetz, Barresi cited increased testing time as one of her key concerns. Oklahoma fourth-graders currently take only two hours of state tests. "We just felt like that’s a significant leap," department spokeswoman Tricia Pemberton told PolitiFact. "We do want the increased rigor of a PARCC-type exam … but we just want to do a little less of that at this point." Commissioner Bennett has been evaluating PARCC, along with other testing options for Florida that he could go with. He has said he will take the lawmakers’ concerns into consideration as he makes his recommendation. Our ruling In a letter to the state education commissioner, Gaetz and Weatherford said they were concerned that new standards would increase test-taking time for Florida’s students, describing the PARCC standards as "consuming" 20 days for elementary, middle and high school students. The word "consuming" implies that those days will be taken up completely by testing. That’s not the case for students, who will not be tested continuously for 20 days. But it’s on the mark for schools, which would have a 20-day window in which to administer tests to different students within the school. In fact, schools generally expect to focus on little else besides testing procedures for that time period. The current FCAT tests work the same way, but that testing window is shorter, at 12 days. The lawmakers could have been more clear that if PARCC standards are adopted, students will not face 20 days of continuous testing. But in context, their statement is generally accurate. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Will Weatherford	None	None	None	2013-07-22T12:19:25	2013-07-17	['None']
pomt-05422	"Nobody is leaving Memphis. That's a myth."	/tennessee/statements/2012/may/01/joe-brown/nobody-leaving-memphis-says-city-councilman-joe-br/	When Memphis Mayor A C Wharton kicked off the budget season by presenting his administration’s plan for financing city government for 2012-13, budget chairman Jim Strickland talked about the possibility that a proposed one-time tax for schools might make more people vote "with their tail lights" by leaving the city. That brought a challenge from Memphis City Councilman Joe Brown, who is a reliable advocate of increasing city government taxes and spending. "Nobody is leaving Memphis," Brown said. "That's a myth." Even the mayor’s budget document cites the negative migration trend, noting that tax revenues "have been negatively impacted by years of population decline and decimated by the recent recession." So we felt obligated to put Councilman Brown’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter Brown did not respond to numerous messages or emails asking for evidence to support his claim. It’s worth noting here that this Joe Brown, the city councilman, is not the same Joe Brown from Memphis famous for being a TV judge. No, this Joe Brown is the councilman who attracted international attention for Memphis in 2004 when he barred seven Iraqi community and civic leaders from City Hall, citing fears of terrorism. "We don’t want another Oklahoma City," he said at the time, adding confusion about domestic terrorism with his confusion about the origins of the 9/11 attacks. When we contacted Strickland about Brown’s claim, he went straight to the numbers, saying that his analysis shows the city has been bleeding residents at a yearly rate of about a half-percent of the population – roughly 3,000 more people leave the city than move to it. He says he’s even looked at Memphis Light, Gas & Water data that show yearly declines in customers. "All the evidence points to people voting with their tail lights," Strickland said. "They are leaving. Most of the people leaving are middle class and Memphis is losing its middle class." U.S. Census Bureau numbers from 2000 and 2010 back up Strickland. We have tracked this closely at The Commercial Appeal over the years, and Tom Charlier reported on it extensively in a piece last March. Between the 2000 and 2010 decennial censuses, Memphis’s population fell from 650,100 to 646,889 -- but those raw numbers mask a larger story of population shifts out of the city. One key variable involves Memphis’s 2002 annexation of an 11.5-square-mile area of Cordova -- which contained 35,000 residents. If population in all other parts of Memphis had remained stable, at the very least the city should have shown an increase of 35,000 from the 2000 Census to the 2010 Census. There’s also the matter of births far out-numbering deaths, which all things being equal would lead to population gain. While these numbers are not readily available for specific cities in Tennessee, the state does track them by county. University of Memphis researcher Charlie Santo pointed us to data that shows that in Shelby County, of which Memphis comprises 69.7 percent of the population, there were 145,120 births between 2001 and 2010 and 76,463 deaths. Thus, the county should have added 68,657 people based on more births than deaths, and if we apportion 69.7 percent of that to Memphis, that means the city could have expected to grow by 47,854 people. Add that 47,854 to the 35,000 Cordova residents forced into the city limits by annexation, and you see that, had there been an absolute zero rate of migration into or out of the city, Memphis’s population should have increased over the decade by 82,854. And, yet, the city showed a population decline of 3,211 people over that period. So more than 85,000 people that would have been expected to be present in census calculations were in fact nowhere to be found inside of Memphis. We also know that the six incorporated suburban cities and towns inside Shelby County grew by 33 percent between 2000 and 2010, adding a total of 41,918 residents. Suburban towns and cities in bordering counties also showed great growth. And in Mississippi’s DeSoto County, which borders Memphis and Shelby County to the south, population grew by 37 percent, with the addition of 43,507 residents. We cannot say exactly how many of those new suburban residents came from Memphis, but the Census Bureau numbers from its 2010 American Community Survey reveal substantial migration from Memphis to the suburbs. The 2010 ACS, a scientifically rigorous U.S. Census sampling, shows a yearly migration out of Memphis of 32,580 people -- 11,425 moved from Memphis to the remainder of Shelby County, 5,767 moved to a different county in Tennessee and 15,388 moved to different state. We did not get numbers for in-migration, because Brown’s comment focused specifically on whether people are leaving Memphis. But the numbers from the decennial census make it clear more people are moving out of Memphis every year than are moving in. As Charlier wrote, this is a staggering trend because it marks only the second decline in a decennial census since the yellow fever epidemic of the 1870s. Smart City Memphis blogger Tom Jones, a former longtime Shelby County government administrator, put it into greater historical context: "Within the 1970 city limits of Memphis, there are more than 30% fewer people; if Memphis were not able to masquerade its population losses through annexations, the city might well have lost more people than any city in the Sun Belt." Our ruling Brown defends his desire to raise taxes and increase spending in Memphis by saying it's "a myth" that residents are leaving Memphis. But he need only look at the mayor's budget document, which says the city has suffered "years of population decline." And numbers from the Census Bureau show a more detailed story of the steady out-migration. It has been masked by annexations and yearly births outnumbering deaths, but it's a very real trend. We rate this claim Pants On Fire.	None	Joe Brown	None	None	None	2012-05-01T12:02:28	2012-04-18	['None']
pomt-01850	"74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/14/donna-edwards/democratic-rep-donna-edwards-says-74-republicans-s/	From the day it was passed in 2010 without a single Republican vote, President Barack Obama’s health care law has polarized Americans by party affiliation: Most Democrats support it, most Republicans oppose it. So we were curious when we heard Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., cited strong Republican approval for the law on the July 13, 2014, edition of CNN’s State of the Union. It came during a roundtable discussion of frayed partisan relations in Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner’s effort to sue Obama over his administration’s alleged overreach on implementation of the health care law. Edwards said, "I don't understand the politics (of the lawsuit), quite frankly. I mean, 74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act. And so they're suing against their own Republicans." We decided to take a closer look at whether 74 percent of Republicans really "support the Affordable Care Act." We started by checking with Edwards’ office. Spokesman Benjamin Gerdes said Edwards was referring to a poll by the Commonwealth Fund, a think tank that supports "better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency" in health care, "particularly for society's most vulnerable." The poll reached 4,425 adults by telephone between April 9 and June 2, 2014. Pollsters interviewed a sample of adults between 19 and 64 who had selected a private plan or enrolled in Medicaid due to provisions in the Affordable Care Act, or who have had Medicaid for less than 1 year. One of the questions was, "Overall, how satisfied are you with this new health insurance?" The poll found that 74 percent of the Republicans who had signed up for health coverage at least in part due to the ACA said they were satisfied -- specifically, 30 percent somewhat satisfied and 44 percent very satisfied. That satisfaction rate was rate slightly lower than it was for Democrats (85 percent) and Independents (82 percent), but still overwhelmingly high. That’s a notable finding, suggesting, essentially, that if you try the ACA, you’ll like the ACA -- even if you’re a Republican. But Edwards didn’t say that 74 percent of Republicans who signed up for coverage as a result of ACA said they were satisfied with the coverage they got. Instead, she said, "74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act" -- a much broader assertion, and one that’s undercut by a host of survey data. For instance, here are three recent polls: • Quinnipiac Poll, June 24-30: "Do you support or oppose the health care law passed by Barack Obama and Congress in 2010?" Republicans: 9 percent support, 90 percent oppose. • Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, June 12-18: "As you may know, a health reform bill was signed into law in 2010. Given what you know about the health reform law, do you have a generally favorable or generally unfavorable opinion of it?" Republicans: 15 percent support, 74 percent oppose. • Gallup, May 21-25. "Do you generally approve or disapprove of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama that restructured the U.S. health care system?" Republicans: 8 percent support. (Figures for "oppose" were not posted.) By contrast, support for the law among Democrats ranged between 66 percent and 83 percent in these polls -- a yawning partisan gap. When we got back in touch with Gerdes, he acknowledged that Edwards "did misspeak." Our ruling Edwards said that "74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act." She actually has a reasonable point to make -- that, contrary to the popular impression of the law, most Republicans who have signed up for insurance through the law say they are satisfied with it. Still, that’s not how Edwards phrased the claim on CNN. On the broader question of whether Republicans "support the Affordable Care Act," the results in recent polls have ranged from 8 percent and 15 percent -- far lower than the 74 percent a viewer would be led to believe from watching Edwards during the roundtable segment. We rate her claim False.	None	Donna Edwards	None	None	None	2014-07-14T17:32:55	2014-07-13	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-10834	Poor people go to a "payday lender...and they pay 300, 400, 500 percent interest."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/13/john-edwards/on-the-money-about-loans/	At a campaign stop in Americus, Georgia, John Edwards said the U.S. has "the worst saving rate in the industrialized world." As a consequence, when the bills come in many working Americans can be short of money. "And so the result is, they go to the payday lender, right? And they pay 300, 400, 500 percent interest." He is right about those interest rates, and some experts think he understates the problem. Over the years, a number of groups have looked at the practices of such lenders and found that the rates they charge are enormously high. Jean Ann Fox, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, an expert on the subject who has testified in Congress, says "the bottom line is he is being conservative in his description of how expensive these loans are." A November 2006 study by Fox's organization, the CFA, "Cashed Out: Consumers Pay Steep Premium to 'Bank' at Check Cashing Outlets," concluded that "check cashers make two-week term payday loans based on personal checks held for future deposit at effective annual interest rates between 390 percent -780 percent." The average cost of a $300 loan was 406 percent annual percentage rate, according to this survey. The Center for Responsible Lending, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy group that focuses on fighting abusive lending practices, has a list of the signs of predatory payday lending. The number one sign is lenders who typically charge an interest rate of 400 percent APR or higher. Payday loans allow an individual to use a post-dated personal check to get a small, short-term cash advanThe Congressional Research Service also looked into this lending system and explained how they work: Typically, an individual writes a post-dated personal check to the lender, typically for $100-$500. The lender holds onto the check until the borrower's next paycheck. The fee on a two-week loan (the usual amount of time between pay periods) is between $15- $17 per $100. That may seem like a small amount, but it is equal to an annual percentage rate of between 391 percent and 443 percent, according to CRS. The Center for Responsible Lending produced yet another study, this one in November 2006, "Financial Quicksand: Payday Lending Sinks Borrowers in Debt with $4.2 billion in Predatory Fees Every Year." The report found that nationwide "borrowers were paying more in interest, at annual rates of 400 percent, than the amount of the loan they originally borrowed." A 2004 report from the Consumer Federation of America, "Unsafe and Unsound: Payday Lenders Hide Behind FDIC Bank Charters to Peddle Usury," put the average loan rates close to 500 percent. "Edwards is right on the money," says Ellen Schloemer, research director at the Center for Responsible Lending. "The rates are outrageous."

pomt-07051	"Only seven of 18 federal food assistance programs have been associated with positive health and nutrition outcomes, while the remaining 11 have not been effective."	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/30/jim-jordan/rep-jim-jordan-says-7-18-food-programs-check-out-1/	Duplication and wasteful spending in federal welfare programs are targets near and dear to Rep. Jim Jordan. The Ohio Republican chairs an influential group, the Republican Study Committee. The group’s political beliefs generally intersect with those of the Tea Party, and they include a desire to stop wasteful government spending. Toward that end, Jordan called a hearing of a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee, which he chairs, to talk about potential duplication in federal welfare programs. Reading his opening remarks, Jordan touched on a General Accounting Office recommendation that more study is needed on the effectiveness of the federal programs. "They found that only seven of 18 federal food assistance programs have been associated with positive health and nutrition outcomes," Jordan said, "while the remaining 11 have not been effective." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. Were nearly two-thirds of the food assistance programs really deemed ineffective? We started with a GAO report, released in March 2011, that identified 34 areas where agencies, offices, or initiatives have similar or overlapping objectives or provide similar services. The areas spanned the federal government, touching on programs in agriculture, defense, economic development, energy, general government, health, homeland security, international affairs, and social services. In some cases, the report said, financial benefits ranging from hundreds of millions to several billion dollars annually could be realized by improving efficiency and eliminating duplication. Eighteen programs, most of them overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, spent more than $62.5 billion on domestic food and nutrition assistance in fiscal year 2008. Programs' spending ranged from $4 million for the smallest program to more than $37 billion for the largest. The system of programs works to ensures that millions of low-income people are adequately fed. The GAO found that the system "shows signs of overlap and inefficent use of resources." During the hearing, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the Cleveland Democrat who is the oversight committee’s ranking member, told Jordan he would support more study but not cuts in benefits. (See related PolitiFact item) The GAO "did not find waste, fraud and abuse in the administration and delivery of these programs," Kucinich said. "It does not recommend delivering fewer benefits to those in need." Jordan said the GAO report left the question of whether the programs are working. What the report did not say that 11 of 18 programs were not effective. Jordan’s press secretary, Meghan Snyder, acknowledged that his characterization of the 11 programs as ineffective "was a misstatement. It should have been 'have not been shown to be effective.' " She quoted the pertinent statement in the GAO report: "Little is known about the effectiveness of the remaining 11 programs because they have not been well studied." That's an important distinction. Nothing can fairly be said about the effectiveness of programs that have not been evaluated. Jordan's point was that the programs do need to be studied, Snyder said. Language she cited from the report shows the GAO would agree: "As part of its broader recommendation, GAO suggested that USDA (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) consider which of the lesser-studied programs need further research, and USDA agreed to consider the value of examining potential inefficiencies and overlap among smaller programs." Where does that leave us? The first part of Jordan's statement, part of remarks he read at the hearing, was correct in that seven of 18 food assistance programs were associated with positive health and nutrition outcomes. But the second part of his claim, that other 11 were found to be ineffective, was inaccurate. To his credit, his office readily acknowledged the mistake. But a tenet of PolitiFact is that words matter, and in this case, a part of his remarks made in a formal hearing was inaccurate. His underlying point -- that more assessment of the programs is needed -- is buttressed by the GAO report. With half the statement on point but the other half off target, on the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates as Half True.	None	Jim Jordan	None	None	None	2011-06-30T06:00:00	2011-06-01	['None']

Barack Obama is inexperienced on national security matters, said at a town hall meeting in Nevada that his opponent had been to Iraq only once. "The security of this nation and its future security against the threats and the challenge of radical Islamic extremism, is transcendent," McCain told a crowd in Reno on May 28, 2008. "It's always transcendent to every president, all throughout our nation's history. And so Sen. Obama and I have a strong disagreement on this issue. And Sen. Obama has been to Iraq once." News accounts confirm, and the Obama campaign did not dispute, that the senator has indeed traveled to Iraq just one time during the war, in January 2006. He traveled with Sens. Christopher "Kit" Bond, R-Mo.; Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind.; and Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn.; and met with U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, American intelligence and reconstruction specialists and Iraqi election officials, according to news accounts from the time. He also played basketball with troops in Kuwait. And in a phone call with reporters back home, he reaffirmed his skepticism about the war effort. "There is not going to be a military solution here in Iraq," Obama told the Chicago Sun-Times at the time. He said it was time to "start phasing down troops" and "to give the Iraqis more ownership." McCain has been to Iraq eight times. One can argue about the significance of the disparity, but not about the numbers. We rule McCain's claim True.

pomt-07388	"A vast majority of the production in the United States comes from small independent oil and gas companies."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/03/dan-boren/rep-dan-boren-says-most-domestic-oil-produced-smal/	During an April 27, 2011, interview with Stuart Varney of Fox News, Rep. Dan Boren, D-Okla., argued against eliminating certain tax breaks for oil companies -- an idea that had gained support in recent weeks as gasoline prices soared nationwide. Boren argued that the biggest financial pain from ending such tax breaks would be felt by smaller companies like those based in his oil-rich state. The tax breaks, he said, "go to small independent companies like we have in Oklahoma. Did you know a vast majority of the production in the United States comes from small independent oil and gas companies? And the new rigs that are … drilling right now in the United States, they are not the ExxonMobils of the world. They are the Devons, the Chesapeakes, and even smaller companies that are based in Oklahoma that are employing a lot of … Democrats (in) blue-collar jobs. And the president needs to understand that." We wondered whether "small independent oil and gas companies" actually account for "a vast majority of the production in the United States." We turned to the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the trade group that represents independent oil and gas companies. They pointed us to a study the group commissioned from the consulting firm IHS Global Insight and released earlier this month. The study compared the reach of the "independent" sector to the bigger firms in the industry. It defined independents as "all North American operators in the lower 48 states and Alaska, excluding BG, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ENI, ExxonMobil, Hess, Marathon, Murphy, Occidental, Petrobras, Repsol, Shell, Statoil, and Total." Using the statistical tables provided, we calculated a few relevant percentages. We’ll summarize them here: U.S. oil and gas production for 2010 (amount produced) Onshore: Independents accounted for 72 percent of production Offshore: Independents accounted for 42 percent of production Total: Independents accounted for 67 percent of production U.S. oil and gas production for 2010 (dollar value) Onshore: Independents accounted for 70 percent of value Offshore: Independents accounted for 37 percent of value Total: Independents accounted for 62 percent of value So independents accounted for between 62 percent and 67 percent of domestic oil and gas production in 2010. That’s a healthy majority, but we think Boren’s description of it as "a vast majority" is exaggerated. There’s another factor to consider. Boren said he was referring to "small independent oil and gas companies." The statistics above certainly include some of those smaller companies, but it also includes some that aren’t so small. These include the two that Boren specifically mentioned. Devon Energy Corp. reported $9.9 billion in total revenue and $4.6 billion in net income in 2010, while Chesapeake Energy Corp reported $9.4 billion total revenue in 2010 and $1.8 billion in net income. Both companies are small compared to, say, ExxonMobil Corp ($105 billion in revenues, $9.3 billion in net income for 2010), but they’re hardly run out of someone’s basement. So we think the suggestion that those companies qualify as "small independent oil and gas companies" is misleading. Ultimately, Boren makes a valid point that a majority of U.S. oil production comes not from the biggest multinational oil companies but from independent firms. Still, it’s not a "vast majority," as he said, and some of the firms in the "independent" category -- including the two he cited by name -- are hardly what most people would consider "small." On balance, we rate Boren’s statement Half True.	None	Dan Boren	None	None	None	2011-05-03T11:00:42	2011-04-27	['United_States']
pomt-04686	"In the last 29 months, our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-45-million-jobs-have-been-create/	During his speech to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., former President Bill Clinton repeated a talking point often used by Democrats to tout President Barack Obama’s record on job creation. "In the last 29 months," Clinton said, "our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs." But Clinton is cherry-picking the numbers to paint Obama’s record in the most favorable light. Other methods show less impressive growth in jobs -- even declines. First of all, Clinton was using private-sector job figures, not total job figures. Right off the bat, that paints Obama’s numbers favorably, since government jobs have declined during much of Obama’s term. If you count from the start of Obama’s term, private-sector jobs have increased by 332,000, but total jobs have decreased by 316,000 due to losses of government jobs. Since this time frame includes the start of Obama’s term -- when the economy was in free fall and before Obama’s policies had time to take effect -- we don’t think this is the best way to measure it. The way Clinton did it is another way to count it. Clinton started counting from the low point of jobs in February 2010. Using this method, private-sector jobs increased by about 4.5 million. However, starting the count at the low point is a bit of cherry-picking. If you instead start at the official end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector jobs increased by 3.4 million. That’s well below Clinton’s 4.5 million figure. We realize that speakers at political conventions are going to put the best gloss on the numbers they have available, so it’s not surprising that Clinton would use the 4.5 million figure. But getting to 4.5 million requires starting the count at the most favorable point possible for Obama. In addition, as we’ve written previously, presidents are not the only factor in job creation. The national, and world, economies are too big for any one person to control. So crediting Obama’s policies is at best partially correct because there are so many other factors -- such as policies of the Federal Reserve, the willingness of banks to lend money, and global business trends -- that play a role. Our ruling While it’s true that by most measures, the number of jobs in the United States has increased on Obama’s watch, Clinton has done some cherry-picking in coming up with the 4.5 million number. But he chose his words carefully in describing the jobs picture. He said, "In the last 29 months, our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs." On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2012-09-06T12:40:12	2012-09-05	['None']
pomt-01806	"Tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state."	/florida/statements/2014/jul/23/nan-rich/nan-rich-says-tourism-and-retirees-dominate-florid/	Florida is famous for its tourists and retirees. They spend plenty of bucks in the Sunshine State -- but is the state reliant on them for its economic strength? Former state Sen. Nan Rich, the underdog who’s challenging former Gov. Charlie Crist in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, touched on that topic during a speech to the Florida Press Association in Coral Gables on July 11, 2014. (Crist spoke a day earlier; Republican Gov. Rick Scott declined an invitation to speak.) "Our state’s economy is unlike any other in the country," Rich told the association, according to Miami Herald reporter David Smiley who attended the speech. "Today, tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state. And while they do create jobs, they are mostly lower-paying service industry jobs." Since the economy is a top issue in the battle for governor, we decided to check her statement that tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in Florida. A look at the data We found no cut-and-dried answers to the question of which sectors are Florida’s dominant economic engines. However, we did find evidence that shows tourism and retirees play an important role in the state’s economy -- too important, some say. Rich told PolitiFact Florida that she was relying on a 2014 report by the LeRoy Collins Institute, a public-policy group at Florida State University, titled, "Tougher Choices: Shaping Florida’s Future." It was written by professors Jim Dewey and David Denslow with the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida. The report examines state spending, demographics and jobs. Among the conclusions is that "Florida’s reliance on retirees and tourists comes at a price as the demands of older residents and tourists are disproportionately linked to lower-paid service jobs. … Compared to the rest of the nation, Florida has relatively fewer high-skill high-wage jobs and relatively more low-skill low-wage jobs, many serving tourists and retirees." Without the negative spin, the state’s official 2013 economic development plan concurs on the importance of tourism and population growth, which has traditionally been driven by retirees. "Historically, Florida’s economy has been driven by agriculture, tourism, the military, and population growth, which in turn produced gains in construction, real estate, retail trade, and services," the plan says. About 19 percent of Florida’s population was at least 65 years old as of 2013, according to the U.S. Census. Bureau. Florida had the highest percentage of seniors in the nation as of 2010. We turned to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to look at real gross domestic product by industry in the state of Florida -- the total amount of economic activity by sector, adjusted for inflation. Unfortunately, the data does not include "tourism" or "retirees" as an industry. One category that combines arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food service -- a rough approximation of "tourism" -- produced $46.9 billion in GDP in 2012. That was substantially smaller than the state’s biggest generator of GDP -- "finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing," at $161.8 billion. But the latter category also includes some sectors relevant to Rich’s claim, such as real estate purchased by retirees. Other categories that exceeded the arts and entertainment sector included professional services, education and health care, and government. Some of these also generate economic activity due to seniors, particularly health care. The actual answer, apparently, appears to be more of an assumption than a provable fact. A Visit Florida spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida that tourism is "the state’s No. 1 industry" and generates 23 percent of the state’s sales tax revenue and employs about 1.1 million Floridians. However, when we asked what economic measures prove that tourism is the top industry, Visit Florida spokeswoman Kathy Torian said: "It's an aspirational statement rather than a scientific fact. ... We feel that the combination of sales tax revenue, employment and economic impact from visitor spending make the case for the tourism industry." Experts' views We also interviewed four economists who study the state’s economy, and they generally agreed that tourism and retirees play a vital role in Florida’s economy, though with some quibbles. Bill Seyfried, an economist at Rollins College, said he’d prefer the term "important engines" rather than "dominant." "Clearly, both tourism and retirees have strong impacts on the Florida economy -- more than most other states -- but the state economy is becoming more diversified as evidence by deeper integration with the global economy, which is likely to get a further boost with the expansion of the Panama Canal, as well as increased growth in professional/technical services, growing aerospace and life-science sectors," he said. Seyfried examined state GDP data from 2011-2013 and found that growth came from "many sectors, not dominated by a few related to tourism. One can question whether some of the growth from 2011-2013 reflects a rebound from the crash, but the growth across sectors suggests a lack of overdependence on a few factors," such as tourism and retirees. Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moody’s, told PolitiFact Florida that the state’s large senior population influences many other aspects of the state’s economy. "Because of Florida’s large retiree population, its residents are more dependent on nonwage income than in any other state, which means that long periods of stock market gains (like the one we currently enjoying) provide an extra charge to Florida’s economy," Donaldson said. "In many, many ways, Florida’s economy depends on its senior population, so I think it is accurate to describe this population as an economic engine." Our ruling Rich said, "tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engines in our state." We didn’t find a simple way to quantify whether tourism and retirees are the dominant economic engine in Florida, but a combination of statistical data and expert analysis suggests that both are important engines, and possibly too important, due to the low-wage jobs they bring. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Nan Rich	None	None	None	2014-07-23T12:06:36	2014-07-11	['None']
pomt-04094	Says Texas public school funding grew three times the rate of enrollment from 2002 to 2012.	/texas/statements/2013/jan/16/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-education-increased-phenomen/	Asked about restoring public education aid, Gov. Rick Perry suggested that’s the wrong question. According to a Jan. 9, 2013, Texas Tribune news story, Perry replied at a press conference earlier that day: "We’ve had public education funding growing at three times the public education enrollment. So you’ve had a 70 percent increase of funding from 2002 to 2012. You've had a 23 percent increase in enrollment... I think under any scenario over the last decade, the funding that we have seen in the state of Texas for public education has been pretty phenomenal." Those contrasting figures seemed surprising given that the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature modified school finance formulas--sending schools $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same--and also made other school funding cuts. We were mindful, too, of other flawed education spending claims. Of note, Republican lawmakers have said Texas did not cut such spending (Pants on Fire), that they raised education spending (Pants on Fire) and also that they raised education’s share of the budget (Mostly True). Enrollment increased about 20 percent from 2001-02 to 2011-12, from more than 4.1 million to nearly 5 million students, according to a December 2012 report by the Texas Education Agency. By email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us 2012-13 enrollment is expected to exceed 5 million, but the total has not been settled. And how much did spending increase or decrease during the period? To find out, we measured spending on public schools in two ways: how much spending from all sources--state, local and federal--changed and how much the state itself spent. Overall expenditures Overall school expenditures, counting state, local and federal sources, totaled $27.9 billion in 2002 and $44.2 billion in 2012, according to a chart from the Legislative Budget Board, which tracks fiscal issues for lawmakers. That makes for a difference of 58 percent, though that’s also before adjusting for inflation, which the board’s staff did by converting figures to 2004 dollars using an inflation adjuster devised by the federal government, the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government. In 2004 dollars, Texas public school spending in 2002 totaled $30.1 billion. In 2012, the total was $33.3 billion--11 percent greater than in 2002. By this measure, then, it looks like school enrollment went up faster than spending. Then again, we learned, these figures were not behind Perry’s statement. State spending alone Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Perry was referring to the difference in state education spending alone "as those are the funds the state has control over." The budget board’s chart shows $10.9 billion in state spending on the schools in 2002 and $18.9 billion in 2012, for a 73 percent difference, or a little more than Perry’s declared 70 percent. Adjusting for inflation, though, reduces the increase to 20 percent. In 2004 dollars, such spending was $14.2 billion in 2012, compared to $11.8 billion in 2002. Analyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities and school lobbyist Lynn Moak, a former Texas Education Agency official, each pointed out another wrinkle, suggesting that any consideration of state education spending should take into account changes in law approved in 2006 resulting in the state picking up about $7 billion more in annual costs in return for school districts cutting local maintenance & operation property tax rates. Castro said by email: "The property tax cut was $14.2 billion a biennium, or $7.1 billion every year. That means the state had to put in that amount of money a year to offset local property taxes falling by the same amount." The shift in funding sources did not, in itself, step up aid received by the schools, Castro said. Moak said by phone: "This was simply a source-of-funds transfer." To adjust for the annual cost shift, we subtracted $7.1 billion from the state spending in 2012, suggesting a $0.9 billion difference from the 2002 spending. However, adjusting for inflation makes the 2012 state spending equal $8.2 billion in 2002 dollars--25 percent less than the $10.9 billion spent in 2002. We asked Frazier about taking inflation and the tax-swap law into consideration. She replied by email: "The governor has laid out the accurate facts." Our ruling Perry said education spending escalated more than three times as fast as enrollment from 2002 to 2012. We accept that he was talking about state education aid, which outpaced the 20 percent growth in enrollment by about the cited margin. But that’s without considering inflation and the impact of the annual tax swap set in motion by lawmakers and Perry, which drove up state spending without in itself delivering more school aid. Make those adjustments and it looks like Texas schools in 2012 fielded 25 percent less in state aid than what they fielded in 2002. We rate this claim as False.

Now it’s three."	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/12/mark-warner/va-senator-says-fewer-workers-supporting-more-soci/	(Editor’s Note: This week – all week – PolitiFact Georgia is taking a look at the federal debt. You can comment on our Truth-O-Meter findings by joining our Facebook page. Hit the "like" button and you’re ready to comment.) A bipartisan barnstorm on the national debt swept through Atlanta on Monday, bringing unsettling news on just how far into the red the U.S. government has sunk. Georgia’s own U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, and U.S. Sen Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s editorial board and attendees at a Rotary Club luncheon that we need to address the national debt now. One of the reasons is Social Security. Fewer workers are supporting a growing number of retirees. The simple math points to a disaster just down the road. "There used to be 16 workers for every one person on Social Security. ... Now it’s three. That’s not anybody’s fault; it’s just demographics," Warner told the AJC’s editorial board. Sounds bad. But is Warner right? First, a little background. For years, no officeholder dared talk about cuts to Social Security, which was often referred to as the highly charged "third rail" of U.S. politics. The warning was clear: touch it and risk political death. But the soaring federal debt has allowed politicians of all stripes to begin talking about reining in Social Security expenses. Proposals range from increasing the Social Security tax to raising the retirement age. The problem is an aging population -- too few workers supporting too many retirees -- and a government that has borrowed heavily from the Social Security Trust Fund. A nonpartisan General Accounting Office report recently warned: "In the next two decades America’s population will age dramatically, and relatively fewer workers will be asked to support ever-larger costs for retirees." Warner warned that unless something is done, Social Security beneficiaries could see a 22 percent cut in benefits by 2037. Chambliss said the government is now writing checks out of the general fund to pay beneficiaries. About 40 cents of every dollar of that money is borrowed, he said, and the country is paying interest on that money. That inflates the federal debt. U.S. News and World Report recently reported that last year Social Security ran its first cash deficit in more than 25 years. "This is troubling because the federal government for years has been borrowing the system's surpluses, and now there's nothing left to borrow," the magazine reported. "Worse, the government is going to have to borrow just to pay back what it owes Social Security." Chambliss and Warner are part of what’s informally known as the "Gang of Six," a clutch of senators who are trying to garner support for cutting the debt by curbing federal expenditures and raising additional revenue. The group also includes Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill.; Tom Coburn, R-Okla.; and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. It has been meeting since the December release of a report by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. That commission, convened by President Barack Obama, suggested a series of ambitious deficit-cutting reforms. The Gang of Six is trying to garner support for its cause. It has a difficult mission. Straightening out the national debt means reforming cherished entitlement programs, including Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare health benefits for the elderly. We interviewed experts from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the conservative Heritage Foundation and the libertarian Cato Institute to check out Warner’s claim. They agreed with Warner’s general contention. They said the best data come from the Social Security Administration, which says that in 1950 there were 16.5 workers for each Social Security recipient. In 2011, the ratio is 2.9 workers for each recipient. This year, about 157 million U.S. workers support some 55 million Social Security recipients, according to the SSA’s data. In 1950, 48 million workers supported 2 million recipients. That’s very close. We rate Warner’s claim True.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2011-04-12T06:00:00	2011-04-11	['None']
pomt-11897	Insurance companies "have made a fortune with Obamacare."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/23/donald-trump/trump-says-insurers-made-fortune-obamacare-they-di/	As two dozen senators attempt to carve out a short-term compromise on the Affordable Care Act, President Donald Trump is sending mixed signals. At the heart of the deal are payments to insurance companies that sell certain policies on the Obamacare exchanges. In tweets and remarks, Trump both praised the compromise effort championed by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and flagged his displeasure. "I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care," Trump tweeted Oct. 18. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The bailout, as Trump calls it, is no bailout; the money actually ends up with doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. But here we zero in on Trump’s statement that insurers "have made a fortune with Obamacare." There’s no question that the companies’ profits have been enormous. The question is, was Obamacare the cash cow? Based on the filings of the companies, and the analysis of people on Wall Street, at universities and a respected neutral health policy group, the answer is, no. The White House press office pointed to a news article that reported booming profits for the top five for-profit insurance companies, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group. Collectively, they had $4.5 billion in net earnings in the first three months of 2017. That cash was"the biggest first-quarter haul for the group since the Affordable Care Act exchanges went live in 2014," the article said. But the article doesn’t actually tie those profits to Obamacare. The fact is, Obamacare does not just include the exchanges where people buy private insurance. The exchanges themselves are a small slice of the overall insurance business. Despite the enormous attention paid to the exchanges, they make up less than 4 percent of the insurance market for people under 65. And contrary to Trump’s assertion, they have dragged profits down, not boosted them up, experts say. Returns from the exchanges have been so bad, three out of five of the companies listed in the article have fled. Aetna reported that it lost $650 million in 2016 and 2017 from the policies it sold in the individual market. For 2018, Aetna pulled out of every state exchange. UnitedHealth Group has also left the exchanges. It put its combined losses at over $1 billion in 2015 and 2016. Humana, which had sold in 11 states, got out too. Cigna trimmed its participation from seven states to six. Cigna CEO David Cordani told CNBC in August that the market is "challenging," and that "we are losing money, but we are losing a little less than we expected." For 2018, Anthem also remains, but withdrew from Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin, and trimmed back the number of counties it serves in Kentucky, Georgia and California. It was going to leave Virginia completely, but then struck a deal with the state to sell in counties that would otherwise have no carrier. Moody’s Investor Service ranked it as a positive development for companies that exited the exchanges, saying it "lowered exposure to this challenging business." The overall individual market, which includes plans sold on and off the exchanges, brought an estimated $4.7 billion in underwriting losses in 2016, according to the consulting group Oliver Wyman. The news has not been all bad for the companies. Premium hikes in 2016 and 2017 began to balance things out. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health sector statistics, found that insurers who stayed in the exchanges had figured out how to come out ahead, but it took a couple of years for them to get there. Obamacare beyond the exchanges So Trump missed the target completely when he linked the exchanges and the multi-billion dollar profits of five big insurance companies. But Obamacare is much more than the exchanges and parts of the program have both helped and hindered company profits. On the negative side of the ledger, the Affordable Care Act imposed limits on the spread between premiums collected and medical services paid out. For individual and small group plans, companies must spend at least 80 percent of premiums on providing care. For the large-group plans, the percent is 85 percent. "This provision has likely had a modest downward effect on profits," said Larry Levitt with the Kaiser Family Foundation. In 2015, companies that fell below those minimums rebated about $400 million to customers, government numbers show. A tax on insurance companies helps finance Obamacare. Congress lifted it for 2017, but it is slated to return in 2018 with an estimated value of nearly $13 billion. Sheryl R. Skolnick, director of U.S. equity research at Mizuho Securities, tracks UnitedHealth Group specifically. "That health insurance industry fee in 2018 is projected to cost the company $.75 a share on just about 1 billion shares," Skolnik said. On the positive side of the ledger, the one clear bright spot for insurers in Obamacare was the expansion of Medicaid. In the 32 states that extended the program to adults making as much as 138 percent of federal poverty, coverage is mainly handled through private insurers. "Mostly as a result of expansion programs under the ACA, health plans and service providers experienced strong Medicaid growth over the early years of ACA," according to a report from Mark Farrah and Associates. Health care analysts at Milliman, an actuarial consulting firm, estimated that insurers had underwriting gains of $1.5 billion in 2016. That was a year when exchange losses topped $4 billion. A study in Michigan found that operating margins for the companies that managed Medicaid in that state improved four-fold between 2013 and 2015. How does this all add up for each of the five big insurance companies? Precision is difficult, but between the losses tied to the exchanges, regulations and taxes on one hand, and profits on Medicaid on the other, Skolnik said it’s a wash. "I think it's fair to say that the health insurance industry has probably lost close to as much as they've gotten under the ACA," Skolnik said. Which raises the question, where did those hefty profits come from? The bulk of the business lies in employer-based coverage, which makes sense since that accounts for nearly 60 percent of the under-65 insurance market. Over the years, companies have benefited by shifting more of the costs onto customers through higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. And mergers in the industry have also helped. "Consolidation among insurers has led to higher margins," said economist Amanda Starc at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. Medicare Advantage, a quasi-private version of traditional Medicare, has also been a key profit center for insurers. Under the program, the government contracts with insurance companies to deliver health care to seniors. The rising number of retirements among baby boomers has fueled that market. Enrollments are up, and the insurance companies have worked hard to keep their costs down. "They are very aggressive there which gives them the clout to get better provider contracts," said J.B. Silvers, a professor of health finance at Case Western Reserve University. Our ruling Trump said insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare. The White House cited the companies’ surging profits as proof. But just because insurers made billions since the time when the Affordable Care Act took effect, doesn’t mean that the ACA delivered those profits. Most of the companies had steep losses on the Obamacare exchanges and got out. Every report we saw and every expert we reached said insurers made their huge profits elsewhere, largely through their work in the large group or employer-based market or through the Medicare Advantage program. The expansion of Medicaid, another part of Obamacare also helped, but to a smaller degree. The fortune that Trump cited didn’t come from Obamacare. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00234	Says New Jersey Rep. Leonard Lance voted repeatedly "to let insurance companies charge more to people aged 50 and over."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/09/tom-malinowski/age-claim-new-jersey-leaves-out-something-importan/	Older people vote, and Tom Malinowski, the Democratic challenger in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District, seems to have them in mind. In a television ad criticizing incumbent U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance, Malinowski says Lance voted more than 60 times "to gut affordable health care." These votes included provisions to let insurers deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and "to let insurance companies charge more to people aged 50 and over." This is all about the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. The last part of the claim by Malinowski, a former U.S. State Department official, intrigued us because of a unique aspect of a New Jersey law in effect before the Obamacare was passed. It already limited how much more insurers could charge their oldest customers based on age. Those differences, however, were not quite as narrow as required by Obamacare. But let’s dispense quickly with something else first. When Malinowski says Lance, a Republican, voted more than 60 times to gut affordable health care, he is speaking of the array of votes in Congress between 2011 and 2017 concerning the federal law, passed by Democrats in Congress in 2010. Some of the votes were to fully repeal the health law. Some were to delay its implementation. Some were to eliminate or stall tax provisions within it -- to delay the IRS’ ability to penalize taxpayers who refused to get health coverage, for example, or to stop the planned taxes on durable medical equipment sales. The tax was one of the many ways the law was paid for. Lance did not go along with his party on one of its biggest, most recent bills. He voted against a repeal-and-replace measure in 2017. He said it would not adequately protect people with pre-existing conditions. But what about the age differential -- and what did it mean in New Jersey, specifically? We took a look. Age differences Older people go to the doctor more than young adults do. That’s a reality that affects the premiums insurers charge. As a result, insurers typically charged their oldest customers buying individual policies five times or more the premiums of their youngest adult customers before the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, according to a 2017 research report by the actuarial firm Milliman. Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms found that people in their early 60s could face a ratio of 6-to-1, Milliman’s report noted. The ACA changed that, mandating that in the individual market, premiums for the oldest adults could be no greater than three times those for the youngest. This didn’t affect large employer plans, which tend to have a range of ages that balance out big price differences anyway, and it didn’t apply to Medicare, the federal program for people 65 and older. But in the individual market, it held down what would have been higher prices for the oldest buyers, while raising premiums for younger buyers. Other mechanisms in the act, particularly taxpayer subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket costs, helped temper some price changes. It bears noting that the ACA does not say a thing about the age of 50, as Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, confirmed to us. The law just refers to youngest-vs.-oldest adults. But political campaigns like to use specific ages, and 50 seems to have a meaningful resonance for voters. So what would happen if Congress got rid of the ACA? Multiple analyses say younger buyers would see premium reductions while older ones would see price spikes. This could be particularly true if older customers lost one of the ACA’s other protections, a prohibition on basing premiums on medical conditions. Lance cited that concern when voting against the 2017 American Health Care Act, although he had voted for other repeal variations before then. New Jersey’s difference So it’s cut and dried, right? Not quite. States used to have significant sway in how they regulated insurers, and New Jersey already limited premiums based on age. While the national average ratio of premiums for young adults to older ones was 5-to-1 or greater, New Jersey law in 2009 limited age differences to 3.5-to-1. Mathematically, that’s 17 percent higher for the oldest customers than allowed under the ACA (which allows a rate discrepancy of 3-to-1). That’s not as high as rates might be if New Jersey had no cap on age differences, but it nevertheless could amount to hundreds of dollars a month, said Benji Schwartz, Malinowski’s campaign spokesman. It is hard to determine exactly how high or low rates would be for Lance’s constituents even with a 3.5-to-1 age ratio -- that is, even if older customers could be charged 17 percent more than younger customers -- because age was just one of the pre- and post-ACA pricing factors, Joel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, told us. Other variables went into the mix. But when the ACA kicked in, "most people saw major reductions," Cantor said. "As we say, run the movie backwards and people would be hit with major premium increases," Cantor said. Our ruling Malinowski’s ad said that Lance voted repeatedly "to let insurance companies charge more to people aged 50 and over." The ad contains elements of truth but leaves out important facts: The ACA already allows insurance companies to charge older customers more — just not as much more as they did before. New Jersey limited those differences already, just not as much as the ACA. The congressional bills to change or eliminate the ACA would not have affected people on employer plans or Medicare. These factors matter. We rate the claim Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tom Malinowski	None	None	None	2018-10-09T12:13:45	2018-10-03	['None']
pomt-03984	State support for local schools per pupil has decreased by at least 25 percent over the past decade.	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/12/empowered-georgia/georgia-lawmakers-cutting-education-funding-group-/	Are the people who run this state devoting less money to Georgia’s public schools than they did a decade ago? Yes, says one group. EmpowerED Georgia, a group of parents and teachers that estimates its membership at 3,500, has a chart on its website claiming the decrease has been at least 25 percent per student since 2002. The group says state lawmakers, through tax credits and other programs, have been overly supportive of private schools in recent years at the expense of public schools. A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw the claim about the size of the decrease and asked us to investigate. The EmpowerED Georgia graphic says the decrease is based on information on midterm education spending it found on the Georgia Department of Education’s website. "The key point I was making is that the state allotments to local school systems over the last decade have decreased by a significant percentage on a per-student, inflation-adjusted basis," said EmpowerED Georgia co-founder Matt Jones, a teacher at Toombs County School in Lyons. "The method of measuring the exact rate of inflation is a technical issue, but the approach used is the most relevant one for state and local governments. We believe that 25 percent is the best estimate possible." Here’s what EmpowerED Georgia found: In fiscal year 2002, which began July 1, 2001, and ended June 30, 2002, the state spent about $5.6 billion on education. In fiscal year 2012, which began July 1, 2011, and ended June 30, 2012, the state spent about $7.04 billion. EmpowerED Georgia divided the total spent by the number of public school students in Georgia, which has increased from nearly 1.5 million pupils in 2002 to about 1.65 million in 2012. It calculated the difference of per-pupil spending between those years and adjusted it for inflation. It used a price index that state and local governments use for various costs. In fiscal year 2002, EmpowerED Georgia found the average spent on each student was $3,873. Ten years later, the organization said the total was $2,910. The difference, according to these numbers? A 25 percent decrease. Case closed, right? Not so, say state education officials. Those officials say some perspective is necessary here. The state budget, for example, is smaller than it was, when adjusted for inflation. State spending decreased significantly after the Great Recession in 2008. The education budget cannot escape all cuts, education officials say. Class sizes are larger than they were. There’s new technology in the classroom. It’s difficult to make such a comparison, they say. "They are theoretically being more productive with larger classes," Lou Byars, the department’s director of financial review, said of Georgia teachers. Jones wrote an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that rejected the state’s argument about the recession’s impact on education spending. "[T]hat does not explain why k-12 programs have been reduced virtually every year since 2002. Nor does it explain how, under these dire budgetary restrictions, the General Assembly has miraculously been able to find funding for a private school tuition program and a new system of state charter schools," he wrote. Education officials also questioned EmpowerED Georgia’s methodology. "The idea of adjusting it for a (consumer price index) or a (government price index) is not a good way to do it," said Scott Austensen, the state Education Department’s chief financial officer. A government price index uses a combination of elements that state and local governments face when preparing and adjusting a budget, such as construction prices, wages and health care costs. Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a fiscally conservative think tank, questioned the use of such an index. "We don't like the government spending index because it has little to do with overall inflation and more to do with comparing your rate of growth with other government out-of-control spending growth and has nothing to do with the ability of taxpayers and their income growth to fund the program," McCutchen said. Georgia State University’s Fiscal Research Center completed a report in November on the recession’s impact on school revenue. Like EmpowerED Georgia, it found state spending on education in Georgia had declined by 25 percent between 2002 and 2011. It, too, used an inflation index of state and local government prices. Overall, education spending has declined by about 12 percent, if you include local and federal spending in the state. Cynthia Searcy, who wrote the GSU report, said EmpowerED’s spreadsheet looked accurate to her, although they used slightly different numbers. Georgia State University associate professor Carolyn Bourdeaux, who edited the report, believes state and local government price indexes more accurately capture the cost of government to operate. To sum up, EmpowerED Georgia claims that education spending is down about 25 percent over the past decade. The larger point about a decrease in education spending is not disputed by state education officials. But they disagree with the use of state and local government price indexes to conclude there’s been a 25 percent decrease. EmpowerED Georgia’s math is supported by the Georgia State study. Still, there are some factors that deserve consideration when examining this claim, such as the recession’s impact on state spending and larger class sizes. The group’s statement contains an element of truth but needs a lot of context to be fully understood. Under the definitions of our rating scale, this rates as Half True.

pomt-09450	The health care bill will "create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/08/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-claims-health-care-reform-will-create-thous/	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put a new spin on health care reform during a recent meeting between President Barack Obama and members of Congress. "It's about jobs," she said. "In its life [health care reform] will create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately." To be clear: Pelosi was not arguing that the bill would literally put people to work in the field of health care. Rather, she claims that cheaper health care will allow businesses to hire more workers, thus creating more jobs. "Imagine an economy where people could change jobs, start businesses, become self-employed, whether to pursue their artistic aspirations or be entrepreneurial and start new businesses, if they were not job-locked because they have a child who's bipolar, or a family member who's diabetic with a pre-existing condition, and all of the other constraints that having health care or not having health care places on an entrepreneurial spirit," she said. We'll start out by noting that both sides claim that health care reform will either create or destroy many jobs. The Democrats assume that their bills will make health care less expensive, meaning that employers will have more money to hire more workers. For instance, Obama's Council of Economic Advisers estimated in December that health care reform could create 320,000 additional jobs. The Republicans, however, are claiming the opposite. They maintain that the House and Senate versions of the bill, as well as a recently released proposal by Obama, would levy such hefty fines on employers -- if they don't offer their employees health insurance -- that employers would end up laying off workers to keep costs down. To back up this claim, they point to a Congressional Budget Office report from July 2009 that cited several older studies. One study from 2007 estimates that 224,000 workers could be unemployed if employers were required to provide insurance that cost, on average, $2 per hour worked. A second study, also published in 2007, found that an employer mandate could cost about 750,000 jobs. But that study also took into account a minimum wage increase from $5.15 to $7.25, the current rate. Ultimately, the CBO concludes that requiring employers to offer health insurance will reduce employment, but the effect "would probably be small." Another study by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also looked at the employer mandate in June 2009. At the time, the Senate bill would have required employers who do not offer insurance to fully cover the cost of coverage for their lowest income employees who purchase insurance through a new health care insurance exchange. The group concluded that such a requirement could deter employers from hiring low-wage workers and might ultimately lead to job losses. All this information shows that health care reform may have some impact on employment, but there's a catch: Since the CBO and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities did those analyses, the Senate has changed its bill to say that employers will not be required to offer insurance, but that employers with 50 or more employees must help workers defray the cost if they qualify for new tax credits to help buy insurance. Obama's proposal includes similar language. Employers with 50 or more workers that don't provide coverage would be penalized, but the proposal would exempt the first 30 workers when calculating a $2,000 per worker fine. That background is meant to demonstrate one thing: The House, Senate and Obama proposals are moving targets. As a result, it is nearly impossible to quantify with any certainty how many jobs will be created -- or lost -- from health care reform. And we want to emphasize here, we've found no studies on lost jobs that examine the current proposals, which include fines but not full employer mandates. So, we asked Pelosi's office for more information. Her spokesman, Nadeam Elshami, pointed us to a recent study by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning public policy think tank. According to the report, "one important way to create jobs is to slow the growth of medical spending. If health care cost increases slow down, then businesses will find it more profitable to expand employment, and workers will more readily move into those new jobs." The study is a combination of data collected by Neeraj Sood, a professor at the University of Southern California who has looked at the impact of rising health care costs on employment, and David Cutler, a economist at Harvard University who has studied the impact of health care reform on care and insurance premiums. The initial impact of health care reform would be lower administrative costs, the authors argue. Those costs are associated with the marketing, underwriting and brokers’ fees charged by health insurance companies. The authors also argue that health care reform would make treatment more cost effective. Eventually, those efficiencies would trickle down to employers; in short, they won't have to pay as much to cover their employees and can instead use that extra cash to hire more workers. All told, the authors of the report estimate that health care reform could produce, on average, 250,000 to 400,000 jobs a year over the next decade. To come up with those job numbers, Cutler and Sood modeled two scenarios. In the first, medical cost reductions would occur at a moderate 0.75 percentage points annually, producing an average of 250,000 jobs every year. In the more aggressive scenario, medical cost reductions are as high as 1.5 percent annually, producing an average of 400,000 jobs per year. In reality, the number of jobs produced per year would vary, according to the report. For instance, in 2013, the number of jobs created under the second scenario would be about 210,000. That number would climb to nearly 800,000 in 2019. So, in her statement, Pelosi assumes that 400,000 jobs are created every year for a total of 4 million over 10 years. But Pelosi is cherry-picking the most optimistic number from one study. A more moderate rate of reduction could produce fewer jobs per year, according to the report. Furthermore, she fails to mention that the 400,000 is an average, meaning that some years could produce a higher number of jobs and others could produce fewer jobs. And finally, there's clearly a lot of uncertainty about whether the health care bill, with its fines on employers who don't provide health insurance, will create jobs or cut jobs. As a result, we find Pelosi's claim Half True.	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2010-03-08T14:16:36	2010-02-25	['None']
pomt-10227	Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid "said, quote, 'I can't stand John McCain.' "	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/sarah-palin/unreservedly-so/	Trying to portray her running mate as a maverick still capable of shaking up the political establishment, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin used her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention to reference Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's public distaste of John McCain, and get a retaliatory dig in at the sharp-tongued Nevada Democrat. "Harry Reid, the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee," Palin said Sept. 3, 2008. "He said, quote, 'I can't stand John McCain.' Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we've chosen the right man." Reid did, indeed, express exactly those sentiments in an Aug. 21 interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Asked about Connecticut Independent Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman's decision to accept a prime-time speaking slot at the Republican convention, Reid defended the former Democratic vice presidential nominee and related a conversation the two men had after Lieberman informed him of his decision. Lieberman continues to vote with Senate Democrats on procedural matters, and chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the Democratic-controlled chamber. "He (Lieberman) has a close personal relationship with John McCain. I don't fully understand why he does," Reid told the newspaper. "I told him last night, 'You know, Joe, I can't stand John McCain.' He said, 'I know you feel that way.' '' It's not the first time Reid has leveled a harsh personal critique at his colleague. In May, Reid appeared in a video posted on the Web site BigThink.com in which he contrasted McCain with then-Democratic primary rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton and called the Arizonan a flawed candidate, in part, because his temper prevents him from getting along with colleagues. Reid went on to dismiss McCain's record of bipartisanship as something of a myth. "I think that this illusion that's out there that he's a great bipartisan person is really without much foundation," Reid stated. "He worked with Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform, that's nice, he's reached across the aisle in a couple of occasions, but there have been a couple of occasions … he supports the president in all of his crazy economic policies, he has supported the president on this war, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, so I can't get much of my juices flowing for John McCain. There are a lot of them flowing to do everything I can to make sure that he's not president." The personal criticism is a bit puzzling, if only because McCain and Reid have had few public run-ins. McCain has been out campaigning, and absent from the Senate chamber, for most of the time Reid has served as majority leader. And during the six years Reid served as Senate Democrats' second-in-command as whip, he supported McCain's biggest legislative accomplishment: the 2002 rewrite of the nation's campaign finance laws that McCain shepherded with Russ Feingold, D-Wis., which Reid referenced in his video clip. But the lawmakers from neighboring states have had decades to get to know each other, and presumably build up personal animosities. They both arrived in Washington as newly elected congressmen in 1982, and both moved to the Senate in 1986. There, they've displayed distinctly different personalities. The high-energy McCain is blunt, funny and testy — and has irritated colleagues in the clubby chamber by being quick to discard customary courtesies. Reid, in contrast, is an effective behind-the-scenes operator who comes off as taciturn and dour, and who shuns the kind of self-promotion that consumes many of his colleagues. Their common trait is boxing: Reid was a former amateur fighter, while McCain spent time in the ring as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy. Reid's assessment of McCain's bipartisanship in the video is harsh, even by most Democratic critics' standards. It was McCain who worked with liberal icon Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 2006 on an immigration overhaul that most Democrats backed to create a guest worker program and give longtime illegal aliens a chance to become citizens. In 2005, he helped broker a deal among a bipartisan group of senators to prevent a showdown over Democrats' ability to filibuster conservative judicial nominees. And he defied his party by opposing President Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 (he now supports making them permanent) and pushing for stricter fuel efficiency standards and caps on greenhouse gases to combat global warming. But at least Reid can't be accused of sugarcoating his personal impressions. He's on the record as not being able to stand John McCain.

Stanley McChrystal, President Obama "has to fix yet another problem he inherited from the Bush administration."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/23/ed-schultz/ed-schultz-says-mcchrystal-was-obama-problem-inher/	It's moot now that President Barack Obama has accepted the resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but liberal TV host Ed Schultz delivered a stinging commentary in which the liberal TV host he told the president to "fire this jackass." McChrystal -- who along with his senior staff was portrayed in a Rolling Stone profile making disparaging comments about numerous senior officials, including Vice President Joe Biden -- was relieved of his duty on June 23, 2010, one day after the article became public. In the 24 hours between the time the article surfaced and McChrystal's departure, Schultz delivered a rant excoriating the general. "Gen. McChrystal has put the president of the United States in an untenable position," Schultz told viewers of The Ed Show on MSNBC. "The president either has to fire him or let this culture of insubordination permeate through the ranks of the men and women under his command. ... The man in charge of 90,000 American lives in a war zone shouldn‘t waste time running his mouth or cutting corners on the truth. His job demands the highest level of honor and loyalty. It's about loyalty. And this stupid interview proves that he doesn't live up to that code." Schultz continued, "This was a stupid move by McChrystal. So, once again, here's President Obama. He has to fix yet another problem he inherited from the Bush administration. I want the president to step up, stand up, take charge, and fire this jackass, Gen. McChrystal. Our troops deserve more." Most of what Schultz said is opinion, which falls outside of our purview. But we zeroed in on one thing Schultz said: "So, once again, here's President Obama. He has to fix yet another problem he inherited from the Bush administration." Is it appropriate for Schultz to blame President George W. Bush for the McChrystal "problem"? McChrystal is a career military officer who rose steadily through the ranks from his first day as a second lieutenant in 1976. It's true that McChrystal served in several senior Army positions during the years that Bush was president, including as commanding general of the Joint Special Operations Command from 2003 to 2006. In Afghanistan during 2001 and 2002, McChrystal was chief of staff of military operations. He also ran commando operations in Iraq, and he served in two positions with the joint staff in Washington. But there's a much stronger argument for linking his career to Obama than to Bush. On May 11, 2009 -- less than four months after being sworn in -- Obama ousted Gen. David D. McKiernan, the top American commander in Afghanistan, and installed McChrystal. It was widely seen as a deliberate shake-up designed to improve the execution of the long-running war. In announcing the move, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that ''fresh eyes were needed'' and that ''a new approach was probably in our best interest.'' So while McChrystal served in senior positions under Bush, he was specifically tapped by Obama to run the war in Afghanistan. To the extent he's a "problem," it seems clear to us that he's Obama's problem, not Bush's. We considered the possibility that Schultz was saying that the "problem" Obama inherited from Bush was the war on Afghanistan as a whole. But while there's a bit of vagueness in Schultz's wording, we decided that the most sensible interpretation is that he was referring to McChrystal specifically. The entire rant, from beginning to end, is about McChrystal and the awkward position he put Obama in, and the immediate sentence before the statement we're analyzing was, "This was a stupid move by McChrystal." (We contacted MSNBC's publicity department but received no clarification about what Schultz meant.) So if Schultz believes that McChrystal is a problem inherited from Bush, he's wrong. Obama didn't just appoint McChrystal to fill a vacant spot; he effectively sacked the general in charge to create a vacancy that he then proceeded to fill with McChrystal as his fix-it man. The lesson for Democrats is that not everything can be blamed on President Bush. We rate Schultz's comment Pants on Fire!

pomt-01112	"Estimates say individuals who escaped these high tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion in adjusted gross income."	/florida/statements/2015/jan/08/rick-scott/people-moved-2-trillion-worth-income-escape-high-t/	Rick Scott began his second term as Florida’s governor in much the same fashion as he started his first -- by railing against high taxes. In his inaugural address on Jan. 6, 2015, Scott boasted that scads of people had moved to Florida in recent years, allegedly lured by the state’s lack of income tax and low cost of living. "Over the last 20 years, millions of people have escaped from states with climbing tax rates to move to states with lower taxes," Scott said. "For starters, estimates say individuals who escaped these high tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion of adjusted gross income. They’re voting with their feet." Scott went on to point out that between 1992 to 2011, New York and Illinois had lost billions in adjusted gross income, and that "their No. 1 destination was Florida." The Sunshine State, meanwhile, had "inherited" more than $100 billion in adjusted gross income from other states in the same time period. Considering Florida just last year passed New York as the third-most populous state in the union, it’s obvious people are moving into the state. We wondered about the larger point here, whether $2 trillion in adjusted gross income transferred into Florida and other states to avoid higher taxes. Feet not really voting Scott’s office told us the estimate came from author and tax wonk Travis H. Brown’s book How Money Walks: How $2 Trillion Moved Between the States, and Why It Matters, which touts adjusted gross income movement as proof that states with high taxes persistently lose population and money to low-tax states. Brown’s publicist did not respond to our request for comment, so we couldn’t ask him specifics about his theory. His essential argument, according to his book, is that "it appears that there is a direct correlation between state personal income tax rates and income migration. Money is walking, and we can see exactly where it’s going." Brown combined Internal Revenue Service and Census data of the adjusted gross income (defined as all the money a person makes minus adjustments) of people who moved between states in a 15-year period between 1995 and 2010, using available records. He argued these stats show how these migrations affected states, including Florida, which is the largest net income beneficiary using this point of view, to the tune of $86.4 billion over 15 years, according to Brown. Similar conclusions about taxpayer migration have been drawn by the business-backed Tax Foundation and the New York-based Empire Center. The argument has become a popular anti-tax talking point, just as Scott used it. We ran Brown’s methodology by a number of experts, and we didn’t find many economists who know of Brown’s work well enough to comment on it. Brown identifies himself as a "political consultant and legislative lobbyist by trade" in his book. Cristobal Young, a Stanford sociologist who has co-authored studies on millionaire migration in New Jersey and California that found tax rates had little impact on migration, said he was familiar with Brown’s book and website but paid little attention to them because Brown’s conclusions are "not an academic or scientific work." One economist who did critique Brown was Michael Mazerov of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mazerov said that it’s not clear from Brown’s book whether the $2 trillion number is meant to represent all the money moving out of high tax states into low tax states, or whether it’s simply the sum of all adjusted gross income moving across states, i.e. all the money that didn’t stay in the same state over a 15-year period. That’s a critical distinction, and we found contradictory wording in the book on that point. We tried to reach Travis to clear up this point, but we didn’t hear back. We’ll update this fact-check if we do. Looking at Brown’s website tool, Florida’s biggest gains were from New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But the state also lost residents to North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Arizona and Texas -- albeit far fewer people left the state, resulting in a net population gain. Florida is one of nine states with no individual income tax, along with Alaska, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming (some of those states do tax parts of a person’s income, such as investment dividends). That means that while Florida is gaining residents in net migration, a good chunk of people are still moving out to states that have higher taxes than Florida. States with no income tax also usually have higher property or sales tax rates to compensate. The Tax Foundation said Florida ranked 27th in tax burden back in 2010. Mazerov raised other issues with Brown’s theory, chiefly that it doesn’t consider the full dynamics of people moving between the states. First, it’s not as if taxed income simply evaporates or transfers if someone moves out of a state. In most cases, it’s likely someone else in the state takes a job when someone leaves it. The person who moves would then earn income from another employer in their new state. Lyman Stone, formerly an economist with the Tax Foundation, has agreed on Medium.com that Brown’s IRS data "simply doesn’t show the migration of income, but rather shows the migration of people who formerly earned a given stream of income." Tracking income migration also doesn’t account for people who move to new states but continue to work in their old ones, nor does it include people who move because they are laid off (their jobs simply don’t exist anymore) or are part-time residents of the state -- which accounts for an estimated 800,000 people in Florida. That brings us to a host of caveats about the supposition that people are moving to Florida -- or any other state, really -- primarily for lower taxes. Research shows that taxes simply aren’t a major consideration for people who move between states. Only about 2 percent or fewer Americans move between states in any given year, and factors such as new jobs, better weather, nearby family and housing costs are much more important. Brown’s book acknowledges these factors, but still focuses on the correlation with states with low or no individual income taxes. According to a recent Gallup poll, the national average of people who say they plan to move within the next year who cite taxes as a reason is only 3 percent. Even residents of Scott’s favorite punching bag, New York, only cited taxes 14 percent of the time as a reason for wanting to move. In Florida’s case, where the cost of living is no longer as inexpensive as it used to be, climate is an especially strong factor, and the trend of more people moving from so-called "Frostbelt" states to "Sunbelt" states has been going on for decades. The University of Florida’s Population Program in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida has said jobs are the main reason people in their 20s, 30s and 40s move to the state, while climate is biggest for people in their 50s and 60s. One major factor common to all age groups? Family living in the area. Our ruling Scott said, "Estimates say individuals who escaped these high-tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion in adjusted gross income." That stat comes from an anti-tax advocate who measured the adjusted gross income of people who moved between states. There is disagreement about how much can be assumed by measuring that income migration, and even whether the $2 trillion in movement is among all 50 states or just from high-tax locations to lower-tax ones. In either case, there is plenty of research showing that of the relatively small number of people who move between states, very few of them cite taxes as a reason. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-09793	For middle-class families under the Baucus plan, "13 percent of what they make could be deducted directly from their paychecks . . . the so-called 'Max Tax.'"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/17/keith-olbermann/olbermann-glosses-over-detail-baucus-plan/	When it comes to health reform, all eyes have been watching the powerful Senate Finance Committee. The committee has been trying to reach consensus between Democrats and Republicans. The committee released its findings on Wednesday in the form of a "Chairman's mark," a report that sets out the parameters of legislation. None of the committee Republicans would support the bill at this stage. And some Democrats didn't like it much either. Liberal commentator Keith Olbermann of MSNBC savaged the proposal on his show Countdown that night, reserving particular criticism for committee chairman Sen. Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana. "If it were up to Senator Max Baucus, middle-class families would be forced — literally forced — to pay far more on health care than they already do right now," Olberman said. "Thirteen percent of what they make could be deducted directly from their paychecks and mainlined to insurance companies, the so-called 'Max Tax.'" A few moments later he described the plan in more detail. Baucus' plan, he said, "would give coverage to 30 million Americans who currently do not have any, first, by extending Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for the poor; next, by providing government subsidies to modest-income families and individuals to help them buy over-the-counter coverage. ... That means any individual making more than $32,500, or any family of four making more than $66,150, is on their own subject to the 'Max Tax' of 13 percent." For families earning $66,000, he added, "that is $700 a month they'd have to pay. If the families do not buy that insurance at that rate, they would be fined nearly half that amount." We wanted to see if he was accurately describing the plan as a 13 percent "tax" for the middle class. We found Olbermann got a lot right —- especially in his lengthier explanation — but he also left out details that would provide a fuller picture of the Baucus plan. He was right about the expansion of Medicaid. Anyone who makes less than 133 percent of the poverty level would be eligible for Medicaid under the new plan. Right now, in addition to being poor, you also have to be either elderly, pregnant, blind or disabled. Olbermann's claim about the 13 percent "tax" is based on the caps that limit how much people would pay for health insurance. Baucus' plan caps the premiums for those who earn 133 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level. Some of these people would get credits to make up the difference between the caps and what the insurance would cost. If they get a credit, they would send their premium payments to the federal government, which would then pay the insurer. The caps on how much people would have to pay for insurance are based on their income. The caps gradually increase from an estimated 4.7 percent for people at the lowest income levels, up to 13 percent of income for people who earn 300 percent of the poverty level. They stay at the 13 percent level up to 400 percent of the poverty level. Olbermann used the example of a family of four at 300 percent of the poverty line. According to the plan, the family would have income of $66,150 and pay premiums of $8,600 a year, or $716 a month. So Olbermann's numbers are solid. We have to add a few caveats here, though. Olbermann twice called these payments a tax. They are not a tax. They are a cap on premiums paid for health insurance. Other Democratic health reform plans in Congress have similar requirements that "force" people to buy insurance or pay a penalty. Their caps on premiums are more generous than 13 percent, but they still require people to pay a percentage of their income for insurance. For a detailed comparison of the three Democratic bills on this point, the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has created a handy chart . The center has criticized the Baucus plan for not being as generous for people of modest incomes as the other Democratic plans. Another caveat to Olbermann's remarks is that under Baucus' plan, none of this applies to people who already have coverage some other way. If people of modest incomes get coverage through work, for example, they keep paying whatever it is they pay now. They would not have to pay additional premiums or a penalty. Finally, we want to note that it is very difficult to make a direct comparison of how much people who now buy insurance on their own would pay under the reform plans, because the proposals would substantially change requirements for what medical treatment must be covered. We hoped to either confirm or refute Olbermann's statement that families would be forced "to pay far more on health care than they already do right now." But if they buy on the individual market, we're not sure what they're paying now. We looked for current data on this point, but were unable to find it. Right now, standards for minimum coverage vary greatly from state to state. This state-to-state variation also makes it difficult to find current data on what an "average" price for a family of four pays for an "average" plan. Obviously, if a family is uninsured now, they're going to pay more to get coverage. So back to the statement we are fact-checking. Olbermann said that for middle-class families, the Baucus plan would mean that " 13 percent of what they make could be deducted directly from their paychecks and mainlined to insurance companies, the so-called 'Max Tax.'" He's right that for people who are uninsured now, the upper limit would be 13 percent, and that money would go to insurance companies. But it's to pay for coverage they don't have now — not a tax — and some people would pay less. And all of the plans under consideration in Congress require people to pay something for coverage. So we rate Olbermann's statement Half True.	None	Keith Olbermann	None	None	None	2009-09-17T18:30:39	2009-09-16	['Max_Baucus']
pomt-01110	Agriculture contributes $71 billion to Georgia’s economy annually, making it the state’s largest industry.	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/09/georgia-farm-bureau/71-billion-question-what-value-or-impact-agricultu/	The new year brings with it a new legislative session and updated annual figures on agriculture statistics such as the average yield of, say, peanut farms. Those two factors combine in the budget process, when state lawmakers make policy decisions based, in part, by who is affected by their decisions. An alert reader had that process in mind when asking PolitiFact Georgia to check an oft-repeated claim by the Georgia Farm Bureau and politicians: Agriculture is the Peach State’s top industry. How big? The headline on a Georgia Farm Bureau web page touts, "Georgia Agriculture – The state’s $71 billion industry." A bullet point underneath is a bit more nuanced. "Agriculture contributes more than $71.1 billion annually to Georgia's economy," it reads. The distinction matters, as we’ll get to in a minute. But before we get into semantics, we have to delve into some economics. We contacted the farm bureau, which directed us to the 2013 Ag Snapshot published by the Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development at the University of Georgia. The center conducts an annual survey which allows farmers to report acreage, yield, crop price and other details. The 2013 report – which looks at 82 commodities using 2011 data – concludes the direct economic value of agriculture is $13 billion. Two pages later, it concludes that direct value, combined with the values along the supply chain from fertilizer and seed to first-line processing plants, "generated a total economic impact of $71.1 billion" for Georgia. How? Center officials told us they add to the the $13 billion what the actual economic value (using federal data compiled by a private firm) of the businesses along the ag supply chain. In 2011, the tally was $44 billion. It then induces a multiplier, adding in what workers in all of those jobs spend on daily living, to arrive at the $71 billion figure. "We are looking at the contribution of all the sectors related to agriculture," said center economist Sharon Kane. "It’s so much more meaningful to report the overall impact." The IMPLAN Group LLC, the North Carolina firm that operates the input-output modeling system and provides the figures for ag-related sectors, did not return calls to confirm data. We also contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to try to verify the agriculture numbers. It couldn’t, exactly. The agency’s Economic Research Service division can offer only somewhat comparable data in its Farm Income and Wealth Statistics tables. According to that division, Georgia’s net valued added by farms in 2011 was $2.9 billion. That’s a huge difference from between the $13 billion that farmers reported. Definitions account for part of the gap – Georgia counts timber, nurseries and agriculture tourism such as hunting licenses, while the federal agency does not. But even then, there is at least a $9 billion gap between state and federal figures. To make sense of that gap, and the calculations themselves, PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Bruce Seaman, an economist who studies economic impacts of projects and industries. Seaman, a professor of economics at Georgia State University, said the varying definitions of agriculture likely accounts for much of the massive gap in the figures. More concerning, he said, is the mixing of "impact" and "contribution" when throwing around the $71 billion figure. The Agribusiness report answers the question of how much activity is going on in agriculture and its related industries. That is the industry contribution, Seaman said. It is a snapshot of the industry, which shows agriculture makes up about 10 percent of the overall state economy. That’s very different than saying it has the same impact, or importance, he said. Consider: In 1905, about a third of all jobs in the United States were in agriculture. But Seaman said that did not mean those jobs had a proportional impact on the overall economy, or the United States would have collapsed as jobs moved into manufacturing. "It describes how much activity is linked to an industry," he said. "But it does not mean that if the agriculture industry declined by half, the economy would suffer a $35 or $36 billion loss." So, looking at the big picture, is agriculture Georgia’s largest industry? Think of it as a pie (pecan, of course. Made in Georgia). Based on the state and federal data – and adding in sectors that are directly linked to growing cotton and raising broilers – the $71 billion figure might be a bit too high, but can be mostly verified. But that figure is simply agriculture’s slice of the pie that is Georgia’s economy. In this study, making ag’s slice smaller or larger doesn’t make the pie any bigger. Agriculture is the largest single component in the state economy. But it requires another type of study to know its actual economic impact. The Georgia Farm Bureau statement is accurate, but needs some additional context to fully understood. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11409	Robert Mueller’s investigative team has "13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/21/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claims-about-Mueller/	During a weekend tweetstorm, President Donald Trump took aim at Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of investigators. "Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!" he tweeted on March 18. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Here, we’re going to take a closer look at Trump’s assertion that Mueller’s team has 13 "hardened Democrats," some "big" supporters of Hillary Clinton, and no Republicans. (The White House did not respond to inquiry for this article.) How many Democrats and Republicans are on Mueller’s team? The Special Counsel’s office had made public the identities of 17 attorney staff members through March 21. Their backgrounds are summarized here. Through public records, we were able to independently confirm that at least 12 people on Mueller’s staff are registered Democrats. They ones we confirmed are Greg Andres, Rush Atkinson, Ryan Dickey, Michael Dreeben, Kyle Freeny, Andrew Goldstein, Adam Jed, Elizabeth Prelogar, James Quarles, Jeannie Rhee, Brandon Van Grack, and Andrew Weissmann. Another member of Mueller’s team -- Aaron Zelinsky -- has been reported to be a registered Democrat by both the Washington Post and the Daily Caller. The Daily Caller also reported that Zelinsky wrote, "I’m a Democrat," in a Huffington Post column supporting same-sex marriage in November 2012. In the meantime, we were able to independently confirm that two other members of Mueller’s staff -- Scott Meisler and Aaron Zebley -- are registered to vote but have not chosen a party affiliation. We were unable to independently confirm the status of two other staff members, Zainab Ahmad and Brian M. Richardson. According to the Daily Caller, Ahmad "appears to have registered as a Republican at the age of 18, but has since changed her registration status to unaffiliated." We’ll also note that in the jurisdictions in which the Mueller lawyers live -- primarily the District of Columbia, Maryland and New York -- the Democrats are the dominant party, meaning that many races are effectively decided in Democratic primaries rather than in the general election. However, Trump’s assertion that there are no Republicans on the team is undercut by the fact that its leader is Mueller, who is registered as a Republican in the District of Columbia. Mueller was appointed to offices by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as by Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. In addition, Mueller was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, who was nominated for deputy attorney general by Trump himself, and who previously was appointed as a U.S. Attorney by George W. Bush (and later kept on by Obama). The Daily Caller has also reported that Mueller has occasionally donated to Republicans in both statewide and national races. Fox News has referred to Mueller as the "only known Republican" on the team. It’s worth noting the importance of the word "known," since other FBI or Justice Department personnel are assisting the investigation in certain capacities. The names of investigative and office support personnel have not been made public, the Special Counsel’s office told PolitiFact. James D. Robenalt, a Cleveland lawyer who runs a continuing legal education class on Watergate and its lessons, said that FBI agents in particular are likely helping gather evidence. Agents "come in all political stripes, though most are not active politically," Robenalt said. "FBI agents, as most law enforcement, tend to be conservative, law-and-order types, so my guess is most would tend to be Republicans or conservative Democrats or just plain Independents." So Trump is using some sleight-of-hand to say that there are "zero Republicans" on Mueller’s team. The team is led by a registered Republican, and there may be other registered Republicans working with Mueller whose identities the public simply doesn’t know about. How many team members supported Clinton? Trump has a point here, too, but it’s worth keeping the scale of the donations in context. Two of the 13 publicly known Mueller staffers donated what might be characterized as "big" sums to Clinton’s 2016 campaign -- Quarles, with $2,700, and Rhee, with $5,400. During the 2016 campaign cycle, $2,700 was the maximum donation an individual could make to a campaign. Such a donation could be made twice -- once for the primary campaign and then again for the general election. A third member of the team, Weissmann, donated $2,300 to Clinton, but that was in 2007, when she was making her first presidential run. (The Daily Caller separately reported that he attended Clinton’s election-night party in 2016.) Three other team members donated smaller amounts: $250 by Freeny and Prelogar, and $200 by Atkinson. Does Mueller’s team have ‘13 hardened Democrats"? How you define "hardened" is a judgment call. But if you measure by campaign donations, the point is overblown. Seven of the registered Democrats have no record of writing checks to federal candidates. Based on federal disclosure data, Quarles is easily the most generous donor on the team, giving in excess of $35,000 over the better part of two decades. Most of these donations went to Democratic candidates or entities, but it’s worth noting that Quarles also made two donations totaling $2,750 to Republicans -- former Virginia Gov. George Allen and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz. He was the only team member to give donations to federal Republican candidates. The second-most generous team member was Rhee, who gave $11,950 to Democrats in federal races. Weissman ranked third, with $6,600, followed by Andres and Goldstein, both of whom gave in the mid-$3,000 range. Freeny, Prelogar, Van Grack and Atkinson also gave money in federal races, with donations from $200 to $800. The Daily Caller found additional donations totaling a little less than $12,000 in state and local races by eight of the staff members. These donations were to Democrats. So the donor on the team who gave the most money is also the only one to donate to Republican candidates as well. Four other staff members gave between $3,000 and $12,000 over a span of several years, four more gave donations only in the hundreds of dollars, and seven more didn’t give any money at all in federal races. How much do these affiliations matter? Mueller’s team has the legal right to register to vote with a party or by making personal donations. Such activities are protected under the Hatch Act, originally passed in 1939. It’s also important to note that Mueller was prevented from considering political affiliation when putting together his team. Both Justice Department policy and the Civil Service Reform Act "prohibit using political affiliation and may also prohibit using certain ideological affiliations in hiring and taking other personnel actions with regard to career attorneys," the department’s inspector general has written. Moreover, the career attorneys on the Mueller team are bound by professional codes to pursue justice and rise above partisanship. Every federal employee swears an oath to "support and defend the Constitution of the United States" and "bear true faith and allegiance to the same." Lawyers practicing in the federal courts swear a separate oath "that as an attorney and as a counselor of this court, I will conduct myself uprightly and according to law, and that I will support the Constitution of the United States." Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in political law and government ethics at the firm Akerman LLP, said that in his experience, "Justice Department lawyers tend to skew towards the Democrats while FBI agents are overwhelmingly Republican. Both of them take an oath to dispense justice without fear or favor with regard to political party, and I’ve never seen anyone from either group act in a partisan way." "I don’t think one should ever ask about party affiliation when it comes to prosecutors," Robenalt added. "They come in all stripes. The question is whether they are qualified — and as I understand it, the team assembled is highly qualified." Robenalt said he wouldn’t advise young Justice Department lawyers to voluntarily eschew all political activity today for fear of getting attacked if they one day join a politically charged investigation. "It is a First Amendment right and crucial to our democracy," he said. "My guess is most will stay away from politics, but our country was built on the idea of freedom of belief and expression." One final point worth remembering is Trump's own history of donations to Clinton's U.S. Senate campaign (five, worth $4,100) and first presidential campaign (two, worth $2,300, though they were refunded in 2009.) Our ruling Trump tweeted that Mueller’s team has "13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans." Mueller’s team does have 13 registered Democrats and no registered Republicans, and several team members made donations to Clinton’s campaign in various amounts. However, Trump leaves out a crucial registered Republican — Mueller himself — and glosses over the fact that we don’t know the identities, or the partisan affiliation, of other Justice Department or FBI staff who are working with the investigation. It’s also questionable to say that the multiple non-donors are "hardened" Democrats. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-13512	Says that in 2015, "illegal" immigrants accounted for 75 percent of federal drug possession convictions and 5 percent to 30 percent of convictions for murder and kidnapping plus two other crimes.	/texas/statements/2016/sep/02/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-illegal-immigrants-account-75-pe/	During Austin tapings of his Fox News show, Sean Hannity thrice showed figures suggesting immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission have lately been convicted of up to 75 percent of federal crimes. In back-to-back August 2016 episodes featuring Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Hannity presented a slide listing the percentage of "illegal immigrant federal convictions" in fiscal 2015 for five crimes. On night one, most noticeably, Hannity showed the slide at the top of his show while saying "in the last year alone, illegal immigrants" were "responsible for 18 percent of drug trafficking; 30 percent of kidnapping/hostage taking; 75 percent of drug possession; 10 percent of money laundering; 21 percent of national defense; and 5 percent of murder sentences," going on to say numerous crimes have been committed lately in Texas. Some 30 minutes later, Hannity showed the slide again and said to Trump: "Something’s wrong." "Yeah, it’s wrong, it’s wrong," Trump replied, "and everybody knows it’s wrong." So, we wondered, was Hannity right about the listed crimes? His slide referenced the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which gathers information on federal crime and sentencing issues and where Sekemia Mwonyonyi replied to our inquiry with an email showing how to reach the aired figures by clicking through commission statistics posted online. Separately, Nazgol Ghandnoosh of the Sentencing Project, which says it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, also laid out the methodology. As a result, we built a chart demonstrating that Hannity accurately drew his numbers from data presenting percentages of 32 federal offenses for which citizens, non-citizens and, in particular, "illegal aliens" were sentenced in fiscal 2015. Ghandnoosh said by email that Hannity’s percentages regarding five of the federal crimes accurately tracked the commission tallies. In general, those classified as "illegal aliens" accounted for 25,670, or 37 percent, of 70,225 individuals convicted of all federal crimes in the 12 months through September 2015. That includes 18,782 sentenced for immigration offenses. The "illegal alien" category accounted for the following share of convictions in the crimes cited by Hannity: • 1,640 of 2,181 total convictions (75 percent) in which the primary charge was simple drug possession. • 13 of 43 convictions (30 percent) for kidnapping/hostage taking. • 21 of 100 convictions (21 percent) for "national defense" crimes, which include convictions for exporting arms, munitions or military equipment without a license or providing material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations or for terrorist purposes, per a 2013 commission report. • 3,555 of 19,989 convictions (18 percent) for drug trafficking. • 69 of 665 convictions (10 percent of them, for money laundering. • 5 of 91 convictions, or 5.5 percent, for murder. Mwonyonyi noted another aspect by pointing out to us that 73 percent of all the "illegal alien" federal offenders in the year--that is, 18,782 of 25,670 individuals--were primarily sentenced for immigration violations unique to the federal government. "If you take out the immigration crimes," Mwonyonyi wrote, "you find that illegal aliens committed about 14% of all non-immigration federal crimes." Sliced another way, the commission tallies show U.S. citizens drew 51 percent or more of all convictions across 29 offense categories including manslaughter (96 percent U.S. citizens); murder (84 percent); sexual abuse (95 percent); robbery (98 percent); drug trafficking (74 percent); bribery (93 percent); money laundering (76 percent); racketeering/extortion (87 percent); child pornography (96 percent); and burglary/breaking and entering (100 percent). Notably too, Hannity’s chart presents percentages of unauthorized immigrants convicted of selected federal crimes--not exploring the residency statuses of the far greater number of U.S. residents prosecuted by state and local authorities. That's probably leaving out a lot of people. For instance, as of August 2016, Texas alone held some 146,800 state prison inmates. As we completed this fact check, federal prisons altogether held nearly 193,000 inmates. Our ruling Hannity's slide states that in fiscal 2015, "illegal immigrants" represented 5 percent to 75 percent of U.S. residents convicted of five federal crimes ranging from murder to simple drug possession. Those figures accurately reflect federal data though a comprehensive picture would arguably fold in individuals convicted on similar state and local charges. We rate the statement True.

pomt-01641	"The United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee paid time off to care for a new child."	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/25/don-beyer/beye/	Former Lt. Gov. Don Beyer has his eyes set on the 8th District congressional seat in Northern Virginia, calling for stronger guns laws, protecting the environment and expanded family leave when a baby arrives. "The United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee paid time off to care for a new child..." Beyer, a Democrat, says on his campaign website. We wondered if he’s right. The Family and Medical Leave Act entitles some workers to 12 weeks of unpaid leave time when they have babies. The law has many exceptions; it does not apply, for example, to businesses with fewer than 50 employees or to workers who have been at a company for less than a year. Three states -- California, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- provide paid family leave through payroll taxes. And some companies go beyond federal requirements and provide paid leave. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 12 percent of private industry workers have access to paid leave. But the bottom line, as Beyer says, is that the U.S. does not require parents be compensated when they take time off to care for newborns. How does that compare to the rest of the world? Beyer’s office pointed us to a report released this year by the International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency. It examined maternity and paternity leave in 185 countries and territories and found that 99 percent of them require compensated maternity leave -- paid by the countries through a social insurance program, by employers, or a combination of these sources. Mothers in only two countries, the United States and Papau New Guinea, aren’t guaranteed paid maternity leave, according to the report. Beyer’s office also sent us a link to a PolitiFact National story that President Barack Obama’s claim in June that the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn’t provide paid maternity leave. Our colleagues rated Obama’s claim Mostly True, saying that U.S. leave policies for mothers is among the most meager in the world. But they noted that paid maternity leave isn’t a universal right around the world because many countries don’t offer the benefits to all working mothers of newborns. For example, temporary workers don’t receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don’t get maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don’t get leave in Japan. Canada also excludes migrant workers and moms that own more than 40 percent of their business and it requires women to have at least 600 hours of insurable employment to be eligible. There’s a wrinkle that makes Beyer’s statement a slightly different from Obama’s comment on maternity leave. Beyer uses the phrase "family leave," which can be interpreted as including paid time off for fathers. In the U.S. dads, just like moms, have a right to time off, but it’s not paid. The ILO worldwide data on fathers is not as extensive as on mothers, but suggests most developed nations offer paternity leave benefits. Amy Raub, a principal research assistant at the World Policy Analysis Center at UCLA told us a handful of other developed countries, in addition to the U.S., don’t provide paid time off for fathers. Our ruling Beyer says the U.S. is the only industrialized country that doesn’t guarantee parents paid time off to care for their newborns. To a very large extent, he’s right. The U.S. is the only developed country that doesn’t mandate paid leave for working mothers, according to United Nations’ statistics. But there are two footnotes to Beyer’s statement: 1) Many nations that mandate paid maternity leave don’t offer the benefit to all moms and; 2) There are a handful of developed nations in addition to the U.S. that don’t offer paid paternity leave. So we rate Beyer’s statement Mostly True.	None	Don Beyer	None	None	None	2014-08-25T13:34:47	2014-08-25	['United_States']
pomt-10908	"When a sinkhole began dumping toxic water in Florida's aquifer, Rick Scott tried to cover it up."	/florida/statements/2018/aug/01/gwen-graham/gwen-graham-lacks-proof-florida-gov-rick-scott-tri/	Gwen Graham says Florida needs a governor who will fight to protect clean water, unlike, she said, Gov. Rick Scott. "When a sinkhole began dumping toxic water in Florida's aquifer, Rick Scott tried to cover it up. I worked with the press to expose the secret sinkhole and hold Scott accountable," she tweeted July 18. Graham is one of five Democrats seeking the party’s nomination in the Aug. 28 primary to replace Scott, who is term-limited and running for U.S. Senate. Graham’s tweet linked to a 2016 Politico article in which Graham, then a congresswoman, was quoted blasting the state over its handling of a sinkhole at Mosaic’s Polk County phosphate plant. Here’s what Graham’s tweet has a point about: Scott’s administration, more specifically the Department of Environmental Protection, kept quiet about the sinkhole for weeks, later saying it didn’t know it was a sinkhole. But she went too far in stating that Scott himself "tried to cover it up." Her tweet also leaves out the actions Scott took once he did learn about the sinkhole. Sinkhole opened up at a plant in 2016 On Sept. 15, 2016, WFLA-Channel 8 broke the story about the sinkhole, which was the first time Mosaic commented about it publicly. The next day, WFLA reported that the Florida Department of Environmental Protection knew about the sinkhole but did not disclose it to the public. The 45-foot-wide sinkhole opened underneath a gypsum stack at a Mosaic phosphate fertilizer plant, dumping at least 215 million gallons of contaminated water into the Floridan aquifer over three weeks. Mosaic workers became aware of the leak on Aug. 27 and notified the department on Aug. 28. State inspectors arrived within 24 hours. Their initial report didn’t use the word "sinkhole," but "water loss incident." Environmentalists and the media called for more transparency by the state government. But state law at the time did not require the department to inform the public about a spill into the aquifer if it had not spread off-site. DEP officials described their response to the spill as going "above and beyond the requirements of Florida law by working with Mosaic to notify the nearest adjacent home­owners who may want their drinking water wells tested." Jon Steverson, DEP secretary at the time, said he didn't know it was a sinkhole, which was why he didn't tell Gov. Rick Scott about it until Sept. 16, 2016, the day after it hit the news. (Scott’s office confirmed to PolitiFact that he learned about it on that day.) "I knew at the time in late August that there was a water loss incident," Steverson told reporters weeks later. "I was not aware of the sinkhole until a much later point in time." Not announcing the incident, which was allowed under the law at the time, is not the same as a "cover up," which could imply that state officials and Scott schemed to hide the information. Mosaic apologized for not notifying the public sooner. Once Scott was notified, he took action during the next couple of weeks. Responding to criticism from Graham at the time, Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz told the Tampa Bay Times that Scott had directed the DEP to expedite its investigation and asked the Florida Department of Health to work with DEP to ensure drinking water was safe. Scott initially defended his agency by saying state law didn’t require DEP to notify anyone unless the pollution left Mosaic’s property. "Within 24 hours after they (the DEP) were notified, they started the investigation,'' Scott said Sept. 22. "If somebody's done anything wrong, we're going to hold them accountable.'' But days later, Scott declared the law "outdated" and announced a temporary emergency rule that included 24-hour public notification requirements. He also vowed to propose legislation for the upcoming session that would make such a policy permanent. "I am demanding any business, county or city government responsible for a pollution incident to immediately tell the public," Scott said. "That is common sense and our residents deserve that." A judge later said that the Legislature would have to set such a rule change, and it did just that in 2017 when it unanimously passed a bill signed into law by Scott. Steverson, who was Scott’s pick to lead the department, quit a few months after news about the sinkhole broke. Scott’s spokesman said Scott didn’t ask Steverson to step down. Mosaic said repairs were completed in June 2018. The state is reviewing the company’s report to ensure all repairs were effectively completed. Graham’s role After the story came out, Graham spread the word about it through statements to the media. Graham criticized the state’s response, called for an investigation and filed public records requests to Scott’s office and the environment protection department seeking electronic communications about the sinkhole. She received hundreds of pages of materials, but the communication between state officials was largely after the news broke. Graham raised questions about why the emails between state officials didn’t begin earlier. "If this is the sum total of the communication that went on between DEP and the governor’s office over this massive potential contamination," Graham said, "Florida families have a lot to be concerned about." In her tweet’s accompanying Politico story, she was more nuanced about Scott’s role. "I don’t know which is worse," Graham said in 2016. "Either Gov. Rick Scott knew about the sinkhole and didn’t inform the public, or leadership at the Department of Environmental Protection is so irresponsible they didn’t alert the governor to a potential public health disaster." Graham spokesman Matt Harringer didn’t point to any evidence that Scott himself had covered up the sinkhole, as her tweet indicates, but said his administration did and that the buck stops with the governor. "It is completely fair to use ‘Rick Scott’ and ‘his administration’ synonymously," Harringer said. "The governor is the ultimate head of the Department of Environmental Protection — and often takes credit for their actions." Our review of her comments found that she more often pointed the finger more broadly at Scott’s administration or the Department of Environmental Protection. On Facebook in September 2016 she wrote: "Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants — but the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has tried to keep a toxic sinkhole secret from the public. That's just wrong." On an April 2018 press release on her campaign website she wrote, "Graham has a record of holding Scott accountable for polluting Florida’s waters. In 2016, she launched a public records investigation to expose his administration’s role in covering up a toxic sinkhole." But the July 18 tweet was not the only time that she blamed Scott for a cover up. The environment page on her campaign website states, "When a massive toxic sinkhole opened up in Central Florida and state regulators tried to cover it up, Gwen fought for the public to know by exposing Governor Scott’s secrecy." Our ruling Graham said, "When a sinkhole began dumping toxic water in Florida's aquifer, Rick Scott tried to cover it up." She exaggerates by stating that Scott tried to cover up the sinkhole. News reports show that the head of the environmental protection department didn’t inform Scott until the media reported about it, which happened about three weeks after the sinkhole started. The department does not earn good marks for transparency: It initially labeled the sinkhole as a "water loss incident" and did not inform the public right away. But Graham goes too far in calling it an attempted cover up. Not announcing the incident was allowed under the law at the time. Graham’s tweet went further than past statements about the issue by squarely blaming Scott. The quick jab does not account for actions he took after he learned about the sinkhole, including an emergency order to change the notification rule and calling for a permanent law change about public notification (which he signed). Graham’s campaign now says that blaming Scott himself for the cover up is the same as blaming the administration. But the tweet should have been more precise. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13725	Says Gov. Mike Pence and Rep. Mike Coffman "take the same positions on a number of things ... Coffman and Pence oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans."	/colorado/statements/2016/jul/27/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-links-mike-pence-mike-coffman-says-both-oppos/	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman oppose gay rights. A July 20 DCCC news release says that Coffman, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Pence make for an "extreme" ticket and Trump and Coffman "share many of the same dangerous ideas." It compares Coffman’s and Pence’s record on eight different issues, from the minimum wage to abortion. The implication is that Pence and Coffman share the same positions, including on gay rights. "Trump’s VP pick also makes perfect sense for Coffman, given that they take the same positions on a number of things like ... Coffman and Pence oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans," the release states. PolitiFact dug into the claim that Pence and Coffman "take the same positions" in their opposition to equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. The DCCC release tries to back up its claim by saying when Pence was an Indiana congressman in 2007, he said the Employment Non-Discrimination Act -- a bill known as ENDA that sought to prohibit employment discrimination against gay people -- "wages war on freedom of religion in the workplace." The release failed to mention that Coffman took a different approach; he co-sponsored a 2013 version of ENDA. In other words, Coffman supported legislation to prohibit workplace discrimination based on "sexual orientation or gender identity" that Pence opposed in 2007. We asked about the omission, and a DCCC spokesman said "that was just for space" given that the release was running five-pages long. The news release cited Coffman’s opposition to same-sex marriage, referring to Denver Post coverage of a 2014 election debate where he said, "Certainly I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Ultimately it’s going to be up to the voters of Colorado to make that decision. I will respect as a member of Congress whatever decision that they make." In a series of yes-or-no questions, Coffman answered "no" when asked, "Should Colorado recognize same-sex marriage?" He also replied "yes" when asked, "Do you support Colorado’s ban on same-sex marriage?" After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex message, some Colorado Republican lawmakers condemned the decision. Coffman, however, said in a statement, "The world is changing, and while I’ve supported traditional marriage, the court has ruled a ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. It is time we move forward and focus on the big debates of our day — how to keep our country safe and get Americans back to work." Coffman’s spokeswoman, Cinamon Watson, dismissed the DCCC attack as "a bald-faced lie," saying Coffman is "no Mike Pence" on gay rights. She directed us to praise of Coffman by an array of LGBT organizations and Democratic flip-flopping on gay marriage by President Barack Obama and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Supporting gay rights Coffman does have a mixed record on support for LGBT rights, which some attribute to the 2011 redistricting of his 6th Congressional District, which shifted from staunchly conservative to a more diverse, middle-of-the-road swath of Denver suburbs. Gay advocacy groups have lauded Coffman for taking certain stands. Examples include: In 2015, One Colorado commended Coffman for co-sponsoring the Veteran Spouses Equal Treatment Act, to ensure that "all military families have equal access to the benefits they earned serving our country -- even if they do not live in a state with marriage equality." In September 2014, the Log Cabin Republicans PAC endorsed Coffman as one of its "strongest allies in Washington," including his co-sponsorship of anti-workplace discrimination legislation and support for renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, which for the first time included protection of LGBT people. In February 2016, the American Unity Fund praised Coffman for becoming the first Republican to co-sponsor the Juror Non-Discrimination Act, which prohibits excluding someone from serving on a jury based on sexual orientation or gender identity. He was also the only Republican to co-sponsor the Freedom from Discrimination in Credit Act of 2015, which seeks to expand the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, he voted for the Peters’ Amendment, which prohibits discrimination in federal transportation and housing programs and passed the House with strong bipartisan support. Coffman’s support for LGBT rights contrasts with Mike Pence’s hard-line stand on social issues. In April 2015, Coffman was one of eight Republicans who penned a letter to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights praising the agency's first-ever briefing dedicated to discrimination against LGBT Americans, The Hill reported. The letter came in the aftermath of the controversy over an Indiana religious freedom law signed by Pence, who later signed a revised measure facing business boycotts and a firestorm of criticism. "(Coffman) is as not as extreme as Mike Pence, and I would say not many people are as extreme as Mike Pence," Austin Montoya, spokesman for One Colorado, told PolitiFact. Opposing gay rights Coffman has taken other positions, though, that advocates of gay rights don’t like. Montoya cited Coffman’s votes against repealing the military’s "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" policy, and his support of the Defense of Marriage Act (before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the law that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples in 2013). And while Coffman did co-sponsor the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which failed to become law, Montoya noted that Coffman has not co-sponsored the more expansive Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include discrimination protection based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Our ruling A DCCC news release said, "Coffman and Pence oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans." The release stated that Coffman and Pence "take the same positions on a number of things," including on gay rights. DCCC and other critics have a point in saying Coffman opposed same-sex marriage, repealing the military’s "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" policy and he supported the Defense of Marriage Act. But he has backed legislation to protect gay Americans from discrimination in the workplace, in securing credit, in federal transportation and housing programs and in military benefits. Advocacy groups have praised Coffman’s support on some protections and said he is not as steadfast an opponent as Pence. We found several examples where the pair do not align. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fb91919a-bd52-46a0-af26-f910a8c191f8	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2016-07-27T16:07:51	2016-07-20	['Mike_Pence', 'Mike_Coffman', 'LGBT']
pomt-09294	"Obama did not open new lands to offshore drilling – all of these areas were already open for drilling once Congress and President Bush lifted the moratorium in 2008. Instead, President Obama yesterday announced what areas he would CLOSE to offshore drilling."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/23/house-natural-resources-committee-republicans/obama-didnt-expand-offshore-drilling-boehner-says/	UPDATE: This item was originally attributed to House Republican Leader John Boehner because we found this news release on his website. But after we published it, Boehner's staff pointed out to us that it actually originated with the Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee. So we are republishing the item and attributing it to them. Our analysis and ruling has not changed. A few weeks ago, President Barack Obama announced that he's going to open up new areas for offshore drilling. But according to conservative members of Congress, he's actually closing them. Here's such a claim in a news release from the Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee. "Obama did not open new lands to offshore drilling – all of these areas were already open for drilling once Congress and President Bush lifted the moratorium in 2008. Instead, President Obama yesterday announced what areas he would CLOSE to offshore drilling." The claim has been made by other Republicans, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin who said at the April 9, 2010, Southern Republican Leadership Conference that, "after inheriting a good pro-development GOP plan, that opened up both coasts for drilling, the Obama administration halted development." So yeah, we're confused. Obama's March 31, 2010, announcement about offshore drilling didn't come as too much of a surprise to those who have been following the issue closely. During the campaign, Obama went from being staunchly against the idea of allowing more drilling to saying he would be open to the prospect, a shift for which we gave him a Half Flip. So, when he said on March 31, 2010, that he'd be allowing new drilling, we made the call that he hadn't drifted too much from where he'd ended up at the end of the campaign. Here are the basics of Obama's plan, which lasts from 2012 through 2017: • The coasts of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and part of Florida's eastern seaboard will be open to "exploration, study and potential development." • The northern coast of Alaska in the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas will also be open to study and potential development. • The Bristol Bay area off of the southern coast of Alaska in the North Aleutian Basin is now protected by a presidential memorandum until 2017. Investigating whether the Republicans are right about Obama's drilling proposal requires a little history. In 1981, Congress authorized an annual offshore drilling moratorium, which was renewed regularly until 2008. Included in that ban were almost all of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts as well as parts of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1990, former President George H.W. Bush imposed an executive moratorium that overlapped with the areas prohibited from drilling under the congressional ban. In 2008, former President George W. Bush lifted his father's ban on drilling. And in the same year, amid high gas prices and election pressures, Democratic leaders allowed the nearly 30-year-old ban on drilling to lapse. Shortly before Bush left office, the Minerals Management Service of the Department of Interior issued a new five-year leasing plan that proposed opening up areas in the Pacific, Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico to new drilling. Also included in the proposal were Bristol Bay as well as the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas. So, Obama was left with a drilling plan from the former administration, and choices to make as his administration crafted its own energy policy. Under the Bush plan, those areas would have been opened quickly with only a short period of time for citizens, lawmakers and others involved in the process to vet the proposal. So, on Feb. 10, 2009, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar decided to extend the comment period on the new plan for another 180 days. During that time, Salazar held public meetings in the areas that would be impacted by the new drilling. And that brings us to March 31, when Obama announced that he would be allowing new drilling. Looking at his plan -- and the proposal Bush put on the dockets right before he left office -- it's clear that Obama decided to move forward on some parts of the Bush proposal, including drilling in the Atlantic, but scrap other parts, such as drilling in the Northeast and in Bristol Bay. So, generally speaking, the Republicans are correct that the areas where Obama is proposing new drilling were already open when Bush and Congress lifted the bans in 2008. But there is one area that is part of Obama's proposal that was not protected by either ban. It's a swath of ocean in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that is off limits until 2022 as part of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. Congress will have to rescind this law in order for drilling to take place there. The Republicans on the committee also said that the only news in Obama's drilling announcement is what areas he plans to close to drilling. Indeed, Bristol Bay has been closed to drilling until 2017 by presidential memorandum. But areas off the coast of California, for instance, have simply not been included in Obama's current drilling plan, which lasts until 2017. So, they're not officially closed, just off the table for now. Republicans also point out that most areas in Obama's plan will be studied for potential drilling first, which could slow the entire process. In theory, some of those areas may never be leased at all, but that remains to be seen. Let's recap: There is some truth to the Republicans' assertion that Obama hasn't opened new areas to drilling given the Bush proposal that was already on the books. But he overlooked the patch of ocean in the eastern gulf that was not part of Bush's plan and is in Obama's proposal. On their second point, the Republicans are also on less than solid ground. Indeed, Bristol Bay -- which likely would have been leased for drilling under the Bush administration -- is closed to drilling, at least until 2017. But other areas not included in Obama's current five-year drilling plan, such as areas in the Pacific, are not technically closed; they're just unavailable for the time being. As a result, we give the Republican members a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03473	On the coal industry	/virginia/statements/2013/jun/14/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-flip-flops-coal/	Terry McAuliffe wasn’t hot about coal in 2009 when he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. "We have got to move past coal," he said during an April 29 debate that year. "As governor, I never want another coal plant built. I want us to build wind farms, biomass, biodiesel and solar. That’s my emphasis." McAuliffe also issued a 30-page energy plan in 2009 that called for the development of clean energies and offered no hope for coal, other than an eagerness to retrain workers leaving the industry. He called for upgrades in emission controls that would make Virginia coal plants "the cleanest in America" and make the state "a leader in carbon sequestration." This year, McAuliffe seized his party’s gubernatorial nomination without opposition and Republicans are claiming he’s taken a much warmer position toward the fading coal industry, a long-time staple of the economy in Southwest Virginia. Proof of change, the GOP says, can be found in a May 8 article in the Bristol Herald Courier which quotes McAuliffe -- after visiting the headquarters of Alpha Natural Resources, one of the nation’s largest producers of thermal and metallurgical coal -- as saying he wants to help the coal industry grow. "I was over at Alpha Natural Resources talking about what they need done to make sure we have a healthy work force of coal, that coal can continue," McAuliffe told reporters. "We need to make sure we do what we need to, to make sure this vital industry here in Virginia continues to grow. I can really help them on exports; to open up those Asia markets in China and Korea. As governor, I want to help them create more jobs to help exports around the world." Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, did not reply to three requests to explain whether his boss’s coal policy had changed. Schwerin, however, did provide some information to The Virginian-Pilot in a May 23 article. "Terry believes we need to support coal workers, both through increased exports throughout the world, and workforce training to ensure that displaced workers can find new careers," he said. "The fact is, we need an all of the above energy policy that focuses on increasing renewable energy like wind and solar while supporting existing Virginia industries." Comparing all the statements, it’s clear McAuliffe is friendlier to coal now then he was four years ago, when he urged Virginia to "move past coal." This year, unlike 2009, he is promising to help the industry "grow," promising to promote coal exports to Asian markets and calling for an "all of the above energy policy." McAuliffe does not mention coal in a 13-page agenda entitled "Keeping Virginia Competitive in a Global Economy," or on campaign website site posts about his agendas on energy and jobs. In each of the postings, he talks up the need to create clean energy jobs -- particularly wind power. But McAuliffe’s words in Bristol ring loudly. We rate his new position on coal a Full Flop.

pomt-07622	"When I took office in 2003, we had very little reserves."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/20/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-providence-had-very-little-reserve-/	On March 3, Providence’s new mayor, Angel Taveras, released "staggering" figures showing that the city has a $180-million structural deficit for this fiscal year and next and has nearly depleted its reserve or "rainy day" funds. "I thought we had a Category 3 hurricane," Taveras said. "This is a Category 5." In the wake of that announcement, Taveras’ predecessor, U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, was criticized for leaving the city in poor financial shape and draining reserve funds to balance his last city budget. Cicilline denied that he had masked an emerging financial crisis in Providence and he defended his accomplishments during his eight years as mayor, saying that, "When I took office in 2003, we had very little reserves, and we worked very hard to build up our reserves." We decided to take a look. We began by asking Cicilline’s communications director, Jessica Kershaw, to provide the basis for the former mayor’s statement. In reply, Cicilline’s congressional office issued a statement saying: "When referring to the unreserved fund balance, or rainy day fund, as the attached Comprehensive Annual Financial Report shows, in 2003, when Cicilline took office as mayor, there was $10 million, and the Cicilline administration more than doubled that by building it up to $22 million by 2008." Attached to the statement was a page from the city’s audited financial statement for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010. That page shows Providence had an "unreserved" general fund balance of $10.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2003. That total rose to a high of $22.36 million at the end of fiscal year 2008, but it plunged to $2.08 million at the end of fiscal year 2010. So does $10.2 million represent "very little reserves"? Well, at that time $10.2 million was just under 3 percent of the city’s $345 million in actual general operating spending for 2003. Certainly, that’s not nearly as much as the $22.36 million in unreserved fund balance that the Cicilline administration had accumulated by fiscal year 2008 -- about 5 percent of the city’s actual spending that year. But it’s a whole lot more than the $2.08 million that the Cicilline administration had left by the end of fiscal year 2010 -- about 0.5 percent of the actual spending. And it looks really good in comparison with the $220,814 that remained in those reserves as of March 11. But what is the standard for determining whether a city’s rainy day fund is sufficient? Public finance literature often focuses on a 5 percent standard. And this year, the Government Finance Officers Association executive board is recommending revised "best practices" that call for the equivalent of two months -- or 16.6 percent -- of annual spending. With that in mind, did Cicilline have "very little reserves" when he had $10.2 million, or about 3 percent? Gary S. Sasse, the former Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council director and state revenue director who is now financial adviser to the Providence City Council, said, "I would say 3 percent is marginal reserves. It doesn’t meet the requirement of 5 percent. But it’s better than nothing. It’s better than we have right now." City Treasurer James J. Lombardi III, a critic of Cicilline’s financial practices, said that while the 2003 unreserved fund balance fell below the 5 percent threshold, that doesn’t mean Providence had "very little" reserves at the time. "Clearly, it was a lot more than we have today," he said. Plus, the Cicilline administration had other restricted contingency accounts as a cushion, Lombardi said. And in 2003, the city’s assets included the Dunkin’ Donuts Center, which it later sold. Now, the city has slashed its unreserved general fund balance, depleted restricted contingency accounts and borrowed at least $60 million to balance the budget, he said. Cicilline has defended his decision to use reserve funds and to borrow money to balance budgets, saying those actions were better than cutting city services and significantly raising taxes. "It was a judgment that I made that that was the best way to navigate through the worst economy since the Great Depression," he said. So where does that leave us? Certainly, it’s true that when Cicilline took office, the unreserved fund balance did not meet the often-cited 5 percent threshold and it fell well short of the 16.6-percent goal that a professional group now recommends. But it’s a stretch for the former mayor to characterize the $10.2 million he had in 2003 as "very little." After all, that’s almost five times what was in the reserve fund in his last year in office. Given municipal finance standards, there is an element of truth in Cicilline’s claim, but his statement ignores critical facts that would give a much different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that is the definition of "Barely True." Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	David Cicilline	None	None	None	2011-03-20T00:00:01	2011-03-04	['None']
pomt-11391	Small businesses in West Virginia "make up about 96 percent of our state's economy."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/26/joe-manchin/joe-manchin-target-small-business-share-west-virgi/	Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently cheerleaded West Virginia small businesses in a tweet from his Senate account. Manchin tweeted, "Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We were surprised that small companies comprise 96 percent of West Virginia’s economy, so we took a closer look. As it turns out, Manchin used the wrong terminology, ultimately making his claim incorrect. We turned to data from the federal Small Business Administration, which offers fact sheets about small businesses in every state. Manchin’s in the ballpark for the number of small businesses in the state. The SBA counts 115,673 small businesses, a number that is apt to fluctuate regularly, as companies start up and go out of business. (The agency’s definition of a small business is one with fewer than 500 employees.) And the fact sheet has a number close to the 96 percent figure Manchin cited. The SBA says that 98.9 percent of West Virginia’s businesses are small businesses. But that does not support what Manchin said. Saying that almost 99 percent of West Virginia's businesses are small firms is not what economists refer to as a "percentage of the economy." That term refers to the percentage of all economic output, which is sometimes called state-level gross domestic product. The fact sheet doesn’t provide small business output as a percentage of the economy, but it’s certainly well below 96 percent. Why? Because while small businesses account for nearly 99 percent of employers in the state, they only account for about half — 50.1 percent — of West Virginia employees. So it is not credible to say that half of the workforce produces 96 percent of the output while the other half — the big-company workforce — produces just 4 percent of output. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising if the half of West Virginia employees working for big companies account for more than half of economic output, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "In the nation as a whole, employees at smaller businesses tend to earn lower compensation than employees in larger businesses, probably indicating they are less productive," Burtless said. "All these facts lead me to believe there is no possible way those 120,000 small businesses can account for 96 percent of the production or output of the West Virginia economy." Manchin’s office declined to comment for this article. Our ruling Manchin said that small businesses in West Virginia "make up about 96 percent of our state's economy." This appears to be a case of mistaken terminology. Small businesses do make up nearly 99 percent of the state’s employers, but only half of its employees. The way it is worded, Manchin's claim exaggerates the output of small businesses and underplays the economic influence of large companies in the state. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-07529	"We’ve lost 26 million jobs … since (Obama’s) been president."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/06/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-says-us-has-lost-26-milli/	During an interview on NBC’s Today show on April 5, 2011, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized President Barack Obama’s handling of the economy. Asked by host Meredith Vieira whether the recent run of job growth and falling unemployment numbers "throw a real monkey wrench" into his party’s argument, Priebus said, "No, not at all. Under this president, he’s promised millions and millions of jobs. We’ve lost 26 million jobs, Meredith, since he’s been president. He promised under an $850 billion stimulus program that we’d be on a path to recovery. We’ll none of that has come true. … I think that pointing out a snail’s pace in the job (growth) numbers is not going to be enough to undo 26 million jobs that are lost, Meredith." We wondered: Has the number of jobs really declined by 26 million since Obama has been president? The answer: Not by any standard method of calculating job losses. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official arbiter of U.S. employment numbers. We found that in January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, 133,563,000 Americans were employed. Today, that number is 130,738,000. That’s a significant decline -- but of 2.8 million jobs, a number roughly a tenth of what Priebus cited. We then looked at the difference between the highest level of employment during the recent recession and the lowest level. From its peak in December 2007 to its bottom in February 2010, a total of 8.7 million jobs were lost. That’s still only about one-third of the number Priebus gave -- and that period was split roughly evenly between the presidencies of George W. Bush and Obama. We arrived at these figures, as economists do, by comparing job gains with job losses to determine a net total. It’s theoretically possible that 26 million jobs were lost during the Obama presidency and that 23.2 million jobs were created, leaving a net of 2.8 million jobs lost. But even if that were the case, economists across the political spectrum say it would be highly misleading of Priebus to focus on the job losses without citing the offsetting job gains. It would not be "kosher to count only one-half of the jobs equation," said Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said it would be "absurd" to cite the gross job numbers instead of the net numbers. Just for a sense of scale, if it were a net number, losing 26 million jobs, as Priebus indicated, would mean losing about 20 percent of the nation’s jobs -- something on the scale of the Great Depression. We e-mailed the Republican National Committee’s press office for an explanation, but they did not reply by the time we posted this story. Perhaps Priebus simply misspoke, or perhaps he misplaced a decimal point and ended up wrong by a factor of 10. Whatever the reason, the 26 million figure he cited on the Today show was ridiculously wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2011-04-06T10:33:46	2011-04-05	['None']
pomt-13161	"Nearly half of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in abject poverty."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-half-young-black-children-are-ab/	On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has often recited statistics about the economic plight of African-Americans, arguing that Democrats have done little to improve the lives of one of their core constituencies. The Republican presidential nominee did so again during a rally in Springfield, Ohio, on Oct. 27. "Nearly half of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in abject poverty," Trump said. It turns out that the poverty rate for young African-Americans is disproportionately high, but not nearly as high as Trump suggests. While the Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article, we suspect that he came across the statistic in a "State of Working America" report published by the liberal Economic Policy Institute. An infographic packaged with the report said, "45.8 percent of young black children (under age 6) live in poverty, compared to 14.5 percent of white children." If that were a current statistic, Trump would be on pretty solid ground. But it’s not. It’s not obvious from the infographic, but the State of Working America report was published in 2012. And the data itself is now six years old. The full text of the report says, "In 2010, close to half (45.8 percent) of young black children (under age 6) were in poverty, compared with 14.5 percent of white children." The problem is that 2010 was during and just after the Great Recession, so poverty rates were unusually high. To find out what the rates are now, we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The most recent data we found is for children under age 5 and covers 2015. That’s slightly different, but Census data specific to poverty levels among children age six do not change the percentage significantly. For African-Americans under five, the poverty rate was 37.4 percent. That’s quite a bit lower than the "almost half" of African-American children that Trump cited. The percentage falls even further if you give weight to Trump’s use of the term "abject poverty" and look at the poorest of the poor -- those with incomes at half of the poverty level or less. For African-Americans under 5, that half-of-poverty rate is 20.4 percent. That’s even further from "almost half." We should note that compared to other racial and ethnic groups, the poverty levels for African-Americans are indeed high. Here’s a summary for children under 5: Group Percent at poverty level Percent at half-of-poverty level African-American 37.4 percent 20.4 percent Hispanic 30.2 percent 13.1 percent White 12.8 percent 8.4 percent Asian 11.9 percent 5.0 percent Our ruling Trump said, "Nearly half of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in abject poverty." The poverty rates in question were as high as Trump says they were at the depths of the Great Recession, but they have since eased, to somewhere between 20 percent and 37 percent, depending on which income threshold you use. Still, the rates for African-American children are disproportionately high, so Trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-28T13:00:00	2016-10-27	['None']
pomt-00967	"Nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-nearly-1-5-women-us-has-been-rap/	On the occasion of this year’s Grammy Awards, President Barack Obama released a public-service announcement targeting sexual violence, particularly against women and girls. In his videotaped statement, Obama mentioned a statistic about the prevalence of rape -- with a frequency that was startling enough to provoke several PolitiFact readers to ask us to check it out. "Right now," Obama said, "nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape." Is that statistic correct? We took a closer look. We’ll start by noting that this is a different statistic than one that drew some criticism when the Obama White House and other political figures raised it last year. Vice President Joe Biden, for instance, said, "One in five of every one of those young women who is dropped off for that first day of (college), before they finish school, will be assaulted in her college years." Biden and others were referring to college campuses -- unlike Obama’s most recent comment, which was referencing overall patterns in the population. We’ll discuss the evidence for both "one in five" statistics in a moment, but first, let’s look at where Obama’s recent claim came from. The CDC study The number comes from the 2011 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, which was released in September 2014 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey was based on landline and cellphone interviews with more than 12,000 people who were 18 years or older, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The survey’s summary table shows that 19.3 percent of women interviewed reported experiences that the authors categorized as rape or attempted rape. That’s "nearly one in five," so on the broad figure Obama cited, he correctly reported the CDC’s finding. What qualified as rape in the survey? This is where it gets a bit complicated. The three subcategories listed are: • "Completed forced penetration," 11.5 percent. • "Attempted forced penetration," 6.4 percent. • "Completed alcohol- or drug-facilitated penetration" without the ability to consent, 9.3 percent. However, you can’t just add up all three subcategories -- you’d get 27.2 percent, which is significantly higher than the survey’s overall rate for rape of 19.3 percent. CDC explained that the subcategories are derived from the overall rape estimate, and they overlap. Within each estimate, victims are counted only once, but due to the possibility of re-victimization, the same respondent may be represented in multiple categories, CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard said. Comparing the CDC study with the campus study As we noted, the campus study had some methodological problems. The biggest was that researchers surveyed undergraduates at two unnamed large public universities (one in the Midwest and one in the South) -- a sampling that may not be valid for the entire country. Large universities may not be representative of experiences at mid-size or small colleges. Further, the two colleges selected may not even be representative of large campuses. In addition, the results for the campus survey were gleaned from 5,446 Web-based responses. Web-based polls yield a lower response rate than other methods, and researchers say that could skew results. By contrast, the CDC study was based on the tried-and-true technique of telephone polling -- and used a far larger, and more random, sample. It’s also worth noting that the studies had slightly different scopes. The campus survey was about "sexual assault," which included not only rape but also "forced touching of a sexual nature (forced kissing, touching of private parts, grabbing, fondling, rubbing up against you in a sexual way, even if it is over your clothes)." By contrast, the CDC figures cited by Obama focused exclusively on cases of penetration or attempted penetration. For these reasons, we consider talking points based on the CDC study to be significantly more credible than those based on the campus study. Experts agree. Last year, when we interviewed Mary Koss, a public health professor at the University of Arizona, she told us that the Campus Sexual Assault Study "is not the soundest data (the White House) could use." For this fact-check, however, she said the CDC provides the best available data. Obama, she said, is "basically right. No survey is perfect, but this survey is considered very sound in the field." We do see one legitimate reason for caution. The CDC study takes a public-health approach in its methodology, asking respondents about their past experiences without looking at whether the activities may have qualified as crimes per se, as our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted. Surveys that take a criminal-justice approach, by contrast, focus on activities that were presumed to have been criminal. Because of this methodological difference, criminal-justice surveys tend to report significantly lower rates of rape than public-health surveys do. For instance, the CDC study came up with 1.9 million cases of rape in 2012, whereas the National Crime Victimization Survey found far fewer rapes -- 347,000 -- over the same period. So, given two survey methods to choose from, Obama picked the one that produced the higher number. Ordinarily, we take issue with claims that cherry-pick results. In this case, however, we aren’t as critical of his decision, since independent scientific experts have long questioned whether criminal justice surveys under-report instances of rape. Notably, in 2014, the National Research Council concluded that under-reporting of rape in the National Crime Victimization Survey was "highly likely." William D. Kalsbeek, an emeritus professor of biostatistics at the University of North Carolina and co-chair of the National Research Council panel, told PolitiFact that "the search continues for the best way to measure rape and sexual assault in population surveys. Our panel found that the broader, behavior-based definition of rape and sexual assault used by (the CDC study) is preferable to the more limiting, legal-based definition" used in the criminal-justice survey. Our ruling Obama said that "nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape." A well-respected survey by the CDC found that 19.3 percent of women reported experiences that are considered to be rape or attempted rape under the survey’s guidelines. There are other surveys, using a different methodology, that show lower rates of rape, but researchers say the data in the CDC study is at least as credible, if not more so. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-02-16T12:06:15	2015-02-08	['United_States']
pomt-09208	"You’ve got almost twice as many cops in New York City as you do on our entire border. That’s nuts."	/texas/statements/2010/may/21/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-nypd-force-almost-twice-size-border-/	Asked whether Texas needs to follow Arizona’s lead and enact a hard-line immigration law, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said in a May 12 interview with the Texas Tribune that he was more interested in “a long-term solution” to illegal immigration: securing the border. Claiming the federal government had done “virtually nothing” to address the situation, Dewhurst said border operations conducted by “local sheriff’s departments, local police departments, the state and our federal partners” had taught the following lesson: “At the end of the day, [even with] all of the technology in the world, you need people.” To emphasize his personnel point, Dewhurst compared the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents to the number of police officers in the nation’s largest city, New York. “You’ve got almost twice as many cops in New York City as you do on our entire border,” Dewhurst said. “That’s nuts.” Nutty, maybe. But does Dewhurst's statement reflect reality? Answering our query, his office provided figures from the New York Police Department indicating that it has about 34,500 officers and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the Border Patrol has about 19,100 agents on the northern and southern U.S. borders. The Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection division of the federal Department of Homeland Security. We checked, and those figures stand up. The website for the New York Police Department says the agency's "current uniformed strength is approximately 34,500." And Steven Cribby, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the Border Patrol numbers about 20,000 -- 17,000 of whom are stationed on the U.S-Mexico border. An additional 2,100 employees are on the border with Canada, with the rest patrolling coastal waters, primarily near Puerto Rico. Counting only the border agents that work the southern and northern borders, the NYPD force is about 81 percent larger than the Border Patrol, almost twice the size, as Dewhurst says. (That calculation leaves out the Border Patrol agents who work coastal waters. If you add those, the New York force is 73 percent larger.) We wondered, though, if it's reasonable to compare cops working the nation's biggest city to officers monitoring our international borders. We put that question to several law enforcement and criminal justice experts, including Samuel Walker, professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. His assessment: "The comparison of the NYPD and the Border Patrol is completely wrong, given their very different roles and working environments." Walker's point, which we heard separately from other experts: The two organizations have dramatically different missions and environments. The New York Police Department responds to calls for service from the city’s more than 8 million residents and numerous visitors, while fighting all kinds of crime, in a dense urban area. In contrast, the experts said, the Border Patrol has much narrower responsibilities, which they have to fulfill across vast spaces -- much of it sparsely populated. Since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the agency’s primary mission has been to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country, Cribby said. Agents are also tasked with preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country illegally and stopping drug and human trafficking along the border between the legal ports of entry. Even comparing staffing levels of different police departments can be tricky. The usual basis for comparison is the number of sworn officers per 1,000 residents. Those ratios vary widely across the country and even from city to city. Based on the most recent numbers available, New York's ratio in 2008 was 4.3 officers per 1,000 residents; the national rate was 2.5. “It’s often like comparing apples to carburetors because there is so much difference in how departments use people,” said Craig Fraser, director of management services for the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit research and consulting group in Washington. In some cities, police officers do jobs that are performed by civilian personnel elsewhere. Some police departments have fewer officers because other local law enforcement agencies, like a sheriff’s office, pick up slack. It's even trickier to compare agencies with such different duties as the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department, as Dewhurst did. So where does all of this leave his statement? The lieutenant governor accurately characterizes the relative sizes of two law enforcement agencies -- the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department. He may have a point that the border needs more federal agents -- though there is disagreement over whether more boots on the ground will prevent illegal immigration -- but comparing the size of that force to the cops in the Big Apple is not a valid way to prove it. Because his comparison takes the numbers out of their proper context, we rate his statement as Half True.	None	David Dewhurst	None	None	None	2010-05-21T06:21:48	2010-05-12	['New_York_City']
pomt-12935	On resigning her Texas House seat.	/texas/statements/2017/jan/10/dawnna-dukes/full-flop-dawnna-dukes-sworn-after-vowing-resign-h/	Months ago, Dawnna Dukes declared that she’d resign her Texas House seat, effective Jan. 10, 2017. Yet on that date, the 11-term Austin Democrat, who's been under investigation for possibly using taxpayer resources for nongovernmental purposes, joined House colleagues in getting sworn in to serve a fresh two-year term. Dukes represents House District 46, which extends from East Austin north into Pflugerville. Dukes’ actions prompted us to roll out the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter. Let’s recap: In 2013, Dukes sustained injuries in an automobile accident that she subsequently blamed for often missing House meetings. In two 2016 investigations, too, the Austin American-Statesman uncovered questionable expenses on Dukes’ campaign spending reports and revealed that she was absent from the Legislature for much of the 2015 session, even as she apparently attended several social events. The newspaper also found that Dukes’ consulting company and her subcontractors made more than $1 million over four years working to boost the number of minority- and women-owned companies working for the Austin school district, but had little to show for its work. Dukes then stressed persistent injuries and her desire to care for her daughter in initially telling the Quorum Report, a Capitol news organization, about her plans to resign. That report’s Sept. 26, 2016, story about Dukes’ plans quoted her as saying that multiple visits to the emergency room combined with a more serious evaluation of her condition from physicians had forced her to re-evaluate her situation. "This has been a very difficult decision to make," Dukes said. "However, in light of my ongoing health issues and concerns, I find that I can no longer provide the active, effective leadership that is needed to continue my sworn duties. I must take the time to focus all of my energy to heal and continue to provide for my young daughter and extended family." Later that day, the Statesman noted in its news story on Dukes’plans that she’d been dogged by a criminal investigation into use of taxpayer resources for nongovernmental purposes. Her retirement announcement came days after the Texas Rangers delivered the findings of their probe to the Travis County district attorney’s office, which was reviewing the file, the story said. The story also said Dukes was "allowing her current term to expire rather than resigning immediately, allowing her to make an extra $3,220 per year in retirement benefits from the state because serving any amount in January counts as a full year when calculating pension benefits." Also noted: Dukes’ name would still appear on the November 2016 general election ballot. Without campaigning for the seat, Dukes went on to defeat her Republican opponent in the heavily Democratic district. Still, the expectation remained that the seat would become vacant starting Jan. 10, the first day of the 2017 regular legislative session, and remain vacant pending the results of a special election to be called by Gov. Greg Abbott. Next, though, the Statesman reported Jan. 7, 2017 that Dukes had notified the new Travis County district attorney, Margaret Moore, that she was no longer planning to step down. Three days later, about half an hour after the noon start of the 2017 session, Dukes joined colleagues in the House and was sworn in to serve a fresh two-year term. Earlier, Dukes explained her move in a Jan. 9, 2017, Facebook post, which she described as her replies to questions from the Texas Tribune, that after constituents urged her to reconsider her plans, her doctors "gave me the green light and I decided to ensure District 46 had experienced representation starting on" the session’s opening day. After her swearing-in, Dukes reaffirmed that explanation to reporters. She also declined to discuss the county's probe, saying, "Anything concerning legal is in the process, or not, and I don’t plan on discussing it." After we posted this story, Dukes responded to our earlier requests for comment on whether she'd flip-flopped by saying her late-breaking decision to fill the seat honored her longstanding commitment to voters who gave her the 2016 Democratic nomination before she announced her plan to resign the seat. Voters went on to re-elect her, Dukes stressed. Doctors gave her encouragement, Dukes reaffirmed by phone, and constituents "talked me into keeping the promise to serve." Asked if she plans not to resign at all, Dukes said she intends to serve "as long as the people elect me." Our ruling Summing up, Dukes said in September 2016 that she’d resign her seat in early 2017. On Jan. 10, 2017, however, she was sworn in to serve an additional two years representing the Austin-area district. We find this a FULL FLOP. Full Flop A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop. UPDATES, Jan. 10, 2017: This story was revised to clarify when the Statesman reported on possibly questionable uses of goverment resources. We also heard back from Dukes and added her elaboration about deciding to get sworn in. These revisions didn't affect our Flip-O-Meter rating. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43553e90-2b5d-4a23-a195-4a45f99271c0	None	Dawnna Dukes	None	None	None	2017-01-10T16:29:39	2017-01-10	['Texas_House_of_Representatives']
pomt-07199	Planned Parenthood "raked in more than $300 million in profits over the past four years."	/florida/statements/2011/jun/07/marjorie-dannenfelser/abortion-opponents-claim-planned-parenthood-had-30/	A debate in Congress earlier this year about whether to yank millions of dollars in federal funding for Planned Parenthood spawned a whole slew of claims by politicians about abortion. The Truth-O-Meter weighed in on several claims: everything from a claim by Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain that Planned Parenthood's early objective was to "help kill black babies before they came into the world," which got a Pants on Fire, to Richard Corcoran, a Florida state representative, who claimed that "90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted," which received a True rating. Before we delve into a new claim about Planned Parenthood, here is a summary about the debate from an April 21 fact-check by our colleagues at PolitiFact National: "Even though Planned Parenthood cannot use federal money to provide abortions, Republicans passed an amendment in the U.S. House in February that would block all federal funding to the group. Republicans contend that any support for Planned Parenthood can provide indirect support for abortions. The amendment, which did not have sufficient support to pass the Senate, was a key issue in the budget debate that nearly led to a government shutdown on April 8, 2011. It was not included in the budget agreement that prevented the shutdown." Planned Parenthood receives about $363 million a year from the federal government, which can be used for cancer screenings, annual exams, birth control and other preventative services. Now, a leader of an organization that advocates for pro-life legislation claims that Planned Parenthood is a money-maker. The claim comes from a U.S. News and World Report Washington Whispers blog on May 26 about U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- the Democratic National Committee chair who represents part of South Florida -- who called the GOP "anti-women" after the vote to de-fund Planned Parenthood. In response, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said: "The truly ‘anti-woman’ organization here is Planned Parenthood and the party that continues to defend its taxpayer funding when it has raked in more than $300 million in profits over the past four years. Fifty-four percent of Americans don’t want to be coerced into contributing to an organization they don’t believe in just by paying their taxes — nor should they be." For this Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to check Dannenfelser's claim that Planned Parenthood "raked in more than $300 million in profits over the past four years." We'll focus on two parts: Is the dollar figure right, and is 'profit' the right word? We contacted SBA List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley, who referred us to "excess of revenue over expenses" listed in Planned Parenthood's annual reports. Here is what those reports show: 2005-06: $55.8 million 2006-07: $114.8 million 2007-08: $85 million 2008-09: $63.4 million Total: $319 million. Although Planned Parenthood doesn't dispute the numbers pulled from the annual reports, a spokesman says it's not that simple. Spokesman Tait Sye notes that the full text of that line in the annual report for 2008-09 is "excess of revenue over expenses excluding investment losses." He points to the next line showing that the organization lost $78.1 million in investments that year, which should be subtracted from the four-year total. He also says that the group sometimes receives multi-year grants that show up as revenue in one year but are really spread out over several years. In the reports from other years, the financial data does not refer to investment losses or gains, and Sye said those amounts were simply included in the totals for those years. The extraordinary losses when the markets plunged for almost all investors, presented differently in the 2008-09 report, makes it awkward to combine the four years since Planned Parenthood didn't detail its investment losses or gains previously. Subtracting the $78 million would leave the group with about $240 million in revenue over expenses in the four-year period. But how much more or less is unknown since we were unable to obtain the actual investment income for the other years. We asked the SBA List why it didn't factor in the investment losses. Quigley responded: "We added up the bottom-line numbers that Planned Parenthood listed for excess revenue." We think the number is somewhat overstated because of those 2008-09 losses, but we can't tell by how much. In the second part of our fact-checking, does the "excess revenue over expenses" constitute a "profit"? We sent Dannenfelser's claim to experts in nonprofit management and heard back from four. Three disagreed with using the term "profit" to describe excess revenues over expenses: Christopher Stone, faculty director of the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard University; Herman B. "Dutch" Leonard, professor of public management at Harvard Kennedy School of Government and at the Harvard Business School; and Beth Gazley, assistant professor at Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs. "Bottom line: a nonprofit’s surplus should not be confused with profit," Stone wrote in an e-mail. "Profits are generated by businesses to reward investors. Businesses also use profits to provide additional compensation (bonuses tied to profits) for employees who help generate the profits for investors. Because nonprofits may not use their surpluses for either of these purposes, these surpluses should not be confused with profits. All surpluses must be devoted to the charitable purposes of the organization." And Gazley wrote: "But more to the point, the 'taxpayer'-funded portions of the Planned Parenthood affiliates’ budgets are either program grants or reimbursements for services eligible for Medicaid. So the government-funded parts of the (Planned Parenthood) budget would NOT be generating a 'profit' – they would be used in full each year. This means any excess of revenues over expenses (AKA 'profit') would have come from other sources – private donations, endowment income, etc. So Ms. Dannenfelser’s argument that the taxpayers are somehow subsidizing this 'profit' is misleading." We asked Gazley how she knew the taxpayer portions were not the source of the excess revenue. She cited her 16 years of experience as a fundraiser and management consultant for nonprofits, and her service as both a board member and past president of a developmental disabilities agency that is primarily Medicaid funded. "Based on my experience with other NPOs, it is very hard (to carry a surplus of federal funding from year to year) given the care that is taken in the calculation of formulas to reimburse only for real costs," she wrote. Sye, the Planned Parenthood spokesman, also said the federal funds are not part of the excess of revenue over expenses -- in fact, he said, the government money never covers the full cost of services. Back to whether we can call that excess of revenue over expenses a "profit." Terri Renner, longtime CPA and lecturer at Indiana University's school of Public and Environmental Affairs, argued that "the excess of revenues over expenses is the accounting definition of profit." "Any time an organization of any kind has revenue that exceeds expenses - it's making a 'profit,' " Renner wrote in an e-mail. "NPOs don't like that word - so they use different vocabulary ('revenues over expenses'). The key difference is that for-profit organizations usually distribute part of the excess to the owners as compensation for their investment and reinvest the rest back into the company. NPOs reinvest all of the money back into the organization - theoretically." Planned Parenthood, of course, disagrees with characterizing the sum as a profit. "To be clear, Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit entity and so we do not generate a profit," Sye said. "Obviously the reserves are reinvested to meet the health care needs of women we serve. Every healthy nonprofit will have reserves." We asked Quigley of the SBA List, why refer to this figure as a "profit" for a nonprofit? She responded by e-mail: "We feel the point is clear — we’re not saying nonprofits shouldn’t have a profit, but rather wish to point to excess in profit and question why this organization would need to be supplemented by American taxpayers. Planned Parenthood does not need to receive $363 million in taxpayer funding per year." Let's return to Dannenfelser's claim: "The truly ‘anti-woman’ organization here is Planned Parenthood and the party that continues to defend its taxpayer funding when it has raked in more than $300 million in profits over the past four years." We said we'd examine both the dollar figure and the word "profits." We think the "more than $300 million" description is off base because of the $78 million in losses, but neither Planned Parenthood nor the SBA List is saying definitively what the investment gains or losses were for the four-year period. Still, there is some element of truth in that it's at least scores of millions of dollars. In the second part of our ruling, we looked at whether "excess revenue over expenses" for a nonprofit is the same as "profit." Most of the experts we consulted say no. And the one who would call it profit agrees that it's not treated the same way as profit for a corporation. Companies distribute their profits to shareholders and owners, while nonprofits put their excess revenues back into the organization's work. We think the real sting in this claim comes from the word "profits," so we weighed that more heavily than the vague dollar figures in our ruling. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00701	"The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/01/marco-rubio/iran-united-states-disagree-nuclear-deal-framework/	How can the United States and Iran come to a deal on Iran’s nuclear program when the two countries can’t even agree on what they supposedly agreed to? That’s the point presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. -- a vocal critic of the negotiations -- made on National Public Radio April 13. "I still have tremendous questions about whether this deal's even viable," he said. "The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things." President Barack Obama and the other negotiating parties -- Iran, China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany -- hit a milestone in early April. They established a framework agreement that lays the foundations for a final deal, to be reached in the summer. So we wondered: Are the United States and Iran’s descriptions of what the deal will entail so different? It’s important to keep in mind that the agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, was a framework, not a final deal. The framework itself isn’t publicly available, and the parties still have plenty of details to hammer out. For these reasons, there’s room for the negotiating parties to fill in the blanks with details that appeal to constituents. Even so, some of the differences between the United States’ and Iran’s descriptions of the agreement are significant -- such as the timeline for sanctions relief and how much access international inspectors will have to Iran’s nuclear facilities. Back in April, Iran and the United States decided to set these differences aside, hoping to successfully address them later, said Matthew Kroenig, a professor at Georgetown University and an expert in nuclear weapons policy. "These differences are important, however, and could very well kill the deal," Kroenig said. Officials in both countries have said the other’s descriptions run counter to what was decided in Lausanne, and if they can’t agree, the potential for a deal might die. Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Javad Zarif tweeted and said on Iranian television that the American factsheet was "in contradiction" to the framework agreement, according to the New York Times. Responding to a question about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s pushback against the deal, Obama told reporters April 11, "If that is his understanding and his position -- in ways that can't be squared with our concern about being able to embark on vigorous inspections to assure that Iran isn't cheating under any program, and that we don't have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a potential violation -- then we're probably not going to get a deal." Significant discrepancies We reached out to Rubio’s team and didn’t hear back. But Iran and the United States have each produced factsheets about the agreement, in addition to a joint statement from the negotiating parties. If you want to look at the details yourself, Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs put together a side-by-side comparison of all three fact sheets and relevant political statements. A major discrepancy between Iran and the United States is the timeline and conditions for pulling back sanctions against Iran. According to the American factsheet, the United States and European Union will "suspend" sanctions against Iran after it has been verified that Iran is complying with the deal. The sanctions can "snap back" into place if it is discovered that Iran is not complying. Iran’s summary, on the other hand, says the sanctions will be "revoked" as soon as the deal is implemented -- distinguishing a permanent change from the ability to reinstate sanctions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said April 4, "During the talks we (both sides) always talked about lifting economic, financial, and banking sanctions. We never talked about the suspension of the sanctions, and if that were the case, no agreement would form." Additionally, Obama said the sanctions relief would be "phased in," while Rouhani said the sanctions would be canceled on the "very first day of the implementation of the deal." Another point of contention is the level of access international inspectors will have to Iran’s nuclear facilities. The American factsheet has several bullet points emphasizing that the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspectors will have near universal access to Iranian nuclear facilities. Obama called it "unprecedented," noting that Iran will also be required to grant access to the material supply chain in addition to the facilities themselves. Iran’s summary of the framework says much less about verification processes. It says Iran will comply with some of the agency’s protocols "on a voluntary and temporary basis." Additionally, Iran’s religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said international inspectors will not have unlimited access to nuclear facilities. "It must absolutely not be allowed for them to infiltrate into the country’s defense and security domain under the pretext of inspections," Khamenei said, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. While the discrepancies over sanctions and levels of verification are important, others are a just matter of spin, said Graham Allison, director of Harvard’s Belfer Center and a nuclear weapons analyst. For example, regarding one of Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities, the United States factsheet says, "Almost two-thirds of Fordow’s centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed." Iran’s factsheet, on the other hand says, "More than 1,000 centrifuge machines and all related infrastructure in Fordow will be preserved and maintained." Both descriptions are accurate -- Fordow currently has 2,710 centrifuges, and the deal will lower that number to 1,044. While the differences in the public descriptions may be striking, Allison said people should not pass judgment on the final deal yet, given that the real negotiations are conducted in private, meaning the real contents of the deal are private, too. "Poisonous political divides in both Washington and Tehran mean that a host of commentators and even journalists seize on, and even exaggerate, these differences for their own political ends," Allison said. Our ruling Rubio said, "The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things." Leaders in Iran and the United States are both accusing the other of distorting the framework agreement reached in April -- and there are some dramatic and significant differences in the way the two countries are describing aspects of the agreement. It’s important to keep in mind that the agreement is not the final deal, and many details have yet to be solidified. But Obama and experts have said some of the differences that have surfaced, if unresolved, could kill the final deal. We rate Rubio’s claim True. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.

pomt-09513	"As Houston's mayor, I helped our area lead the nation in job growth."	/texas/statements/2010/feb/17/bill-white/white-says-houston-led-nation-job-growth/	Former Houston mayor Bill White, running for governor, frequently touts his experience leading the country's fourth-largest city, which he casts as an economic powerhouse. "As Houston's mayor, I helped our area lead the nation in job growth," White wrote responding to a questionnaire from the League of Women Voters of Texas, a nonpartisan group that encourages active participation in government. The league published White's and other candidates' responses in its primary election Voters Guide for the March 2 party primaries. Houston led the entire country in job growth? Sounds wondrous. We wondered if White was rightfully bragging. Katy Bacon, White's spokeswoman, pointed us to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics that White's campaign used to compare the job growth in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown area to growth in the rest of the United States. You're reading right: The White campaign compared Houston's job growth to job growth in other states. And it found that over his six years as mayor, Houston gained more jobs than any state outside Texas. The skinny: Some 244,100 jobs were added in the Houston area during the period, compared to 156,800 in Washington, the state with the second-highest increase in jobs. Texas was first with 943,000 new jobs. We confirmed those numbers — and found a wrinkle the White campaign overlooked. It turns out that Dallas, which gained 265,800 nonfarm jobs from 2003 through 2009, led the country in job growth. When we noted that that put the Houston area in the number two spot — in contrast to leading, as White says in the voter guide — Bacon said: "Even if we're number two or number three, we're still leading the nation." Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, guided us to the way she said most economists gauge job growth — by the rate at which jobs increase, instead of the gross number of jobs added. By that calculation, Wyoming led the nation with nearly 12 percent job growth during White's mayoral tenure, followed by Houston (about 10.6 percent), Utah (10.2 percent), Dallas and Texas (both about 9.9 percent). Abbot's approach seemed reasonable. After all, counting raw job gains for any community or state would give areas with more residents a natural advantage in the competition. By the same token, relatively few jobs in a place with a small population can have an outsized impact, percentage-wise. Take Odessa, with 21.5 percent job growth, or Grand Junction, Colo., with 14.2 percent. Another example of the numbers game: Farouk Shami, a Houston businessman and White's opponent in the Democratic primary, has said that the ranks of Houston's unemployed increased by 42,000 people on White's watch. By singling out the raw number, Shami downplays factors including whether employment increased too as population grew, not to mention a devastating recession that affected the entire country. No matter how the job numbers are sliced, Houston experienced significant job gains while White was mayor. It added more nonfarm jobs than any other state during that time — but still, fewer jobs than Dallas. By percentage, Houston boasted the second highest rate of nonfarm job growth (San Antonio was first) among the 10 biggest cities in the country. Houston was among the national leaders. But it wasn't No. 1. We rate White's statement as False.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-02-17T22:36:27	2010-02-02	['Houston']
pomt-12424	"Jefferson Davis statue to be replaced with Obama likeness."	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/18/tdalliancecom/obama-statue-replacing-jefferson-davis-new-orleans/	A website masquerading as a Fox News Channel page ran a fake news story saying officials in New Orleans are replacing a memorial to the leader of the Confederacy with a statue of former U.S. President Barack Obama. "Jefferson Davis statue to be replaced with Obama likeness," read the headline on a May 12, 2017, post on TDAlliance.com. The site has a banner reading "Fox News: The FB Page," and several other posts resembling news stories. This particular post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fake, part of the social media site’s efforts to battle fabricated stories in news feeds. The story built on a real news story from NPR about the Big Easy replacing Confederate icons around the city. This particular account is from May 11, recounting how work crews had to remove the Davis statue in the middle of the night after "death threats against city officials and contractors." The TDAlliance.com post used bits and pieces from that real story, then added fake news that an Obama statue will take Davis’ place. "The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisiana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars," the story read. It also added that the Davis monument would be "melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders." Looking at the crude composite image plastered on the story, we saw a familiar sight: A real bronze statue of Obama installed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, back in 2012. When last we saw this statue, it was erroneously cited as being erected in the White House (read here for more about that contrived tale). TDAlliance.com appears to alter existing news stories, or make subtle changes to comments from officials in myriad posts. The site’s registration does not denote the administrator. We attempted to reach the site through its Contact Us form, but did not receive a response. The site’s About Us page reads, "Fox News The feedback Page is a Conservative Christian look at the Government, today’s news , and mostly a way for the page author to attract hot chicks." Its Facebook information page calls the site "the #1 name in newsfotainment." Not only is the site’s story wrong about there being an Obama statue in the works in the Crescent City, but it steals details from a legitimate news story from a real media organization to make its ruse harder to discern, all while impersonating Fox News.

Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up, too."	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/11/blog-posting/no-obama-did-not-follow-trump-g20-summit-germany/	A website that makes no guarantees that its information is factual claims former president Barack Obama went to the G20 summit, trailing current President Donald Trump and not leaving him alone. "Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no?," said a July 8 post on world-politicus.com headlined "Obama Goes To G20 Summit." "This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be." This year’s G20 meeting was held July 7-8 in Hamburg, Germany. The "Group of Twenty" — 19 countries and the European Union — meet to discuss the world economy, international cooperation, and other topics. G20 finance representatives have been meeting regularly since 1999. Heads of state and government for the 19 countries and top representatives for the European Union began meeting annually since 2008 in response to the financial crisis. Obama attended the summits when he was president, but his spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that he was absent from this year’s event, "nor was he in Germany." Obama was not even traveling abroad during that time, said Kevin Lewis, Obama’s spokesman. "The last time that he was in Germany was about a month ago," Lewis said July 11. The G20’s website lists Trump’s name and photo as the U.S. leader, not Obama. Trump is included in official photos of the event, not Obama. And had Obama actually appeared at the event, it would have made international news and being widely reported. World-politicus.com’s "Disclaimer Policy" page said all information on the website is "published in good faith and for general information purpose only," but does not assure that the information is true. World-politicus.com "does not make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information," the website said. We reached out to world-politicus.com but did not get a response. The article in world-politicus.com also appears in another website, wetheproudpatriots.com, with the headline "Obama Shows Up In Germany For G20 Acting Like The President… Look What He Did To Screw Trump." The "Terms and Conditions" page for wetheproudpatriots.com says it "does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful." Our ruling World-politicus.com published a post headlined, "Obama Goes To G20 Summit," adding "Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up, too." Obama has attended previous summits, but his spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that he was not present at this year’s event, "nor was he in Germany."

pomt-13864	"40% of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun."	/florida/statements/2016/jul/07/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-right-about-far-reaching-/	In the wake of the Orlando shootings and lacking congressional action regarding gun reform legislation, many are calling attention to the the devastating truths about gun violence in the United States. One of the vocal supporters advocating for tighter gun restrictions is Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. Wasserman Schultz took to her Medium page to lament the occurrence at Pulse Night Club and to express the need for stricter gun legislation that she believes can prevent future gun violence fatalities, especially by suspected terrorists. In her June 18, 2016, post, Wasserman Schultz wrote that "40% of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun — gun violence has touched someone you know." Many other politicians have made many claims regarding gun violence, but this assertion seemed particularly far-reaching. Do two out of every five Americans know someone whose death can be attributed to a gun? We took a closer look. The evidence We reached out to one of Wasserman Schultz’s campaign representatives, and they told us that the 40 percent figure came from an October 2015 Huffington Post article that cited a YouGov poll from the same month. YouGov is an online market research organization that utilizes a network of over 4 million users who offer their personal views and experiences by participating in surveys. The poll that Wasserman Schultz refers to surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults selected by a random sample stratified by age, gender, race, education and region. One of the questions asked in the survey was, "Do you personally know anyone who has been killed by another person with a gun?" The poll found that 22 percent said yes, with 6 percent saying the person was in their family and the other 16 percent saying it was someone else they knew. Another question asked, "Do you personally know anyone who has committed suicide using a gun?" On that question, 28 percent of participants answered yes, with 7 percent knowing a family member who used a gun to commit suicide and 21 percent saying they knew someone else who committed suicide with a gun. The 40 percent figure asserted by the Huffington Post article as well as in Wasserman Schultz’s Medium post come from the total percentage of participants who had professed to knowing someone who had died because of a gun. The 40 percent figure is reached once you take into account the overlap between the respondents who knew both a homicide and a suicide victim. We reached out to to Peter Moore of YouGov, who published the poll online, to ask if Wasserman Schultz’s claim accurately encapsulated the results. "I’ve had a look at the full dataset, and I can confirm that the 40 percent figure is accurate," Moore said. "Her statement does properly capture the poll’s findings. It is also consistent with other similar survey data." We asked Moore about possible sources of error in the survey, and he responded, "There are none in particular beyond the general margins of error associated with surveys," which was determined to be 4.1 percent by YouGov. To contextualize the YouGov poll, we reached out to James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University. While not debating the results or methodology of the poll, he did offer some caveats. He noted that suicides account for a large share of the deaths -- a fact that may not be obvious from Wasserman Schultz’s statements. He also said that the poll’s wording leaves a fair amount of interpretation to the respondent. Respondents "have to decide how well they know someone," he said. "There are better ways to write questions like this so it’s not so vague." In all, the way the questions were worded may make the percentage sound "a lot worse than it is," Fox said. Past data While there have been many surveys conducted regarding guns and gun violence, the most similar polls to the YouGov poll were surveys conducted in 1993 and 1999 by Gallup. The question in both years was, "Not including military combat, has anyone close to you--such as a friend or relative--ever been shot by a gun?" In 1993, 64 percent responded no and 36 percent responded yes. In 1999, the percentage of people answering yes dropped to 31 percent, compared to 69 percent responding no. It’s important to note that the Gallup questions refer to people getting shot -- a larger universe than those getting shot and killed. So, it’s not a direct comparison. Though the Gallup results can by no means confirm or refute YouGov and Wasserman Schultz’s claim, the numbers do not appear drastically different. With limited inquiry into the number of people who are close to victims of gun violence, it is difficult to ascertain a clear estimate. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, "40 percent of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun ." Wasserman Schultz is right about the 40 percent figure if you consider the YouGov poll findings. It’s important to note that a majority of the 40 percent figure comes from suicide deaths, not homicides. And there is limited research on this topic generally. Overall, we rate her claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26bdb266-7613-4006-af9c-19d4e47313e8	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2016-07-07T14:03:46	2016-06-18	['United_States']

In replying, he changed the focus, making what is essentially a definitive claim about national polls on possible presidential contenders. "No, I mean, in the end, any poll right now is ridiculous," the governor said. "You look over the past four or five elections, people who poll high at the beginning are not the people who end up being the nominees." Given that Walker ranks ninth out of 11 potential GOP presidential candidates, according to Real Clear Politics’ polling averages, such a claim, if true, could mean a run isn’t necessarily a lost cause. Of course, the 2016 election is still two years away, most voters aren’t paying close attention and the potential candidates will do plenty of jockeying in the meantime. "Campaigns certainly matter," pollster Gary Langer, who directs ABC News polling, told us. "However, being an early leader has its advantages." Wisconsin poll The poll alluded to by the Fox interviewer was an exit poll of Wisconsin voters who had just cast ballots in the Nov. 4, 2014 mid-term elections. Amid a wave of GOP wins nationwide, Walker was re-elected that day by a margin of 52 percent to 47 percent. But only 42 percent of the state voters in the exit poll, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said Walker would make a good president. Walker’s evidence We asked Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick for evidence to back Walker’s statement about early polling in presidential races. She noted some instances in which an early front-runner did not get nominated for president, including two in 2008. Hillary Clinton, who held a big lead in early polling, lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama; and Rudy Giuliani, who dueled with John McCain in early polling, lost the GOP nomination to McCain. But Walker’s claim takes us all the way back to the 1996 presidential election. So let’s get a fuller account of early polling and who the nominees turned out to be. Early presidential-preference surveys To avoid comparing apples and oranges, we looked at polling only for open seats; in other words, polls for nomination races in which an incumbent president was not seeking his party’s nomination for another term. In 2016, that’s the playing field for both parties. We relied primarily on polling data provided by researcher Kathleen Weldon from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research and work that FiveThirtyEight.com blogger Nate Silver did in 2011 for the New York Times. Both assembled data from major national polls. As we’ll see, despite Walker's sweeping claim, there are a number of examples that don’t support him. 1996: Kansas Sen. Bob Dole was the clear Republican front-runner and he won the GOP nomination. Roper data showed him well in the lead in nearly every early poll. And Silver’s measure found Dole had a 39-point edge over Texas Sen. Phil Gramm in polls taken from January to June of 1995. Dole lost the election to Democratic incumbent Bill Clinton. 2000: Both parties had clear early front-runners and both of those candidates became the nominees. Roper said George W. Bush led all other Republican contenders by September 1997 and Vice President Al Gore was well ahead of other Democratic contenders five months earlier. In Silver’s averaging -- for polling done from January to June 1999 -- Bush led Dole’s wife, North Carolina Sen. Elizabeth Dole, by 28 points while Gore led his nearest rival, New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, by 33 points. Bush edged Gore in the election. 2004: Gore was the clear front-runner in early polls, well ahead of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, but he decided nearly two years before the election not to run. Later, in early 2003, Kerry and Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman were tied in the polls, according to the Pew Research Center. Kerry eventually claimed the Democratic nomination. Kerry lost the election to Bush, who won a second term. 2008: The results in this election were mixed. As we noted, Hillary Clinton was the clear front-runner, initially polling well ahead of Kerry and North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, before losing the Democratic nomination to Obama. Later, she led Obama by 15 points in Silver's averaging of the poll results from January through June 2007. On the Republican side, as we noted, Guiliani and McCain polled well early. Roper said Giuliani, the former New York mayor, led McCain, the Arizona senator, in most polls in 2005, but only by a few points.. McCain lost the election to Obama. 2012: One of the candidates who polled well early won the GOP nomination. Roper said polls from 2009 revealed a tight race among former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, before Romney claimed the Republican nomination. Romney lost to Obama, who won a second term. So how does this all shake out? Five contenders -- Bob Dole in 1996, Bush and Gore in 2000, McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012 -- all scored high in the earliest polls and went on to win their party’s nomination. Our rating Walker said that in "the past four or five" presidential elections, "people who poll high at the beginning are not the people who end up being the nominees." Some who polled high since 1996 didn’t become the nominee, of course, but that isn’t enough evidence to back Walker’s flat statement. Indeed, five contenders who polled well early did, in fact, become the presidential nominee. For a statement that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-02913	The average fast food worker is 29, and most fast food workers "are on some form of public assistance."	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/04/bill-maher/bill-maher-average-fast-food-worker-29-most-are-pu/	HBO host and comedian Bill Maher recently blasted conservatives who oppose increasing the minimum wage, pointing to a new study that says the median income for fast food jobs is $8.69 an hour. That’s "barely enough to gas up the car you’re living in," he said, a quip met with ooo’s from the studio audience. He closed Real Time with Bill Maher on Oct. 25, 2013, with more factoids about the plight of workers employed in fast-food restaurants. "Consider the fact that most fast food workers, whose average age by the way now is 29, I'm not talking about kids, are on some form of public assistance, which is not surprising," Maher said. "When even working people can’t make enough to live, they take money from the government in the form of food stamps, school lunches, housing assistance, day care." Maher’s point being that by opposing an increase to the minimum wage, Republicans are forcing fast food workers to need some type of public assistance -- something Republicans also oppose. We won’t comment on the policy, but we did wonder about two specific factual claims: that the average fast-food worker is 29 and receives public aid. On the age point, 2012 Current Population Survey data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show the median age of front-line (the people who take orders or cook food) workers, including those at fast-food restaurants and excluding managers, is 29.2. A BLS spokesman said this would be the most reliable category to use. Maher’s researcher pointed to a 2012 Atlantic story that said the median age for these workers is more than 28, citing the BLS. (While Maher said average age and not median age, the median, or midpoint of a dataset, is actually a better representation of fast food workers as a whole, experts told us.) As for the claim about public assistance, that comes from the study Maher referenced on air. Released Oct. 15, it grabbed headlines with its bold conclusion: "More than half (52 percent) of the families of frontline fast food workers are enrolled in one or more public programs, compared to 25 percent of the workforce as a whole." The study was done by a team of six researchers from the University of California-Berkeley Labor Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Department of Urban and Regional Planning, and University of Massachusetts-boston Labor Resource Center. It was funded by a group that supports raising the minimum wage, Fast Food Forward. The report argues that low wages lead to frontline fast food workers seeking public benefits, in addition to a lack of health insurance and a limited amount of paid hours. Researchers used data for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program, the Earned Income Tax Credit, food stamps and temporary cash assistance -- the country’s biggest programs for low-income families. Ken Jacobs, chairman of the Berkeley Labor Center, said the figures in the report are conservative because they do not account for other income-support programs, such as child care, rental assistance and free or reduced school feeding programs that do not have readily available data. The report relied on 2007-11 survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, federal and state data for the four social programs, U.S. Census Bureau survey data, and employer-provided statistics for fast food workers. Workers counted for the report had to put in at least 27 weeks of work a year at at least 10 hours per week, which accounted for most workers. The researchers looked at benefits on the family level because some programs do not directly support the worker but their children (CHIP) or are paid at the family level (food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit). Jacobs said he was not expecting the percentage of fast food workers who earn a public benefit to be so high. But the report acknowledges that because these programs are meant to prop up low-income households, it would seem likely for low-wage industries to employ many of the beneficiaries. To that end, the restaurant and food services industry has the highest public program participation rate of any sector, the report found. "One argument could be, ‘This is how these programs are supposed to work,’ " Jacobs said. "Then you get into the question of what is better: Do we want to have large firms putting the labor costs onto the public, or should firms internalize those costs?" Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University School of Law who supports raising the minimum wage, said Maher’s point is basically correct. "He should have said a ‘majority’ of fast food workers (get some form of public assistance)," Secunda said. "That would have been more precise than ‘most.’ " Opponents of increasing the minimum wage did criticize the center for including CHIP and the Earned Income Tax Credit as categories, as those are used by some middle-class families. The tax credit was created in 1975 to provide low-wage and moderate-wage workers with an incentive to work. Michael Saltsman of the conservative Employment Policies Institute said the EITC was designed for these workers, and it boosts wages even for families earning close to $50,000 a year. He pointed out that the EITC represents the biggest chunk of program enrollment in the study. David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine who has written against minimum wage increases, said the fact that the research was funded by a group that supports raising the minimum wage does not necessarily undermine the analysis. But Neumark doesn’t equate raising the minimum wage with less dependence on public assistance. "We could have fewer people employed at higher wages, and some of those would use fewer public benefits," he said. "But those no longer employed would be more dependent on public assistance, and lose out on the opportunity to build skills and advance out of low-wage jobs." For its part, McDonald’s USA did not answer our questions about the average age of its restaurant workers or how many are on food assistance. A spokeswoman sent us a statement that said the chain employs hundreds of thousands of people, and "wages are based on local wage laws and are competitive to similar jobs in that market." Our ruling To make a point about the need to increase the minimum wage, Maher pointed to the plight of fast food workers, who, on average are 29 and receiving some form of public assistance. The median age, which economists say is a more accurate measure than the mean age, is 29, according to the best information we could find. As for receiving public assistance, Maher is referencing a university report funded by a group that supports increasing the minimum wage. The report concluded that 52 percent of the families of fast-food workers are receiving some type of public assistance. That’s not exactly how Maher put it -- he didn’t refer to families -- but some assistance programs specifically are meant to help families and children. Experts, meanwhile, said that while the methodology behind the report appears credible, there is some matter of opinion of what constitutes public assistance. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Maher	None	None	None	2013-11-04T12:02:26	2013-10-25	['None']
pomt-07395	Says "in Canada, the number of CT scan machines per 1,000 people is like one-tenth of what we have here in this country. That's why people have to wait."	/georgia/statements/2011/may/02/herman-cain/Oh-Canada-Cain-says-nation-behind-U-S-in-CT-machin/	Health care in the United States is costly for patients. But it might prove even more costly for elected officials next year. Both Republicans and Democrats hope to wield public concerns over health care as a potent weapon in the upcoming presidential and congressional elections, and some early candidates have already started swinging away. Former Godfather's Pizza CEO and conservative activist Herman Cain set up a presidential exploratory committee in January and last month attacked President Barack Obama’s health care initiative. He described the health care plan approved by Democrats in the House and Senate as socialized medicine that increases wait times for diagnostic tests. Cain, a cancer survivor, said longer waits could put cancer patients like him in danger by delaying discovery. Cain told The Root, a black perspectives online magazine: "In Canada, the number of CT scan machines per 1,000 people is like one-tenth of what we have here in this country. That's why people have to wait." That’s a huge difference, so PolitiFact decided we’d pass this statement through our own diagnostic equipment to see whether Cain’s prognosis is accurate. Computerized tomography scanners are X-ray machines that emit several beams from different angles simultaneously to produce detailed images of any part of the body. CT scanners are used to look for bleeding in the body, tumors and other internal damage. Unfortunately Cain would not tell us how he determined the number of CT scanners in Canada and the United States. In fact, neither he nor anyone from his staff would say anything to us beyond, "I don’t think we’re going to comment." But PolitiFact did find data quantifying the number of CT scans per capita. Canada had 12.7 CT scanners per 1 million residents in 2007, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States had 34.3 per million in 2007, the last year the organization had data for the United States. Canada has fewer CT scanners per capita than Greece and Portugal, two countries on the verge of bankruptcy, and it certainly has fewer than the United States, but not "like one-tenth." It’s more like one-third. Even though Cain’s numbers were not factually accurate, his general opinion that decreased diagnostic capacity puts patients at risk still deserves scrutiny. Canada spends less on medical treatment and therefore does have less capacity, said Edwin Meyer, founder of Buffalo-based Cross Border Access, a company that helps negotiate hospital billing rates for Canadians coming to the United States for medical services. Canada does a good job prioritizing who needs service right away and by doing so keeps costs for patients low, Meyer said. But a person with a non-life-threatening injury that keeps them out of work and causes constant pain may not receive diagnostic services and surgery right away. "People that are in need but stable can end up waiting a long time," Meyer said. While the United States has better capacity in general, many Americans, like the uninsured, do not have access to this capacity, said William Custer, a professor at the Institute of Health Administration at Georgia State University. The high number of CT scanners has also helped to drive up the cost of health care in the United States, but Custer said there is little evidence that this more costly service leads to better health outcomes. Ultimately, you can’t judge a national health care system on medical capacity alone, he said. "They make trade-offs and we make trade-offs," Custer said. "It’s a matter of taste." If Cain had said Canada has one-third the number of CT scanners of the United States, he would have been correct and then we could have examined whether this lack of capacity really does make Canada’s system inferior. That’s not what he said, though, and it doesn’t take a 3-D X-ray imager to know that one-tenth is different than one-third. Prognosis: False.

pomt-00649	"We had an agreement that the president could have signed that would have kept 10,000 troops" in Iraq.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/18/jeb-bush/obama-refused-sign-plan-place-leave-10000-troops-i/	During a tough campaign week focused on the Iraq War, former Gov. Jeb Bush shifted blame for problems there to President Barack Obama, saying that Obama’s actions helped hand the country over to Islamic State. A University of Nevada student attending a town hall-style meeting in Reno asked Bush why he was placing the burden on Obama, at one point telling Bush, "Your brother created ISIS." Bush countered that the Obama administration hadn’t followed through on proper planning. "We had an agreement that the president could have signed that would have kept 10,000 troops, less than we have in Korea, that could have created the stability that would have allowed for Iraq to progress," Bush said. (Watch video of the exchange above.) The claim came in the middle of a rough few days for Bush, who was being criticized for his changing answers on whether he would have invaded Iraq. We wondered if it was true that Obama could have signed a deal to leave 10,000 U.S. troops in the country after the war’s end. The exit When Obama took office in January 2009, he inherited a plan that President George W. Bush forged in 2008 with then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. That Status of Forces Agreement called for the withdrawal of all American troops by the end of 2011. It was widely assumed a new plan would be negotiated after the 2008 version expired in 2011. There were no stipulations about a specific number of American military personnel to be left behind. Obama ran on the campaign pledge of bringing a responsible end to the Iraq War, and announced shortly after taking office that combat operations would end in 2010. A high of 168,000 U.S. service members were in the country after the 2007 surge, drawing down to about 43,000 after combat troops left in 2010. He said in October 2011 almost all troops would be home by Christmas. About 200 Marines would stay to train the Iraqi army and act as security for diplomatic personnel. In short, he kept the 2011 timeline Bush and al-Maliki had chosen. When it came time to renegotiate a new agreement, there was little consensus on whether a residual force should stay in the country. Military leaders in Baghdad and the Pentagon pushed for as many as 24,000, but the White House rejected that amount. (For the record, U.S. forces in South Korea number more than 28,500.) Obama reportedly did consider leaving up to 10,000 troops in strategic locations after the exit, but that plan faced opposition both in the United States and in Iraq. Obama ruled out a force that size during an August 2011 conference call. Negotiations led to the idea of a smaller, continuous force of 3,500 troops, with up to 1,500 more rotating in and out, and about a half-dozen F-16’s. But this plan ran into several roadblocks, including the insistence by Washington that those troops be immune to Iraqi -- although not American -- prosecution should they commit a crime. Austin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor, said al-Maliki allegedly supported the residual force and may have signed a new plan, but the Iraqi parliament would not. Facing the prospect of a weak agreement that didn’t protect remaining troops the way the United States wanted, when neither Baghdad nor Washington wanted to leave them there, negotiations broke down. No new agreement was reached, and no residual force was formed. There has been plenty of debate whether it was Washington or Baghdad that was more intractable on a new agreement. The aftermath So a plan to leave 10,000 troops didn’t exist when Obama took office and was never fully realized by his administration. But would an agreement to leave American troops have stabilized the nation the way Jeb Bush claimed? We were curious what experts would say about this point. (Bush’s campaign didn’t return our requests for comment.) "I think most observers would agree that a residual U.S. force would have prevented the Islamic State from achieving as much as it has in Iraq," Long said. "But it is also unlikely that a residual force would have completely stabilized Iraq, as the sources of instability are fundamentally political." Remember that the country was considered relatively stable in 2011; ISIS elements existed prior to that, but largely formed into the force it is today after American troops left -- and mostly in Syria at first. Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, said a recent Iraqi delegation to the institute agreed the terms of the planned renewal could not have passed parliament. "They said that the Iraqi government was too weak, and unwilling to go against the wishes of those Iraqis who wanted the Americans to leave," Preble said. Our ruling Bush said, "We had an agreement that the president could have signed that would have kept 10,000 troops, less than we have in Korea, that could have created the stability that would have allowed for Iraq to progress." Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from George W. Bush and followed it, but there was no agreement to leave a large force behind. The Obama White House considered 10,000 troops for a short time but ruled it out, suggesting a much smaller force. Negotiations with Iraq broke down, however, and there was no agreement that met conditions Washington wanted. Experts told us Bush parsed his words carefully enough to have a point that a residual force would have likely helped Iraq fend off ISIS. But there was no consensus to leave 10,000 troops in place. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-05-18T11:47:50	2015-05-13	['Iraq']
pomt-10954	On supporting Mitch McConnell as U.S. Senate majority leader.	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/24/kevin-nicholson/does-gop-us-senate-candidate-kevin-nicholson-suppo/	Kevin Nicholson, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, frequently casts himself as an outsider who wouldn’t be part of the political class in Washington, D.C. That stance has helped the first-time candidate draw endorsements from national conservative organizations. Now, you can’t get much more insider than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican who, despite his long tenure, so many Republicans seem to not to like. So, a key question for voters in the Aug. 14, 2018 GOP primary in Wisconsin is: Where does Nicholson stand on keeping McConnell as the majority leader? As it turns out, the answer is: For, against and somewhere in between. To address the question, we turn to our Flip-O-Meter, which rates a person’s consistency on an issue. Nicholson’s positions Early in the campaign, Nicholson was okay with McConnell. He told Politico in September 2017: "I have no issues voting for Mitch McConnell." But by October 2017, Nicholson favored replacing him. A Nicholson campaign spokesman told the Associated Press the original Nicholson comment had come before the Senate failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, saying: "Kevin has made it clear he’s prepared to support new leadership because of the Senate’s failure to pass a conservative agenda." The same comment about supporting new leadership was reported by the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison. A similar report appeared the same month in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The newspaper stated that Nicholson opposes McConnell, with the campaign spokesman reiterating: "Kevin has made it clear he’s prepared to support new leadership because of the Senate’s failure to pass a conservative agenda." Also that month, there were two key endorsements of Nicholson, both of which cited McConnell. The pro-Donald Trump Great America PAC, with ties to former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, endorsed Nicholson. People close to Bannon said Nicholson, when meeting with Bannon, made it clear he would oppose McConnell as Senate majority leader, the Journal Sentinel reported. See all of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. FreedomWorks for America, a super PAC affiliated with a group that helped start the tea party movement, also endorsed Nicholson, saying Nicholson "has indicated that he would oppose Mitch McConnell’s failed leadership." Nicholson’s shift was noted in November 2017 in a Politico article that carried the headline, "Republicans flee from McConnell in 2018 primaries." The article pointed out that Nicholson "originally said he would support McConnell, but has since won Bannon's endorsement and now supports ‘new leadership’ for Senate Republicans." But Nicholson would shift again. Some eight months later, on July 16, 2018, Nicholson moved to somewhere between support and opposition. This was the exchange when Nicholson was interviewed by major Trump supporter and former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who was filling in for conservative Milwaukee radio talk show host Mark Belling: Clarke: Will you vote -- when the new leadership is chosen in the next Congress — will you support Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader? Nicholson: I mean, that's a hypothetical; it's hard to predict, right? Like, at the end of the day, I know that who's ever in leadership -- and I'm saying this, like, transparently and honestly as I can -- if they're putting forth good ideas, I'm going to be right there with them, kicking down doors to make it happen. At the end of the day, though, if what they’re doing is foisting upon us all 2,000-plus-page omnibus bills that land on the desks of U.S. senators 48 hours before they have to be passed, with no ability to be amended, I’m going to be the first guy pushing back. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Asked about the varying statements, Nicholson campaign spokeswoman Ronica Cleary sent us an email that didn’t address Nicholson’s position on McConnell, saying in part: "Kevin has been consistent in saying that institutions should always be open to changing leaders when they aren’t functioning properly, and he believes that the entire Senate should be subject to term limits -- including leadership. This is why he’s limited himself to two terms. Ultimately, as he said on the radio this week, he is not going to answer hypotheticals." Our rating Nicholson has gone from supporting McConnell as majority leader, to saying he wanted new leadership to now somewhere in between, saying the question is a hypothetical. Had we rated Nicholson’s first shift, he might have earned a Full Flop. But at this point, for being somewhere between support and opposition on McConnell, that’s a partial change in position. We give Nicholson a Half Flip. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Kevin Nicholson	None	None	None	2018-07-24T06:00:00	2018-07-16	['Mitch_McConnell', 'United_States']
pomt-11023	Says Sen. Bill Nelson "voted for higher taxes" 349 times.	/florida/statements/2018/jul/05/rick-scott/did-sen-bill-nelson-vote-higher-taxes-349-no/	For years, Republicans have criticized Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for voting to raise taxes again and again. Nelson's opponent in the 2012 U.S. Senate race, Connie Mack, claimed Nelson raised taxes 150 times. That number grew to 272 before the November 2012 election. Now, Nelson’s current competitor, Gov. Rick Scott, is upping the ante in a new television ad. "Forty years later, a lot of things have changed, but Bill Nelson is still in Washington," the narrator says. "Still collecting a paycheck. Besides reading speeches, what’s Nelson done all those years. 349 times he’s voted for higher taxes." Scott’s evidence included about 349 votes Nelson cast in the Senate starting in 2001, as well as votes he took in the U.S. House of Representatives (1979-90). With that, we wanted to see if it was true. We have rated similar claims that Nelson voted to raise taxes False because the total was bolstered by non-binding resolutions, which cannot change the tax law, and double counted multiple votes on a single piece of legislation. Although the list is not exactly the same, we found that Scott’s team uses the same tallying tricks implemented in the past, which inflates the number of times Nelson voted for higher taxes. Scott’s list uses misleading math In 2012, we fact-checked Mack’s claim that Nelson voted to raise taxes 150 times and ruled that claim False. Two months later, we fact-checked Mack again. This time he claimed that Nelson voted for higher taxes 272 times and that also rated False. As we concluded in those checks, Mack’s list was boosted by including budget resolutions and counted multiple votes on the same piece of legislation. Scott’s 349-time claim does the same thing. More than half of votes on his list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set nonbinding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. Budget resolutions do not change tax law. Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction, offered another important distinction. "Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is also not voting for a tax increase," Gordon told us. Scott’s tally makes the additional mistake of counting multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Scott’s list includes nine votes Nelson took on a 2008 budget resolution. Again, those votes do not alter how much in taxes anyone pays. Overall, we found that nearly half of all the votes Scott counted were from non-binding resolutions. The mathematical gymnastics continues in other parts of Scott’s list. Scott’s tally includes multiple votes on the other pieces of legislation. It’s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments. For example, in 2017, Scott counted 19 of Nelson’s votes against H.R. 1 — the GOP tax bill. By voting against the bill, Scott’s office argues Nelson voted for higher taxes. In reality, Nelson’s votes would have kept the status quo. And while the tax bill that passed Congress and was signed into law cuts taxes for most Americans, not every American is guaranteed a tax cut. Scott’s "claim is predicated on the idea that tax cuts are ‘free,’" Joe Rosenberg, a research associate for the Tax Policy Center, said. "The claim could equivalently be phrased as ‘Nelson voted to reduce the federal deficit 349 times.’" Besides tallying tricks, Scott’s statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Nelson voted for President Ronald Reagan’s major tax cut package in 1981 and Nelson also voted to extend President George W. Bush-era tax cuts in 2006 and 2010. Nelson also supported the 2009 stimulus package, which included more than $200 billion in tax cuts. "The statement you are fact checking is that Nelson VOTED in favor of higher taxes 349 times," said campaign spokeswoman Kerri Wyland. "He did. Every member of Congress should be held accountable for every single vote they take – that is part of their job and it is what American families expect. Every vote cited was an opportunity for Bill Nelson to make his position on taxes clear, and every time he voted in favor of higher taxes." Our ruling Scott said Nelson "voted for higher taxes" 349 times. Just like Republicans in the past, Scott’s list overstates the number of times Nelson voted for higher taxes by including nonbinding budget resolutions, which accounted for almost half of the 349 votes on the list. Scott also counts multiple votes on the same piece of legislation, which further inflates the number. And as we’ve concluded in previous checks, the list neglects that Nelson has, on occasion, voted for lower taxes. We rate this claim False.

A self-described citizen activist from Fayette County, Angela Bean, has been one of the opposition leaders, and she has taken the anti-Common Core message on the road to various school and community meetings. In a newspaper article this month, Bean -- who is also an executive board member of the Fayette County Republican Party -- identifies another reason for hating Common Core: There are concerns about the longitudinal data system that goes along with Common Core, Bean told The Newnan Times-Herald. The system is designed to collect up to 400 data points on each child, which can include personally identifiable data. Does Common Core allow for this amount of extensive data collection? And, if so, what data is being collected? We checked with the initiative’s founders for more information. Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit education groups and state education departments, and they are designed to better prepare students for college and careers, and ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts in the same grades. The Obama administration has used its education funding grant process to encourage states to adhere to the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Georgia’s state Board of Education adopted Common Core performance standards on July 8, 2010. And the standards rolled out in school districts during the 2012-2013 school year, said Dorie Turner Nolt, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Education. We checked with the Council of Chief State School Officers, a national organization of public officials who head state education departments, and one of the founders of the Common Core standards, about Bean’s data collection claim. Organization officials said there are no data collection requirements with Common Core, and they address the issue on its website. "States are still responsible as they were previously to report their accountability (on tests and other student assessments), but Common Core doesn’t add any new data reporting, said Margaret Millar, the CCSSO’s director of membership services. Kathleen Porter-Magee, an education expert at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute who has studied Common Core, agreed that there are no requirements for any sort of data collection or data mining. "If a state chooses to collect achievement data, that is a decision the state chooses to make," she said. "But is is not lumped in with Common Core." So, if Common Core doesn’t have a data collection component, or require data collection, has Georgia decided to collect data independently? Turner Nolt, with the Georgia Education Department, initially responded to Bean’s statements in another article, also printed in The Newnan Times-Herald. In that response, Turner Nolt refutes the claims that Georgia is participating in a data collection system, known as inBloom. That system is one of several education data collection systems, but it is not aligned with Common Core, state and and national experts maintain. (Some individual Georgia school districts are participating in inBloom. We reached out to company officials for specifics but did not receive a response by press time) The state Education Department does collect student data annually and makes that data available in a user-friendly format for teachers and other school officials in its Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS) Grant Program. The system is available for access by every public school district in the state. There are currently more than 65,000 teachers using the system. The system collects data points in about 10 categories, Robert Swiggum, the state department’s chief information officer, said in an email to us about the SLDS data program. The categories include: a student’s name, grade, gender, ethnicity, birth date, attendance, enrollment history, test scores, courses taken and grade received, and any subgroup (example: English language learner, retained, economically disadvantaged). Each of the categories has dozens of data points that can vary depending on how many tests each student takes, those test scores, the number of courses taken and the length of time a student has been in school. Turner Nolt said the data in the state’s SLDS system has been collected for years, but that the information is now computerized. The systems does collect personally identifiable data, as Bean claimed, but the information is not shared beyond the student’s teachers and school administrators, Turner Nolt said. To sum up, Bean claimed a data system companion of Common Core collects up to 400 data points on each child, which can include personally identifiable data. Bean’s claim incorrectly intertwines Common Core and a data collection system. Our research found that Common Core does not include a data collection component. Georgia’s Education Department does collect student data as part of a separate annual collection cycle, then provides the information in a digital format for teachers and school officials to use. Bean’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts about the separation of Common Core and data collection. We rated her claim Mostly False.

pomt-10449	Every family health insurance policy has "a $900 hidden tax" to subsidize health care costs of the uninsured.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/02/hillary-clinton/a-reasonable-estimate-for-uninsured-costs/	“You know you’re going to bankrupt the country with health care, right?” talk show host Bill O’Reilly began as an introduction to talk with Sen. Hillary Clinton about her health care plan. “Oh, no, I’m not,” said Clinton, who appeared on the The O’Reilly Factor on April 30, 2008. Clinton boiled her plan down to this: “Everybody who has health insurance who’s happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- it’s not government-run, it’s not a new bureaucracy. It’s the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And we’re going to open it up to every American, because I think it’s about time...” “But you’re going to subsidize it,” O’Reilly interjected. “Well, we are,” Clinton said. “But here’s why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesn’t have health insurance...” “...goes to the emergency room...you’ve got to pick it up,” O’Reilly said, finishing her sentence. The $900 figure is key to Clinton’s plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people. Think of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the store’s loss. “That’s kind of what’s going on with healthcare,” Sheils said. Hospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people don’t pay, “it’s kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread,” he said. The cost is shifted onto those with private insurance. Sheils said Clinton’s claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is “in the ballpark.” Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year. Hillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan. “One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers,” according to her plan. “Rather than reducing prices, the system raises families’ costs. “And, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a “hidden tax”: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured.” It cites a report from Families USA called “Paying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured.” The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University. Thorpe says Clinton’s figure actually is low. According to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said. “The only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than it’s worth,” Thorpe said. “It is their only means to stay financially solvent.” In 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress. O’Reilly didn’t contest Clinton’s numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other people’s health care. “I mean, I don’t want to be paying for someone who’s taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day,” O’Reilly said. “But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes,” Clinton said. “Or some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis." “I don’t mind doing it,” O’Reilly said. Clinton’s point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that she’s at least close. We rate her statement True.

pomt-13490	"Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika)."	/florida/statements/2016/sep/08/naral-pro-choice/naral-misleads-attack-marco-rubio-about-zika-fundi/	As the number of Floridians infected with the Zika virus continues to escalate, political groups and and candidates have lobbed attacks in the U.S. Senate battle in Florida. NARAL Pro-Choice America, a liberal organization that supports abortion rights, attacked Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s record on Zika in an ad airing on TV in Orlando and West Palm Beach and online. NARAL endorsed Rubio’s opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter. "The Zika virus is here. It’s dangerous to pregnant women. And it has no cure. But Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency," states the narrator while text states that Rubio "voted against contraception and family planning." The narrator then continues: "And Marco Rubio continues to be against a woman's right to choose an abortion even if they are infected with the Zika virus." The ad shows video of someone clad in protective gear spraying for mosquitoes and anxious looking women including one who is pregnant. The ad began airing as Congress returned from recess to debate Zika funding again. On Sept. 6, a Senate bill failed to receive the necessary votes to move forward. We will zero in on Rubio’s votes related to Zika. Rubio’s voting record and public statements about Zika show that he has repeatedly shown support for Zika funding requests, including by President Barack Obama. The ad is referring to Rubio’s votes in favor of Zika legislation that would have cut funding to one organization in Puerto Rico, an affiliate of Planned Parenthood. Zika bills In February, Obama requested $1.9 billion for vaccine research, testing and mosquito control related to Zika. Rubio announced his support for Obama’s request at a press conference in Miami April 8. A timeline from Rubio’s office states he was the first congressional Republican to announce his support. Since that time, Rubio has repeatedly called on his colleagues in floor speeches, media outlets and press conferences to pass a bill. On May 12, Rubio and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla, announced they would introduce legislation to provide the full $1.9 billion request. "There's no reason every proposal to address Zika cannot be bipartisan and earn broad support, and I'm hopeful we can reach a final outcome that fully addresses the problem," Rubio said at the time. On May 17, Rubio voted with the majority, 68-29, for a motion on an amendment by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to provide $1.1 billion to combat Zika. Rubio reluctantly voted for the compromise measure while still calling for Obama’s full funding request. Two days later, the Senate passed the full bill 89-8 with Rubio voting with the majority. The bill called for spending $1.1 billion to prevent, prepare and respond to the Zika virus domestically and internationally including on the development of a vaccine. House and Senate negotiators then got together in a conference committee. Republicans added a clause to block any money for Profamilias, the Puerto Rican branch of Planned Parenthood. The services of that family planning agency are relevant here because Zika can be transmitted through sex, and condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika. Profamilias served 8,000 people in 2015. Democrats saw that as a "poison pill" intended to doom the bill, while Republicans said Democrats were refusing to compromise. While the bill would have blocked funding for Profamilias, it would not have blocked funding for Puerto Rico entirely. The ad omits that the bill provided funds that would potentially help clinics and hospitals in nearly every municipality on the island. Puerto Rico has 20 community health centers operating at 84 sites. Profamilias has seven clinics on the island, and in each area there is another type of facility that would have been eligible for Zika funding. The ad cites two Rubio votes in June on the appropriations bill that included the $1.1 billion for Zika. The first vote, on June 14, was a motion to proceed and passed 94-3. So NARAL is attacking Rubio for voting in favor of something that was supported by virtually every senator of both parties. The second vote was on June 28 when the Senate voted 52-48 to bring up the Zika measure. It failed to reach the 60-vote threshold, so the underlying bill didn’t reach an up or down vote. Rubio voted for the measure. "Shame on Washington for failing to pass Zika funding," Rubio said after the bill died. "We’ve been on top of this issue for five months, and it’s a failure of both parties in this town, including the president of the United States, that it’s taken this long to even get to this point." One final note about the ad’s attack on Rubio for opposing abortion, including for women with Zika. Rubio told Politico in August: "I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life." Our ruling NARAL’s TV ad said, "Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika)." The text on the screen stated that Rubio "voted against contraception and family planning." The ad creates a misleading impression that Rubio’s votes show he is indifferent to funding clinics to combat Zika. Actually, he has repeatedly supported Zika funding requests, including $1.9 billion sought by Obama. The ad cherry-picks votes by zeroing in on Rubio’s votes on measures that would have blocked funding to the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico. The ad doesn’t explain that despite that block, the bill still could have provided money to fight Zika both in Puerto Rico and the United States. Nothing passed due to the gridlock over that issue. As for the statement about Rubio’s voting record, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aa91b4ec-4be7-4979-a670-89978e01dab9	None	NARAL Pro-Choice America	None	None	None	2016-09-08T11:47:20	2016-09-06	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-00913	Six of the nation’s 10 wealthiest counties, "according to median income, are in and around the Washington, D.C. area."	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/02/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-most-10-richest-counties-are-aro/	Speaking at an event to mark Ronald Reagan’s birthday, Gov. Scott Walker complained about, of all things, income inequality. It's not like the Wisconsin Republican was about to Occupy anything. He was making a larger, Reagan-like argument -- that there is too much power concentrated in Washington, D.C. During his remarks, given Feb. 6, 2015 at the late president’s alma mater, Eureka College in Eureka, Ill., Walker said: "In fact, if you have any doubt, if you looked last year, the numbers that we saw put out showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America -- six of the top 10 wealthiest communities in America, by county, according to median income -- are in and around the Washington, D.C., area," Walker said. "That tell you anything about where we're growing the economy in this nation?" The governor made the same six-in-10 claim a week earlier, in another speech -- in Washington. And again in remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington. Let's see if it's true. The numbers We’ll note at the top that Walker was careful to make his claim about counties and median income. Nothing wrong with that. The median divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the households falling below the median income and one-half above the median. But it's worth noting that you'd get a different picture if you picked variables such as cities or average income. For median household income, the latest U.S. Census Bureau figures for counties are estimates for 2013. The figures were released in December 2014. As Walker stated, six of the top 10 counties are in Washington suburbs, either in Virginia or Maryland. County Name Median Household Income Estimate for 2013 Loudoun County, VA $117,680 Falls Church city, VA $117,452 Los Alamos County, NM $110,930 Fairfax County, VA $110,658 Howard County, MD $108,503 Hunterdon County, NJ $107,203 Douglas County, CO $105,192 Arlington County, VA $101,533 Morris County, NJ $99,950 Montgomery County, MD $97,873 (Technically, Falls Church is an "independent city" but is treated as a county by the Census Bureau.) As we noted, the top 10 look much different if you consider average income. That's because super-rich residents can skew the data much higher. Indeed, in July 2014, Money published a list, based on IRS figures from individual tax returns, for the 2012 tax year. No suburban county around D.C. made the top 10. The highest average income was $296,778 in Teton County, Wyo. Three of the top 10 counties were in Texas. Salim Furth, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, told us the D.C. area ranks high in median income because of its "high-paying jobs in and around government, and high real estate prices which nudge out retirees and people with low incomes." David Egan-Robertson, a demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Applied Population Laboratory, said many federal jobs, as well as private-sector positions in the D.C. region under federal contract, require high levels of expertise. And "to attract and retain this high level of expertise requires higher levels of compensation." One footnote: In early 2013, our colleagues rated two claims similar to Walker's. Also made by Republican politicians, those claims relied on data slightly older than what Walker cited. Both U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin had said seven of the nation's 10 richest counties were in suburban Washington. PolitiFact Ohio and PolitiFact National, respectively, rated both claims True. Our rating Walker said six of the 10 wealthiest counties, "according to median income, are in and around the Washington, D.C. area." The latest U.S. census estimates for median household income, for 2013, bear that out. Six of the top 10 counties were in D.C. suburbs in Maryland or Virginia. We rate Walker's statement True.

pomt-05824	"Shelby County donated – I’m sorry, gave – 44 schools to the city of Memphis."	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/19/chris-thomas/suburban-advocates-say-shelby-county-gave-memphis-/	During a Shelby County Commission discussion over the possibility of transferring school facilities to suburban municipalities, Chris Thomas made a point that has become almost a suburban mantra. In that meeting and another held on Feb. 10, Thomas and suburban colleagues Wyatt Bunker and Terry Roland hammered home the contention that Shelby County always "gave" school facilities to Memphis, free of charge, when the city took areas through annexations. Following that precedent, they argue, the county should give buildings to suburban cities wanting to split from the controversial new unified school district and form municipal districts. Memphis City Councilman Shea Flinn, during the Feb. 10 deliberations, vented his frustrations on his Twitter feed: "Dear comm Bunker that 44 school system (sic) given to Memphis is False. It was done by agreement an (sic) other consideration was given. Damn." And: "My head might explode with the number of times that bull (expletive) is going to come up." So who is right here, on an issue of utmost importance as Shelby County’s system of public schools goes through an historic transition? At least since 1965, have annexations resulted in Shelby County just giving school buildings to Memphis’s special school district, Memphis City Schools? We found a complicated set of legal and historical circumstances, and, as with other issues associated with the impending transfer of Memphis’s public schools to the county, stances that have reversed over time, depending on residency. Memphis stakeholders who once argued buildings must be given over without consideration now want the suburbs to pay up, while suburban interests who once argued a city should compensate the county now say the county should give buildings to suburban towns free and clear. Thomas and other advocates for the suburban municipalities cite feasibility studies from suburban school consultants Southern Educational Strategies. The studies say: "Since the 1960’s, at least 44 of these facilities, plus the furniture, fixtures, and equipment held in trust for the students were transferred by Shelby County Schools to the special school district at no direct cost to the Memphis City Schools." One figure in the study shows that for each year since 1965 exactly $0.00 flowed to Shelby County in exchange for the schools. Thomas’s statement is worth quoting in full, because it captures the prevailing suburban view: "I think it’s funny over the past many years that Shelby County donated – I’m sorry, gave – 44 schools to the city of Memphis . . . when they annexed areas. And now all of a sudden when a municipality, when a city in the county wants to educate those children, we are going to say we are going to charge you but we were giving them to Memphis? Personally I think that stinks. I think it’s unfair." Flinn cites, among others, blog posts from Smart City Memphis, the consultant firm run by Tom Jones, a close aide to county mayors from the late 1970s until the early 2000s. "It’s how you understand a contract — consideration is more than just cash," Flinn said. Smart City’s blog has taken serious issue with those studies, and in particular targeted former suburban Shelby County Schools (SCS) superintendent Jim Mitchell. A post titled "Town Districts School Building Fiction" quotes Mitchell at a suburban forum saying, "That is not what’s been done in this county for 45 years." Meaning, the county had not gotten payment from Memphis for schools during annexations. Jones wrote: "Let’s say it simply: he is wrong." He added: "There have been torturous negotiations to give county government financial consideration . . . using waivers of ADA funding requirements, offsetting financial credits, or through joint design of schools by city and county school district." In other words, although there was not a direct cost, Memphis-partisans point out that the county was indirectly compensated in other ways, such as agreements to allow the county to forego what is commonly referred to as the Average Daily Attendance (ADA) funding requirement. ADA requirements mean that for every $1 the county gives for capital improvements to the suburban system, it has had to give a corresponding share to Memphis City Schools (MCS) based on the city’s much-larger student population. "When I’ve heard the county commissioners, it’s like, ‘Oh, they annexed and they got the schools la dee da,’ " Flinn said. "But that’s not an accurate rendition. It was a negotiated transaction, with give and take on both sides." Where the feasibility studies do reference negotiated agreements between the city and county over the schools, to waive ADA requirements, they do so in the form of footnotes. Ernest Kelly, the attorney at Evans, Petree who litigated for MCS for decades, said those footnotes came out of years-long legal wrangling. Those footnotes show that Memphis ultimately agreed to allow Shelby County a $12 million waiver on ADA funds as "credit" for Memphis taking schools in annexations from the late 60s and early 70s. To Memphis at the time, $12 million spent on suburban school capital improvements meant, because of the then $5.7-to-$1 ADA split, it stood to see $68.4 million flow into its coffers from county government. That $68.4 million equates to $229 million in purchasing power in the 2010 economy, and the website MeasuringWorth.com calculates that $68.4 million in projects in the 1978 economy equates to $433 million in projects in the 2010 economy. For the suburban school system, the $12 million credit — equivalent to $76 million in projects today — allowed for construction or renovation of some of the very buildings municipalities want to receive for free. A Jan. 27, 1978, article from longtime Commercial Appeal education reporter Jimmie Covington, now working to help Collierville start a municipal system, points out: "For several years, the county has not had to share school construction funds with the city because of credits received from the city system for county schools which were annexed. However, about $4 million in county school building projects approved for this year have about exhausted the credits." In an April 28, 1978, article, Covington wrote that "the city system has paid the county for annexed schools by waiving" the ADA share. Kelly does emphasize that MCS felt strongly it could have and should have received buildings without any considerations, based on an 1898 case, Prescott vs. the Town of Lennox. While cautioning that the legal niceties related to an annexation differ from the current circumstances, Kelly explained that Lennox determined facilities are a public trust and therefore "the buildings ought to follow the kids." "We were all suited up and ready to go to Chancery Court," Kelly said Thursday, but there were other variables, some having nothing to do with schools – like the city’s desire to push the burden of costs related to the city’s public hospital over to the county. Cut a deal giving the county something for the annexed schools, MCS was told, so we can save money on the hospital issue. "So the legal argument didn’t get resolved on one side or the other," Kelly said. "We had a compromise that . . . eliminated the risk of paying money, which would have been painful and in our view unjust. From the county’s point of view, they got something." Two of the planners most involved in more recent transfers – longtime and recently-retired SCS chief of operations Richard Holden and former MCS director of planning Louise Mercuro — each said there were agreements in which MCS again agreed to allow the county to waive ADA requirements. "Most of them had to do with schools that would eventually become part of Memphis City Schools," Holden said. For some buildings, MCS and SCS cooperated with joint funding, planning and designing. "It was never a straight policy that they give the schools, ever," Mercuro said. "The county always got something out of it, one way or the other." Holden, now a key member of the county’s schools merger transition commission, said that after SCS became an elected board, in 1998, there was more of a push from the suburbs to get fair value from MCS for annexed schools. "In the latter years Shelby County Schools board members thought there should be some compensation," Holden said. Longtime SCS board chairman David Pickler agreed with that assessment. According to a Feb. 12, 2003 article, one of the initial proposals for financing what became Arlington High School involved crediting the county for $37 million for annexed schools. Both Memphis and suburban school boards "agreed to the proposal in concept" but it did not come to fruition. Arlington High School was eventually financed with bonds paid for by a tax levy on non-Memphis residents only. Our ruling So did Shelby County in fact "give" 44 school buildings to Memphis City Schools? As the consultants note, exactly $0.00 in real dollars has exchanged hands for the buildings MCS took over during annexations. But there were serious past negotiations where the county received considerations of real value, even if it never got a check. Some of the suburban municipalities, in fact, benefitted from new schools or renovations made possible by Memphis agreeing to "credit" the county for some value of schools it took over. Because of that, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Chris Thomas	None	None	None	2012-02-19T09:00:00	2012-02-06	['Memphis,_Tennessee']
pomt-07607	"There is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/22/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-lexposure-low-levels-radiation-ar/	As news broke last week that Japan's nuclear disaster may result in low levels of radiation wafting all the way to the U.S., political pundit Ann Coulter wrote a column arguing that too much is made of exposure to low levels of radiation. In an appearance on Fox's O'Reilly Factor on March 17, Coulter argued some exposure to radiation may actually be good for you. "There is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer," Coulter said. Before you go sticking your head in the X-ray machine, a little perspective is in order here. While there are scientists who subscribe to the theory that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects -- it's called hormesis -- it is still an outside-the-mainstream opinion. "There is not a shred of evidence that radiation is good for you," said Eric Hall, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University in New York City. As for hormesis, Hall said, "No one in the mainstream believes it." Said Fred Mettler, a radiation expert at the University of New Mexico: "Ms. Coulter -- who I find very enjoyable -- might be better sticking to political opinions." Mettler, the U.S. representative for the United Nations committee on the health effects of radiation, pointed us to a chapter on hormesis from his book, Medical Effects of Ionizing Radiation. In the book, Mettler calls hormesis "a concept that is controversial at best." "Early studies in the United States seemed to suggest a hormetic effect, or at least there were areas of higher radiation background that had lower cancer incidence," Mettler wrote. In particular, Mettler cited the work of T. D. Luckey, professor emeritus at the University of Missouri, Columbia, School of Medicine, who argued in multiple studies that evidence shows "a significant decrease in cancer mortality rates of lightly exposed humans." Mettler cautioned not to read too much into such studies, however. "In addition to variability in populations, statistical uncertainties, potential bias factors, and chance, on one hand there will be instances in which there was less effect than predicted," he wrote. "This is all understandable without invoking a unifying hypothesis of hormesis." Owen Hoffman, a radiation-risk expert at Senes Oak Ridge Inc., a center for risk analysis, said that studies show low levels of radiation might eliminate some cancer but initiate others. "Certainly radiation kills cells and can stimulate immune responses," Hoffman said. "Thus it is possible for precursors of cancers, which are produced in the absence of above-background radiation exposure, might be eliminated through the processes of cell killing and immune response activation. But radiation exposures, even at background levels, can also initiate, promote new cancers and accelerate the manifestation of cancers that would occur in later life in the absence of exposure." Hoffman also pointed to the work of Dr. Charles Land of the National Cancer Institute, who "has shown in several of his recent publications that there is considerable uncertainty in the estimation of radiation risk. In his work, he does not give much credibility to the possibility that radiation induces a protective or beneficial effect. On the other hand, he concludes that even if some credibility could be given to the possibility of a threshold or beneficial effect of radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates, the biological and epidemiological evidence that new cancers may be initiated or promoted by radiation exposure cannot be completely ruled out." "At present," Hoffman said, "carefully conducted epidemiological evidence does not support the presence of such beneficial effects in human populations that have been carefully monitored and followed up over time." In her blog post, Coulter cited the work of Bernard L. Cohen, a physics professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who "compared radon exposure and lung cancer rates in 1,729 counties covering 90 percent of the U.S. population. His study in the 1990s found far fewer cases of lung cancer in those counties with the highest amounts of radon -- a correlation that could not be explained by smoking rates." We e-mailed Cohen and asked him about Coulter's statement. "Word for word, what she says is correct," Cohen responded. "It could go further and say that no other confounding factors (like socioeconomics, geography, etc., 500 were explored) can explain the results. However, my study was designed to test the assumption that the danger of radiation is simply proportional to the radiation dose, which is the only evidence that low-level radiation may be harmful. My conclusion was that that assumption is false. "Whether low-level radiation is protective against cancer, a theory called hormesis, is debated in the scientific community," Cohen said. "There is evidence on both sides." So where does this leave us? We are not rating whether hormesis -- or as Coulter put it, the theory that exposure to low levels of radiation is actually good for you and reduces cases of cancer -- is correct. Reputable scientists disagree about that. We're rating whether Coulter was correct in saying there is "a growing body of evidence" that radiation in excess of approved exposure levels may be beneficial. There is a small but growing body of research to back up those claims. But the fact is that the mainstream of the scientific community has not embraced the theory. They point to limitations of those studies and argue the research falls well short of scientific evidence. Coulter failed to present this counter-weight, the opinion shared by the majority in the scientific community, which doesn't buy into -- and in many cases outright rejects -- the idea that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects and reduce the risk of cancer. And so we rate Coulter's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04227	Says Gov. Scott Walker has "led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn’t implement a (health-care) exchange, Obamacare doesn’t happen here."	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/25/jon-erpenbach/erpenbach-says-walker-misled-federal-health-care-l/	Republican Mitt Romney’s defeat in the November elections, coupled with the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2012 ruling, put an end to debate about whether President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law would take effect. Or did it? Gov. Scott Walker, a vocal critic of the law, seemed to bow to legal and political realities on Nov. 16, 2012, when he announced his administration was "complying with the law, whether we like it or not." The statement was part of an announcement that he would not create a state-run insurance marketplace to put the law into effect. Rather, Walker told reporters, he would let the federal government run it, another of the options under the law. Democrats and some prominent business organizations wanted a state exchange, arguing it could be better tailored to Wisconsin’s needs, and any problems could be dealt with at the local level. State Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) issued a statement criticizing the decision. "I am disappointed that Governor Walker does not have enough faith in the people of Wisconsin to help create a health insurance marketplace that best fits our needs as a state," Erpenbach said. That critique was a common refrain from Democrats that day. But Erpenbach added a twist that caught our eye. Walker, he said, "has led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn’t implement an exchange, ObamaCare doesn’t happen here." The background A core of conservative critics of "Obamacare" believes that states maintain the ability to challenge -- and possibly block -- the federal health care reform law if they decline to run the exchanges. The legal theory holds that an unintended loophole in the law could block federally run exchanges from functioning legally in states. The state of Oklahoma made a version of the argument in amended court filings in September 2012. Wisconsin tea-party groups lobbied Walker not to create an exchange in part by raising this issue. And one of the leaders of that effort, Ross Brown of the Dane County group known as We the People of the Republic, feels it was a likely factor in Walker’s decision. Brown said he has no hard proof of that. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us the governor had not opted against a state exchange to keep the legal option open. Werwie said Walker’s is aware of the legal argument and has not ruled out pursuing it, but added that it was not under active consideration now. "At this time, this is how the Walker administration is moving forward," Werwie said. Erpenbach’s claim While there is some fuzziness about what could happen in the future, Erpenbach’s claim was entirely about the past -- that Walker had led residents to believe if the state did not create an exchange Obamacare would not be implemented here. Erpenbach pointed us to several Walker statements at key junctures in the "Obamacare" drama: February 2011: Walker joined 21 Republican governors favoring repeal of Obamacare if the courts don’t first strike it down. Lacking either, they wrote, federal officials should change the law to address the GOP governors’ fiscal and philosophical objections. They said that, lacking major improvements, they’d let the feds run the exchanges. December 2011: Walker suspended planning for a state-run exchange, a change in position. He had previously talked about creating one. He cited the pending Supreme Court case. In neither case was there a hint that Walker’s position on the exchanges was a move to stop the law. Erpenbach argues that Walker omitted the fact that if Wisconsin didn’t run the exchange, the feds would. But the clear context of Walker’s statements, and the news coverage of it, was that it was either/or. January 2012: Walker stopped work on a state exchange, eliminated his own Office of Free Market Health Care and turned down $37 million in federal planning money. Here’s how he explained his decision on creating an exchange: "Stopping the encroachment of Obamacare in our state, which has the potential to have a devastating impact on Wisconsin’s economy, is a top priority. Wisconsin has been a leader and innovator in health care reform for two decades, and we have achieved a high level of health insurance coverage without federal mandates. When job creators and Wisconsin families are facing difficult times it doesn’t make sense to commit to a federal health care mandate that will result in hidden taxes for Wisconsin’s families, increased health care costs and insurance premiums, and more uncertainty in the private sector." In that statement, Walker directly linked the exchange decision to "stopping" Obamacare in Wisconsin and not committing to it. And he did not explain the federal role. June 2012: After the Supreme Court upheld much of the law, Walker issued a statement saying that "Wisconsin will not take any action to implement Obamacare." He pinned his hopes for stopping it on the fall elections, and made it sound like the last hope: "I am hopeful that political changes in Washington, D.C., later this year ultimately end the implementation of this law at the federal level. If there is no political remedy from Washington and the law moves forward, it would require the majority of people in Wisconsin to pay more money for less health care." He again pledged not to phase in any parts of the law pending the election outcome. Around the same time, we fact-checked a Walker op-ed piece in the Washington Post. We rated False his claim that a study showed that Obamacare would "devastate Wisconsin" by pushing people off employer-sponsored insurance, driving up premiums, increasing dependency and making 122,000 people ineligible for Medicaid. After the Nov. 6, 2012 elections, Walker contemplated his final decision on a state or federal exchange. This is when the tea-party lobbyists and Obamacare critics such as Sen. Frank Lasee, R- De Pere, pressed him to let the feds do it -- in part hoping to keep alive a possible legal challenge. Walker, though, made no mention that we could find of that legal option when he announced on Nov. 16, 2012, he’d let the feds run it. Rather, he focused on possible costs to taxpayers. Wisconsin "will defer to the federal government’s insurance exchange," Walker wrote to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. One historical footnote: Walker’s remarks to reporters on Nov. 16, 2012, included the assurance that "We are complying with the law, exactly as the law is written." Was that a sly nod to the potential legal problem with how the law was written? Werwie said no, that Walker simply meant the law gave states the option of not creating an exchange and deferring to the federal government. Our rating Erpenbach said Walker "has led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn’t implement an exchange, ObamaCare doesn’t happen here." There’s no doubt that some conservative Obamacare critics see a link between stopping federal health care reform and not creating a state exchange. They are thrilled that Walker did what he did, in part for that reason. But Walker for the most part clearly cast his rhetoric about "stopping" the law in terms of the Supreme Court case and the election. And he has mostly made it clear that no state exchange would instead mean a federal exchange -- not no Obamacare. An exception was his January 2012 remarks, which coupled some heated language about stopping the law with his decision to punt the exchange to the federal government. That gives Erpenbach’s claim an element of accuracy, but we rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Jon Erpenbach	None	None	None	2012-11-25T09:00:00	2012-11-16	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
pomt-06982	"There are 30,000 people that have been killed with seat belts."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/13/joseph-trillo/ri-rep-trillo-says-30000-people-have-died-because-/	During the June 29, 2011, Rhode Island House debate over legislation to allow the police to stop motorists who are not wearing seat belts -- a bill that has now become law -- supporters said it would encourage more people to belt themselves in. Critics countered that the proposal was one more attempt to chip away at our personal freedoms and could encourage racial profiling. Few will disagree that seat belts save lives. But this was one instance where House Minority Whip Joseph Trillo, who said he regularly uses his seat belt, couldn't restrain himself. "There are 30,000 people that have been killed with seat belts, where they've gotten into accidents, the cars were on fire, they've been knocked out, they haven't been able to get out of the vehicle," he said. "My point is, even if the majority of people are saved, why do we keep forcing people to do things that they feel it's their own individual right to make a decision?" When we saw him make that comment on Capitol TV, we were intrigued. Thirty thousand people have lost their lives because they wore their seat belts? We were driven to call him that evening to ask him for the source of that statistic. A few emails and another phone call later, he reported that he couldn't find the source. "I know that I got it in an email. It brought me to a credible site. I don't remember what it was though," he said. "I'm not sure whether it's cumulative or on a yearly basis." Undaunted, he cited a page on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- which we checked -- saying that in 2002, 2004 and 2006, the number of people who died while wearing a seat belt was 12,000, 13,000 and 12,500, respectively. When we pointed out that being killed while wearing a seat belt doesn't mean they would have survived if they had been unbelted, Trillo argued that "if 12,000 to 13,000 are dying with seat belts every year on a national level, even if 2,000 couldn't get out of the car, it still could cumulatively add up to 30,000." We tried to find the source of Trillo's statement. A Google search came up blank. But we did find a website that talked about "23,000 people who run the risk of being trapped and fatally killed by a seat belt each year!" It also warned against seat belt use because "psychiatrists say that exposing young children to practices such as bondage from an early age can cause confusion during puberty." Needless to say, it was a humor website. So we decided to go the extra mile to look for some real data. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Consumer Product Safety Commission sent us to the NHTSA. Its most recent estimate is that 12,713 lives were saved in 2009 by people wearing seat belts, and another 3,688 fatalities would have been prevented if every driver had used one. (In Rhode Island, 11 lives were saved because of seat belt use and 10 died because they were not belted in, according to that report.) When we asked them for the number of deaths in which the use of seat belts was a contributing factor, they came up empty. NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database of motor vehicle fatalities logs lots of causes of death, listed as "most harmful event." Wearing a seat belt isn't one of them. After Trillo's comment about being trapped in a burning car, we searched the database and found there were 157 fire- or explosion-related fatalities in passenger vehicles in 2009 where the victims were using their seat belts. If you add people who died by immersion in water, the number jumps to 243. Even if seat belts trapped the occupants in every case, that would represent less than one percent of fatalities and it would take 123 years (at the 2009 rate) to match Trillo's 30,000 figure. (Lap belts have only been mandatory in U.S. cars since the 1960s.) We even put out a message to the 32,000 people who follow PolitiFact National on Twitter, asking people to email us if anyone had any reliable information on the question. One response led us to Sgt. William Mahoney, an accident scene investigator for about seven years with the Kansas City, Mo., Police Department, which handles about 65 to 75 traffic fatalities per year. "I've never seen a death that's been classified as having been caused by a seat belt," he said. "I'm not saying they don't exist. I've never seen one." When we asked Lt. Col. Raymond White of the Rhode Island State Police if, in his 28 years in law enforcement, he has ever seen an instance where someone probably would have survived a crash if they hadn't been wearing their seat belt, he said, "That's never been the case." And William Hall, who manages the occupant protection program at the University of North Carolina's Highway Safety Center, said that in the 30 years he's been with the center he hasn't seen any estimate comparable to Trillo's. "I have no clue as to where he may have gotten it," he said, noting that it's "quite likely" that, if the number was real, he would be aware of it. Hall said that "less than one half of one percent of all crashes involve a post-crash fire or going in the water. So that's a very low probability event. There are probably some extremely rare, rare circumstances where someone might have not been killed if they had been unbelted, but that's very, very hard to substantiate. It could mean it's just a non-survival crash and you're not going to make it, seat belt or no seat belt." In summary, when Trillo asserted that 30,000 people "have been killed with seat belts," the context of his statement made it clear that he was saying that seat belts contributed to their deaths, not simply that 30,000 people who died happened to be wearing seat belts. When we asked him for the source of his information, he couldn't produce it. "When we're doing all those bills, I'm trying to assimilate a lot of information. I'm not taking notes on it. I'm just reading stuff," said Trillo. In fact, when we suggested it might be wise to take note of his sources in case someone -- like PolitiFact, for example -- wanted to know where his facts came from, his response was, "I could care less." But we care because, if seat belts are really that dangerous, we want to know. And if a politician is exercising his right to be fooled by an email, we want to know that as well. With more than 30,000 fatal traffic accidents in the United States each year, we suspect there must be at least a few in which victims might have survived had they not been wearing a seat belt. But a search of Google, a question to the 32,000 readers who get our Twitter feed and queries to three federal agencies, two law enforcement agencies and others with an interest in tracking the dangers of seat belts produced no evidence that 30,000 people have died from wearing seat belts. Ever. Trillo's statement deserves to be strapped in for a one-way ride to Ridiculousville. We award his inflammatory claim a Pants On Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-00387	Says Scott Walker refused federal funds and "Wisconsin families now pay nearly 50% more than Minnesotans for the same health care."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/07/tony-evers/evers-base-attacking-walker-health-care/	In his first TV ad after winning the state’s Democratic nomination for governor, Tony Evers blamed incumbent Scott Walker for high health care costs in Wisconsin. The 30-second ad focused on the Republican governor’s decision to turn down federal funds that would have expanded Medicaid in 2014. "When Walker was running for president, he played politics and rejected millions in federal health care money that would have lowered costs for our families," the ad says. "Minnesota’s governor took the funds. They made changes. Wisconsin families now pay nearly 50% more than Minnesotans for the same health care." There’s a core statistical claim about health care costs, but also implications about the reasons behind it. Let’s dig in. States far apart in 2018 premiums The 50 percent claim is simple enough. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit think tank focusing on national health issues, uses benchmark plans for comparisons between states — specifically the second-lowest cost silver premium for a 40-year-old in each county. Their approach, which is widely accepted, shows a $569 average premium for Wisconsin in 2018 and a $385 average premium for Minnesota. Thus, Wisconsin premiums are about 48 percent higher for people purchasing individual insurance through the state and federal marketplaces created after the Affordable Care Act, according to the latest data. So the ad is largely correct about the number. But it is incorrect to attribute that number to "families," since the analysis it is drawn from is based on the cost an individual would pay. The ad also focuses on why those premiums are higher, pointing to Walker’s Medicaid decision. Declining Medicaid was part of Walker’s Obamacare alternative, and was his first major policy initiative as a presidential candidate. (Democrats have come after Walker for this decision before, including a claim by then-gubernatorial candidate Dana Wachs that the move cost Wisconsin $1 billion, which we rated Mostly True in June 2018.) Medicaid expansion would have covered everyone making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Walker instead did what’s called a "partial expansion" of Medicaid, covering everyone making less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level. The full expansion would have moved more low-income people out of the marketplace, which affects premiums for those who remained in it. But how much? Medicaid just one of many factors Experts say Medicaid may be a factor in the premium difference, but it is just one of many that could explain differences in premiums between two states. A handful of studies have shown Medicaid expansion has some impact on premiums, but not much, said Adam Searing, a research professor at Georgetown University. Several studies showed Medicaid expansion reduced premiums by 2 percent to 7 percent, while a study in New Hampshire actually showed an increase in premiums after Medicaid expansion. JP Wieske, deputy commissioner of the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, called it "total poppycock" to claim that Medicaid decisions drove the difference between Wisconsin and Minnesota premiums. He said Medicaid would be "very far down" the list of factors affecting Wisconsin health care premiums. "I’m not sure it would be top three or five," Wieske said. Other factors in premium determination include reinsurance, risk pool differences and competition between insurers and providers, said Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute in Washington, D.C. She said the amount attributable to Medicaid is "likely to be small relative to the other factors." Sabrina Corlette, another research professor at Georgetown University, said the ad over-reaches and oversimplifies by comparing two states based primarily on the Medicaid distinction. "It is just challenging to draw hard and fast conclusions when you’re just comparing one state to another, because states can have very different policy and market dynamics," she said. Minnesota’s health care system has a unique history that includes a state-run high risk pool (for the most costly patients) that dates to the 1970s and MinnesotaCare, which at the time of the Medicaid expansion already covered many people who became eligible, said Jim Schowalter, chief executive of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans. So Medicaid expansion had a different impact in Minnesota than Wisconsin. "It’s an apples and oranges comparison because of the different programs and eligibility," Schowalter said. Corlette said it’s fair to note, though, that Minnesota has been more proactive than most states about addressing health care costs. "Minnesota has really leaned in, and where there are policy levers available to try and keep people covered, get rates lower, make the marketplace run smoothly, they have taken advantage of those," she said. "I think that’s fair to say about Minnesota and its political leadership." Sam Lau, a spokesman for Evers’ campaign, said the ad was drawing a distinction between the states’ leadership. "In contrast to Scott Walker's inaction, there are numerous decisions and changes Minnesota made to lower its health care costs, and now in 2018, average health costs in Wisconsin are nearly 50% higher than in Minnesota," he said. "Health care policy is complex, but despite its complexities, health care costs can be lowered." Reinsurance helped Minnesota, soon Wisconsin, too Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg said the ad actually makes the case for Walker’s record on health care. Walker pushed for a reinsurance program for Wisconsin, which will be in effect for next year. The plan, called the Health Care Stability Plan, is projected to lower premiums by 10 percent compared to what they would have been and takes effect in January, according to the insurance commissioner office. It is funded by $166 million in federal money and $34 million in state dollars. The 50 percent gap in premium costs only developed this year after Minnesota implemented reinsurance. In 2017, Wisconsin actually had lower premiums than Minnesota — $368 compared to $412. But Wisconsin’s premiums jumped to $569 in 2018 as insurers raised rates after losing $500 million in the Wisconsin marketplace from 2014 to 2017, said Elizabeth Hizmi, spokeswoman for the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance. Some insurers reduced coverage areas and others left the Wisconsin market altogether. Meanwhile, Minnesota’s rates stayed consistent as the state instituted reinsurance. Under that program, the state paid a portion of medical expenses for insurers beyond $50,000 and until $250,000, meaning insurers took on less risk from the sickest people and could offer lower overall rates. "Our premiums today have everything to do with reinsurance," Schowalter said. Our rating Evers’ ad is built around the claim that Wisconsin premiums are 50 percent higher than Minnesota’s, but it goes astray on several fronts. The ad attributes the figure to "Wisconsin families," when it comes from an analysis that looks at the premium cost for a 40-year-old individual in each county. And while the ad notes Minnesota "made changes," the framing of the issue — starting with Walker’s rejection of the funds and ending with the difference in health care costs — leaves viewers with the impression that Walker’s decision is the sole, or at least a primary reason, the states have such different premiums. Experts say that’s not correct. Several other policies and market dynamics play a more significant role than Medicaid in determining premiums. Furthermore, differences in the health insurance markets between Wisconsin and Minnesota make simplistic comparisons between the states unreasonable. The ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-02411	Oregon has never before tried to create a land-use plan for "what it should look like for 50 years."	/oregon/statements/2014/mar/06/state-rep-brian-clem-d-salem/has-oregon-never-created-land-use-plan-what-it-sho/	For more than 40 years, Oregon has maintained a national reputation for its comprehensive land-use system. However, political wrangling and costly, time-consuming lawsuits have frequently hamstrung the process. Mere mention of the words "land use" can divide many rooms down the middle. The Claim The Oregon Legislature just waded into a years-long attempt by the Portland region to create a 50-year supply of urban and rural reserves. Lawmakers jumped in after the Court of Appeals found parts of the plan fatally flawed. State Rep. Brian Clem, D-Salem, helped broker a bill, also with a 50-year horizon, that put into law significant parts of the plan the court tossed out. The bill trimmed the number of urban reserves, particularly in Washington County, and made a few other growth-boundary tweaks. Clem called the effort groundbreaking. "This reserves effort is a big deal," he told reporters on Feb. 28, 2014. "We’ve never tried this before -- beyond that five-, six-year cycle, what it should look like for 50 years." There’s something new under the sun when it comes to Oregon land-use law? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The Analysis Clem’s claim hinges on both the 50-year time frame built into the new law -- is that a first? -- as well as the contents of the bill, the "reserves." Given the tricky legal landscape, we called veteran land-use attorney Ed Sullivan. Everything the state is dealing with today, he said, stems from Senate Bill 100, the 1973 law requiring cities and counties to prepare their own plans in accordance with statewide goals. Rules based on the law require the Portland area to maintain a 20-year supply of "buildable land," Sullivan said. They also require a review every five years to determine whether the urban growth boundary needs expanding. Fast-forward to the mid-1990s, when the counties and Metro -- the regional planning agency -- wearied of the every-five-year review scramble. They tried something different. Using existing authority, they designated more than 18,500 acres for urban reserves -- enough to accommodate growth for 30 years, according to projections. So there was language in a 1997 plan outlining a time frame longer than five years, but not the 50 contained in Clem’s claim. However, the state Court of Appeals tossed that plan out, and it never took effect. We called Dan Chandler, now strategic policy administrator at Clackamas County, who worked on the 1997 case. What’s different this time, he said, is the first-ever inclusion of rural reserves -- a classification of land that didn’t exist in the law until 2007. The bill creating rural reserves, he added, established the legal path to the deal just struck in Salem. We emailed Clem at his legislative office, and he called us a few minutes later. He knew about the legal existence of urban reserves but hadn’t realized the Portland area in the late 1990s -- in an ultimately doomed effort -- designated more than 18,500 acres for future growth. "But what I was talking about in my claim," he said, "was how no one has ever done both urban and rural reserves in one big effort. In fact, just before the quote you’re focusing on, I specifically mentioned SB 1011, which is all about urban and rural reserves together. Without both components, I don’t think we could have pulled this off." We checked with Christian Gaston, The Oregonian reporter who has been writing about the Legislature’s land-use action. He confirmed Clem’s account. Dubbed the "grand bargain," the new law has received near-universal acclaim. One Clackamas County commissioner has expressed misgivings, but all of the groups that mounted court challenges against the most recent Metro/counties plan, including watchdog land-use group 1000 Friends of Oregon, say they are satisfied with the outcome. The Ruling The Portland area now has a new way to plan where growth will and won’t occur, as well as a solution for avoiding those burdensome five-year periodic review cycles. Clem, in touting the law, said "we’ve never tried this before," meaning no one has devised a land-use plan that looks out a half-century. That’s on the mark, since Metro and the three counties signed off on a plan 17 years ago that identified enough acreage to accommodate growth for three decades -- not five. It’s important to note, however, that since that plan died after successful legal challenges, it was never "tried." Clem rightly notes that the 1997 plan did not address rural reserves. In addition, he gets points for context. In his claim, he used the words "reserves" in referring to the first-ever inclusion of both urban and rural reserves in the same bill. The reporter who wrote the story that included his claim backed Clem’s account. So while it’s true that a plan was developed nearly 20 years ago that looked out far more than five years, that rocky iteration of Oregon’s land-use history was never actually put into effect. We rate Clem’s claim True. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling.	None	Brian Clem	None	None	None	2014-03-06T16:54:06	2014-02-28	['None']
pomt-00196	"In Congress, Ron DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions."	/florida/statements/2018/oct/18/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-attack-ron-desantis-about-pre-existi/	Florida Democrats are turning Ron DeSantis’ Obamacare opposition against him in the state’s closely watched governor’s race. An ad for Democrat Andrew Gillum's campaign highlights patients with conditions including breast cancer, asthma, epilepsy and arthritis. "They are called pre-existing conditions and everybody knows somebody who has one," says the ad produced in partnership with the Florida Democratic Party. The ad then pivots to DeSantis’ time in the U.S. House. (He resigned in September to focus on his campaign.) "But in Congress, Ron DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions," the narrator says. "He’d let insurance companies deny them coverage. And when he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'" In a related fact-check, we explained the full context of the comment DeSantis made about the emergency room and cancer patients. DeSantis and Gillum could not be further apart on health care. Gillum has called for expanding access to health care and supports Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal, and DeSantis supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. DeSantis has been quiet on health care policy that he likes so far in his campaign. He has not yet released a health care plan, and the issues page on his website doesn’t mention the topic as of three weeks before Election Day. Did DeSantis really call for not including pre-existing conditions in a new law? His comments were more nuanced. DeSantis and a GOP Obamacare replacement The crux of the Democrats’ attack focuses on a decision by DeSantis to support House Republicans’ American Health Care Act, a 2017 bill that put protections for pre-existing health conditions in jeopardy. The Affordable Care Act barred insurers from rejecting people on the basis of pre-existing conditions, or charging them exorbitant rates for their premiums. We didn’t find examples that showed DeSantis "demanded" protections for pre-existing conditions be dropped in a new bill. But he was a part of the conservative wing of House Republicans, known as the Freedom Caucus, which did appear to force changes in the legislation behind the scenes. In March 2017, Freedom Caucus members said they wanted the bill to attack the law’s insurance coverage mandates, the Washington Post reported. House leaders who drafted the bill had steered clear of insurance mandates, but the Freedom Caucus didn’t want a watered-down bill. "I think we can probably be more aggressive," DeSantis said at the time. The Freedom Caucus wanted several of the key provisions of the law repealed, including the individual and employer mandates, the essential health coverage required in every plan and community rating rules that limit the factors insurers can use when setting premiums. DeSantis was part of the Freedom Caucus meeting with President Donald Trump about plans to change the bill. When the caucus wouldn’t join Republican leadership, the bill collapsed. DeSantis issued a statement calling the bill a "a flawed piece of legislation produced by a hasty process" which left "the core architecture of Obamacare in place" and didn’t do enough to addressing rising premiums and lack of consumer choice. Republicans continued to work on it. In late April 2017, Fox’s Lou Dobbs asked DeSantis about the effort by the Freedom Caucus to get the necessary votes for a health care plan. DeSantis replied: "Well, I think we should get the votes. I mean, we promised to fully repeal it. That's what I think we should do. That's what most conservatives want to do. We have resistance to doing that, so this bill is a compromise bill that rolls back a lot of Obamacare, then allows states to effectively opt out of the premium-hiking regulations. "And so that should be something that everyone in the conference should be able to get behind who ran on repealing Obamacare. And I think if we do that, and hopefully, the Senate will make it better, and the states that opt out, I think you can see some premiums start to go down, which would be a huge win for consumers." The New York Times explained a series of changes to the bill that won over the Freedom Caucus, including one that would affect people with pre-existing conditions. States would be allowed to waive a rule to allow higher prices for consumers who had a lapse in coverage of more than 63 days. Then, these consumers would buy insurance through a separate pool. This would have undermined the key provision of the Affordable Care Act to ban insurers from charging higher prices to those with pre-existing conditions. While the Freedom Caucus wanted to push health care closer to the pre-ACA days, the legislation didn’t do away with pre-existing condition protections completely. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 6.3 million people could potentially face higher premiums for one year under the bill due to pre-existing health conditions. On May 4, 2017, DeSantis joined a narrow majority to vote for the bill, which passed the House on a mostly partisan 217-213 vote. (It later died in the Senate.) DeSantis and the Senate version The Democrats also point to comments by DeSantis in favor of a subsequent effort to overhaul the bill, known as the Graham-Cassidy bill. "So I think that this is clearly better than Obamacare," DeSantis said on Fox Business News Sept. 21, 2017. "It really empowers the states to fashion solutions. And I think that would be good for a large number of states who really are suffering under Obamacare." That bill did address pre-existing conditions, by requiring states to show they intended to keep coverage accessible and affordable if they wanted billions in federal aid dollars. But other parts of the bill would have allowed states to give insurance companies a free hand in charging those people higher premiums. Experts said the bill’s language protecting people with pre-existing conditions was vague and subject to broad interpretation. This bill also died. DeSantis has said he supports protections for pre-existing conditions DeSantis, much like other Republicans nationwide this year, has been trying to thread the awkward needle of opposing the Affordable Care Act while declaring support for pre-existing condition protection. WPLG’s Glenna Milberg asked DeSantis about pre-existing conditions at an Oct. 15 campaign event in West Miami a few weeks after the ad appeared. DeSantis replied "100 percent you need pre-existing." He also said that before Obamacare, pre-existing condition protection existed, which isn’t quite right. Before, individual market insurers in all but five states maintained lists of so-called declinable medical conditions, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Many insurers also maintained a list of declinable medications. A spokesman for DeSantis told the Tampa Bay Times in September that DeSantis supports protections for pre-existing conditions. His campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Gillum's ad said, "In Congress, Ron DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions." We didn’t find an example of DeSantis individually demanding protections for pre-existing conditions be dropped in a new bill. However, he was part of the Freedom Caucus, the conservative wing of the House, that forced changes that weakened protections for pre-existing conditions. "Eliminate" is too strong. In May 2017, DeSantis voted in favor of the Republicans’ American Health Care Act in 2017, an Obamacare replacement bill that would have put pre-existing condition protection in jeopardy for some patients. DeSantis also voted for the Graham-Cassidy bill that said states had to show they intended to keep coverage accessible and affordable in order to get federal aid. But the bill also would have allowed states to let insurance companies charge higher premiums to sicker people. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-08637	About $4.89 billion in one-time money was used to balance the current state general revenue fund budget.	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/17/ted-strickland/strickland-administration-figures-one-time-money-u/	The fine print tucked among the hundreds of pages of Ohio’s state budget that details how state programs are paid for doesn’t normally make for a very hot political issue. However, this is no ordinary state budget that is paying the bills in Ohio. The current budget relies heavily on federal stimulus money and other nest eggs. Ohio is now relying on an unprecedented level of one-time money in its budget. Those sources include: Stimulus funding Draining of little-used state accounts Debt restructuring A loan from the school facilities commission Proceeds from cuts to state employees Ohio’s Office of Budget and Management attempts to tackle this controversial subject on its website with an estimate of exactly how much one-time money is used. A chart there totals the one-time resources affecting the general revenue fund at $4,887,844,809 — we’ll call it $4.89 billion -- a numerical statement that we are attributing to Gov. Ted Strickland since the cabinet-level office ultimately answers to him. That number is billions of dollars lower than estimates some other analysts have provided, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a closer look at the state’s accounting of one-time money. One-time money is simply funding that won’t reoccur in the next budget cycle, and it’s being used to make ends meet in the $50.5 billion general revenue fund budget. Think of it this way: If you find a $50 bill in the alley you might use it to pay your cell-phone bill this month. Next month you won’t have that $50 coming in to use on the bill, thus it’s one-time money to you. Republican lawmakers seized on the heavy use of the one-time money during last year’s budget debate. They accused Gov. Ted Strickland of promoting an unsustainable budget that would steer Ohio off a budgetary cliff when the next state budget rolls around. This was a key argument for Republicans, as only six of 67 GOP lawmakers voted for Strickland’s budget in the House and Senate. The implication is that the more one-time money used in the current state budget, the bigger the structural imbalance will be when that money isn’t there to prop things up next time. And next time is soon -- the next budget will be rolled out in the spring of 2011. Strickland spokeswoman Amanda Wurst quickly put us in touch with David Ellis, the state’s assistant budget director, to explain the details on how his office compiled its one-time number. Ellis said that the $4.89 billion figure only includes all of the one-time money contained in House Bill 1, the state’s primary budget document that passed in mid-July 2009. He said it doesn’t encompass any changes to the state’s budget made in subsequent pieces of legislation since the bill was signed into law more than 14 months ago. However, since House Bill 1 was passed, as Ellis knows, the state has felt the impact of other spending-related provisions that have come into effect. The biggest change was the delay of an income tax cut worth $844 million contained in House Bill 318, but that delay is supposed to end after this budget. Additionally, the OBM one-time list does not include an increase in the reimbursement rate for prescription drug coverage under Medicaid Part D, worth $152 million, that happened in Feb. 2010 long after the state budget was enacted; nor a raid on the state’s tobacco fund, worth $627 million, in combined state and federal funds still tied up in court. Tally those figures and the state’s use of one-time money in the general revenue fund portion of the budget rises from $4.89 billion to $6.51 billion. Ellis said budget officials see no point in updating the one-time number. "We’ve not felt compelled to update it at each turn of the page," Ellis said. "It’s not been updated because it has no bearing on the day-to-day operations of the office or the day-to-day operations of the budget." Wurst, who serves double duty as the budget spokeswoman, noted that reporters who ask budget questions are told the one-time figure doesn’t include any changes made after mid-July 2009. "We always make that clear to reporters, such as yourself, that the figure hasn’t been updated," she said. Wurst argues that the public isn’t being misled by the number because to get to the chart depicting the one-time money requires clicking on a previous tab titled "budget highlights." Therefore, she argues, it’s clear that the context of the one-time money is from within the state budget bill passed some 14 months ago. What Wurst doesn’t mention is that the one-time money chart is the only place that such a figure appears anywhere on OBM’s website. And, of course, it wouldn’t require a major programming overhaul to more clearly label the chart so that the public realizes that the one-time figure only includes items passed in House Bill 1. A second argument advanced by Ellis is that the $627 million related to the state’s raid on the tobacco fund shouldn’t be counted as one-time money because it remains tied up in court. The Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments on July 6 about whether the state should be allowed to use money from Ohio’s settlement with Big Tobacco on "optional" Medicaid services and human-service programs. A ruling has not yet been issued. "We absorbed those costs into our budget," Ellis said. "We didn’t have the money to spend." That’s true — to a degree. While money shifted from underspending in other Medicaid areas is plugging the hole made by the tobacco funds currently held up by the Supreme Court case, the Strickland administration still hopes the court will give it the green light to use those dollars. And even if you don’t count those funds, the budget office’s one-time number is still off by about $1 billion. So let’s go to the scorecard and add it up: The state budget office acknowledges its $4.89 billion figure is outdated but says it’s not misleading to the public. A more updated figure isn’t available anywhere on OBMs website. And, there certainly are political considerations for having the number appear as low as possible. And Strickland budget officials question whether the $647 million raid on the state’s tobacco fund should be added to the total at all because the Ohio Supreme Count hasn’t yet ruled on whether that money can be put to use. Whether you count the $647 million in tobacco money tied up in court or not, it’s clear that the $4.89 billion one-time money figure is off by at least $1 billion. The fact that reporters are apprised immediately by Wurst that the figure is incomplete shows that the administration realizes that it isn’t an accurate representation of how much one-time money is used in the state budget. That suggests to us that the Strickland administration knows that continuing to use the $4.89 billion one-time money figure on its website could mislead the public. That’s why we rate the statement as False.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2010-09-17T11:30:00	2010-09-17	['None']
pomt-13486	Says Patrick Murphy "never worked as a CPA" and was "never a small business owner."	/florida/statements/2016/sep/08/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republican-group-misleads-attack-patrick-murphys-r/	The National Republican Senatorial Committee says it’s fact-checking U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy’s resume as a certified public accountant and small business owner. Murphy, a Jupiter Democrat, is running against incumbent Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. The NRSC’s TV ad begins with a video clip of Murphy saying in 2012, "I believe that my background as a CPA and a small business owner is exactly what we need." The narrator then reads lines from a CBS4 Miami report and says, "Never worked as a CPA," and "Never a small business owner." Did Murphy distort his work experience? We heard similar attacks against Murphy during the primary, and wrote a guide to attacks on Murphy’s resume. There are a lot of nuances to how Murphy has characterized his work experience, and the TV ad makes it sound clear cut. It’s not. 'Never worked as a CPA?' Murphy did work as a CPA. But he first held a lesser title and then worked as a CPA for less than a year. Murphy started at Deloitte in Miami 2007 as an "audit assistant." He applied for his CPA license from Colorado in 2009; at the time Colorado required fewer semester credits than Florida. After he obtained the license in September 2009, he was promoted to "audit senior." He left in May 2010. To get the license, Murphy took a test through the state of Vermont. (The exam is the same everywhere, so he didn’t have to travel to Vermont to take it.) CBS4 reported that Murphy "never worked a day in his life as a Certified Public Accountant." This is a matter of semantics: He did work while a CPA for several months at Deloitte, but he worked in Florida while holding a Colorado CPA license. Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida, previously told PolitiFact Florida that Murphy’s path -- starting as an audit assistant at Deloitte, taking the CPA test and getting licensed in another state and then being promoted -- would have been common. Many new hires at firms such as Deloitte have not passed the CPA exam. These non-CPA assistants can’t sign audit opinions or tax returns; however, they do audit work without having a CPA license from any state, McGill said. "Bottom line: He can fully work as an audit assistant or even audit senior or manager in for Deloitte in Miami without being licensed in Florida (or anywhere)," McGill said. "It only becomes critical to have the Florida license if he becomes a partner." Murphy was promoted to "audit senior" after obtaining his license. "They are the boots on the ground doing the actual work," he said. Murphy acknowledged in a 2012 debate that his CPA license was from Colorado after his Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Allen West, accused him of misleading voters about his credentials. "I am a certified public accountant in the state of Colorado," Murphy said. "I never hid that." Murphy’s 2016 campaign website said that after college, he "went on to work as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) for Deloitte and Touche, auditing Fortune 500 companies." A Murphy spokesman referred to an article by the Sun Sentinel which quoted a former supervisor of Murphy’s at Deloitte from 2007 to 2009. She gave $250 to his campaign in 2011. "Patrick is a licensed CPA who did valued accounting work in Florida," Courtney Connolly told the Sentinel. 'Never a small business owner' Murphy was a small business owner. But the business was owned by multiple people and grew out of a business owned by his father. The business was Coastal Environmental Services, a company formed to clean up the Gulf oil spill. Ultimately the firm only did work in the Gulf for a few months. In 2010, Murphy, his father Thomas P. Murphy Jr. and Dan Whiteman incorporated Coastal Environmental Services. The elder Murphy owns the affiliated Coastal Construction, and Whiteman was listed as the president of both firms. Annual reports show Patrick Murphy was a director in 2011 and 2012. Once elected to Congress, he remained an owner but no longer a director. State records don’t show if someone is an "owner," and Murphy hasn’t said if he financed the firm. By "owner" Murphy presumably meant that he had an economic interest, University of Florida corporate law professor Stuart Cohn previously told PolitiFact Florida. "Records filed with the state do not require listing those who had such an economic interest, whether as a shareholder or otherwise," Cohn said. "So, it is not possible from the state records to determine who owned what economic interests and in what percentages." The Murphy campaign shared an IRS document with PolitiFact Florida that showed that Murphy, his father and Whiteman were shareholders in 2010. (The campaign blacked out the percentage each owned, as well as the names of three additional shareholders.) Whiteman previously told PolitiFact Florida that as vice president Murphy "managed the company’s affairs." "It's typical for business partners to have multiple ventures together, so it’s not unusual for some of the owners of Coastal Construction to also be owners of Coastal Environmental," Whiteman said. Most of Murphy’s annual congressional financial disclosures do not mention his position with Coastal Environmental. In 2015, he amended his 2012 form to show that he was the firm’s vice president. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 he doesn’t list the firm at all. The company has been dormant since 2010, so it hasn't generated any income and doesn't need to be reported as an asset on the forms, said Joshua Karp, Murphy’s campaign spokesman. Our ruling The NRSC ad says Murphy "never worked as a CPA" and was "never a small business owner." Murphy did work as a CPA, albeit for only several months. He first worked as an audit assistant, and then got licensed through the state of Colorado. Murphy has been an owner of Coastal Environmental Services. The firm only did work in the Gulf for a few months in 2010 and has since been dormant. Since it is a private business, we lack some information about it such as whether he put up any money to finance the business. He was a co-owner along with his father. In both cases, the word "never" is too extreme to characterize Murphy’s work experience. However, in both cases we are talking about Murphy working for brief periods of time. Murphy may be overselling his resume, but the ad also exaggerates when it says "never." We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/48c429c2-9a50-4d02-beac-b18e0f30905b	None	National Republican Senatorial Committee	None	None	None	2016-09-08T15:53:55	2016-09-07	['None']
pomt-07246	"We are in the bottom 10 in dollars in the classroom and the top 10 in dollars in the bureaucracy and red tape."	/ohio/statements/2011/may/30/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-ohio-near-bottom-classroom-sp/	Gov. John Kasich took office complaining that not enough money spent on public education was going towards classroom instruction. The implication was that Ohio’s public schools instead are spending too much on administrator salaries and slighting schoolchildren. Well, he’s not implying anymore, he’s now saying as much. "We are in the bottom 10 in dollars in the classroom and the top 10 in dollars in the bureaucracy and red tape," the governor told a national television audience on May 12 during a live interview on FOX News cable television. The governor has made similar claims in the past, but his statement also contained something new, so Politifact Ohio decided to take a look. It has been well documented that Kasich’s first operating budget released in March suggested putting the squeeze on public school education, proposing to cut funding to local school districts by 11.9 percent next fiscal year and another 4.9 percent the year after. It would seem contradictory to cut funding to schools and yet chide them for not spending more in the classroom, school officials say. At the same time, Kasich wants to increase the number of charter schools, direct competition to school districts. But the Republican governor insists he is giving the districts choices for how to save money and compete and yet still boost classroom spending all while drawing down fewer state dollars. One is with controversial Senate Bill 5, the collective bargaining reform law that is suspended while a challenge is mounted against it by labor groups, including teachers unions. The law sharply curtails collective bargaining power of teachers and other public union workers, bans strikes and eliminates binding arbitration. The other option the governor says districts can turn to is cutting their administrative and overhead costs by trimming the number of administrators they employ and looking for ways to consolidate their services. PolitiFact Ohio checked a variation of the first part of Kasich’s statement last November when the new governor complained that Ohio was 46th in the country in classroom spending. We rated that claim Mostly True. New this statement is the claim that Ohio ranks in "the top 10 in dollars in the bureaucracy and red tape." It turns out the governor based his most recent statement, including the new part of the claim about administrative costs, on the same information as his previous comments, a 2010 report from the Greater Ohio Policy Center and Brookings Institution. The report, ‘Restoring Prosperity: Transforming Ohio’s Communities for the Next Economy,’ focused on ways to improve Ohio’s economy by strengthening the state’s urban cores. Revising how education dollars are spent was one of the report’s conclusions. "Ohio ranks 47th in the nation in the share of elementary and secondary education spending that goes to instruction and ninth in the share that goes to administration," the report states. A spokesman for Kasich said it was that line in the 76-page report that the governor is referring to with his comments. It’s important to note, though, that the statistics, from the National Center for Education Statistics, are from a state-by-state analysis of data from the 2007-2008 school year, meaning they are about three years old. The Dayton Daily News, which reviewed U.S. Department of Education statistics, recently reported that Ohio was 12th highest in terms of the amount of money spent on administrative costs and 46th lowest for spending in the classroom. While those statistics do not perfectly match Kasich’s statement of Ohio being in the top 10 for administrative spending, they were close enough that the administration highlighted the story in support of Kasich’s position. We agree. That the Education Department’s data has Ohio slipping to 12th on administrative spending is not enough to make the governor’s underlying point inaccurate. Knowing it provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2011-05-30T06:00:00	2011-05-12	['None']
pomt-07708	"Thirty-five states have accepted high-speed intercity rail money."	/florida/statements/2011/mar/04/raymond-lahood/us-transportation-secretary-ray-lahood-35-states-h/	U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says that the decisions made by Republican governors in Ohio, Wisconsin and now Florida to refuse federal money for high-speed rail projects shouldn't overshadow the fact that the vast majority of governors and states embrace the idea of bullet trains in their backyard. "Thirty-five states have accepted high-speed intercity rail money. Thirty-five," LaHood told a March 2, 2011, meeting of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. "There's a lot of enthusiasm and energy and very good plans around the country for high-speed, intercity rail. ... Just in the last two weeks, I probably received half a dozen or more letters from either governors or senators that are ready. They have their plans ready. If there is more money to be made available, they are ready to get in. America is ready for high-speed intercity rail. And the fact that 35 states have accepted the money is proof of it." A video copy of LaHood's speech is attached to this story. His comments about rail begin about six minutes in. We decided to check LaHood's claim that 35 of the country's 50 states have accepted money for high-speed rail projects. High-speed rail has been a priority of President Barack Obama's administration, which set aside $8 billion in the 2009 federal stimulus package for rail projects and awarded an additional $2.5 billion to fund rail projects in October 2010. Florida, for instance, was offered $2.4 billion in federal money to help build the 84-mile-long corridor linking Tampa and Orlando. The total project was estimated to cost about $2.7 billion, with either the state or a private contractor picking up the remaining share. The Tampa-Orlando line was conceived as one of the first legs in what Obama envisioned as a nationwide high-speed rail network. A second line eventually would have connected Orlando and Miami, with future lines connecting Jacksonville to Orlando and Jacksonville to Tallahassee. Eventually, a network of high-speed rail lines would be able to carry passengers from Miami up the eastern seaboard, or as far west as Los Angeles and Seattle, linking 80 percent of the country's population. Florida Gov. Rick Scott rejected the money for his share of the network in an announcement on Feb. 16, 2011, joining a group of critics who believe the federal money could be better spent on state road systems, or by not being spent at all. The federal government revoked a $400 million grant to Ohio for high-speed rail after the state's new governor, John Kasich, said he would not participate. The same thing happened in Wisconsin, where the federal government pulled back $810 million to build a high-speed line between Milwaukee and Madison after newly elected Gov. Scott Walker made it clear that he would not accept the money. All three states received or spent federal dollars on their rail projects before nixing them entirely. Justin Nisly, a spokesman with the U.S. Department of Transportation, said that, in total, 35 states and the District of Columbia have received federal funding through the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program either as part of the 2009 stimulus or the 2010 grant awards. Here's the transportation department's list of states that received money -- Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, North Carolina, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and West Virginia. That's 35 states alright. But in going through the list, along with the accompanying grant information the Transportation Department provided (here and here), we found several caveats to LaHood's claim. Maybe high-speed, maybe just intercity First, the list is not just high-speed intercity service. It's high-speed or intercity service. That's why Kansas is on the list though it's not planning a high-speed line. Kansas is planning to possibly use an existing freight-line to move people between Kansas City and Oklahoma City. On top of that, the list includes three states that have loudly rejected federal funding for high-speed rail projects. Florida, Wisconsin and Ohio have combined to say no to nearly $3.6 billion in federal moneys. Each of those states did spend or receive some federal dollars before killing their projects, but not nearly enough to construct a high-speed line. Wisconsin has a second asterisk. While it rejected money for a high-speed line between Milwaukee and Madison, it did accept $2 million to upgrade the existing Hiawatha Amtrak line linking Milwaukee and Chicago. But that's upgrading an existing Amtrak line, not developing a high-speed rail line. Money for tracks, stations, tunnels Other states on the list are receiving money, but not for high-speed rail service. Four states included on the list received funding only to create broad statewide rail plans, not money to engineer or plan the feasibility of specific high-speed rail corridors. To develop the broad vision documents, New Mexico received $100,000, Idaho received $200,000, Nevada received $640,000 and West Virginia received $1 million. And still other states received money to renovate existing track or stations -- which would improve service -- though without creating high-speed rail lines. (High-speed rail doesn't have a singular measure, but most people agree a high-speed line should reach speeds in excess of 125 mph). Maryland's $70 million in funding was to plan for the replacement of two tunnels on existing rail track, and to plan for the building of a new train station at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Indiana received $71 million to improve existing regular rail service between the town of Porter and the Illinois state line. It also had asked for $2.8 billion to develop a high-speed line linking Chicago and Cleveland, but was rejected. (Ohio's decision to reject a high-speed line likely makes Indiana's application moot). That's at least 10 states that either have rejected the idea of high-speed rail, or are receiving federal funding -- but spending on something other than you'd consider a high-speed rail project. That doesn't include another handful of states that received federal funding just to study the possibility of constructing a high-speed rail corridor. A study which, by no means, signals that state wants to build a line, or will (If you don't believe us, ask Florida's new governor). Other lists differ from LaHood's One more interesting point about LaHood's 35-state claim: It's not the same number used by the Federal Railroad Administration. On its website, the railroad administration keeps a "current list of High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail project funding." (A word of caution: You'll need to install Microsoft Silverlight to view the list. If you're having trouble, we copied the list and posted it for you to see here.) The list includes awards to states totaling $4.8 billion, including the first $66 million awarded to Florida as part of its Tampa-Orlando line, and $45 million given to Wisconsin and Ohio before those states pulled out of the program. Excluding Florida, Wisconsin and Ohio, the railroad administration says 15 states and the District of Columbia have been awarded some type of high-speed rail funding. They are: North Carolina, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, New York, Georgia, Kansas, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon, California, Vermont and the District of Columbia. For the record, high-speed rail corridors are still being actively planned in California, in Oregon and Washington, in Illinois, and throughout the northeast. Our ruling LaHood told transportation officials that "35 states have accepted high-speed intercity rail money." It seems clear that 35 states, plus the District of Columbia, have so far been awarded money for rail projects through the 2009 federal stimulus or a subsequent federal grant. And yes, the program is called High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program. But to say all of that money is directed for high-speed intercity rail stretches common logic. First it's really high-speed or intercity rail. Next, three of those 35 states have subsequently said no thanks. And several other states are taking the money, but not using it to develop new high-speed rail lines. We understand that you can make an argument that all of that money could one day result in a high-speed rail project. But based on the results in Wisconsin, Ohio, and now Florida, we're far from ready to go there just yet. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-15379	Says Jeb Bush "oversaw (an) average in-state tuition increase of 48.2 percent during his tenure."	/florida/statements/2015/jun/30/florida-democratic-party/florida-dems-say-tuition-went-482-percent-jeb-bush/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush likes to advertise education reforms during his two terms in office, but the Florida Democratic Party wants to remind voters those changes came at a price. In a joint press release with the Texas Democratic Party ahead of a fundraising visit to the Lone Star state, Democrats compared Bush to fellow presidential hopeful Rick Perry, the former Texas governor. In a chart listing dubious gubernatorial achievements, Dems said Bush "oversaw (an) average in-state tuition increase of 48.2 percent during his tenure." Did public university tuition go up by almost 50 percent in eight years during Bush’s two terms? That number is more or less correct, but there’s more to the Bush-era education overhaul than that. Higher-cost education Before we dive into the convoluted tuition-setting process, keep in mind that Florida’s governor does not set tuition rates, the Legislature does. The governor does sign off on the rate in the final budget, and can veto an increase. But the Florida Democratic Party said he "oversaw" the increases, so we need to keep that wording in mind. When Bush took office, the State University System was governed by the Board of Regents, which was designed to protect university interests and often fought with legislators over how money was spent at schools. One of those battles led Bush to work with then-Speaker of the House John Thrasher and the Legislature to dissolve the Board of Regents in 2000. The Regents’ duties were turned over to the state Board of Education and a governor-appointed Board of Trustees at each university. But that system soon added the current Board of Governors, created when U.S. Sen. Bob Graham (also a former governor) masterminded a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2002. Now let’s get down to the numbers. Florida Democratic Party officials didn’t elaborate on their claim for us, but they did include a link in their press release to back up their point. A chart from the Florida College Access Network, a student advocacy group, showed average in-state, undergraduate tuition and fees for students taking 30 credit hours at State University System schools over a number of years. Doing the math from that source, we found that the percent change of the systemwide average from the 1999-2000 fiscal year (Bush’s first year in office) through 2006-07 (when he left) really was 48.2 percent. This is the number the Florida Democratic Party is likely using. 1999-2000 2006-07 Percent change $2,170.98 $3,217.65 48.2 percent Source: Florida College Access Network But this is PolitiFact, so you know we found more to the numbers than that. Things get a little complicated because Florida’s fiscal year starts in July, while governors are inaugurated in January. That means there’s some overlap in which a new governor is working with his predecessor’s budget for six months. If we’re really going to compare tuition numbers, we should start with the fiscal year that started before Bush took office in January 1999 to establish the baseline for what tuition was when he began his first term. If we look at it that way, the percent change is even higher. 1998-99 2006-07 Percent change $2,061.75 $3,217.65 56 percent Source: Florida College Access Network We also need to keep in mind that these College Access Network totals are averages for all the universities in the system, with tuition and fees reported together -- a common measurement because fees are mandatory. But to get an accurate count, we have to split tuition and fees, because some fees can vary from school to school. Neither the governor nor the Legislature set fees. That’s up to the Board of Governors (and the Regents before them), which has final say over fee hikes. We asked the Board of Governors for the systemwide tuition rates for the time frame we’re looking at, to see what the actual rate of tuition increases were. They are reported by credit hour, but the rate of change is still easy to calculate: 1998-99 2006-07 Percent change $46.99 per credit hour $73.71 per credit hour 56.9 percent Source: Board of Governors So Bush oversaw a tuition increase of almost 60 percent. Whether that’s a lot in relative terms is a different matter. His campaign pointed out undergraduate students saw an average annual increase of about $145 with a full load of classes. A Bush spokeswoman also said his successors have raised tuition at a higher rate than that, which we’ve dealt with in other fact-checks. We can look at a couple of nationwide measures, again reported in tuition and fees, which can give us a rough idea of how much costs were going up across the country while Bush was in office. The National Center for Education Statistics shows that between 1998-99 and 2006-07, in-state undergraduate tuition at four-year public institutions went up more than 75 percent. The College Board, which uses NCES data in part to come up with its figures, puts that at about 72.7 percent. Florida universities have historically had low in-state undergraduate tuition rates, with the biggest increases passed off on out-of-state residents and graduate students. The College Board’s annual Trends in College Pricing report showed that when Bush left office, public universities in Florida charged the least among all 50 states for in-state, undergraduate tuition. Only Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia averaged less in 2006-07. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said Bush "oversaw average in-state tuition increase of 48.2 percent during his tenure." While not having the power to increase tuition himself, Bush did sign budgets in which the Legislature increased tuition substantially. We came up with 56.9 percent ourselves, counting the strict cost of tuition per hour over the eight years Bush was governor. That hike doesn’t beat estimates of the nationwide average at the time, however, and in-state, undergraduate tuition was still quite a deal compared to other states when Bush left office. The statement is accurate, but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2015-06-30T11:39:26	2015-06-25	['None']
pomt-00855	In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria, "nobody got upset."	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/18/sean-hannity/hannity-unlike-iran-letter-response-no-one-got-ups/	Republicans are accusing Democrats of a double standard when they criticize a letter that 47 GOP senators sent to Iranian leaders. The Democratic criticism charges that the senators, in warning Iran’s leadership against a pending nuclear deal, stepped on President Barack Obama’s responsibility for handling foreign policy. But some Republicans counter that Democrats have taken on similar diplomatic efforts. On his show March 10, 2015, Fox News host Sean Hannity said that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., acted counter to President George W. Bush’s strategy of diplomatically isolating Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, by traveling to Syria in 2007 to open up relations. Pelosi was then the House speaker. Yet this barely caused a ripple at the time, Hannity suggested. "In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria against the Bush administration's wishes, nobody got upset," Hannity said. "But now this is the greatest sin of all times, and they're being called traitors in the New York Daily News on their cover." Hannity was correct to say that Pelosi’s visit with Assad went against Bush administration policy. At the time, the administration had adopted a strategy of diplomatically isolating Syria and not engaging in direct talks with Assad, because of the country’s role in conflicts in Lebanon and Iraq. Pelosi’s office has pushed back against Hannity’s claim that Pelosi’s visit and the Republicans’ letter to Iran are equivalent. But we won’t delve into that question here. Instead, we’re going to look at whether Hannity was correct to say that "nobody got upset." Politicians and staff The reality is that Republicans -- and some others -- at the time said Pelosi went beyond the role of representative and stepped unwelcome into the role of secretary of state. For starters, the Bush administration spoke out publicly against the 2007 trip. Addressing reporters in reference to Pelosi’s trip, Bush himself said, "Sending delegations hasn’t worked," according to the New York Times. "It’s just simply been counterproductive." Vice President Dick Cheney also offered a harsh critique in an interview with radio host Rush Limbaugh. "I'm obviously disappointed," Cheney said. "I think it is, in fact, bad behavior on her part. I wish she hadn't done it, but she is the speaker of the House, and fortunately I think the various parties involved recognize she doesn't speak for the United States in those circumstances. She doesn't represent the administration. The president is the one that conducts foreign policy, not the speaker of the House." On CBS, White House counselor Dan Bartlett said, "We did ask her not to go. We did not believe it would advance the diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. I think most Americans would not think that the leader of the Democratic Party in the Congress should be meeting with the heads of a state sponsor of terror." Media In addition, both mainstream and the conservative media criticized Pelosi for the trip -- covering the back-and-forth extensively on the editorial pages, nightly shows and the Sunday political talk shows. Here are a few examples: • The Washington Post editorial board: "The really striking development here is the attempt by a Democratic congressional leader to substitute her own foreign policy for that of a sitting Republican president…. Ms. Pelosi's attempt to establish a shadow presidency is not only counterproductive, it is foolish." • The Wall Street Journal editorial board: "What was Ms. Pelosi hoping to accomplish other than embarrassing President Bush? With her trip, Ms. Pelosi has now reassured the Syrian strongman that Mr. Bush lacks the domestic support to impose any further pressure on his country." • Former Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan: The trip was a "thumb in the eye of the president of the United States, and it does send a mixed message." • Former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., in an interview with Hannity: "I don't understand why, as speaker of the House, she would be going to see a dictator in Damascus when the White House has publicly asked her not to go there." • Then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.: "I believe her visit to Syria was a mistake, that it was bad for the United States of America and good for the Syrians." Hannity himself Hannity, one of the most popular hosts at the cable news network with the highest ratings, also addressed the trip on several occasions. On his show April 5, 2007, Hannity said Pelosi’s intention by taking the trip was to embarrass Bush. Two days later, Hannity called Pelosi the "Diva of Damascus" who was "conducting her own foreign policy" that was "dangerous for America." And on April 12, 2007, he accused Pelosi of "making friends with America’s enemies." "Why is the San Francisco liberal willing to compromise with radicals and apparently not the president?" he said. Through a spokeswoman, Hannity told PolitiFact that he was specifically referring to comments made in support of Pelosi’s trip by Obama and Hillary Clinton, then both serving in the Senate. Hannity does have a point that Clinton (and some other Democrats, as noted by The Daily Show) did support Pelosi’s trip yet have spoken out against the Iran letter. For instance, in 2007, future Secretary of State Clinton said, "I applaud Speaker Pelosi. I have long advocated engagement with countries in the region, including Iran and Syria. By contrast, Clinton said of the Iran letter, "Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the Iranians or harmful to the commander-in-chief." For a reminder that nothing is ever entirely new in politics, check out this passage from an April 2007 New York Times article about Pelosi’s Syria trip: "Democrats say the complaints have a certain political expediency to them, and note that many of the same people criticizing Ms. Pelosi’s decision to delve into foreign policy were fine when Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker of the House, made his own foray into foreign policy back in 1997." Our ruling Hannity said that in 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria, "nobody got upset." In reality, many politicians, pundits and editorial boards spoke out against Pelosi’s trip, including Bush and Cheney. Hannity told PolitiFact that he was referring specifically to comments made in support of Pelosi’s trip by Obama and Hillary Clinton. However, that point would not have been obvious to viewers watching the show. Rating Hannity on what he actually said on television, we find his claim False.

pomt-11062	"Fact: Over 90,000 kids were detained under Obama. And no one cared."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/25/brad-parscale/tyes-immigrant-children-detained-under-obama-they-/	As President Donald Trump faced criticism from the left and right for his administration’s policy leading to separation of undocumented immigrant children from parents, conservatives fired back by arguing that President Barack Obama also detained children. "Fact: Over 90,000 kids were detained under Obama. And no one cared," tweeted Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale June 20. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in April the Trump administration would refer all people caught crossing the border illegally for prosecution, including adults traveling with children. As a result of that zero-tolerance policy, officials said about 2,300 children had been separated from their parents at the border between May 5 and June 9. In response to the political backlash, Trump signed an executive order June 20 stating the administration will temporarily keep families together pending proceedings. We found multiple claims on social media and on conservative websites stating that 90,000 children were detained under Obama, so we decided to fact-check the figure. Parscale also tweeted a Daily Caller article that included photos taken during a media tour of detention facilities in Texas and Arizona in 2014. These images show immigrants in caged-in facilities and sleeping on floors. (In May, Trump correctly tweeted that Democrats had mistakenly tweeted 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the border in steel cages.) Parscale declined to comment on the record. Child immigrants during Obama’s tenure Parscale appears to be referring to unaccompanied minors fleeing gang violence and poverty in Central America during Obama’s tenure. Those unaccompanied minors who crossed the border without parents are a different group from the children separated from their parents at the border in recent months. A report to the U.S. Senate in 2016 stated that since the beginning of fiscal year 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services had placed almost 90,000 unaccompanied minors with sponsors in the United States. Under the terms of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Act, unaccompanied minors from countries other than Canada and Mexico were transferred from Border Patrol to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, by law within 72 hours, said David Fitzgerald, co-director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at University of California San Diego. These minors were detained in a jail-like setting until they could be placed with a parent, family member, or other sponsor living in the U.S. They stayed with those caregivers until the end of their immigration proceedings, which would decide whether they could stay permanently or be deported. Under Obama, most of these detentions were short-term before the unaccompanied minors were released to a caregiver. There isn’t a clean answer for average detention time, but in federal filings in the Flores settlement case, the government said that for residents booked into family residential facilities during a stretch between October 2015 and May 2016 the average length of stay was 11.8 days. (The Flores settlement was a January 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department. The agreement determined immigrant children must be held in the "least restrictive setting.") During Obama’s tenure, it was possible for undocumented children to be separated from a parent once they were already in the country if their parents ultimately got deported. While some children were separated from their parents under Obama, this was relatively rare, and occurred at a far lower rate than under Trump. 'No one cared' Parscale said that "no one cared" about child detentions under Obama. But family detention under Obama was highly controversial. The majority of the Senate Democratic caucus -- 33 senators -- along with 178 House Democrats sent a letter in June 2015 to the Homeland Security Secretary urging an end to family detention. "The prolonged detention of asylum-seeking mothers and children who pose no flight risk or danger to the community is unacceptable and goes against our most fundamental values," they wrote. The UN Refugee Agency filed an amicus brief in litigation against the detention of minors. Several rights organizations including the ACLU filed briefs in the July 2016 case in which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Flores settlement applies to all children, whether accompanied or unaccompanied by their parents. Our ruling Parscale tweeted, "Fact: Over 90,000 kids were detained under Obama. And no one cared." The 90,000 children refers to the unaccompanied minors from Central America during Obama’s tenure. Children were detained by the federal government until they could be released to a parent or other caregiver in the U.S. However, Parscale omits that this group of children detained is a different situation from the recent Trump administration policy. The 90,000 refers to minors who crossed the border without any parents during Obama’s tenure. Those unaccompanied minors were detained until they were placed with a caregiver. The Trump administration policy separated children from their parents when they crossed the border. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-11593	"We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/donald-trump/trump-exaggerates-energy-exports/	President Donald Trump put himself on the side of average Americans in his effort to reduce government regulations, particularly on energy. "We have ended the war on American Energy and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal," Trump said. "We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world." There are different ways to understand the claim that America is "now ... an exporter of energy." One way to read Trump’s statement is that the United States only recently began to export energy. This is flat wrong. "We have been exporting coal, natural gas, electricity, refined products and energy technologies for a very long time," Paul Sullivan, a professor at National Defense University, told us in August. "Liquefied natural gas exports from Alaska to Japan have been around for a long time." Trump might have meant that the United States had only recently become a net exporter of energy — meaning the total of all U.S. energy exports recently overtook the total of all U.S. energy imports. That’s also inaccurate. "This has been falling, but we are still a huge net energy importer," Jason Bordoff, who directs Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told us. In its most recent projections, the federal Energy Information Administration concluded that the United States would become a net energy exporter around 2026, depending on the course of future patterns of global supply, demand and pricing. The United States has been a net coal exporter for many years. It has been a net exporter of refined petroleum products since around 2011. So neither of those would make Trump correct. Natural gas has done better. In the Energy Information Administration's January 2018 shorter-term energy outlook, it reported that "in 2017, the United States was a net exporter of natural gas for the first time on an annual basis since 1957." We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said, "We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world." The United States has been exporting different forms of energy for many years. It has been a net exporter of coal and refined petroleum products, a fact that predates Trump. The one new development is natural gas. For the first time since 1957, the United States became a net exporter in 2017. Overall though, it is a net energy importer, a situation that’s not expected to change until midway through the next decade. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-09965	Democrats in Congress "had control since January of 2007. They haven't passed a law making waterboarding illegal. They haven't gone into any of these things and changed law."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/13/newt-gingrich/gingrich-wrong-democrats-and-waterboarding/	Under pressure of a lawsuit, the Obama administration recently released memos on the interrogation of terror suspects during the Bush administration. The memos detailed techniques that included waterboarding, a simulated drowning maneuver widely considered to be torture. Some torture opponents have called for the prosecution of Bush administration officials. Republicans, meanwhile, are firing back at Democrats in Congress, saying that they implicitly condoned the actions. Democrats "had control since January of 2007," former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in a television interview. "They haven't passed a law making waterboarding illegal. They haven't gone into any of these things and changed law." There is a grain of truth in his claim, but he conveniently ignores the actions of the Democratic Congress. Democrats did pass legislation in 2008 that would have had the effect of outlawing waterboarding by restricting U.S. agents to interrogation methods outlined in the Army Field Manual. The manual specifically forbids waterboarding. But President George W. Bush vetoed the bill and Democrats were not able to muster the two-thirds majority necessary to override the veto. This was a big issue during the 2008 presidential campaign, because Sen. John McCain opposed the bill, even though he had said waterboarding is torture. At the time, McCain said he wasn't comfortable restricting intelligence personnel to the Army Field Manual. It's worth noting that some elected officials do not believe that Congress needed to pass a law saying that waterboarding was illegal. McCain, for example, said in 2007 that waterboarding already was illegal. "It's in violation of the Geneva Conventions. It's in violation of existing law," he said at a debate in St. Petersburg. After the Bush administration memos were released, McCain said the legal reasoning behind them was "deeply flawed," though he did not call for prosecutions. So Democrats did try to change laws to end waterboarding after gaining control of Congress and initially passed the law. But they were stopped by a presidential veto. So Gingrich's statement that they " haven't passed a law making waterboarding illegal. They haven't gone into any of these things and changed law," is only true because of the veto. The Democrats certainly tried to pass a law that would have had the effect of outlawing waterboarding. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06402	Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to freeze pay for state employees includes a 5.4 percent raise for himself.	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/28/blog-posting/bloggers-say-gov-scott-walker-taking-pay-raise-whi/	The reaction to Gov. Scott Walker’s state employee pay plan, which calls for no pay raises for state workers for the next two years, fell along party lines. Republicans said it was a measure of continued tough economic times and tight budgets. Democrats and union leaders complained the pay freeze came on the heels of legislation passed by Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature that requires state workers to pay more for the health insurance and pensions. Some left-wing bloggers found even more reason for outrage. They said that while the average state worker was being hit again, others -- including Walker -- weren’t sharing the pain. Of course, Walker is the guy who as Milwaukee County executive liked to tout the fact he was giving back some of his salary. And as governor likes to note he’s so frugal he brings a brown bag lunch to work. Nothing stirs up bloggers quite like the smell of hypocrisy in the morning. The Cognitive Dissidence blog said this: "It is noted that Walker is giving himself a $7,500 raise. Not only is he being overly generous to himself, but he is also lavishing the love on some of his top henchmen like Becky Kleefisch, J.B. Van Hollen and Mike Huebsch." Another blog, Uppity Wisconsin, made a similar claim, saying Walker "clearly thinks the hard-working, ultra-efficient, super-effective guy who's Wisconsin governor (that would be him, as defined by him) deserves a significant pay raise -- a 5.4 percent raise." There were more examples, as the claim was picked up by other bloggers. Some reporters even contacted the governor’s office to ask about the issue. Residents called the governor’s office to register their complaints. And we received numerous emails -- from both sides -- urging us to sort it out. So did the governor’s compensation plan -- scheduled to take effect in January -- pad his own salary? Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the state’s largest employee’s union was to blame for spreading the misinformation. Marty Beil, executive director of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, AFSCME Council 24, issued a news release Oct. 28, 2011 that criticized Walker for taking a higher salary than his predecessor -- but that was after the blog posts and the initial outrage. So we’ll focus on the bloggers’ pay raise claims. The bloggers all cite this 184-page document which outlines Walker’s overall compensation plan for state workers. It includes a chart (page 67) showing the salaries for the state’s constitutional officers, such as state treasurer, secretary of state, attorney general and, of course, governor. For each, an "incumbent’s salary" as of July 5, 2009, is shown, with a line through it and another line shows the new pay rate as of Jan. 1, 2012. In the case of the governor, the salary of $137,092 is shown with a line through it. The salary to take effect next year is listed as $144,423. A raise, right? That’s how the bloggers interpreted the chart. But that’s not how pay for elected officials is set. The state constitution bars elected officials from increasing their own pay. That’s why changes are set before elections and always take effect in the future, when the new officials are in place. So, Walker’s pay was determined before Walker ever took office, according to state Legislative Reference Bureau. Indeed, the higher salaries were proposed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration and approved by state lawmakers back in 2008. Under that measure, Walker is already being paid $144,423 and that salary will remain in effect -- with no change -- during the four-year term. The other constitutional officers will also receive flat pay. So what of the chart that the bloggers referenced? "We’ve been getting a lot of confusion on this," said Tim Lundquist, a communications officer for the state Department of Administration, who pointed to the Office of State Employment Relations. "The OSER people say this is the way it has to be drafted,’" Lundquist said. Greg Gracz, head of the employment relations office, tried to clarify matters with a memo Oct. 27 that said: "No increases for rates for office for constitutional officers are proposed." But his attempt with a chart to clear up the matter is equally misleading -- and incorrect. That new chart shows the governor’s pay under a column titled "effective July 5, 2009" as $144,423. It shows the same pay under another column, effective Jan. 1, 2012. That suggests to the average reader (or blogger) that Gov. Jim Doyle was paid that amount. He wasn’t. The pay raise took effect when Walker took office. Our conclusion Bloggers dug into the pay plan proposed by Walker and found what sure looked like the ultimate hypocrisy: the governor giving himself a raise while freezing state workers pay for two years. The document they cited makes it look like there’s a raise coming, but there is not. Elected officials cannot increase their own pay. A quick look at the Blue Book or a phone call to the Legislative Reference Bureau would have told them that. So there’s no pay raise for Walker, or the lieutenant governor, state treasurer, secretary of state, and attorney general. Although the confusion is understandable because of a sloppy and confusing state compensation document (and an equally poor followup memo), it muddles things for residents. Here’s the clearest answer possible: The claim is False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2011-10-28T14:58:53	2011-10-26	['None']
pomt-08567	Says Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands.	/florida/statements/2010/sep/28/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-calls-opponent-taliban-daniel-webster/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson -- the man who described the Republican Party's health care plan as "die quickly" and who later equated the health care system to an American holocaust, who suggested former vice president Dick Cheney was a vampire who could turn into a bat and fly away at a moment's notice, and who said putting Republicans in charge of government was akin to making members of al-Qaida pilots -- is making another series of eye-catching claims. Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? "Taliban Dan Webster." (We guess we should note in fairness that the ad starts out pleasantly enough -- with Grayson's disclaimer saying he approved of the message and a picture of him smiling and holding two of his children). The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript: Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) "Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida." Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) "Wives submit yourself to your own husband." Female narrator: "Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us." Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL. Webster: "You should submit to me. That's in the Bible." Female narrator: "Webster tried to deny battered women medical care and the right to divorce their abusers." Webster: "Submit to me." Female narrator: "He wants to force raped women to bear the child." Webster: "Submit to me." Female narrator: "Taliban Daniel Webster. Hands off our bodies. And our laws." The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers and produced rebukes from Webster's wife, Sandy Webster, and Webster campaign manager Brian Graham. "Alan Grayson's latest attack on my husband is shameful," Sandy Webster said in statement. "Mr. Grayson seems to have a problem telling the truth and no problem misleading the public. Dan has been an amazing husband and father and the finest man I have ever known. Mr. Grayson should be ashamed of his nasty smears against my husband." We decided to immediately check to see if Grayson is correctly quoting Webster, and we will fact-check the other claims in another report to be posted quickly. Grayson spokesman Sam Drzymala said the audio and video of Webster come from a speech he made for the Institute in Basic Life Principles, which Drzymala described as a "right-wing cult." The Institute in Basic Life Principles describes itself as a Christian teaching organization that provides training and instruction on how to find success by following God’s principles found in Scripture. Some of its specific teachings are controversial. Among them, the Institute teaches that a mother violates Scripture when she works outside the home, that married couples are to abstain from sex 40 days after the birth of a son, 80 days after the birth of a daughter and the evening prior to worship, and that people should avoid rock and even contemporary Christian music because it can be addictive. Webster has been involved with the group for nearly 30 years and continues to participate in training and also speaks at seminars. In a 2003 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, Webster said he home-schooled his six children on Institute curricula and said the group's teachings have had a major influence on his life. One of those Institute beliefs describes the complementary roles of a husband and wife. "The man provides servant leadership and the woman responds with reverent submission and assistance," according to the group's website, which goes on to quote Ephesians 5:22–33 -- Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. . . . Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it . . . . Let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. According to the Institute, a wife is never supposed to "take over," writing that "in response to pressures within the family or within a marital relationship, a foolish wife will take matters into her own hands." A wife also is to "stay beautiful for her husband." "Resistance or indifference to your husband’s need for physical intimacy is the unspoken crushing of his spirit," the Institute says on its website. In other places on the website, the Institute talks about a wife's need to submit to a husband's spiritual leadership. In his 2003 interview with the Times, Webster declined to discuss specific teachings and whether he disagreed with any of them. "I believe what I believe," he said in the 2003 interview. "It has not affected the way I've served. I don't think anyone can tell you that I've forced my beliefs on anyone else." Bill Gothard, founder and president of the Institute, said the image and video of Webster was taken from a talk to fathers at the group's 2009 Advanced Training Institute Conference in Nashville. The Advanced Training Institute is a home-education curriculum provided by the Institute in Basic Life Principles. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Gothard said the quote is severely distorted and manipulated. "It couldn't be any more starkly misused," Gothard said. "That gets my adrenaline up. A man who stoops to that level should not be in any office." Gothard said Webster was leading a talk to a group of fathers and was discussing prayers they should say. Webster's point was that they shouldn't pray for their wives to do something, rather they should pray for what they could control in their own life. "I am stunned how he could have taken what Daniel said, and turned it around to say the opposite of what Daniel was saying," Gothard said. PolitiFact Florida asked for, and received, a video with Webster's extended comments. The video confirms Gothard's recollection of the 2009 speech. "Have verses for (your) wife. I have verses for my wife," Webster said in an unedited excerpt provided by the Institute. "Don't pick the ones that say, 'she should submit to me.' That's in the Bible, but pick the ones you're supposed to do (laughs). So instead (laughs) that you'd love your wife -- even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it ... and, as opposed to wives submit yourself to your own husband. She can pray that if she wants to, but don't you pray it." Webster goes on to make the same point about praying for children. "Pick out the ones that have your responsibility listed into it," Webster said. "Yes, children are to obey their parents, but more importantly we're as fathers to, um, not provoke them to wrath." So in his message Webster was telling fathers that they should not pray for the first half of the passage in Ephesians (Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands) but pray for the second (Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it). The Grayson ad clearly suggests that Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands, and the repeated refrain of "Submit to me," is an effort to scare off potential female voters. But the lines in the video are clearly taken out of context thanks to some heavy-handed editing. The actual point of Webster's 2009 speech was that husbands should love their wives. Maybe Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands. But there's no evidence in this ad, especially Webster's own words, to support that allegation. We rate Grayson's claim False.

pomt-14274	Say Bernie Sanders "won Nevada after all."	/nevada/statements/2016/apr/07/blog-posting/no-bernie-sanders-didnt-retroactively-win-nevada/	Hillary Clinton was declared the winner of Nevada’s presidential caucuses back in February, but some supporters of Bernie Sanders are claiming the Vermont senator might have won the state after all. The pronouncement came after Sanders delegates ended up outnumbering Clinton’s during the hectic Clark County Democratic Convention on April 2, leading many media outlets and supporters to declare that Sanders retroactively "won" the state by outmaneuvering Clinton. So, did Sanders add another state to his column as many have claimed? The answer is no, and it likely will remain that way. We’ll tell you why. Caucus math Nevada has a total of 43 delegates it sends to the Democratic National Convention in July. Eight of those are so-called "superdelegates," made up of elected officials like Sen. Harry Reid and other party powerhouses who get to independently decide which candidate to support. (Four currently support Clinton, one supports Sanders and three are neutral so far.) Of the remaining 35 delegates, 23 are so-called "district-level delegates" who are allocated based on February caucus results in each of the state’s four congressional districts. Clinton won 13 of those, while Sanders won 10. The remaining 12 are doled out during the state party convention in May. Of that 12, there are five pledged "party leader and elected official" delegates and seven "at-large" delegates awarded proportionally, so whichever campaign has a majority of supporters at the state convention will win the odd-numbered delegate from those groups. Ideally, the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll — smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process, but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus. Initial estimates from February had Clinton winning 20 delegates and Sanders taking 15. But that didn’t happen at the Clark County (Las Vegas) convention in early April, as the Sanders campaign had 2,964 delegates show up compared to 2,386 for Clinton. In February, Clinton won a total of 4,889 delegates in Clark County but less than half of those showed up for the county convention. Accusations flew from both campaigns about questionable practices before, during and after the county convention, with the Sanders campaign claiming party officials tried to "depose a neutral official," and Clinton surrogates like Nevada state director Michelle White upset with a "number of irregularities" in the convention process. Leaving those accusations aside for the moment, the practical outcome is that Sanders now has a larger number of delegates (2,124) attending the state convention in May than Clinton (1,722). That means they’ll be in a position to pick off a few of those remaining 12 convention delegates. Based on the numbers, it’s likely that Sanders will be able to flip delegates and go from a projected 20-15 deficit to a more narrow 18-17 delegate split. (This count doesn’t factor in the superdelegates, who are also tilted toward Clinton.) For Sanders, that’s not "winning" Nevada. Longtime Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston and the Associated Press reported in the immediate aftermath of the county convention that the likely final result remains a Clinton victory. "Clinton’s widely expected to keep her Nevada win except in the unlikely event of a Sanders blowout at the state level or if Clinton-backing superdelegates defect to the Sanders camp," the AP reported. Our ruling Several reports claimed that Bernie Sanders retroactively won Nevada’s presidential caucuses, based on higher-than-expected turnout at a major county convention. Sanders likely swung two delegates his way after the county convention, but we won’t know for sure until the state convention selects the delegates in May. Either way, Clinton still holds a narrow delegate lead, projections show. That lead is larger if you include the support of Nevada’s so-called "super-delegates." We rate this claim False.

pomt-01541	"Income inequality is worse in towns run by Democrat mayors than in towns run by Republican mayors."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-income-inequality-worse-cities-demo/	During a recent interview with NPR, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the belief -- widely held among Democrats -- that Republican policies are encouraging greater income inequality. "I think inequality can be a problem, and interestingly seems to be getting a little bit worse under this administration," Paul said. "Income inequality is worse in towns run by Democrat mayors than in towns run by Republican mayors." (Here’s the full transcript.) A reader asked us to check whether Paul’s claim about cities under Democratic and Republican mayors is correct. So we did. We located a study by the Brookings Institution released earlier this year that ranked the top 10 and bottom 10 cities by income inequality -- and there does appear to be something to what Paul said. Of the study’s 10 most unequal cities, nine have Democratic mayors. They are Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, New York, Oakland, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore. Of the 10 most unequal cities, only Miami has a Republican mayor. By contrast, seven of the 10 most equal cities have Republican mayors -- Oklahoma City; Omaha, Neb.; Fort Worth, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Mesa, Ariz.; Arlington, Texas; and Virginia Beach, Va. The other three either have a nonpartisan mayor (Raleigh, N.C., and Las Vegas) or a Democrat (Wichita, Kan.). So on the numbers, Paul has a point. The question is, does this discovery mean anything? Experts we spoke to urged taking the claim with a grain of salt -- if not a whole shaker. Here are a few reasons why. Mayors aren’t all-powerful players in the local economy. Where claims of this sort are made, PolitiFact tries to establish whether credit or blame is deserved. In this case, then, is it reasonable to attribute patterns of inequality exclusively, or even primarily, to a mayor? No -- many factors play into a city’s economic success. The mayor of Detroit doesn’t have much power over the international market for automobiles, and no mayor of New York can take all the credit for the economic juggernaut of Wall Street. While mayoral policies may have an effect on the margins, such factors as the state and national business cycle, broad demographic patterns and international business trends tend to have a much greater impact on economic inequality in cities. In addition, it’s worth remembering that "cities attract people on the basis of many factors, of which the party of their political leaders is probably a minor one," said William Frey, a senior fellow in Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program. Inequality patterns in cities may be at least as much about population size and geographic patterns as they are about partisan leadership. Focusing on the partisan differences obscures a more fundamental difference between the most and least unequal cities. The more unequal cities tend to be very big, and the less unequal cities tend to be more modestly sized. The median population of the 10 most unequal cities on the Brookings list is about 630,000, compared to about 430,000 for the most equal cities. (If you used the mean, rather than the median, the average population of the 10 most unequal cities would be even higher -- almost 1.9 million residents per city.) So it’s not exactly apples-to-apples if you compare the attributes of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago on the one hand with those of Colorado Springs, Virginia Beach and Arlington on the other. All other things being equal, larger cities tend to have a wider distribution of incomes on both extremes, since they have more residents. That, almost by definition, means larger ratios between the top and the bottom. In the meantime, big cities tend to attract more wealthy people -- i.e., people who can choose to live anywhere they want -- because megacities are likelier to have world-class amenities. "The real wealth ‘peaks’ tend to be in the big cities, so they have high tops as well as lower bottoms, while the income profiles of smaller localities are typically more ‘compressed,’ " said Jamie Peck, a professor of geography at the University of British Columbia who has studied urban and political patterns in the United States. How old a city is can matter, too, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist and vice president of analytics at the real estate website Trulia. In older cities many middle-income residents have relocated to the suburbs, leaving behind higher levels of inequality. By contrast, newer cities -- such as Mesa (which is near Phoenix) or Arlington (which is near Dallas) -- often contain many suburban areas or are, in effect, suburbs themselves, Kolko said. Such cities tend to have more modest income ranges. Why does all this matter? It undercuts the notion that partisan leadership has much to do with why certain cities become relatively unequal and certain become relatively equal. Causation may actually run the opposite way. It’s always important to remember that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. In this context, it’s not necessarily that Republican leadership creates greater equality, as Paul’s comment presumes. Rather, it could be that greater equality prompts people to vote Republican. Or it could be unrelated. "I think it runs more in the direction that inequality provides conditions for Democratic success, rather than Democrats causing inequality," said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who specializes in electoral patterns and geography. And any explanation other than political leadership causing greater equality weakens Paul’s point. The pattern holds only if you look at cities, not metropolitan areas. If you look at Kolko’s research -- which studied inequality in broader metropolitan areas, rather than in cities per se -- Paul’s pattern falls apart. Of the 10 metropolitan areas with the most equality, only one has a Republican mayor -- Colorado Springs. The other nine either have a Democratic mayor, a nonpartisan one, or no mayor at all because they’re an unincorporated area. This list includes Lakeland-Winter Haven, Fla.; Allentown, Pa.; Salt Lake City; Bethesda-Rockville-Frederick, Md., Tacoma, Wash.; Las Vegas; Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla.; Raleigh; and Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, Fla. What Paul’s office says Brian Darling, a spokesman for Paul, cautioned that the senator was not simply casting aspersions on Democratic mayors’ handling of their cities’ economies. "What he was saying is that Democrats are not solving the problem," Darling said. "It may be an unsolvable problem. Democrats love to talk about the issue and have been allowed to position themselves as the warriors for those harmed by income inequality, yet they are not a party of action" on this issue. That’s a reasonable point, but we think a typical listener hearing Paul’s comment would have assumed that he was arguing that Republican policies have promoted greater equality in cities than Democratic policies have. And as we’ve found, that’s far from clearcut. Our ruling Paul said that "income inequality is worse in towns run by Democrat mayors than in towns run by Republican mayors." He has a point that one credible study shows a fairly strong correlation between low inequality and a Republican mayor. But experts say it’s a stretch to draw conclusions from this. The claim inflates the actual powers of mayors to shape inequality in their cities and it ignores the role of population size and suburbanization in driving inequality. It also glosses over the fact that metropolitan areas, as opposed to cities, show no such relationship. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-11557	"Violent crime in Puerto Rico is on the rise as nearly one-third of the island remains without power."	/florida/statements/2018/feb/07/bill-nelson/fact-checking-statistics-about-puerto-ricos-storm-/	Florida Sen. Bill Nelson is calling on the federal government to help Puerto Rico address the fallout from Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that hit the island more than four months ago. Nelson, a Democrat seeking re-election this year, and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Feb. 1, encouraging federal justice officials to "engage with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to best determine how federal law enforcement can assist the territory in these trying times." The letter comes in the middle of reports of increased crime in Puerto Rico, which Nelson emphasized in a tweet accompanying news reports about the letter. "Violent crime in Puerto Rico is on the rise as nearly one-third of the island remains without power," Nelson tweeted Feb. 2. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered if Nelson’s statistics about Puerto Rico’s storm recovery were accurate. Let’s take a look. Nelson’s communication director Ryan Brown said the claim was in reference to recent news reports about an uptick in killings in January 2018. "If you look at Nelson and Rubio’s letter, they clearly discuss the murder rate when discussing the increase in violent crime," he said. "But they also clearly cite recent media reports." Take for example the Associated Press article from Feb. 1. "One of Puerto Rico’s deadliest months in recent years has closed, with 78 killings reported in January as the U.S. territory struggles with a surge in violent crime and growing discontent among thousands of police officers," it reads. That's almost a 35 percent increase from the previous year at the same time. There were 58 recorded killings in January 2017, according to statistics from Gobierno de Puerto Rico Policia. In addition, the AP reported that Puerto Rico normally sees an average of 56 homicides a month in the last two years. The AP reported that the uptick in killings came after increased dissatisfaction among thousands of police officers. In late December, police officers began calling in sick after the government fell behind on repaying millions of dollars worth of overtime following Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Nelson has a point about a recent uptick in killings, but Nelson said "violent crime," which includes other crimes such as sexual assault, robberies and aggravated assault. The most recent data for violent crime we could find was from Gobierno de Puerto Rico Policia. The report compared the month of January 2017 to the month of January 2018 and showed that violent crime dropped 12 percent, from 716 incidents in January 2017, to 630 incidents in January of 2018. But, comparing violent crime from one point in 2017 to the same point in 2018 is not an apple-to-apples comparison, experts said. Here's why: Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fled the island after Hurricane Maria. It's hard to say exactly how many Puerto Ricans have left. University of Florida economists estimate the post-Maria moves to Florida are around 50,000 as of Jan. 6, according to an Orlando Sentinel article. Secondly, criminologists and experts familiar with the situation in Puerto Rico said it’s possible that the number of recently reported violent crimes (outside of homicides and murders), might be an undercount. "Homicides are reliably measured, but the measurement of other violent crimes depends on reports by the victim or someone else to the police," said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. Part of the reason it’s difficult to track violent crime outside of murders, has to do with the lack of power and resources on the island. Like Nelson accurately said, nearly one-third of the island remains without power. On Feb. 2, the acting executive director of the Electric Power Authority Justo L. González Torres announced that a little more than one million or 70.92 percent electric customers in Puerto Rico have power. That leaves about 450,000 customers (roughly one-third) without power. Our ruling Nelson said that "violent crime in Puerto Rico is on the rise as nearly one-third of the island remains without power." Nelson is accurately citing the percentage of Puerto Rico power customers still without power, but his claim about violent crime requires some context. Nelson is referring to a recent uptick in killings in January of this year, not overall violent crime. The most recent estimate we could find shows that violent crime has actually dropped 12 percent in January compared with same point last year. Still, that doesn’t mean Nelson is wrong. Experts said the uptick in killings is significant, and that the crisis in Puerto Rico has more than likely reduced crime reporting by victims and perhaps also the recording of crime reports by the police, so the official statistics might be undercounting the number of violent crime incidents. With everything considered, we rate this claim Half True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2018-02-07T10:36:54	2018-02-02	['Puerto_Rico']
pomt-09023	“The insurance commissioner can’t do squat about health care.”	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/08/ralph-hudgens/insurance-commissioner-candidate-hudgens-says-offi/	Candidates in the Republican primary for insurance commissioner are in a snit over “squat.” The tiff began June 22, when one hopeful for the office, state Sen. Ralph Hudgens of Hull, was a guest on "The Martha Zoller Show." The radio talk show is broadcast by Gainesville-area WXKT-FM and through a video feed on the Internet. Zoller and Hudgens discussed the race, which for many has become a contest over which candidate can stop provisions of the massive federal health care bill passed in March from taking effect in Georgia. Bashing the bill, which is unpopular among Republicans, is a favorite tactic for candidates wooing conservative voters. Hudgens criticized the rhetoric, arguing that the insurance commissioner's power over federal health legislation is limited. The show went to break. Hudgens and Zoller chatted off-air. Unknown to Hudgens, the Internet feed streamed on. So while radio listeners heard commercials, Web viewers heard Hudgens in a moment of what he thought was off-the-air candor: “The insurance commissioner can’t do squat about health care,” Hudgens told Zoller. But is that the case? Response to Hudgens was swift. The Twitter account of Republican opponent Maria Sheffield, a favorite with the tea party movement, fired off a post: "Seriously, Ralph?" it read. "GA needs a conservative to stop Obama -- I will." Hudgens was unfazed. He publicly embraced the gaffe. In an interview with PolitiFact Georgia, he said voters need to understand the limits of the insurance commissioner's power over federal health legislation. No recording of Hudgens' statement is available, but he said he was trying to make the point that the insurance commissioner's power to keep the new federal health legislation from taking effect in this state is limited. Zoller confirmed with PolitiFact Georgia that this is what he meant. Hudgens' argument goes like this: The post of insurance commissioner is an administrative office. It cannot set public policy, tax or pass legislation. It can't sue in federal court to have the law struck down. It therefore cannot block the federal health care law from taking effect in this state. The insurance commissioner can influence how the health care overhaul takes shape in Georgia by creating regulations and making other decisions about how the federal bill will be implemented in Georgia, Hudgens said. For instance, in April, current insurance commissioner and Republican gubernatorial candidate John Oxendine decided that the state will opt out of becoming involved in the creation of a state "high-risk" pool for people with pre-existing conditions. "As far as fighting Obamacare, I'll say it again. He [the insurance commissioner] can't do squat," Hudgens said. Experts said that because thousands of pages of rules and regulations that outline how the bill will be implemented have yet to be written, much of what an insurance commissioner can do has yet to be established. But the consensus is clear: What an insurance commissioner can do to block federal health care law is limited. Sandy Praeger is commissioner of the Kansas Insurance Department and chairwoman of the Health Insurance and Managed Care Committee for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Federal officials are consulting with the group as they write health insurance regulations. "It is the law of the land. I think we have to obey the law," Praeger said of the health legislation. "But there are ways to comply with the letter of the law and not the law's spirit." Praeger and others pointed out two major provisions of the federal health care bill over which the state has significant say: high-risk pools and health insurance exchanges. High-risk pools are designed to help people with pre-existing conditions get coverage until Jan. 1 2014, when broader insurance provisions go into effect. A state may contract with the federal government to set up the pool itself or opt out as Georgia did. Still, state residents will be able to get insurance from a high-risk pool, said Glenn Allen, a spokesman for the state Insurance Commissioner's Office. "This decision does not mean that Georgia citizens will not have access to a high-risk health pool, they will; but the federal government and not the state of Georgia will bear the financial risk," Allen said in an e-mail. The federal government will put a pool in place that Georgians can use, Allen said. So even though Georgia has chosen not to be involved, high-risk pools will be created. The same goes for health insurance exchanges. They were created to make the pricing of policies easier to understand. Initially, individuals buying insurance on their own and smaller employers will be the primary participants. If the federal government decides that a state won't have an operational exchange by Jan. 1, 2014, or that what it has is not up to snuff, the U.S. secretary of health and human services will create one or contract with a nonprofit that will. Bill Custer, an expert on health policy and director of Georgia State University's Center for Health Services Research, said the state has an important but limited role in such exchanges: "[T]he law specifically gives the states a great deal of flexibility in the design of the exchanges and the regulatory authority over health insurance. It also states that if the states decline to act the Feds will." Even Hudgens' opponent Sheffield acknowledged the limits of the insurance commissioner's power. "As insurance commissioner you can't stop it [the federal health care law] from happening and you can't override that," Sheffield told PolitiFact Georgia. Hudgens' overall point was accurate. There's little dispute that while the insurance commissioner can shape how the federal legislation is enacted in Georgia, he cannot stop it from going into effect. The problem is that Hudgens overstated his position. He used the word "squat," as in "diddly squat." Bupkis. Nada. Nothing. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but Hudgens still earns a Mostly True.

pomt-00318	Says Tony Evers "wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/21/scott-walker/tony-evers-supports-cutting-prison-population-50-r/	A week before the primary vote, when Republican Gov. Scott Walker didn’t know which opponent he would face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election, he tweeted this claim: "A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%" and "that would require the release of thousands of violent felons." Our rating was Half True. There was no evidence to back up the "require" part of Walker’s claim, particularly if a 50 percent reduction were done over a period of years, rather than swiftly. A new, similar Walker attack — zeroing in on Tony Evers — has a similar problem. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. The new claim On Sept. 12, 2018, a month after Evers, the state schools superintendent, emerged from the primary as the Democratic nominee, Walker elevated his attack to a television ad. The governor’s spot begins with a narrator portraying Evers as putting the public at risk, saying he "failed to remove abusive teachers from our schools." Then the narrator asserts that Evers "wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities." Walker’s use of the word today aims to avoid the problem that the word require caused in his previous fact check. That is, a 50 percent reduction "today" — rather than say, over a period of years — would require the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. There are currently about 23,000 inmates, two-thirds of whom have committed a violent offense, according to the state Department of Corrections. That two-thirds portion includes inmates being held for a violent-crime conviction; and it includes those who served their time behind bars for that original offense, but were returned to prison for violating conditions of probation or extended supervision that was also part of the sentence for the original offense. Violent offenses include crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, as well as crimes such as assault, extortion and hit-and-run with bodily injury. But Evers has not put a time frame on how he would achieve a 50 percent reduction. And it’s important to keep in mind that releasing half the inmates who are in prison isn’t the only way to cut the prison population in half. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Evers’ plan On the day Walker’s TV ad was released, Evers reacted by telling reporters: "That’s a lie. I never said that. We will not release violent criminals. We’re not going to get in the gutter with Scott Walker." (Walker has also made a claim similar to the one in his TV ad in a private telephone poll of voters done by his campaign.) To back the first part of Walker’s claim — that Evers supports a 50 percent cut -- Walker’s campaign cites an exchange during a July 12, 2018 debate between Democrats who were running for governor. A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope. Moderator: The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population — Evers: Absolutely, and that's a goal that’s worth accomplishing … We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. The Walker campaign argues that Evers’ response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because MICAH’s website refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015. But neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years. And we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame. Evers has said Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison. He has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior. Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us it’s possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes — or at least not thousands of them. Streit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations. Whether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround. But, despite Walker’s claim, it’s also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. One more point before we close: Ryan King, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses. Our rating Walker says Evers "wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities." Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released. Experts say a 50 percent reduction over a relatively short period, say a few years, would require the release of inmates convicted of violent crimes. But some say it’s possible to cut the population in half, perhaps over 10 years, without the release of any violent offenders, or at least not thousands of them. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2018-09-21T06:00:00	2018-09-12	['Wisconsin']

The unnamed author claimed Jamaica has become a permanently inhabited territory of the United States with its own organized government as determined by an Organic Act passed by Congress. There is no date provided for the decision, and we could not find any legislation relating to such news. This is because Jamaica is its own country, declaring its independence from the United Kingdom and creating its own constitution in 1962. The United States then established diplomatic relations with the country and has maintained them to this day. Trump met with Jamaican Ambassador to the United States Audrey Marks in early April, when they discussed bilateral trade, but they made no mention of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory. This story seems to prey on common geographical ignorance; we couldn’t help noticing during our research that a frequently googled question is whether Jamaica is located in the United States. The fourth-largest island in the Caribbean is in fact located about 90 miles south of Cuba. The country does not require visas for visits under six months, but it does require passports from U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The rumor dates back to February of this year, when Mediamaxzone.com reported falsely that the Jamaican prime minister had hinted Jamaica would become a U.S. territory.

Jason Carter -- grandson of former Georgia governor and former President Jimmy Carter -- was the guest speaker at a Marietta Rotary Club meeting last month. In Republican-dominated Cobb County, the Decatur Democrat delivered a speech that veered from the traditional GOP message. Carter told the attendees that continual shrinkage of the government -- which has been a conservative standard -- is hurting Georgia in the long run. "We collect fewer state taxes per capita than any other state. We have won the small-government competition," he said. "... And although state taxes are low, Georgia is the eighth-most-dependent state on the federal government." Is Georgia collecting fewer state taxes while receiving lots of federal government funds on the back end? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look into it. Carter told us that The Marietta Daily Journal, where we first saw his Rotary Club comments, left out part of his statement. He told the crowd that his tax and dependency claims were based on information from the Tax Foundation, Carter told PolitiFact Georgia in a phone interview. He also cited an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article as a second source for his dependency claim. "The discussion was about the difference in the levels of government. And while we’ve shrunk the federal government, we’ve increased the burden on the state and local governments," Carter said. "The key is the state government taxes." We found the Tax Foundation statistics that Carter cited in the organization’s "Facts and Figures" report of state tax data, released in March. The report, by the nonpartisan tax research group based in Washington, includes state tax and federal dependency data for fiscal year 2011. According to the charts, Georgia ranked last with $1,639 in state taxes collected per capita.(Georgia’s 2010 population was about 9.7 million.) The chart is based on the census’ definition of state tax collections, Tax Foundation officials told us. The next closest state was South Carolina at $1,650. Alaska collected the most state taxes per capita at $7,708. A second Tax Foundation chart, also for fiscal 2011, showed that Georgia also ranked last in the amount of state revenue collected per capita, at $3,807. The revenue data include the taxes levied by the state as well as other general revenue used to operate, such as licenses, fees and transfers from the federal government. We next went to the Census Bureau’s state government tax collections summary report, released in April, for fiscal 2012 data. Governing magazine, which covers politics, policy and management issues of state and local governments, aggregated the census data. We compiled Governing’s data into a spreadsheet and found that Georgia ranked second-to-last for the lowest total state taxes per capita, at $1,711.44. New Hampshire ranked last at $1,675.94 taxes collected per capita. So Carter’s tax claim was correct in fiscal 2011 but off a bit for the following fiscal year. On the second part of his claim, Carter again used Tax Foundation data, along with an AJC story published about a week before his Rotary Club speech. The Tax Foundation used figures from the Census Bureau to determine states’ dependence on the federal government. The organization divided each state’s intergovernmental revenue, or grants and other aid received from the federal government, into the state’s general revenue, which includes all tax revenue. Those calculations, also in the Facts and Figures 2013 report, showed that Georgia was the ninth-most-dependent state in the nation in fiscal 2011. Federal aid accounted for about 41 percent of general revenue. Mississippi was the most dependent, getting 49 percent of its revenue from the federal government; Alaska was the least dependent with 24 percent. The AJC story reported that about 31.6 percent, about $12 billion, of Georgia’s state agency spending was made up of federal funds in fiscal 2012, according to the paper’s review of budget records. The paper found that Georgia has been using federal money to fill budget gaps created by shrinking tax collections and higher demand for state services such as Medicaid. Georgia legislators have discussed forming a committee to study the state’s federal government dependence. To sum up, Carter said that the Peach State collects fewer state taxes per capita than any other state, yet is the eighth-most-dependent state on the federal government. Based on Tax Foundation and census data for fiscal 2011, Carter is correct on his tax collection claim. Advance the data forward a year and Georgia moves up a step in its collections for fiscal 2012. On federal government dependence, analysis of census data shows that Georgia was the ninth-most-dependent state in fiscal 2011. Carter’s overall point is that Georgia is fostering a smaller state government but at the same time relying heavily on federal funds. He seems correct on that point. But his calculations were slightly off. We rated his claim Mostly True.	None	Jason Carter	None	None	None	2013-06-11T00:00:00	2013-05-27	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']
pomt-01650	Says drug cartels are using social media to offer rebates so more children from Central America get smuggled to the United States.	/texas/statements/2014/aug/22/henry-cuellar/henry-cuellar-claim-social-media-rebates-and/	EDITOR’S NOTE: Our first review of this claim, posted Aug. 12, 2014 and readable here, resulted in a Pants on Fire rating. That story appeared just before the State Department emailed a fresh statement leading us to take down the article and do more checking. In the end, we rated this statement Mostly False. In a "did-you-know?" moment, a Laredo congressman said drug cartels offer rebates for children from Central America to lure other kids to make the overland journey to the United States. In an interview with ABC News and Yahoo News, posted online July 16, 2014, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar talked up legislation he and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, had introduced enabling immigration judges to determine quickly whether any unaccompanied child apprehended on the U.S. side of the border with Mexico should be sent home. Agreeing that poverty and violence in Central America have been factors in children flocking north, Cuellar told reporter Jeff Zeleny: "The drug cartels found an incentive, and this is what we’re trying to cut off, these incentives. Finally a last thing: Did you know that they’re even using social media -- social media that says if you get recruited, we’ll give you a rebate if you bring another child with you." Zeleny: "So an advertisement of sorts?" Cuellar: "Oh, without a doubt. They have marketing. They’re very sophisticated organizations." Cuellar’s mention of rebates being floated by cartels via social media stirred our curiosity. After all, the cartels aren’t known for guiding children to the U.S. from the countries south of Mexico, though they do find ways to profit from people passing through their territories. Also, rebates sounded unwieldy at least if the rebates were anything like the return of part of the up-front payment for a service or item such as what you get if you mail a form to a postal box. By phone, Cuellar told us his claim tracked what he heard from an official in the U.S. Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, which is part of the State Department, in a July 11, 2014, briefing of a congressional delegation in Guatemala City. "When they mentioned rebates, it got my attention," Cuellar said, adding the briefer (whom he did not identify) also mentioned discounts. At our request, Cuellar’s office emailed photos of what Cuellar described as his post-briefing journal entry. The presented July 11 entry doesn’t mention drug cartels, repeatedly saying "smugglers" instead. The relevant portion says: "Less Mexicans going north so smugglers looking for new markets (CA) & social media used to recruit." We took "CA" to mean Central America. The next page opens by saying "smugglers rebate $s if they bring someone with them." His office guided us to State Department spokespeople who emailed us several statements. None of them covered all of what Cuellar said. Spokeswomen Mo Mimnaugh and Susan Bridenstine each said smugglers employ social media and Mimnaugh specified that embassy staff told Cuellar "smugglers are known to provide rebates for positive referrals. This information is from Guatemalan government sources." Bridenstine said smugglers sometimes offer discounts to ferry children. Otherwise, we found no news stories on cartels using social media to offer rebates. Also, outside experts expressed doubts about the claim. News stories don’t mention rebates In an email, Mimnaugh pointed out a news story about smugglers using Facebook. The July 7, 2014, article from Prensa Libre, a Guatemalan news service, was headlined, "Coyotes coordinate through Facebook." The story quoted a smuggler identified only as Juan saying he logs onto Facebook to smooth the logistics of guiding almost 100 people a month from Latin American countries into Mexico. Facebook, he said, is cheaper than a telephone call. Other news stories talked about smugglers, social media and occasional discounts without mention of cartels offering rebates. An Associated Press news story, datelined Tecún Umán, Guatemala, said: "Coyotes get their business through social networks, from friends and family, or referrals from prior customers," without saying where that information originated. The 1,900-word story also was published July 21, 2014, after Cuellar spoke to ABC News, making us loathe to consider it because Cuellar wouldn’t have had it as an information source. Some news stories refer to smugglers or the drug cartels vending travel packages. A June 26, 2014, news story in the New York Times quoted Raul L. Ortiz, deputy chief of the Border Patrol for the Rio Grande Valley, saying families and children had become a high-profit, low-risk business for Mexican narcotics cartel bosses who, Ortiz said, had taken control of human smuggling across the Rio Grande. "They now offer family packages, migrants said, charging up to $7,500 to bring a minor alone or a mother with children from Central America to the American side of the river." A July 9, 2014, news story in El Universal, a Mexican newspaper, quoted Ana Cecilia Oliva Balcarcel, director of immigrant protection at the National Institute of Migration in Mexico, describing special offers to migrants that, in some cases, cover up to three trips into the United States for a $6,000 payment, the story said. She was further quoted as saying people prefer to purchase such packages from traffickers rather than going to the trouble of applying for a humanitarian visa from Mexico. Expert: ‘Sounds like talk-radio chatter’ To our inquiries, academic experts on immigration expressed no awareness of rebates being offered to families or children via social media, though some said smugglers might occasionally employ social media. (Spokespeople for Twitter and Facebook declined to comment.) Wayne Cornelius, a professor emeritus at the University of California at San Diego, said via email he hadn’t heard of evidence supporting the rebate claim "and I deal frequently with attorneys providing legal representation for unaccompanied child migrants. It sounds more like talk-radio chatter." Also by email, Austin-based security and intelligence consultant firm Stratfor, which describes itself as a "geopolitical intelligence firm that provides strategic analysis and forecasting," provided a statement from Tristan Reed, its security analyst for Mexico, who said that while drug cartels employ social media, Stratfor had no specific examples of rebate offers "at the moment." Generally, Reed said, "even if Mexican organized crime were advertising their human smuggling services via social media -- which itself makes their operations more vulnerable -- it's only occurring in an isolated manner." Cuellar’s office urged us to query San Antonio consultant Alonzo Peña, former deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who said by email that from his experience, "I can tell you that what the congressman said is not at all outside the realm of possibility or incredible." Peña also said by phone: "I haven’t heard the word ‘rebate’ used" in the context of smuggling children. If the drug cartels aren’t directly ferrying children north, he said, they no doubt find ways to profit from the vulnerable traffic. "I know the cartels are using social media for just about everything they do," he said. Texas professors who study immigration across the Rio Grande expressed skepticism. Nestor Rodriguez, a University of Texas sociologist who has done research in rural Guatemala, said he’d be surprised if formal rebates are offered via social media or otherwise though perhaps smugglers offer discounts if, say, a group of children is expanded by one or two kids, driving down overall expenses. "I never heard of anyone going to a web page to find a smuggling tour," Rodriguez said, saying arrangements are done face to face. "I’m not saying it couldn’t happen." Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said the congressman’s statement struck him as flawed in several ways. Drug cartels don’t smuggle people, he said, leaving that to others, though one cartel levies a "right-of-way" charge for people being smuggled through its territory, he said. "No. 2, this assumes the people doing this, both fleeing and doing the human smuggling, have access to the Internet," Payan said. "Most do not have access to the Internet; they do not operate that way. They don’t want to leave any record of this." And, Payan said, the people who are leaving have no web access at home and don’t necessarily even have cell phones. "Smugglers tend to operate person to person, do their own recruitment, go colonia to colonia," Payan said. "I haven’t seen any of this evidence of social media." After Mimnaugh said Guatemalan government sources had mentioned rebates, Payan said by email the embassy’s response sounded like cherry-picking to defend the congressman. Payan suggested we query Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas-Brownsville. Correa-Cabrera called Cuellar’s claim unfounded and ridiculous, adding she would need to see independent evidence before she put credence in the Mimnaugh rebates’ statement. Cuellar, informed of the lack of published evidence and skepticism among most experts, told us he believes the government briefer over others "because those are the people on the ground and they’re not sitting in some university office looking up information." Our ruling Cuellar said drug cartels are offering rebates via social media so more children from Central America get guided to the United States. The elements of Cuellar’s statement — cartels, social media and some sort of rebate or, perhaps, discount — stem from a State Department briefing for which we found minimal degrees of confirmation. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-12287	"Texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation."	/texas/statements/2017/jun/29/shawn-thierry/shawn-thierry-says-texas-leads-nation-mothers-dyin/	A Democrat credited the Republican governor for highlighting maternal mortality and then made a claim about Texas leading nationally in a disturbing way. Houston Rep. Shawn Thierry noted in a press release circulated the day after Gov. Greg Abbott set the agenda for the special legislative session starting July 18, 2017, that Abbott authorized maternal mortality as a potential topic after Thierry and Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, had urged him to do so. Thierry said: "It was clear that a special session was going to happen and we now know that our Texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation. This time around, we cannot afford for party politics to stand in the way of resolving this crisis." Abbott included "extending maternal mortality task force" in his session "call," he said, to allow lawmakers to maintain the state’s advisory Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force into 2023. The group, created by the 2013 Legislature, is otherwise abolished as of September 2019. We wondered if Texas mothers are more often dying in connection with childbirth than mothers in other states. That’s been reported previously, including in a June 4, 2017, Associated Press news story stating researchers last year found the Texas rate "not only the highest in the U.S., but one of the highest in the developed world." To our inquiry, a Thierry aide, Jasmine Connor, emailed us a web link to an August 2016 news story in the Guardian newspaper stating that according to a study in the medical journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, Texas in 2014 had the developed world’s highest maternal mortality rate at 35.8 deaths per 100,000 births. The journal is the official publication of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which describes itself as a 58,000-member organization dedicated to the advancement of women’s health. 2016 study When we inquired, an ACOG spokeswoman, Megan Christin, emailed us a copy of the study, which appeared in the journal’s September 2016 issue under the headline: "Recent Increases in the U.S. Maternal Mortality Rate: Disentangling Trends From Measurement Issues," A methodological wrinkle was necessary, the authors wrote, to make sure the mortality rates estimated for each state reflected needed improvements in measurement. That is, the study adjusted each state’s tally of maternal deaths to account for whether the state’s death certificate already included a revealing question devised nationally in 2003 based on providing checkboxes on death certificates to measure whether women had been pregnant at up to a year before death. Adding the question, the study says, drove up reported maternal mortality rates. "The addition of this question led to increases in reported maternal mortality rates," the study says. "However, delays in states’ adoption of the new pregnancy question together with use of nonstandard pregnancy questions created a situation where, in any given data year, some states were using the U.S. standard question, others were using questions incompatible with the U.S. standard, and still others had no pregnancy question on their death certificates." Broadly, the study relied on a definition of maternal mortality typically used for international maternal mortality comparisons. The definition, attributed to the World Health Organization: "The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes." The study says, though, the WHO also defines late maternal deaths: "The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than 1 year after termination of pregnancy." Study: Texas saw a spike So, did Texas have the nation’s highest maternal mortality? The state had a yet-to-be explained spike in rates in 2011-12, the study says, giving it by far the highest rate in the country. Previously, adjusted maternal mortality rates for Texas showed a modest increase from 2000 to 2010, the study says, from a rate of 17.7 per 100,000 live-births to 18.6. "However, after 2010, the reported maternal mortality rate for Texas doubled within a 2-year period to levels not seen in other U.S. states," the report says. A figure in the study shows the Texas rate reaching 35.8 deaths per 100,000 live-births by 2014. ADJUSTED MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE, TEXAS, 2000-2014 SOURCE: Figure 4 in study, "Recent Increases in the U.S. Maternal Mortality Rate: Disentangling Trends From Measurement Issues," Obstetrics & Gynecology, September 2016 The report also calls the two-year doubling for Texas through 2011-12 "puzzling." The authors continue: "Texas cause-of-death data, as with data for most states, are coded at the National Center for Health Statistics, and this doubling in the rate was not found for other states. Communications with vital statistics personnel in Texas and at the National Center for Health Statistics did not identify any data processing or coding changes that would account for this rapid increase." The report continues: "There were some changes in the provision of women’s health services in Texas from 2011 to 2015, including the closing of several women’s health clinics. Still, in the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, the doubling of a mortality rate within a 2-year period in a state with almost 400,000 annual births seems unlikely. A future study will examine Texas data by race-ethnicity and detailed causes of death to better understand this unusual finding." Among 48 other states, the estimated mortality rate in 2000 was 18.8; the rate escalated slowly to 23.8 in 2014, the report says. The remaining state, California, saw "a marked decline in maternal and late maternal mortality from 2003 to 2014," the study says, going on: "California has made concerted efforts to reduce maternal mortality, including initiating a statewide pregnancy-associated mortality review in 2006 and contracting with the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative to investigate primary causes of maternal death. This collaborative developed and promulgated evidence-based tool kits to address two of the most common, preventable contributors to maternal death (obstetric hemorrhage and preeclampsia) and implemented quality improvement initiatives throughout the state. These efforts appear to have helped reduce maternal mortality in California," the study says. Texas expert We were unable to connect with authors of the study including lead analyst Marian F. MacDorman of the Maryland Population Research Center at the University of Maryland, College Park. Meantime, Christin put us in touch with Dr. Lisa Hollier, ACOG’s president-elect and the chair of the 15-person Texas task force focused on maternal mortality. Hollier, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, said by phone the 2012 Texas spike identified in the study was unusual, even strange. In 2014, Hollier said, the task force began a case-by-case review of the 2012 deaths, she said, because that was then the latest year of complete death data. We asked Hollier if the 2012 spike seems to hold up. Hollier said: "We need a tiny bit more time to give a perfect answer to that," with conclusions possibly announced later in 2017. Asked to assess Thierry’s claim about Texas leading the nation in deaths in childbirth, which arguably would overlook deaths in the months after delivery, Hollier said by email: "As I considered this question, I believe that the proportion of all maternal deaths that occur literally ‘in childbirth’ would be largely equivalent across states. Given the high rates of maternal mortality in Texas relative to other states, I believe this would mean that deaths ‘in childbirth’ would also be high in Texas relative to other states." State agency response We also wondered if Texas government officials had analyzed the research suggesting Texas lately has the nation’s highest maternal mortality rate. At the Texas Department of State Health Services, spokesman Chris Van Deusen replied to our query by email by saying the agency doesn’t have data for other states or do related rankings. Van Deusen otherwise confirmed that officials are looking into what appears to have been a "pronounced difference" in Texas women in 2012 dying in childbirth or within a year afterward. Van Deusen said that to date, the task force had found the most common causes of maternal death in 2011-2012 were cardiac events (21 percent), drug overdoses (12 percent) and hypertension/eclampsia (11 percent). The task force’s July 2016 report states: "Cardiac events and hypertension/eclampsia were ranked first and third most common causes of maternal death, which is consistent with medical literature. However, overdose by ingestion of drugs emerged as the second leading cause of maternal death in 2011-2012 (11.6 percent). Review of actual case records (including postmortem toxicology and police reports) showed that the majority of these maternal deaths involved licit or illicit prescription opioids. This finding is alarming and may represent an ongoing shift in maternal causes of death." Also of concern, the task force said, was the number of maternal deaths that occurred months after delivery. Close to 60 percent of Texas maternal deaths 2011-2012 "occurred after 42 days post-delivery," the task force wrote. "Case review of these deaths will determine whether they were pregnancy-related, -associated, or neither. Nevertheless, it is clear that women remain at-risk for the first year after their pregnancy has ended. It is possible that lack of continuity of care plays a role in these later maternal death outcomes." In June 2017, Van Deusen wrote us: "Maternal deaths have been increasing in Texas at the same time we have seen increases in the chronic diseases that underlie many deaths: from 2005 to 2014, pre-pregnancy obesity of mothers increased 25 percent, hypertension increased 20 percent, and diabetes increased 45 percent." The state official also provided a chart suggesting that in 2014, 126 or 135 maternal deaths were reported in Texas, giving the state a rate of 31.5 or 33.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live-births, according to respective counts by DSHS and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with both rates a decrease from 2013 and the CDC-reported rate down 13 percent from the 38.7 deaths per 100,000 live-births posted for 2012: Texas Maternal Deaths Within 42 days After The End of Pregnancy DSHS Data CDC Wonder Data Maternal deaths Live Births Maternal Mortality Rate Maternal deaths Live Births Maternal Mortality Rate 2010 72 385,746 18.7 72 386,118 18.6 2011 100 377,274 26.5 114 377,445 30.2 2012 110 382,438 28.8 148 382,727 38.7 2013 126 387,110 32.5 140 387,340 36.1 2014 126 399,482 31.5 135 399,766 33.8 SOURCE: Emails, Chris Van Deusen, director of media services, Texas Department of State Health Services, June 8-9, 2017 Limited federal data At Hollier’s suggestion, we also checked on whether the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports state-by-state maternal mortality rates. Our web search yielded the center’s 2017 assessment that the national rate reached a high of 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2009 and 2011, according to the center’s review of state-forwarded death certificates for women who died within a year of delivering. CDC says: "Whether the actual risk of a woman dying from pregnancy-related causes has increased is unclear. Many studies show that an increasing number of pregnant women in the United States have chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic heart disease. These conditions may put a pregnant woman at higher risk of pregnancy complications. Although the overall risk of dying from pregnancy complications is low, some women are at a higher risk than others. The higher pregnancy-related mortality ratios during 2009–2011 are due to an increase in infection and sepsis deaths." SOURCE: Web page, "Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System," Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, last updated May 10, 2017 (accessed May 26, 2017) At our request, Kimberly Rodriguez of the CDC emailed charts based on agency data showing that in 2015 among only 15 states with reported maternal death rates, Texas tied with Missouri for the third-highest rate of deaths per 100,000 residents, behind Louisiana, Georgia and Indiana. That’s a different indicator, though, than deaths per 100,000 live-births. In the end, CDC spokesman Brian Tsai suggested by email that we rely on the older figures covered by the 2016 study we'd already reviewed. Our ruling Thierry said Texas mothers "are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation." In 2011 and 2012, according to a 2016 study, Texas had by far the nation’s highest maternal mortality rate. A clarification missing from Thierry’s statement: That national analysis took into account deaths not just at childbirth but during pregnancy and up to 42 days after delivery. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-00205	Says 60 percent of Austin’s "waterways are found to be contaminated with fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim."	/texas/statements/2018/oct/16/alexander-strenger/austin-mayoral-hopeful-says-60-percent-austins-wat/	One of six candidates challenging Austin Mayor Steve Adler in the November 2018 election said that more than half of Austin’s waterways are so dirty, they’re deemed "unsafe to swim." The splashy claim by pedicabbie Alexander Strenger appears among entries on an E.thepeople interactive website showing questions to Texans running for office and responses. Question: "What is your top environmental concern and how would you address it?" Strenger’s reply: "60% of our waterways are found to be contaminated with fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim." Strenger then suggested that dog owners who fail to clean up are mostly to blame and said that as mayor, he’d step up police presence near bodies of water to ensure more owners get fined. Candidate cites news story By email, Strenger told us he based his statement on an August 2018 Austin American-Statesman news story. The story said that according to a study by the Environment Texas Research and Policy Center, "60 percent of Austin waterways tested last year were so contaminated with fecal matter as to be unsafe for swimming." Not that Austinites were told to ditch their swimsuits. Popular swimming destinations such as Barton Springs Pool, Barton Creek, Lake Travis, Lake Austin and Walter E. Long Lake did not test positive for unsafe bacteria at any point in 2017, the story said. On the icky side, Austin’s Waller Creek, Walnut Creek, West Bouldin Creek, East Bouldin Creek and Blunn Creek frequently had unsafe levels of worrisome bacteria, the story citing the study said. Colorado River test sites east of Lady Bird Lake were found to have high levels of bacteria two out of the four times they were tested, the story said. According to the story, the researchers "cited stormwater runoff as a cause for some of the biological pollution and recommended that cities require infrastructure improvements to mitigate runoff, such as permeable pavement. They also urged cities to educate residents about bacteria pollution caused by pet waste." Todd Jackson, a field biologist with the city’s watershed department, told the newspaper that the most likely culprit for bacterial contamination was aging infrastructure, including hard-to-spot leaks in residential and commercial utility lines in older urbanized areas. Figures supported by study We dog-paddled to the study, "Swim at Your Own Risk," which says that researchers found that 46 of 76 Austin sites, nearly 61 percent, had at least one 2017 water sample showing excessive bacteria levels--indicating unsafe conditions for swimming, tubing or wading safely. The samples are taken quarterly or less by the City of Austin’s Watershed Protection Department. Water "samples were listed as unsafe for swimming if they exceeded levels of bacteria deemed safe for swimming by Texas regulation," the study says. For freshwater, the study says, "safety is determined by counts of the bacteria E. coli. These bacteria, while they are not typically dangerous for humans, are used as indicators of fecal contamination, which can contain bacteria that make people sick," the study says. An accompanying chart shows that on each of the four days that samples were taken from two creeks, Blunn and East Bouldin, one site or more showed too much E. coli to be considered safe for swimming. Negative results were less consistent for the river and three other creeks, the chart indicates. SOURCE: Study, "Swim at Your Own Risk, Bacteria Pollution in Texas Beaches and Waterways Threatens Public Health," Environment Texas Research & Policy Center, August 2018 (fetched Oct. 11, 2018) An alternate interpretation To our inquiry, Luke Metzger of Environment Texas sent a spreadsheet by email showing the number of times each sampling showed higher-than-acceptable levels of E. coli. The sheet enabled us to speculate about a less dramatic read of the results. That is, just nine of the Austin sites, 12 percent, showed excessive E. coli at every sampling from the year. Metzger replied that he wouldn’t call that an all-clear to dive in. If "there's a problem even once during the year, there's a risk that people could get sick swimming or wading," Metzger said. "Just like Russian roulette, just because you don't die when it lands on an empty chamber doesn't make it a safe game to play." City of Austin says about half of creeks contain too much dangerous bacteria Next, we asked city and state water experts to speak to the study’s judgment about the swimmability of Austin waterways. A city spokeswoman, Susan Garnett, said that at any given time, about half of Austin’s creeks exceed the state’s bacteria threshold for "contact recreation," meaning an activity such as splashing or swimming that increases a person’s chances of swallowing water. That conclusion, she said, ties to samplings taken from about 125 sites in 45 watersheds over the past 30 years or so. Garnett said by email: "The higher the E. coli count, the more likely there is fecal contamination and the higher the risk there is for waterborne illness. Any natural body of water will have some amount of fecal matter due to fish and wildlife, and the fecal matter from warm-blooded animals such as birds, bats, dogs, deer and other mammals will include E. coli." Garnett’s 50 percent figure comports with what the city told the American-Statesman for an August 2014 news story quoting a city environmental engineer, Chris Herrington, estimating that half the city's watersheds had excessive levels of E. coli. Four Austin creeks were seen to be exceeding the state limit of 126 colonies per 100 milliliters of water (a method of gauging bacteria)--a level at which about eight out of 1,000 swimmers would have increased risks for gastroenteritis and offshoot aches and illnesses, the story said. Yet officials also pointed out that with the creeks often running shallow, it was almost impossible to fully immerse in the waters. Herrington said then that the state thresholds are "protective and very conservative." Exceeding them, he said, "doesn't mean an immediate health risk." State spokesman: Five impaired Austin-area waterways in 2014 By email, TCEQ spokesman Andrew Keese responded that in 2014, the latest year analyzed in a commission report, the agency found five of 53 Austin-area waterways, accounting for 13 percent of the area’s "stream miles," to be impaired. Each waterway had enough E. coli over multiple samplings to represent "an elevated level of risk of illness from contact recreation," Keese said. Still, Keese said, that didn’t "necessarily indicate areas considered unsafe to swim. Swimming in all natural waters (including those that meet water quality standards) comes with risk, whether that be from pathogen exposure or other risks," Keese wrote. Keese noted that the Environment Texas study relied on single samplings in one year while the agency makes determinations based on 20 samplings over several years which, Keese wrote, "provides a better overall assessment of risks associated with recreational activities such as swimming." Keese went on: "Bacteria data can be quite variable from day to day, and results are dependent upon a number of factors, such as antecedent precipitation." Commission officials also said through Keese that the study appeared to consider samples from some waterways and not others--notably Austin’s Bull Creek. We turned back to Brian Zabcik of Environment Texas, who said that the study’s consideration of a few water samples taken in 2017 was a deliberate effort to spotlight what the state’s long-term approach could obscure. By email, Zabcik said the researchers didn’t field Bull Creek results because the city samples water from that creek in even-numbered years. Zabcik further quoted Andrew Clamann, a city environmental scientist, advising: "There are too many watersheds in Austin to monitor them all every year." Another perspective For out-of-Austin perspective, we reached the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University, which is working with the city and the Shoal Creek Conservancy to develop a watershed protection plan for Austin’s Shoal Creek Watershed. Nick Dornak, the center’s director of watershed services, said by email that statewide, the majority of monitored streams don’t meet their "designated use," as defined by TCEQ, "due to high levels of bacteria and other contaminants. Other common impairments include high levels of dissolved solids (salts) and depressed dissolved oxygen." Dornak, asked to assess the Environment Texas study and TCEQ’s response, said: "The study looked at a ‘snapshot’ of water quality and represented a kind of worst-case scenario that may be a little misleading." Still, Dornak wrote, this "data does show that there are definitely days where swimming may not be safe around Austin-area streams." Our ruling Strenger said 60 percent of Austin’s "waterways are found to be contaminated with fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim." This claim fairly echoes a study finding that 60 percent of Austin waterways sampled by the city had so much E. coli bacteria that swimming could pose health risks. Then again, the study indicates a smaller share of waterways, 12 percent, had too much of the bacteria at every sampling. It’s worth noting too that the samplings were all taken in 2017, a year ago. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-07090	"Providence is one of the busiest fire departments for its relative size in the country."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/24/paul-doughty/firefighter-union-chief-says-providence-has-one-bu/	When layoffs were looming in the Providence Fire Department, Paul Doughty, the president of the firefighters' union, went on the WPRI "Newsmakers" program June 12. He talked about the changes that cutbacks would entail, and whether a different type of schedule -- 24 hours on the job followed by a 48-hour break -- would pose a threat to public safety. Doughty said the cutbacks could significantly expand a firefighter's workweek in a city where mandatory overtime is already common. "Providence is one of the busiest fire departments for its relative size in the country and in terms of volume of runs," he said. "The rescues are some of the busiest. ... Engine 3 out of downtown is usually in the top 10 percent across the country." The threat of layoffs apparently has been averted now that the union and the city have tentatively agreed on contract modifications that include several union concessions, including giving up a planned pay raise and reducing paid vacation time. But the question still intrigued us: Is Providence's department really one of the busiest for its size? We had a burning desire to know whether that was true or just an attempt by the union to discourage cutbacks. We called Doughty, who said his source was the trade publication Firehouse Magazine, which has been collecting city-by-city data on firefighter activity for 30 years as part of its National Run Survey. The latest data available online, from 2009, includes information supplied by 287 departments in 47 states, the District of Columbia and six Canadian provinces. But Providence is not included. (The magazine looks at a different combinations of departments from year to year.) So he took us back to 2008's listing, which has data for Providence and 256 other U.S. departments. In those rankings, the city does look busy, with the 10th busiest engine (Engine 3, with 4,809 runs per year), the 13th busiest station (15,626 runs from the downtown station per year) and the 31st busiest ladder truck (Ladder 1 with 2,160 runs). It also ranked 50th out of 257 in total calls, with 42,989 runs that year, or 118 calls to the fire department per day. (To confirm that volume, we randomly picked seven days in 2008 and asked for copies of the department's logs. The number of runs ranged from 98 to 131 calls per day. Average for those days: 112.) But those are just raw numbers, and don’t take into consideration the size of population of the area being served or whether the station and equipment statistics reflect having only one station in an exceptionally busy area. The citywide number of calls would be the best indicator of activity. With 178,000 residents, according to the latest U.S. Census numbers, that would amount to 242 calls per 1,000 residents. Firehouse Magazine is a trade publication that doesn't double check the numbers it receives from fire departments. So we tried to get independent numbers from other sources. When we contacted the National Fire Data Center, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, statistician Gayle Kelch told us that the center couldn't break down the numbers by department because they wouldn't include rescue calls or false alarms. "Each city or town would have to do their own data runs," she said. Instead, the center had a nationwide estimate of 26.5 million fire department calls for all types of calls for 2009. (With a U.S. population of 307 million in July 2009, that would break down to 86 calls per 1,000 people. Providence’s reported volume is three times higher.) As part of our search, we also contacted the Insurance Services Office, a private company that collects fire data for insurance purposes. "ISO does not compile data related to this topic. It is not aware of any other organization that may track such information about fire departments, but suggests reaching out to Firehouse Magazine or Fire Chief Magazine," a spokeswoman responded in an e-mail. So we went back to Firehouse and its lists from 2008 (where Providence is mentioned) and 2009 (to see where Providence would fit into the list). "They're recognized as a reputable journal in the fire service," said Ken Willette, manager of the public fire protection division of the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), based in Quincy, Mass. We were concerned that the number of runs, because they are self-reported, might be inflated by multiple pieces of equipment going to the same call. For example, a fire truck will always show up at a rescue call in addition to a rescue wagon, a widespread practice that's been in place in Providence for over 30 years because it provides an extra set of hands and a fire truck can often get to the scene first, said Providence assistant chief Michael Dillon. That practice is common, Firehouse editor in chief Harvey Eisner told us. Thomas Warren, assistant chief for administration in the Providence department, said that in Providence, if more than one piece of apparatus goes to the scene of a fire or heart attack, that only counts as one run.) With those assurances, we took the total number of runs for all U.S. departments -- a combination of fire calls, emergency medical service calls and false alarms -- and factored them in with population statistics supplied by the departments, compiled by Firehouse Magazine, and published on a separate list. Warren supplied the number of runs made in Providence in 2009. For 2009, Providence, with 41,553 calls, ranked as the 14th busiest community, with 233 runs per thousand. Providence was behind Chicago (244 runs per thousand), Newport, R.I. (246), San Francisco (274), St. Louis (283) and Hartford (389), but the department was busier than larger cities such as Fort Lauderdale (231), Miami (209), Nashville (208), Cincinnati (196), Dayton (194), Orlando (191), Memphis (186), New York City (184), and every Massachusetts community, including Boston (124). In the 2008 Firehouse survey, when we adjusted for the populations of the areas covered, Providence ranked 15th. And when we combined the data for both years to include statistics for nearly 400 departments, Providence and Newport were virtually tied for the 20th busiest departments on the list. "It's a very large volume of runs," Doughty. Why so many calls? Providence's Dillon said it’s because residents have confidence that the department can handle emergencies quickly and efficiently, so they may be quicker to call for help than in other communities. Willette of the NFPA said that in addition to the confidence factor, Providence provides medical and rescue services that some departments don't. A higher call volume could also be due to the need to provide more mutual aid to neighboring communities that have cut back on their fire services. It may also reflect the presence of more fire suppression systems that are in place, especially following The Station nightclub fire. "You cannot underestimate the effect of that in a department's operation," he said. In summary, we think that being ranked in the top 20 when it comes to the number of calls per person qualifies Providence as one of the busiest departments in the United States. We rate Doughty's statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-06603	Says credit rating agencies realize that our instability stems in large part from Oregon’s kicker system.	/oregon/statements/2011/sep/23/brent-barton/former-rep-brent-barton-says-credit-analysts-reali/	Oregon’s "kicker law" is often kicked around in political fights over spending and taxes. Republicans, generally, want to leave the refund law alone and force the state to save money by spending less. Democrats, generally, say the kicker is a constitutionally built-in anti-savings mechanism. For those who don’t know, the kicker is officially called the state’s surplus refund law. It requires a refund to taxpayers if the state collects more money in taxes -- by at least 2 percent -- than economists projected. The idea is to make sure legislators don’t spend every dime they get from taxpayers. Former state Rep. Brent Barton, a Democrat who represented part of Clackamas County, recently wrote a guest column for The Oregonian in which he urged the state to divert the kicker and use the money to build a savings fund that could boost our credit rating, which in turn would save millions of dollars in lower interest payments. "The ratings agencies will not upgrade Oregon's credit rating until we stabilize state finances, and they realize that our instability stems in large part from Oregon's kicker system," he wrote. We can’t predict what ratings agencies will or won’t do, and neither can anyone else. Instead, PolitiFact Oregon had a simple question: Do credit ratings analysts actually finger the kicker as responsible for the state’s financial instability? Steve Buckstein of the Cascade Policy Institute, which promotes limited government, argues that without the kicker, legislators would spend every penny on hand for pay raises and new programs. The pressure not to spend is too great, he said. On the other hand, the kicker could "kick" at awkward times, for example, after drastic funding reductions, as The Oregonian’s Harry Esteve illustrates in this 2009 news story: "At the end of each legislative session, the state economist makes his best guess about how much revenue the state stands to receive over the next two years. He has lots of data to work with, and a complex set of equations, matrices and algorithms. But it's still a guess. If he sets a low figure -- which makes sense this year given the current economic conditions -- and then the economy rebounds, the state could end up sending millions of dollars back to taxpayers at the same time it is making deep cuts to services. It happened during the last recession, in 2001, and there are growing fears it could happen again." See the problem? Let’s turn to the actual reports, to see for ourselves what analysts have said. Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service, and Fitch are the houses that determine our creditworthiness, which in turn determines the interest rate at which we borrow money. For example, they loved that Oregon started a savings fund in 2007 by diverting the corporate kicker that year. All three agencies consistently cite the state’s narrow reliance on economically sensitive corporate and personal income tax revenues as a negative. They also dislike Oregon’s active citizen initiative process because it means voters can restrict how much money we collect and how we spend that money. Their big issue is reliability. Many times, but not always, the kicker law is singled out as an added concern. A March 7 Moody’s report says the kicker "adds budgetary challenges, including cash flow pressures." Does that mean that a repeal of the kicker would increase our rating? Or that the existence of the kicker means we’re doomed to a lower rating? Kimberly Lyons, the primary analyst for Moody’s for Oregon, wouldn’t go so far. Ability to govern is what they measure and the kicker is not a defacto defect, Lyons said. "There are other ways to make the structure work for the state. As long as the state is structurally balanced, that’s all we care about." But Gabriel Petek of Standard & Poor’s was more willing to weigh in on the kicker. He said that while Oregon’s reliance on income taxes is the "main driver" of the state’s financial volatility, the kicker makes it difficult to build reserves because we can’t reap the benefits of economic upsides to manage for the economic downsides. It’s as if we’ve deliberately hobbled ourselves. Back to Barton. He checked in with PolitiFact Oregon while traveling. He said he should have stressed that the kicker magnifies Oregon’s fiscal instability rather than causes it. "I probably should have been more precise in wording that sentence, as the verb ‘stems’ implies causation more than magnification. However, the fact remains that the ratings agencies recognize that the kicker system contributes significantly to Oregon's unstable fiscal system." Finally, we checked in with state Treasurer Ted Wheeler, who manages our money. He acknowledged that if Oregon had jobs galore and oodles of extra money in the bank, the ratings agencies could upgrade us anyway, without kicker reform. But that’s not the case, he said, and so analysts continue to call out the kicker as a concern. But doesn’t our financial instability really stem from our unnaturally high reliance on income and corporate taxes? "The two go hand-in-hand. You can’t really separate them," Wheeler said. "You’ve got the volatility from our reliance on the income tax, which in my mind is the most significant issue. You have all of your eggs in one basket, and the basket we’ve chosen is the volatility basket, and then when you combine the kicker with that, the two really are like the evil twins. They work hand in hand to make it hard for government to plan through a reliable revenue structure." So what have we learned? Certainly government could save money without the kicker. But the kicker does exacerbate the volatility of the system that we’ve chosen to pay for public services. And the two analysts we interviewed were understandably wishy washy on how Oregon’s kicker figures into the state’s credit rating. In a previous PolitiFact, we gave Rep. Matt Wand, R-Troutdale, a Mostly False for saying that previous Legislatures suspended the kicker, spent every dime and failed to stabilize state finances. (We explained that serious context was missing.) In this PolitiFact, we come to a similar conclusion about Barton’s statement regarding the kicker’s relationship to financial stability. Oregon’s instability stems mainly from our heavy reliance on one revenue stream. The simplest way to counter that may be to divert the kicker. But a bigger difference, the reports suggest, would be made by adding other taxes -- hello, sales? -- to diversify Oregon’s revenue base. (Sorry, we had to say it.) We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-06404	Says adding toll lanes on I-95 in Broward County improved rush-hour traffic for non-toll lanes from 25 mph to 45 mph.	/florida/statements/2011/oct/28/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-toll-roads-sped-traffic-i-95/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a big fan of interviews from friendly talk radio stations, used an Oct. 10, 2011, chat with a Daytona Beach host to discuss prudent investments for the state amid another big budget shortfall. (Well, after saying Florida doesn't need more anthropologists, which created an uproar within the academic community. And after disputing that he's changed how he will measure his promise to create 700,000 private-sector jobs, which PolitiFact Florida gave a full-flop. Moving on ...) Scott pointed to improving state ports in anticipation of the Panama Canal expansion, cargo rail and adding more toll roads across the state to support new construction projects. In his comments to host Marc Bernier, Scott said the state can designate toll lanes on federal highways as long as the state adds a new lane, and he cited changes to Interstate 95 as an example of how it can work well. "We did that down in Broward County," he said. "It took the rush-hour traffic for the non-tolled lanes from 25 mph to 45 (mph). So for people not paying the toll it was a big benefit. We're going to start doing that across the state." Scott's claim that express lanes improved rush-hour traffic for all drivers is interesting, especially given his signal that he wants to expand tolling statewide. He repeated the point a week later in an interview on Tampa Bay's WFLA-AM 970. We thought it wise to check his evidence. 95 Express, a primer First we'll address what he's talking about, as it may not be obvious to residents outside of southeast Florida with its notoriously treacherous commutes. Scott was referring to "95 Express," a Florida Department of Transportation project unveiled in December 2008 to improve traffic speeds during the morning and afternoon rush hour. He misspoke when he said the program was in Broward County. The only operational piece of the project is in Miami-Dade County. DOT workers added new lanes to a 7.3-mile stretch of I-95 by repainting northbound and, about a year later, southbound lane lines. The express lanes replaced High Occupancy Vehicle, or HOV, lanes that were reserved for cars carrying two or more people, free of charge. The HOV lanes -- one in each direction -- were not very popular. The special toll lanes, two in each direction, start at State Road 836, called the Dolphin Expressway, in Miami, and run north to the Golden Glades Interchange. The second phase, which was scheduled to begin construction in fall 2011, will extend from Golden Glades to Fort Lauderdale in Broward County. A word about the tolls: They are paid automatically via electronic transponders (SunPass) but are not charged to motorcycles, registered carpools of three or more passengers, registered hybrid vehicles, and school and transit buses. Anyone else itching to use the lane less traveled pays a fee based on "congestion pricing," meaning the toll value changes with traffic load. The rate increases with demand, so drivers pay more to use the express lane when they need it most. The higher the toll, the busier the lanes. DOT keeps a weekly estimate of these rates. From Oct. 3 to Oct. 7, 2011, the toll in both lanes was 25 cents from midnight to 7 a.m. But in the southbound lane, which takes on a heavier load of morning commuters, the fee got as high as $3. Conversely, the fee peaked at $2.75 in the northbound lanes from 5 to 6 p.m. "They opt to pay the toll because they know they're going to have a more reliable trip," said Brian Rick, DOT District Six spokesman. The program has generated about $28 million since its debut, he said, or about $1 million a month. That money pays for maintenance of the program and express buses that use the lanes. The first phase of construction cost about $132 million, according to the first yearly overview of the program. The second phase reaching Fort Lauderdale will cost an expected $92.7 million and be finished by 2014. The express lanes reached their peak toll of $7.10 when fans piled on the highway after an Oct. 4, 2010, Miami Dolphins-New England Patriots game. That's a pretty steep fare at $1 per mile, earning the express lanes the nickname "Lexus lanes." Benefits Scott is right: converting high-occupancy vehicle lanes to express lanes speeds up traffic, the program overview shows. Traffic in both HOV and general lanes crawled below 20 mph during the morning and afternoon rush, according to a 2008 study of the HOV lanes. With the express lanes, southbound traffic in non-toll lanes jumped to an average 51 mph during morning rush hour, a 35.7 mph leap. In the northbound non-toll lanes during the afternoon rush, traffic sped up to 41.3 mph, improving by 22.5 mph. DOT puts it more simply on its website: "With the opening of the express lanes, drivers are experiencing improved speeds above 40 MPH in the local lanes and 50 MPH in the express lanes along the northbound and southbound directions during rush hour periods." A few caveats about DOT's numbers. The 2008 HOV study relied on peak periods of 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. In its evaluation of average speeds with 95 Express, DOT expanded the rush-hour periods by an additional hour from 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. Also, the southbound toll lanes did not open until Jan. 15, 2010, halfway through the 2009-10 fiscal year during which DOT collected its speed data for both lanes. There's also the number of vehicles using the highway to consider. The program improved peak-period speeds, but did it do the same for volume? The southbound section in 2008 took on an average of 6,872 vehicles in the HOV and general purpose lanes per hour during the morning peak period. In the northbound section, the 2008 hourly peak period figure was 7,843. In 2010 (keeping in mind the caveats we mentioned before) the southbound express and general purpose lanes moved a total of about 8,916 vehicles per morning rush hour, and 7,856 vehicles per hour in the northbound section in the afternoon. DOT has not completed its fiscal year 2011 report, but project manager Rory Santana said volume is improving as peak-period speeds stay the same. In an interview, he acknowledged the argument that traffic would have improved simply because DOT created a new lane. Still, he says, if DOT had just added an extra lane without the toll lanes and congestion pricing, "there's a very good chance that volume would have gone up right there and filled it up," Santana said. Scott and DOT Secretary Ananth Prasad want to expand the managed lanes program across the state. Prasad is seeking a public-private partnership to put new Express-style lanes on I-75 in Broward County, as well as adding a managed lane to Miami's Palmetto Expressway, according to an interview with the News Service of Florida. Our ruling A program overview for 95 Express shows Gov. Scott was about right when he said speeds for rush-hour traffic in non-toll lanes had improved from 25 mph to 45 mph. DOT's first study of the program shows traffic speeds during the peak periods were actually lower than 20 mph before the program. In 2010, traffic speeds during peak periods increased by 35 mph for southbound general lanes and by 22.5 mph in northbound general lanes. Still, Scott misidentified the program's location. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-10-28T10:02:44	2011-10-10	['Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida']
pomt-11886	"We have done more in eight months than the previous administration has done in many years" against ISIS.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/trump-takes-full-credit-gains-against-isis/	President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to hit the Islamic State hard, and the armed fundamentalist group has suffered major losses on his watch. In July, coalition forces broke ISIS' hold on Mosul, the largest Iraqi city under their control. In October, they were forced out of Raqqa, the Syrian city the Islamic State claimed as the capital of their would-be caliphate. During a news conference, Trump drew a sharp contrast with his predecessor in the White House. "We have done more in eight months than the previous administration has done in many years," Trump said Oct. 25. Based on numbers from the battlefield and the assessment of terrorism analysts, Trump can rightly claim that he built on the work done under President Barack Obama, but he can’t take full ownership of the gains that followed. Sorties and munitions Numbers tell only part of the story, but Pentagon figures on the missions flown and the explosives rained down on ISIS put the first months of the Trump administration into context. The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to U.S. Air Force Central Command data, coalition forces engaged the enemy nearly 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and September 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.) Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three-fourths of the action took place during the Obama years. The Air Force reports over 102,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. Over two-thirds of that came before Trump took office. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Loss of territory By late August 2014, the Islamic State controlled about 35,000 square miles. The defense data firm IHS Markit mapped the terrorist group’s declining influence between 2015 and 2017. The ISIS zones are in gray. The maps show that most of the territorial collapse of ISIS took place during the Trump administration. But defense experts say that what the maps don’t show are the offensive operations that began under Obama. The battle for Mosul, for example, began in October 2016, about four months before Trump took office. The collapse was a continuation of what had begun earlier. Between the start of 2015 and February 2016, IHS reported that ISIS had lost 22 percent of the territory it once controlled. A drawn-out effort Some defense analysts criticize Obama for not moving quickly enough to confront the Islamic State. Anthony Cordesman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the Obama administration was "grindingly slow" to get air power and equipment into the region. But that changed rapidly through 2015. "Virtually all were in place before the Trump administration came to office, along with virtually all of the key arms transfers and other assistance that went to Iraqi forces and the Syrian forces supported by the U.S," Cordesman said. Under Trump, the tempo of airstrikes increased, and military commanders were given greater leeway to order attacks. But Cordesman said that represented no great shift in overall strategy. "Trump deserves credit for fully implementing the plan and some limited improvements, but it is nonsense for him to take credit for a program his predecessor had largely put in place," he said. The Islamic State faced battles everywhere. It was under attack by the Iraqi and Syrian militaries. Kurdish and Syrian forces backed by the United States wore down ISIS fighters at strategically key locations. American and Russian airstrikes targeted both ISIS military centers and the oil fields that helped fund the fundamentalist fighters. William Braniff, executive director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said the Islamic State was an "impossibly poor nation-state fighting a multifront war while savaging its own economic base." It was, in Braniff’s view, unsustainable. "This beleaguered proto-state was then starved of external sources of money and fighters by an international effort, that included many initiatives led by the United States under the Obama administration, and that were continued into the Trump administration," Braniff said. We reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said his administration had done more against ISIS in the last eight months than the Obama administration had done in many years. Trump is correct in the sense that the Islamic State has suffered its largest territorial losses since he took office, but that confuses the timing with the cause. Between two-thirds and three-fourths of the firepower unleashed against ISIS hit before Trump became president. The terrorist group’s hold on territory had started to crumble a year before he took command. While Trump ordered some changes in the military operation, the experts we reached said those didn’t transform the strategy so much as continue the one he inherited from Obama. Trump can take credit for keeping the fight going, but he has to share the glory for the results. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13123	"One in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/03/mike-pence/mike-pence-right-1-5-us-households-dont-have-anyon/	On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has consistently criticized President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, echoed that theme during a campaign event in Cocoa Beach, Fla. "Literally, nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't working," Pence said at the Oct. 31 event. "You've got one in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job." We wondered whether Pence was right. We were able to find a statistic with roughly that figure, but it lacks important context. Pence’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we quickly found that several conservative websites all published similar articles last spring with headlines like, "One In Five American Families Don’t Have A Single Person Working A Job." We’ll set aside a technical distinction that will mostly irritate economists -- the difference between "families," which is the unit used in the data cited by the websites, and the broader term "households," which is the word Pence used. There are 81.4 million "families" in the United States, but there are 118.2 million "households," mainly because only "households" include single-person living arrangements. Ultimately, the differences between the two measures was modest -- 19.7 percent of families without any workers, compared to 26.7 percent of households. If these percentages were all that mattered, then Pence would be correct. But what he said ignores that many of those households without a working member consist of senior citizens who are retired. And unless Pence intends to shoo Grandma and Grandpa out of their Barcaloungers and into the workplace, he’s using a statistic that inflates the weakness of the labor market for Americans in their prime working years. How big a concern is this? Looking in federal statistical databases, we couldn’t find what percentage of households consisted of senior citizens. However, we were able to reverse-engineer it. We’ve streamlined the math by making some assumptions, but experts tell us the underlying method is solid. We’ll use "households" as our metric here, because that’s the term Pence used. (Using "families" would produce similar results.) According to the U.S. Census Bureau chart below, there were roughly 30 million households headed by someone 65 or older in 2015. Presumably most of these included a spouse who was also 65 or older. Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 19.5 percent of Americans 65 and over are in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for work). The flip side of this is that about 80 percent of Americans 65 and older are not in the labor force. As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, you can multiply the 30 million 65-and-over households by 80 percent -- the likelihood that someone of that age is not in the labor force -- and come up with an estimate of 24 million senior-citizen households in which no one working. These 24 million retiree households account for the vast majority of the 31.7 million total households in which no one is working. Essentially, it leaves 7.7 million households where no one is working for a reason other than retirement. These 7.7 million households account for just 6.5 percent of the nation’s 118.2 million households. And 6.5 percent is quite a bit smaller than the 20 percent figure Pence cited. By our math, about two-thirds of Pence’s non-working households can be explained by retirement -- a demographic issue that no president can reverse -- rather than by a shortage of jobs. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, cautioned that many households include someone who is 65 and older yet still working, and many households have someone younger than 65 who is either unable to work, due to disability, or who has chosen to go to school or stay home to raise children. "It is valid for political candidates to point to the disappointing employment-to-population ratio of adults, especially for American men between 25 and 54," he said. "But it is quite misleading to suggest there is something wrong with a country that makes it possible for adult students, disabled adults, and very aged adults to live comfortably and productively in families or households that do not contain a person working for pay." Our ruling Pence said, "One in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job." Pence has a point that, according to federal data, about one of every five families, and about one of every four households, does not include a worker. However, this glosses over the fact that a big majority of these households have no worker because they consist of senior citizens who have retired -- an entirely different policy concern than a weak labor market, and one whose demographic roots make it beyond the reach of the Obama administration. We rate Pence’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5c69165e-ef66-45f2-9fc8-6c6c7d2d21b3	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-11-03T11:59:35	2016-10-31	['United_States']
pomt-13825	Says Hillary Clinton "took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire" during the terrorist attack in Benghazi.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/mike-pence/pence-falsely-says-clinton-didnt-send-help-during-/	Vice presidential nominees are often expected to act as attack dogs on a campaign ticket. Maybe Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was warming up for the role at a rally for Donald Trump in Indiana on July 12. Pence rattled off a series of reasons Hillary Clinton was not fit for the presidency. One of them caught our attention, a claim about Benghazi, the Libyan city where a 2012 terrorist attack left four Americans dead. "We don't need a president that took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire and after four brave Americans fell said ‘what difference, at this point, does it make.’ Anyone who did that, anyone who said that, should be disqualified from ever being commander in chief of the armed forces," Pence said. President Barack Obama’s administration has been subject to a great deal of scrutiny during, before and after that attack, and much of that has been directed at Clinton. Several investigations have found, however, that no action by Clinton -- or anybody in the administration -- could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths. And if it were possible, Clinton was not responsible for sending help. That fell to military officials. The Benghazi timeline The attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi began at 9:40 p.m., Benghazi time. It took until after 10 a.m. the next morning for the last plane evacuating Americans to leave Benghazi — the time from the initial attack to the final evacuation is Pence’s "13 hours." (For a more detailed timeline, see this document issued by the House’s select committee on Benghazi or our fact-check of a claim about delays in the military’s response.) At an 11 p.m. meeting (5 p.m. Washington time), President Barack Obama directed military officials to "do everything possible" to save lives in Benghazi. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified that he then ordered forces around the Mediterranean to move toward Libya. Clinton’s department was ultimately responsible for the security setup at the Benghazi mission, but at this point it was the military, under the Defense Department and, ultimately, the president, that was moving forces toward Libya. None of the forces ordered to prepare to deploy to Benghazi ever reached the city in the aftermath of the attack. Eventually, it was decided that the Americans in Benghazi would evacuate to Tripoli, Libya's capital, and forces that would have gone to Benghazi were directed there, Libya’s capital, where they were being evacuated to. The CIA station chief in Tripoli — as opposed to anyone in Washington — dispatched a team to work with local militia groups to extract the Americans in Benghazi. Clinton was active throughout the 13-hour period. She testified that she called Libya’s president to see if friendly forces could be dispatched to help the Americans in Benghazi. She also spoke with the embassy in Tripoli and then-CIA director David Petraeus. There have been eight congressional investigations of Benghazi so far, most of which were run by Republicans. Several of their reports criticized Clinton and her State Department for the security setup in Benghazi, for their part in the administration messaging after the attack, and for not holding themselves accountable afterward. But they generally criticized the Defense Department or other parts of the administration, not Clinton or the State Department, for delays in deploying military assets the night of the attack. When Congressman Mike Pompeo asked Clinton, "Why was heaven and earth not moved at the initial sound of guns," in terms of sending help, Clinton told him to ask the Defense Department. The House select committee on Benghazi concluded: "The decisions made earlier in the year by senior State Department officials to maintain a presence in Benghazi without adequate security forces and an inadequately fortified Mission compound contributed to what amounted to a worst case scenario of circumstances that would test the military’s preparedness and ability to respond. "Nevertheless, the Defense Department did not pass the test." The committee went on to question why it took so long for orders from Obama and Panetta to translate into action on the ground. The committee’s final report leaves open the possibility that the State Department might have further impeded the speed of reaction to Benghazi. "Whether this failure is shouldered by (the Defense Department) alone, or rests in part on decisions made by the State Department in Washington D.C. or with the White House... is one of the lingering questions about Benghazi," the report reads. This brings up the possibility that the State Department delayed help, but that wasn’t Pence’s claim. And, based on the generally accepted timeline of the attack, its appears likely the delay ended up being immaterial. Different Republican-led congressional investigations have concluded that additional forces could not have reached Benghazi in time to matter. Even if Clinton was responsible for the response to the attack, it's not clear what she could have done to overcome what military officials called "the tyranny of time and distance." Our ruling Pence claimed that Clinton "took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire." In fact, it wasn’t Clinton’s responsibility to send troops to the scene — the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred. Pence implied that Clinton dawdled before sending help to Americans in danger. That is not accurate. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/16053b1b-0a59-4f24-ac3f-dcb041744f65	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-07-14T17:34:22	2016-07-12	['United_States', 'Benghazi']
pomt-14308	"Youth unemployment in minority communities is about 40 to 45 percent."	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/31/peter-kinder/peter-kinder-right-about-high-unemployment-minorit/	Candidates for Missouri’s GOP gubernatorial nomination have sparred over race relations, MU campus protests and the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. At a March 17 debate in Columbia, Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder said unemployment was a key cause of the events in Ferguson, saying, "Young men were walking around with nothing to do." "Minority youth unemployment is about 40 to 45 percent," Kinder said. The reasons for the unrest in Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown aren’t simple, but we wanted to determine whether Kinder’s numbers for youth unemployment in minority communities were on the money. Youth unemployment in Ferguson and the city of St. Louis Kinder’s office said the numbers came from a St. Louis Post-Dispatch column in 2014, which said 47 percent of the metro area’s African-American men between ages 16 and 24 were unemployed, according to 2012 census numbers. Peter Muesser, professor of labor economics at MU, said the youth jobless rate Kinder cited seemed to be in the correct range. "I’m seeing Kinder’s statement as likely reliable because it was based on Census Bureau info," he said. "The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau are the best sources when it comes to reliable unemployment statistics." The Census Bureau and the BLS work together, using annual and monthly surveys to define the unemployment rate and other measures of the American population. The Current Population Survey is more in-depth, but the American Community Survey has a bigger sample size, which allows for unemployment estimates from smaller geographical areas like cities and townships. According to the American Community Survey, the youth unemployment rates in 2014 for St. Louis City, Ferguson Township, and Ferguson City were significantly different. St. Louis City – 32 percent (16-19 years); 21 percent (20-24 years) Ferguson Township – 54 percent (16-19 years); 34 percent (20-24 years) Because Kinder specified youth unemployment in minority communities, we looked at the demographic makeup of both St. Louis City and Ferguson. St. Louis City – 126,452 white residents; 118,653 African American residents Ferguson – 9,178 white residents; 17,824 African American residents St. Louis has a comparable number of black and white residents. Ferguson has a significantly larger African-American population, with black residents outnumbering white residents by a 2-to-1 margin. The rate of African American unemployment in all age groups is historically twice that of white unemployment across the nation. Youth unemployment is no different – nationally, the unemployment rate for African Americans 16-24 is about 20 percent, while the unemployment rate for the same age group of whites is about 10 percent. Our Ruling The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data fits Ferguson into Kinder’s claim of youth unemployment of about 40 percent to 45 percent in minority communities. Defining which cities, suburbs and townships are "minority communities" is a matter of debate. But it’s worth noting that Ferguson’s youth are not only more unemployed than their peers in St. Louis , they are also significantly more unemployed on average than both white and black 16-24 year-olds across the country. Ferguson was the community in question when Kinder cited the rate of 40 percent to 45 percent of youth unemployment in minority communities — and Ferguson does fit into Kinder’s estimate. We rate Kinder’s statement as Mostly True.	None	Peter Kinder	None	None	None	2016-03-31T23:17:38	2016-03-17	['None']
pomt-06785	Says Rick Perry "wanted to secede from the union."	/texas/statements/2011/aug/17/jay-carney/white-house-press-secretary-says-perry-wanted-sece/	Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, brought up secession when a New York Times columnist asked about the latest Republican presidential aspirant, Texas Gov. Rick Perry. In her op-ed column posted online Aug. 16, 2011, Maureen Dowd describes the stumping Perry as galloping "through Iowa like an unbroken stallion in danger of cracking a leg." Her column notes that the governor called President Barack Obama "the greatest threat to our country" and questioned Obama’s patriotism and sense of duty. Also mentioned: Perry saying Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would be treated "ugly" in Texas for tackling the economic slump by printing more money. In Cedar Rapids on Aug. 15, Perry said "printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost ... treasonous in my opinion." Obama, Dowd writes, batted away the Texan. Her column then quotes Carney telling her: "We may disagree with our political opponents, but we certainly think they’re all patriots — even those who wanted to secede from the union." We take that as Obama's spokesman saying Perry wanted Texas to secede. But did Perry say that? Asked for backup information, White House spokesman Adam Abrams pointed us to an April 17, 2009, Austin American-Statesman news article recapping Perry’s response to an Associated Press reporter who had asked him about people associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas. Perry, who had just spoken at an April 15, 2009, Austin tea party rally, suggested Texans might at some point get so fed up with Democratic-led actions in Washington that they would want to secede. PolitiFact Texas later transcribed the exchange: Reporter Kelley Shannon: "Some have associated you with the idea of secession or sovereignty for your state..." Perry: "Oh, I think there’s a lot of different scenarios. Texas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that. "You know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention. We’ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we’re a pretty independent lot to boot." A day after the rally, the Statesman reported, Perry called potential secession a "side issue of Texas history. ... We are very proud of our Texas history; people discuss and debate the issues of can we break ourselves into five states, can we secede, a lot of interesting things that I'm sure Oklahoma and Pennsylvania would love to be able to say about their states, but the fact is, they can't because they're not Texas." As noted recently by the Texas Tribune, Perry also touched on secession before the rally. He’s heard in audio accompanied by still photographs posted on YouTube in March 2009 telling tech bloggers visiting him in his Capitol office that from its beginnings as a state, "one of the deals was" that Texas could leave the union "any time we want." Perry continues on the recording: "So we’re kind of thinking about that again." His guests laughed. An anonymous Texas blogger takes credit here for putting the audio and pictures together. This week, we reached one of the tech bloggers, Robert Scoble of Half Moon Bay, Calif., who said the meeting occurred because the bloggers were in Austin for a conference. He said the visitors thought Perry "was being funny. I always thought" Perry’s secession reference "was just Texas bragging" mixed with Perry’s disappointment in the country’s direction. By email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said she has no details about the meeting. She said, though: "The governor was not advocating secession. He never has and he never will." After Perry made his April 2009 comment, a Perry spokeswoman told the Statesman that Perry believes Texas could secede if it wanted. Not so, advised Sanford Levinson, a professor at the School of Law at the University of Texas at Austin, saying that between the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and the 1845 Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States, there is no explicit right for the state to return to its days as a republic. "We actually fought a war over this issue, and there is no possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a 'right' to secede," Levinson said in an e-mail. Levinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows for Texas to break itself into five states but doesn't specify whether that would require congressional approval — and forming new states still wouldn't constitute secession. That was hardly the end of the issue. In April 2010, Perry said in an interview with Newsweek and the Texas Tribune he wanted to clear up his reply on secession the year before. "It was asked as a, you know, what do you think about the people who shout out the word 'secede.' And I say that we live in an incredibly wonderful country and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen. …" We rated Perry’s recap of his 2009 remarks Mostly True because he didn’t acknowledge in the later interview either his position that Texas has the right to secede or his initial speculation about "who knows what may come" from people angry about actions in Washington. Also, in June 2010, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said Perry had threatened to secede, a claim we rated False. Via the Nexis search tool, we found 169 major newspaper articles as of that time linking Perry and secession. But none quoted Perry threatening to push for secession, though critics and comedians framed his words in that way. Our conclusion was that in a politically theatrical moment, Perry stated an old (and factually incorrect) claim that Texas retains the right to leave the union. That is not the same as his saying giddyap, I want to leave. Perry didn’t call for secession then and hasn’t since. We rate Carney’s statement False.

pomt-07536	Says "some [states] with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population."	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/05/newt-gingrich/gingrich-states-should-consider-alternatives-priso/	In the wake of the Great Recession, some conservative political leaders are considering a new portion of the state budget to save money -- the prison system. Gov. Nathan Deal has talked about his desire to find less costly alternatives to prison for drug addicts who commit nonviolent crimes. "It is draining our state treasury and depleting our workforce," Deal said in his inaugural address. It seems some of this new thinking comes from conservative mastermind Newt Gingrich, the former Georgia congressman and one-time U.S. House speaker who says he is considering a run for president. Gingrich co-wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post a few days before Deal’s speech that contained similar themes. "The criminal justice system is broken, and conservatives must lead the way in fixing it," wrote Gingrich and Pat Nolan, a former California lawmaker who is now vice president of a Christian ministry that aids prisoners, ex-prisoners and their families. "Some people attribute the nation’s recent drop in crime to more people being locked up. But the facts show otherwise," they added. "While crime fell in nearly every state over the past seven years, some of those with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population." AJC PolitiFact Georgia stumbled upon the second sentence late last week and wondered whether it was true. Wouldn’t the reason why some states have less crime is because more criminals are in prison? A Gingrich spokesman pointed to data from states such as Texas to make the former speaker’s case. In 2007, Texas lawmakers approved broad changes to the state’s correctional system -- then the nation’s largest -- that included more drug courts and treatment programs, The New York Times reported. Crime, Gingrich and Nolan wrote, dropped 10 percent between 2004 and 2009, and the Lone Star State is expected to save about $2 billion in prison costs over five years. Gingrich and Nolan also compared New York and Florida to further prove their point. "Over the past seven years, Florida's incarceration rate has increased 16 percent, while New York's decreased 16 percent," they wrote. "Yet the crime rate in New York has fallen twice as much as Florida's. Put another way, although New York spent less on its prisons, it delivered better public safety." We looked around to see whether anyone has done research on this topic. The Washington-based Pew Center on the States puts together an annual report on the prison population of each state. Its most recent annual report, released in April 2010, found the number of state inmates in America declined for the first time in 38 years. Between 1972 and 2008, the number of state prisoners grew by an astounding 708 percent, Pew found. The Pew Center has also done research, using data from the federal government, on the nation’s crime rate. It shared two charts: one with the change in crime rate between 1999 and 2009; the other contained the incarceration rate change during that same time period. The Pew research showed four of the 10 states with the greatest drops in crime were also among the top 10 states in lowering their incarceration rates. Those four states were Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Utah. The six other states had increases in their incarceration rates. Texas, which Gingrich and Nolan held up as an example of their theory, had a 10 percent drop in crime and a 15 percent decline in its incarceration rate. Georgia, by the way, had a 21 percent decrease in crime and a 1 percent decrease in its incarceration rate, according to Pew’s data. The Peach State did not rank in the top 10 in either category. We also looked at data from the federal National Institute of Corrections, which compiled 2008 crime statistics from several state and federal agencies and the incarceration rates in 2009. Seven of the 10 states with the lowest crime rates also had among the 15 lowest incarceration rates. Those seven states were Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota and Vermont. Georgia had the eighth-highest crime rate and incarceration rate. Florida and Texas ranked among the top 10 highest crime rates and incarceration rates. So are some of these states making a concerted attempt to leave more space in their prisons? Texas is trying to change its approach in order to save money on incarceration, Gingrich and The New York Times noted. In Oregon, where officials say the crime rate is at its lowest rate in four decades, the state’s Criminal Justice Commission analyzed five-year intervals of the state’s incarceration rate, the Portland Oregonian reported. Oregon had a 36 percent decrease in crime between 1999 and 2009, the largest decrease in the nation, according to the Pew data. The commission found major drops in both violent and property crime from 1995 through 2000, when Oregon's prison population grew more than 50 percent, the Oregonian reported. It also showed that when incarceration remained fairly flat from 2005 to 2008, violent crime and property crime continued to fall. Then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat, has used the lack of growth in the prison system to argue that Oregon should not "overinvest in our prison system." Others in the Oregonian article suggest the lower crime rate is a result of an aging population and efforts to reduce the production of a key ingredient of methamphetamine. There is some debate about what factors are causing a decline in crime. Gingrich and Nolan argued that "some" states with major reductions in crime have also had large drops in their incarceration rate. The Pew figures provide support to Gingrich’s point. So does the National Institute of Corrections data. Therefore, we rate Gingrich’s statement as True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-04-05T06:00:00	2011-01-07	['None']
pomt-09111	“The Republican Party lost 1.1 million registered voters since 2008. The Democratic Party lost 1.2 million registered voters… (while) voter registration in the Libertarian Party rose 8 percent.”	/texas/statements/2010/jun/19/libertarian-party-texas/libertarian-party-says-major-parties-have-shed-reg/	Just before the Libertarian Party of Texas held its state convention, it suggested its fortunes are rising while the two major political parties are on the decline. “The Republican Party lost 1.1 million registered voters since 2008,” the Libertarians said in a June 7 press release. “The Democratic Party lost 1.2 million registered voters in that time period. There is one exception: the Libertarian Party. Over the same time frame, voter registration in the Libertarian Party rose 8 percent.” Did the major parties bleed voters while the LPT surged? Significantly, party affiliations based on voter registration records can only be gauged in the 29 states that allow citizens to declare an affiliation when they register. Texas is among 21 states that don’t permit voters to air a preference at registration time. To back up its claim, the Texas party’s release cites a blog post on smallgovtimes.com. We found that post largely based on research by Michael McDonald, an associate professor of Public and International Affairs at George Mason University. McDonald cites his research in two May posts at Pollster.com. In his first post, McDonald writes that since the 2008 election, voters registering as Democrats are down by 2.7 percent and voters registering as Republicans have dropped 3.5 percent in those states where voters are allowed to register an affiliation. Voters registering their affiliation with a minor party increased by 2.4 percent, he writes. Still, McDonald does not see an incipient minor-party revolution afoot. “America is a long way from having a viable multi-party system at the federal level, like we are currently witnessing in the United Kingdom,” he says in his second post. “However, these trends are consistent with the notion that some American voters are willing to express their frustration with the major parties by registering with a minor political party or affiliating with no party. Indeed, the increase in unaffiliated registrations is a long-term phenomenon observed since the 1970s.” We contacted McDonald in hopes of boring in on Libertarian voter registrations. He told us he did not separately calculate registration for minor parties, but referred us to Richard Winger, a Libertarian himself and the editor of Ballot Access News, a monthly newsletter. A May 26 blog post by Winger says Libertarian registrations in places that allow registration by party are up 8 percent since October 2008 — the figure cited in the release from the Texas Libertarians. Generally, Winger writes, more “voters are registered Libertarians now than ever before. Between October 2008 and this spring, Libertarian registration rose in 19 of the 23 states that tally Libertarians. It declined in four states, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and South Dakota,” a state where the party has not been on the ballot since 2006. Professor McDonald told us he still doesn’t see Libertarians succeeding at the polls unless, he said, they move en masse to, say, lightly populated Wyoming. “They’re not concentrated enough in one state or district in order to win elections,” he said. Here’s why: Regardless of cited changes in party affiliation percentage-wise, the raw numbers of voters registering affiliations underscore the dominance of the major parties. As researched by McDonald, some 43.3 million voters now line up as Democrats, while 29.9 million align as Republicans. Meanwhile, 2.2 million voters are registered as members of minor parties. As of May, according to Winger’s research, more than 259,000 voters had registered affiliations with the Libertarian Party. Even if we assume that some of nearly 23.6 million unaffiliated voters in states where voters can register their affiliations end up supporting Libertarians at the polls, their numerical share of the electorate is swamped by either of the major parties. In elections, numbers are everything. That brings us to a statistical problem with the Libertarian’s statement: it compares a reduction in numbers (how many voters fell off the Democratic and Republican rolls) with an increase in a percentage (the share of voters affiliated with the Libertarian party). Patrick Dixon of Lago Vista, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Texas, told us that’s how the information was presented on the cited online sources. “Maybe I was a little lazy there,” Dixon said. Regardless, he said, the trend is that “our party is growing and theirs are shrinking or growing flat.” In fact, McDonald’s breakdown, shown on a chart in his first May blog post, tracks registrations both by raw numbers and percentages for the two major parties and all minor parties lumped together. Upshot: Based on voter registrations in 29 states that allow voters to declare their party affiliation, the statistics cited by the Libertarian Party are correct. But comparing raw numbers and percentages to make a point, as the Libertarians do, can leave a distorted impression: that the major parties are fading away as the Libertarians gallop ahead. Voter for voter, that’s at least an incomplete characterization. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-13397	Says Donald Trump once suggested that he "would try to negotiate down the national debt."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-has-said-he-woul/	During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump fought about his statements on the national debt. Clinton said, "You even one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States." As she spoke, Trump interjected, "Wrong. Wrong." We did not get a reply from the Trump campaign on the night of the debate. The Trump campaign also did not respond when we looked at his debt comments in May. Clinton is correct that Trump did talk about negotiating down the debt, but he backtracked on his views after economists panned his idea. Trump’s debt statements Clinton’s attack stems from comments Trump made about the national debt in two separate interviews in May. Trump’s initial remarks came in an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick on May 5, 2016. Sorkin: "Mr. Trump, you talk about debt. And you are to some degree the king of debt. I appreciate that point. You have also renegotiated debt agreements over the years. Do you believe that we, in terms of the United States, need to pay 100 cents on the dollar, or do you think that there's actually ways that we can renegotiate that debt?" Trump: "Yeah, I think -- look. I have borrowed, knowing that you can pay back with discounts. And I have done very well with debt. Now, of course, I was swashbuckling, and it did well for me and it was good for me and all that. And you know, debt was sort of always interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with the country. But I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can't lose. It's like, you know, you make a deal before you go into a poker game, and your odds are so much better." ... Quick: "I understand that you've done this in business deals, but are you suggesting we would negotiate with the U.S. credit in such a way?" Trump: "No, I think this. I think there are times for us to refinance. We refinance debt with longer term. Because you know, we owe so much money. … I could see long-term renegotiations, where we borrow long-term at very low rates." ... Quick: "But let's be clear. I mean, you're not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the U.S. has already issued?" Trump: "No. I don't want to renegotiate the bonds. But I think you can do discounting, I think, you know, depending on where interest rates are, I think you can buy back. You can -- I'm not talking about with a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts, you can do things with discounts. … I would refinance debt. I think we should refinance longer-term debt." The second comments came in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, on May 9, 2016. Trump: "I’m only saying you can buy back. Look, this isn’t a real estate deal where you can go in and buy out a mortgage at a big discount because the market crashes, okay? This is the United States government. The bonds are absolutely sacred. … I’m saying if interest rates go up, you can buy debt at a discount on the market — just on the market. You just buy back debt on — at a discount." Wall Street Journal: "And so the U.S. government should spend its money to go buy back its bonds and --" Trump: "Well, if they can make good deals. If they can buy the debt back at good deals, you could buy it back in the market. And if rates go up, you’ll always — you’re always given that opportunity. But no, I’m not talking about negotiating with — with people that own the debt or creditors or anything like that." He tried to clarify his remarks in an interview on CNN May 9, and said that his comments had been misrepresented by the media. "If interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back at a discount, if we are liquid enough as a country, we should do that. In other words, we can buy back debt at a discount," he said. "People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and these people are crazy." Experts told PolitiFact in May that Trump’s statements were unclear and that he confused the concepts of "discount," "refinance," and "renegotiate." (We provided a more detailed discussion of the consequences of what he seemed to argue for in this article.) "The statements are neither clear nor coherent," said Paolo Mauro, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School when PolitiFact asked him about it in May. On the night of the first presidential debate, Dean Baker, an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said that Trump’s comments "didn’t make any sense." "The U.S. has the strongest possible credit rating because it has always paid its debt," he said. "It would pay an enormous price if he tried to negotiate a write-down. We would pay higher interest rates for many decades in the future.More importantly, with the ratio of interest payments to (gross domestic product) at 50-year lows, it is hard to see why anyone would try to do this." "No one on the other side would pick up the phone if the secretary of the U.S. Treasury tried to make that call," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a firm that analyzes Federal Reserve operations, economic data and Treasury financing trends, told the New York Times. "Why should they? They have a contract" requiring payment in full. Our ruling Clinton said Trump one time suggested that he "would try to negotiate down the national debt." In two separate interviews in May, Trump suggested that he could do something to negotiate federal debt through "discounting" and that he would "refinance debt" and "buy back debt on — at a discount." He backtracked after criticism, saying his words had been misinterpreted.

pomt-09320	Says Republican state leaders are using "Soviet-style" budget management.	/texas/statements/2010/apr/15/bill-white/bill-white-objects-what-he-calls-soviet-style-budg/	In a public interview hosted by the Austin-based Texas Tribune, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White compared Republican leadership on state budget woes to how things swung in ye olde U.S.S.R. You remember, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -- home of the late dictator Joseph Stalin and run single-handedly by the Communist Party prior to the government's collapse in 1991. White said March 9 he’d take a more deliberate approach to spending than the state's top leaders, all Republican, who asked government agencies in January to suggest ways to cut their budgets by 5 percent. White said if he's in charge, "it won’t be done by things that are just across the board, Soviet style, you know, budget management that only career politicians seem to embrace." Pressed by interviewer Evan Smith, White said: "Is it just a coincidence that 5 percent is the appropriate amount for each state agency?... No. It’s because that’s the way that career politicians know how to run government." We started our review of White's statement wondering what "Soviet-style" budget management means. Several expert professors said that historically, the term didn't refer to across-the-board budget cuts. Professor Paul Gregory of the University of Houston Department of History said "Soviet style" makes him think of a monopoly party (in this case, the Communist Party) dictating everything to subordinates without any possibility of change. Gregory said Soviet-style budgeting also means hiding expenditures you don’t want people to see—such as massive investments in military infrastructure. Peter Caldwell, a Rice University professor of history, said budget-writing in the Soviet Union most often consisted of “huge and crude” decisions to invest in one part of the economy at the expense of another. And H. Stephen Gardner, chairman of the Baylor University Department of Economics, said he’d define Soviet-style management as overly centralized as opposed to giving autonomy to individual units of government. So are there "Soviet style" ways that state leaders have approached the budget? Some background: In January, Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus--mindful of a projected state revenue shortfall that could reach $15 billion by next January--jointly asked agencies to submit plans identifying savings in 5 percent “priority increments” in their 2010-11 appropriations from state revenue. Such plans could lead to cuts, though no decisions have been made and some programs have already been excused. No doubt, the leaders' request is a centralized one. But is it Soviet-style in any other way? We turned to White for elaboration. White’s campaign pointed us to a statement issued by White, the former Houston mayor, in January: “Well-run organizations cut spending based on priorities and where they can best attain productivity improvements. So, for example, in the city of Houston we made smaller cuts in public safety because that was the highest priority. And we were able to cut more in garbage collection and disposal through productivity improvements.” White then told us that by "Soviet style," he doesn't mean that Texas state government owns the means of production, as in the Soviet Union. “Obviously we have a market system,” White said. He described his alternative approach to the looming revenue gap, saying that as governor, he'd focus on funding priorities such as education while encouraging agencies to improve productivity via "process re-engineering" without hurting the delivery of services to taxpayers. He said the state also would seek savings by renegotiating vendor contracts. Also, he said, there’d be regular meetings with agency chiefs to talk about how they’re cutting spending and avoiding non-essential hirings. “I would have had reports back to me weekly and monthly concerning the efficiencies identified,” White said. We didn't get to why White considers the existing approach "Soviet style" before he had to go. We asked the professors if "Soviet style" accurately characterizes the GOP leaders' request for proposed budget cuts. Gregory said describing the request from Perry, et al. that way “doesn’t seem to have any relevance to what was actually practiced in the Soviet Union. ... It's inappropriate to use that term." Gardner agreed, saying: "It’s a bit hyperbolic to refer to this (budget cutting) as Soviet style. I should admit I have done exactly the same thing myself on matters of budgeting.” The point of saying as much, Gardner said, is to elicit an emotional reaction. He added that Republicans who cast President Barack Obama as socialist — Perry has told reporters he thinks Obama has socialist beliefs — are likewise guilty of hyperbole for dramatic effect. The professor, who said he considers Obama a centrist, speculated that Noam Chomsky, a left-leaning linguist who writes on public affairs, would call the president a "crazed capitalist." "If White’s point is that budget management is being handled in an overly centralized way," Gardner said, "I can see the element of truth there. The problem I would have is even if you say I am going to be more careful and more surgically look at the right places to cut, you’re still using a more centralized approach.” Caldwell agreed with the psychological impact, if not the accuracy, of "Soviet style." Generally, he said, “anyone who ever mentions the Soviet economy or Naziism when they’re talking about American domestic debate is usually off track. They’re referring to crude examples to raise the stakes of a debate. They’re not necessarily wanting a careful, rational debate. Who in America wants the Soviet economy or supports Naziism?” Our conclusion? The GOP leaders' request that agencies submit proposed budget cuts isn’t Soviet style — not even close. At best, White's statement is an example of how politicians try to light up a room. It's so off base, we're lighting up the meter: Pants on Fire!

pomt-05250	Says in the last six months of the Bush administration, the U.S. lost 3.5 million jobs, including 760,000 jobs during January 2009 alone.	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/01/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-35-million-jobs-lost-during-bush-ad/	Vice President Joe Biden spent a lot of time in New Hampshire during the 2008 election, both as a candidate himself and as President Barack Obama’s running mate. So, when he returned to the Granite State earlier this month, he looked back to 2008 and the economic turmoil that year. Speaking May 22 to a crowd at Keene State College, Biden referred to the start of the national recession in the fall of 2008 and to the failing economy he and Obama inherited when they came into office. "In the last six months of the Bush administration, we lost 3.5 million jobs," Biden told the crowd. "As a matter of fact, on that magnificent day … when we were sworn in, before I lowered my hand that day after taking the oath … we’d already lost over 760,000 jobs that month." Claims and blames like this have become a rallying cry of sorts for Obama’s re-election campaign. But, are they true? PolitiFact decided to take a look. The source of the numbers wasn’t hard to find. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks employment numbers from month to month dating back to 1939. The data from the last six months of the Bush administration supports Biden’s claim. A search of the job figures from July 2008 through January 2009 shows the country lost 3.47 million jobs during that time, falling from 137 million from July 2008 to 133.6 million in January 2009, according to the bureau’s monthly count. Those figures, which are seasonally adjusted, are based on payroll surveys collected the 12th of each month from 141,000 businesses and government agencies across 486,000 locations, according to Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the labor statistics bureau. The labor statistics show that job losses started to mount before the end of the Bush administration. Driven by the bursting housing bubble, the country lost 84,000 jobs between January and February 2008. But the job losses grew, reaching 200,000 in April. And by September, when Lehman Brothers collapsed in the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, job losses spiked again, reaching 489,000 in October and 803,000 in November. When Obama and Biden took office in January 2009, the country had already lost 818,000 jobs from the prior month, falling from 134.4 million in December 2008 to 133.6 million in January. But, if you pro-rate those figures to the Jan. 20 inauguration date referenced by Biden, the economy would have lost about 527,000 jobs, roughly two-thirds of the month’s total. That number falls below Biden’s claim of 760,000 jobs lost by the time he took office. The steep job losses continued through the first few months of the Obama presidency, which lost 3.4 million from February through July 2009, according to the labor data. In October 2010, the economy started adding jobs, and job growth has been evident for 19 consecutive months, according to the labor figures. In total, the economy has lost 1.4 million jobs since Obama and Biden took office. "It had gotten bad by (the time they came into office)," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. "Regardless of political leanings, it is not ambiguous that Obama inherited a labor market in free fall." Our ruling: The economic recovery and job creation during the Obama administration will be a leading point of contention throughout the 2012 election. As for the labor situation Obama and Biden inherited when they came to office, there’s little room for debate. Federal labor statistics support Biden’s claim that the country lost 3.5 million jobs in the last six months of the Bush administration, but they show he overstated the losses reported by inauguration day, Jan. 20, 2009. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2012-06-01T06:53:15	2012-05-22	['United_States', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-04688	"We have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/06/choose-new-jersey/new-jersey-leads-world-number-scientists-engineers/	New Jersey has long held the title of most densely populated state in the country. But the Garden State has an even more prestigious ranking, according to a recent advertisement placed by Choose: New Jersey in the Wall Street Journal. The July 30 ad reads in part: "New Jersey has a rich tradition of bringing the world some very big thinking. In fact, we have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world, making ours one of the most highly skilled and educated workforces available." That’s quite a claim for any state to make so for this fact check, we are focusing only on the statistic about scientists and engineers. And it seems Choose: New Jersey’s calculations add up. Let’s look at how Choose: New Jersey, a nonprofit group that markets the state to attract businesses and jobs, came up with their statistic. Choose: New Jersey is part of the Partnership For Action, the Business Action Center and state Economic Development Authority. Melissa Hensley, chief marketing officer for the group, said the group compared geographic and employment data from four organizations: the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, the CIA’s World Fact Book 2012, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the National Science Board. "All of it came down to an apples-to-apples comparison to the extent possible between a state and country," Hensley said. The Census Bureau’s Population Reference Bureau listed New Jersey as having 260,655 scientists and engineers in 2010. That number divided by New Jersey’s total land area of 8,722.58 square miles equals 29.88 scientists and engineers – the highest number among all states and a list of 37 countries. "I read somewhere that New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the U.S., so I guess you could extrapolate from that that there are more scientists per square mile than anywhere else," Brian Bell, a spokesman for the California Institute of Technology said in an e-mail. "Although Massachusetts might give N.J. a run for its money. California has lots of smart people, but we have huge deserts and lots of empty space too." Bell’s guess is accurate. Massachusetts has the second highest number of scientists and engineers, at 23.47 per square mile, followed by Maryland, at 20.97. California is 10th on the list. A similar calculation was used for other countries by measuring the number of researchers – a more broad term that includes scientists and engineers – per 1,000 of employed people. Breaking that figure down and comparing it against country size, we determined that Israel tops the international list, with 5.10 scientists and engineers per square mile (Choose: New Jersey’s calculations were adjusted to consider countries in square miles instead of kilometers). Rounding out the top three are Japan, at 4.46, and Belgium, at 3.16. If both lists are put together, New Jersey and 11 other U.S. states lead the world in number of engineers and scientists per square mile before Israel joins the rankings. "The numbers reflect what we regularly hear from businesses considering locating or expanding in New Jersey – that if a company is looking to benefit from a high concentration of very skilled talent, New Jersey is a prime location," Hensley said in response to our findings. Our ruling Choose: New Jersey said in an advertisement that "we have more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world," making the state’s workforce one of the most skilled and highly educated. Choose: New Jersey used a variety of data to reach its conclusion, from the U.S. Census Bureau to the CIA World Fact Book and more. PolitiFact New Jersey vetted the calculations and found that the Garden State does top the world in number of scientists and engineers per square mile: 29.8. We rate this statement True.

pomt-05316	Obama promised to cut the deficit by half by the end of his first term but he "hasn't even come close."	/florida/statements/2012/may/17/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-ad-says-obama-failed-keep-pledge-ha/	President Barack Obama is failing to deliver on his promises, insists a new attack ad from conservative group Crossroads GPS. The TV commercial, airing in Florida and nine other states through May 31, 2012, lists a few examples relating to foreclosures, taxes and Obama’s health care plan. We plan to fact-check each claim, but for now we’ll address one about the deficit. (See our other stories on past claims from Crossroads GPS.) The ad shows a clip of Obama at a press conference where he says, "Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office." A narrator deems that a broken promise over the sound of shattered glass, adding that Obama "hasn’t even come close." Spoiler alert: We’ve already checked out this issue a few times. In short, the claim about the deficit -- the difference between government spends and takes in -- is accurate. Obama indeed made the pledge on Feb. 23, 2009, following a "Fiscal Responsibility Summit" shortly after his inauguration. (Watch more of his remarks that day.) He said then that the nation’s $1.3 trillion deficit was the largest in the nation’s history. It was mostly unchanged through fiscal year 2011. In 2012? It’s expected to be $1.17 trillion. So not cut in half. That’s according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in a March 2012 report. "Although the deficit is starting to shrink, it remains very large by historical standards," the CBO noted. PolitiFact Florida asked the Obama campaign about the pledge as part of a fact-check along the same lines from Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry. The campaign pointed us to Obama’s response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012. "Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized," he said. "Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. …" Obama promised to halve the nation’s deficit, but he hasn’t managed to chip away much as the end of his first term nears.

pomt-04951	"In 2010, Mr. [Anthony] Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. Now, he claims to be pro-choice."	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/27/naral-pro-choice/abortion-rights-group-says-democratic-congressiona/	On July 19, the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America announced that it was endorsing incumbent David Cicilline for reelection to Congress over his Democratic primary opponent, Anthony Gemma, who also ran for the seat in 2010. The group cited Cicilline's consistent support for abortion rights, accusing Gemma of "attempting a make-over" on the issue of whether abortion should continue to be legal. In a news release, NARAL President Nancy Keenan said the endorsement "is a matter of consistency versus conflicting statements" and that Gemma was calling himself a "pro-life Democrat" as recently as April 16, during a radio interview. "In 2010, Mr. Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate," Keenan said. "Now he claims to be pro-choice. My fear is that Mr. Gemma wants to hop on the pro-choice bandwagon as the anti-choice agenda unfolding in the House is becoming more and more unpopular." We thought readers might want to know whether Gemma really has done a major turnaround in two years. So we took a trip back in time (actually we checked our news archive), to when Gemma announced his original candidacy June 15, 2010. "How would you describe a Democrat who supports gay marriage, a Democrat who is pro-life, except in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother, a Democrat who opposes the death penalty, a Democrat who is pro-business when business is pro-Rhode Island, who is pro-labor when labor is pro-Rhode Island?" he said during a speech at Providence Place mall. He would repeat those views throughout the 2010 campaign. Fast forward to April 16, 2012. On WHJJ, Gemma told talk-radio host Helen Glover, "I'm a pro-life Democrat." But he also made it clear that he objected to Republican efforts to put limits on what women could choose for birth control and said that his personal pro-life beliefs would not affect how he voted on the issue. "I'm not in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade. I'm not even going near there," he said. "My beliefs will not affect where everyone's going here. Women have their own right to choose." And in a July 5 news release with the headline "Anthony Gemma Outlines Women’s Health Care Position/States He Will Defend a Woman’s Right to Choose," Gemma said the issue of family planning choices "is something I personally wrestle with everyday. "But I know I must put my personal religious beliefs aside, and defend a women's (sic) right to choose. The actions of Republicans in Congress and state legislatures are horrifying. I could never vote for an anti-choice bill. Women must be able to make this personal decision for themselves." The statement never used the word abortion but it seemed clear he was talking about abortion rights. Spokesman Alex Morash acknowledged that Gemma's position had evolved because the candidate has become "more understanding of other people's beliefs." When we inquired further for this story, Gemma e-mailed us a statement that said, in part: "My commitments to defend a woman’s right to choose and to preserve and strengthen Roe v. Wade are born of deep contemplation. To an appreciable degree my change was spurred by Republicans’ ongoing efforts -- supported by the likes of Brendan Doherty [the Republican running for the seat] -- to return America to a dark age when women were second-class citizens whose most intimate health choices were made by men." Finally, we asked NARAL Pro-Choice America about the organization's assessment of whether Gemma belonged in the "pro-choice" category, given his pledge and his personal feelings. Part of their response: "We remain skeptical of Anthony Gemma's sudden jump to support a woman's right to choose while labeling himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. His position contradicts how he frames his values." Our ruling NARAL Pro-Choice America said: "In 2010, [Anthony] Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. Now he claims to be pro-choice." It's clear that Gemma's position on abortion rights has changed. He went from saying that he supported a woman’s right to abortion only in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother, to saying he would defend a woman's right to choose when it comes to health care and family planning options, although his statement doesn't specifically mention abortion. He may be calling himself a "pro-life Democrat" in the same breath, but when the candidate says, "I vow to protect a woman's right to choose," he's trying to put himself in the "pro-choice" camp. NARAL says Gemma changed his position after his appearance on WHJJ. Clearly it predates that. But that's a side issue. When NARAL says Gemma has gone from being a "pro-life" candidate to calling himself a "pro-choice" one, we judge that statement to be True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-06515	"Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations."	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/11/eva-galambos/mayor-admits-error-beltline-connection-claim/	Ah, deadlines. For many, they bring panic. In one current case among metro Atlanta elected officials, a coming deadline has resulted in some attempted horse-trading and an interesting 11th-hour debate. County commissioners and mayors across the 10-county region are attempting to finalize a list by Oct. 15 of transportation projects that area residents will vote on next year, along with a 1 percent sales tax to fund those projects. One area they’re debating is a proposal to spend about $602 million on transit projects along the Atlanta Beltline. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed wrote an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution arguing for money for the effort, which is located in the city limits and he argues will benefit the region. Sandy Springs Mayor Eva Galambos countered in a separate op-ed in the AJC that the $602 million should be spent on other projects that will better serve the region. "These are worthy purposes for the city of Atlanta, but they are not related to relieving the Atlanta region’s traffic congestion," Galambos wrote, referring to the Beltline. "A close examination of the Beltline website map reveals an astounding fact: Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations." An astounding fact! Such a claim seemed ideal for PolitiFact Georgia. The Atlanta Beltline is a 22-mile loop of largely unused railroad tracks that circle around the core of Georgia’s capital city. Atlanta political and business leaders embraced a Georgia Tech graduate student’s suggestion to make better use of those lines and began an effort several years ago to build more homes, office space, parks and trails and construct a light-rail line along the Beltline. The effort is expected to take at least another decade before it is completed. Beltline spokesman Ethan Davidson sent us an e-mail contending that Galambos was wrong. "This is absolutely false ... the Atlanta Beltline corridor will have at least three additional connections to MARTA at the following areas: Lindbergh/Armour, Inman Park/Reynoldstown and West End/Oakland City," Davidson wrote. He also sent us a YouTube video by the Beltline that says the Beltline environmental impact study area intersects with six MARTA stations. The study area extends a quarter-mile east and west of the Beltline’s existing and former rail lines. We looked at the same Beltline map that Galambos referred to when we talked to her. We spotted two MARTA stations that seemed to connect to the Beltline: Inman Park/Reynoldstown and Lindbergh Center. Davidson explained that there are plans to connect the Beltline to the West End/Oakland City station. "[The Beltline] doesn’t work if it doesn’t connect to MARTA. … That’s the whole point of it," Davidson said. In response to what we found, and the Beltline’s argument, Galambos told us that the Lindbergh Center station did connect with the Beltline. Galambos admitted she erred in not saying the Beltline connects with the Lindbergh station. "That one is on the map," she said of Lindbergh. The mayor said her point about the Lindbergh MARTA station is that connecting it to the Beltline there won’t help more people across the region to get around. "In terms of service, I didn’t word it correctly," Galambos told us. "In terms of additional connectivity, we’re not getting any." Galambos admitted she made a mistake by writing that the Beltline doesn’t intersect MARTA at any of its stations. We thank her for her honesty. Still, her article went off the tracks on that point. We must give her a rating of False.	None	Eva Galambos	None	None	None	2011-10-11T06:00:00	2011-09-27	['Metropolitan_Atlanta_Rapid_Transit_Authority']
pomt-03939	"The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/20/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-says-obama-ignores-border-fence-law/	In a searing call to action that appeared in the conservative Daily Caller, the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre encouraged Americans to arm themselves, join the NRA and recruit others in preparation against the growing threats of terrorism, economic instability and the policies of the Obama administration. "It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people," LaPierre wrote. "During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing." He cited drug gangs and other criminals who enter the United States through the southern border. They get in, LaPierre said, because "the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border." Flagrant defiance? We decided to examine whether it’s true that President Barack Obama is bucking a law requiring construction of a such a fence. Secure Fence Act of 2006 We did not hear back from the NRA for this story. But the 2006 law directing fence construction is the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico. The act specified "at least two layers of reinforced fencing." One thing it did not do: require a fence to be built "along the entire Mexican border," as LaPierre claimed. Instead, it directed that specific segments of the border -- "extending from 10 miles west of the Tecate, California, port of entry to 10 miles east of the Tecate, California, port of entry," for example -- be double-fenced. The fenced segments totaled roughly 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is about 2,000 miles long. Obama, an Illinois senator at the time, voted for the law. The following year, the legislation underwent a significant change. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security argued that different border terrains required different types of fencing -- that a one-size-fits-all approach across the entire border didn't make sense. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, proposed an amendment to give DHS the discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read, "nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location." In other words, Border Patrol would use its discretion to decide which type of fencing was appropriate in various regions. The amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007. Hutchison said at the time, "Border patrol agents reported that coyotes and drug-runners were altering their routes as fencing was deployed, so the amendment gives our agents discretion to locate the fence where necessary to achieve operational control of our border." Opponents, however, said the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill. Today, DHS says Border Patrol has completed 651 miles of fencing, including 299 miles of vehicle fence and 352 miles of primary pedestrian fence. One mile of pedestrian fence is left to complete, and it is tied up in litigation. So what’s being flagrantly defied? That comes down to the difference between vehicle fence and pedestrian fence, as well as the "double layer" specification in the 2006 law. On the one hand, the fence is virtually complete and in compliance with the 2007 amendment. "It cost almost $3 million per mile to construct that fence. Including maintenance, it is supposed to cost over $6 billion over the next 20 years. President Obama is going above and beyond any president ever at enforcing our immigration laws," said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. On the other, it’s not the fence envisioned in 2006. For one thing, vehicle fencing would be more accurately described as posts placed close enough together that cars can’t be driven between them. What’s more, just 36.3 miles of fencing are double-layered. Said Rosemary Jenks with Numbers USA, a Washington group that favors low levels of immigration: "The Secure Fence Act called for 650 miles of double-layer pedestrian fencing. While the administration claims to have completed 650 miles of fencing, virtually none of it is double layer, and several hundred miles is vehicle barriers, instead of fence at all." Other resources, practical considerations While LaPierre was specific about fence construction, we thought we’d mention other aspects of border control. Rey Koslowski, in a 2011 paper for the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Southwest Border Security Act Obama signed in 2010 appropriated $600 million for enhanced border protection on top of the president’s July 2010 authorization to deploy 1,200 National Guard troops to the border. The largest share of the additional funding, $244 million, was to hire and maintain existing levels of Border Patrol agents and customs officers. Almost $200 million went to the Department of Justice to hire more federal law enforcement officers for the southwest border region, and still millions more went to communications and aerial surveillance equipment. In an interview, Koslowski pointed out that the 2006 law required that no more than 18 months after its enactment the government should have "operational control" of the border. How was that defined? "The prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States." "Well, guess what, they failed," Koslowski said. "Under this definition, no country, not even East Germany, managed operational control like this." So the fence -- pedestrian and vehicle -- is an adaptation to changing immigration patterns, from population centers where people used to walk in, out to deserts and mountains where they drive across. Added Gordon Hanson, an economist at University of California, San Diego: "It simply doesn’t make economic sense to build a fence along the entire border; in desert/mountain regions there are far more efficient ways to block entry than a fence in the middle of nowhere." Our ruling LaPierre wrote that "the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border." First, he misrepresented what the law required, which was segments of fencing in specific places, not a continuous fence along the 2,000 mile border. Second, he ignored the 2007 amendment which gave the government some discretion over how to build the fence. The fence that has been built -- just one mile short of what’s required -- is a combination of pedestrian fencing and vehicle barriers. To some critics that does not satisfy what Congress intended in 2006, and very little of it is double-layered. On that point, we think LaPierre’s statement contains a grain of truth. Otherwise, though, it’s clear that Obama is not flagrantly defying the law, especially as resources toward other aspects of border enforcement are increasing. We rate LaPierre’s statement Mostly False.	None	Wayne LaPierre	None	None	None	2013-02-20T16:31:12	2013-02-13	['Mexico']
pomt-01474	"94 percent of those that are employed by the Department of Education at the federal level were deemed by the department as nonessential employees."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/30/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-says-94-percent-education-department-em/	The U.S. Education Department is often a political football in debates about the role of the federal government. Look no further than the Iowa Senate debate on Sept. 28, 2014, between Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley. During the audience-participation part of the debate, a local college student named Jake asked Ernst this question: "You've said you'd like to eliminate the Department of Education. What implications does this have for students who receive Pell Grants and federal student loans?" Here’s Ernst’s response. "Thank you, Jake, that's a great question. It doesn't do anything to those that receive Pell Grants and student loans. Those are programs that are very necessary for our college students, but they can be easily housed in the Department of Treasury. Now when it comes to the Department of Education, 94 percent of those that are employed by the Department of Education at the federal level were deemed by the department as nonessential employees. So I would rather see the dollars that go to those nonessential employees be directed back to the states so they can be utilized by our administrators and our teachers in making sure that our Iowa students are receiving a great education." Is Ernst correct that 94 percent of employees at the Education Department have been "deemed by the department as nonessential"? Her campaign didn’t return an inquiry, but we took a closer look. First, some background. A government shutdown happens when one particular kind of federal funding stops flowing -- money that’s appropriated by Congress. Appropriations bills are supposed to be passed annually, though in recent years, acrimony between Congress and the president has made it happen more irregularly. This occurred most recently from Oct. 1, 2013, to Oct 16, 2013, when congressional Republicans refused to fund President Barack Obama’s health care law and Obama refused to sign spending bills unless they included funding for the law. There is a grain of truth to back up Ernst’s claim. During the 2013 shutdown, the Education Department furloughed 3,983 employees out of a workforce of 4,195. That’s 94.9 percent of all department employees. But the employees weren’t deemed "nonessential." While the term "nonessential employees" has been used in the media in the past to describe federal employees who are furloughed during a shutdown, the phrase was never officially used to describe employees. The word "nonessential," which has been used since a 1980 memo issued by the Office of Management and Budget, was applied to activities, not employees. The terms for employees themselves are "exempt/nonexempt" or "excepted/nonexcepted." More importantly, the way Ernst uses the term "nonessential" -- suggesting that the employees’ own department classifies them as make-work employees and that their salaries would be better shifted to state education budgets -- is misleading. What prevents an employee from being furloughed during a government shutdown is their performance of "emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property." (Some federal employees are able to continue working because their salaries were paid entirely by user fees or trust funds and, as a result, were not held up by a stalled spending bill.) Few of the Education Department’s employees save lives or guard property. The department’s budget is heavily weighted toward paying out and overseeing student loans and aid to schools in the states. It has the fewest employees of any cabinet-level department in the federal government. (The next smallest, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has twice as many employees.) Since so much of what the department does is to write checks, it’s not surprising that 94 percent of its staff would be furloughed; neither life nor property is at risk. If being "essential" was defined solely by saving lives or protecting property, most Americans' job duties would be categorized in the "nonessential" camp. Ernst is "being disingenuous at best and probably a lot worse than that," said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. John M. Palguta, vice president for policy with the Partnership for Public Service, agreed. "The law makes no reference to whether or not an employee’s work is important, meaningful, and/or valuable to the agency’s mission," he said. A final note: Remember when Ernst said, "I would rather see the dollars that go to those nonessential employees be directed back to the states so they can be utilized by our administrators and our teachers in making sure that our Iowa students are receiving a great education"? Well, the money saved from "nonessential" employees wouldn’t do much to help front-line schools. If the roughly 4,000 Education Department employees were magically transferred to state or local education jobs, they would increase the number of state and local education employees by a minuscule 4/100ths of 1 percent, according to our calculations of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Our ruling Ernst said, "94 percent of those that are employed by the Department of Education at the federal level were deemed by the department as nonessential employees." While it’s true that the Education Department did furlough 94 percent of its employees during the 2013 government shutdown, those employees were neither called "nonessential" in official documents nor were they "nonessential" in any casual definition of the word. The Education Department’s furlough rate was 94 percent because its employees were not saving lives or protecting property -- the standard for being exempt from furloughs. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02686	Under a proposed bill, a $100,000 home’s flood insurance premium would be "maybe $200 or $300 annually."	/florida/statements/2014/jan/07/gus-bilirakis/gus-bilirakis-says-his-flood-insurance-bill-would-/	While millions of indebted Florida homeowners are already trying to keep their heads above water, recently enacted flood insurance regulations are threatening to swamp the housing market with even more problems. With the end of subsidized flood coverage, Florida legislators have been looking for ways to keep their constituents from drowning in sky-high premiums. One such solution is a bill co-sponsored by Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, who recently discussed the measure with Bay News 9 anchor Al Ruechel. After listening to Bilirakis explain his bill, Ruechel asked the congressman what it might cost to cover a home worth $100,000. Bilirakis’ answer was eye-popping, according to a reader who brought it to our attention: "Well, we’re saying maybe, I’m approximating, but maybe $200 to $300 annually. Approximate. Because I’ve done these figures in the past." The reader told us he couldn’t believe his ears, and frankly, neither could we. Would a $100,000 home really only cost as little as $200 a year to cover under the Bilirakis bill? We dove into this claim with both feet. A deluge of problems First and foremost, the 12th District representative’s figure sounded so low that it led us to wonder if Bilirakis had simply misspoken. We asked his office if that was the case. They assured us he had, meaning to say "monthly" instead of "annually." So if you were watching and thought your flood insurance bill could end up being only a few hundred dollars a year, sorry to disappoint you, but his office did correct the statement. But let’s go through the math, anyway. Bilirakis was referring to his proposed H.R. 3312, the Homeowners Flood Insurance Relief Act of 2013, which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Oct. 23. The bipartisan bill is co-sponsored in part by Florida’s Thomas Rooney and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Republicans, and Democrat Kathy Castor. It’s a response to the Biggert Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, which Bilirakis supported. The law took effect on Oct. 1, 2013, and Bilirakis and other lawmakers have since been focusing on how to handle the law’s consequences. (Lawmakers said they didn’t realize such dramatic rate increases would happen.) Biggert-Waters ended subsidized premiums for the troubled National Flood Insurance Program, which is some $24 billion in debt, leading to astronomical increases for some homeowners. Homes with severe or repetitive losses, along with second homes and businesses, face rates that are allowed to rise 25 percent per year until they mirror their true risk of flooding. That applies to some 50,000 policyholders in Florida. Other homeowners in flood-prone areas will be grandfathered in at current rates unless they sell their homes or let their policies lapse. About 115,000 subsidized condos or multifamily homes won’t be affected, nor will about 1.8 million Florida policies currently not being subsidized. Some horror stories about changes in premiums involve homes being hit with insurance bills quintupling or worse, climbing well into five figures for a year of coverage. Many neighborhoods in flood-prone areas are already reporting dismal sales figures, with sellers frightened off by sky-high insurance quotes. The problem is especially troublesome for Florida, which Gov. Rick Scott claimed has paid out four times what it has received in flood claims over the last 35 years. We found that Mostly True. H.R. 3312 isn’t the only attempt to deal with this problem. The Senate has been struggling with its own measures, and Florida legislators are proposing a competing market set up by private insurers. The Bilirakis bill does a couple things: First, it caps the maximum flood insurance premium levied on a structure at 1/30th of the property’s appraised value at the time of sale. This is based on the concept of a 30-year mortgage and is meant to establish a baseline of coverage. Second, it would spread any increase over current premiums across a 10-year phase-in period, during which time the premium would get incrementally higher until it reached the maximum. FEMA, which evaluates the amount of risk faced by each property, would have the flexibility to determine that rate of increase. The bill would allow homeowners to pay for flood coverage in monthly installments, instead of an annual lump sum payment. So, using the example of a $100,000 home, the annual premium would be limited to 1/30th of $100,000, or $3,333.33 per year (we’ll round down, but actuaries probably won’t be as generous). Spread out over 12 months, that would be a monthly payment of $277.77. A $250,000 home would have a maximum premium of $8,333.33, with a $694.44 monthly payment, and so on. Only in Florida would an insurance bill that high be considered reasonable, but it still provides a cap to the exorbitant rates possible under Biggert-Waters. It’s also quite a bit higher than a couple of hundred dollars a year. Our ruling Bilirakis told Bay News 9 his bill would limit a $100,000 home’s flood insurance bill to "$200 to $300 annually." That didn’t add up to us, and when we asked his office about it, they told us he meant to say "monthly", not "annually." We do appreciate it when elected leaders admit they’re wrong. Unfortunately for homeowners paying for flood insurance, Bilirakis used the wrong word in the interview, and we have to rate the wording of this particular statement False.

pomt-00457	Says the Trump administration "has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender.’ "	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/17/tammy-baldwin/sen-tammy-baldwins-claim-about-trump-administratio/	Transgender rights have become an issue in many aspects of American society, from Hollywood actors seeking recognition and roles, to the state of Vermont, where Democrat Christine Hallquist is vying to become the nation's first transgender governor. In Wisconsin, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person to the serve in the Senate, has been a champion of LGBTQ rights. At a June 2018 Human Rights Campaign event, Baldwin gave a speech in which she praised volunteers on the front lines of the "fight for equality" and also aimed a couple barbs at the Donald Trump administration. The administration "has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender,’ " Baldwin told the crowd, which booed in response. What’s more, she continued: "President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country." For this fact check we will look at the first claim on the CDC word ban. (We checked the second claim, on transgender people and the military, separately. You can find it here). The background On December 15, 2017, The Washington Post published a story headlined "Words banned at multiple HHS agencies include ‘diversity and ‘vulnerable.’ " HHS is the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is a federal agency under the HHS and is headquartered in Atlanta. The agency in question is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (You may remember that in the wake of the story, the Human Rights Campaign and artist Robin Bell projected some of the words onto to the side of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.) When asked to provide backup for Baldwin’s statement, campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to that Washington Post report. "The Trump administration is prohibiting officials at the nation's top public health agency from using a list of seven words or phrases — including ‘fetus’ and ‘transgender’ — in official documents being prepared for next year's budget," the news report said. A day later, The New York Times reported on the "uproar" over the purported word ban: The Department of Health and Human Services tried to play down on Saturday a report that officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been barred from using seven words or phrases, including "science-based," "fetus," "transgender" and "vulnerable," in agency budget documents. "The assertion that H.H.S. has ‘banned words’ is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process," an agency spokesman, Matt Lloyd, told The New York Times. The Times story noted officials said the proposal was not a ban on words. Rather it was a recommendation to avoid some language to ease the path toward budget approval by Republicans in Congress. In a Jan. 9, 2018, report in The Hill, CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald said the agency "has not banned, prohibited, or forbidden" the use of certain words in official documentation. The statement came in response to concerns from Senate Democrats. Later that month, CNN published a follow-up report, which said news reports about the "banned" words may have been overstated and cited a document, along with interviews with officials from the Department of Health and Human Services. They describe not a ban or prohibition on words but rather suggestions on how to improve the chances of getting funding."Words to avoid: vulnerable, diversity, entitlement." The other four words on the list — "transgender," "fetus," "evidence-based" and "science-based" — were brought up by employees at the meeting who wanted to know if they could be used, according to the two HHS officials, who were familiar with what transpired at the meeting. "Nobody ever told them they couldn't use these seven words. It was just said, 'if you think these words would cause someone to jump to a conclusion, then use a substitute. But if there isn't a good substitute, then go ahead and use the word,' " said one of the officials. Likewise, CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, refuted the idea of a ban. "CDC has not banned, prohibited, or forbidden employees from using any words," Harben said. "CDC uses the best scientific evidence available and strongly encourages evidence-based programs." Our rating Baldwin told a human rights group that the Trump administration "has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender.’ " The statement was based on a Washington Post report. But that story was later countered by several other published reports that indicated the words were not banned. Rather, it was suggested that other words be used in some cases — in part to temper controversy during the budget process. And despite The Washington Post headline, the first paragraph of the story does not mention the word "banned" instead saying "they should avoid using certain words or phrases in official documents being drafted for next year's budget."

pomt-01251	"It is senior citizens, not Hispanics, who are the fastest-growing demographic in this country."	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/13/brit-hume/hume-senior-vote-growing-faster-hispanic/	Conventional wisdom is that the changing landscape of the American electorate -- i.e. the influx of Hispanic voters -- is good news for Democrats. But Fox News analyst Brit Hume turned the idea on its head during his post-election analysis. The fastest-growing segment of the country is old people, Hume said. And that’s good news for the Grand Old Party. "It is senior citizens, not Hispanics, who are the fastest-growing demographic in this country," Hume said. "Hispanics are clearly the fastest-growing ethnic group in the country, but their size as a group is dwarfed by the 65 and older demographic which has been trending Republican," Hume continued. "If the GOP continues to make gains, it may more than offset any advantage Democrats have with the ethnic groups." The simple question here is: Are senior citizens, and not Hispanics, the fastest-growing demographic in the United States? (Hume did not respond to our requests for more information.) Looking at the past Every two years, the U.S. Census Bureau produces a report that breaks down eligible voters by race, ethnicity and age. Of particular significance for tracking the Hispanic vote, it culls out noncitizens. This table, based on the Census Bureau data, shows that in no decade did the senior group grow at a faster rate than Hispanics. (All numbers are shown in thousands) Group 1980 1990 Growth 1980-90 2000 Growth 1990-00 2010 Growth 2000-10 Hispanic 18+ 5,565 8,566 +53.9% 13,158 +53.6% 21,285 +61.8% 65+ 23,514 29,192 +24.1% 31,815 +9.0% 37,745 +18.6% It’s the same case for the raw number of eligible voters, except for the 1980-90 period. So in present terms, Hume’s case appears weak. Looking ahead As a general rule, we at PunditFact don’t assess predictions, but we can compare Hume’s sense of the future to what the Census Bureau tells us to expect. Here, Hume finds a bit more support. There is one decade, between 2020 and 2030, when the senior population is estimated to grow by 30 percent while the Hispanic group would increase by 26 percent. (Note: These estimates look only at population, not voter turnout. The Census does not project voter turnout. Again, the numbers shown here are in thousands.) Group 2010 2020 Growth 2010-20 2030 Growth 2020-30 2040 Growth 2030-40 Hispanic 18+ 21,285 43,407 103.9% 54,827 26.3% 67,309 22.8% 65+ 37,745 55,969 48.3% 72,774 30.0% 79,719 9.5% The same pattern holds true when we look at the absolute change in population. Group 2010 2020 Growth 2010-20 2030 Growth 2020-30 2040 Growth 2030-40 Hispanic 18+ 21,285 43,407 22,122 54,827 11,420 67,309 12,482 65+ 37,745 55,969 18,224 72,774 16,805 79,719 6,945 A few important caveats In Hume’s framework, voters are either seniors or Hispanic, but of course, some will be both. By focusing on seniors, Hume seems to assume that age, rather than ethnicity, does more to shape a person’s vote. That might or might not be true, and it’s actually the diciest part of any comparison. Also, there is no question that seniors actually get to the polls much more reliably than Hispanics. In the 2010 elections, about 61 percent of seniors voted. The Hispanic rate was half that, just 31 percent. Now couple that with the higher number of seniors, 37.7 million in 2010 compared to 21.2 million Hispanic voters, and you can see where Hume has a point completely apart from how fast each group is growing. If Republicans get 57 percent of the seniors who vote, and Democrats get 70 percent of the Hispanics who vote, the Republicans come out ahead 13.1 million seniors to 4.6 million Hispanics. We could get into more complex calculations involving presidential races, the electoral college, and the concentration of Hispanics in certain states, but we’ll leave that for fivethirtyeight.com. Our ruling Hume said seniors, not Hispanics, are the fastest-growing demographic. The Census Bureau numbers tell us that’s not accurate right now. Historically, the Hispanic population has grown faster than the senior population. The Hispanic group will continue to grow faster until about 2020, according to Census Bureau projections. In the decade after that, the senior group is projected to grow at a faster rate, but then after 2030, the growth rate for Hispanics is higher once again. Hume’s electoral analysis (based on seniors showing up to vote) was more on target than the trend he cited as evidence, but we only deal with his factual statement, which aligns with Census numbers in one decade out of five. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Brit Hume	None	None	None	2014-11-13T16:47:47	2014-11-10	['None']
pomt-06312	"The governor won this state with 49 percent. We had some of the closest races in the House in history. So you’re not dealing with this 70-30, like they want to make it."	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/14/robert-hagan/state-rep-robert-hagan-says-ohio-isnt-70-30-republ/	Because of slow population growth, Ohio is losing two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. And because of their statewide sweep last fall, Republicans controlled the process of drawing a new congressional map, which features 12 solidly GOP districts and four that favor Democrats. Needless to say, the Democrats aren’t fond of their counterparts’ work. They have resisted any deal that doesn’t improve their chances to win more seats and have threatened to take the map to a referendum. After two months of debate, cooler heads have yet to prevail. Capping a particularly rancorous session on Nov. 3, State Rep. Robert Hagan stood angrily to complain that redistricting was distracting from more urgent problems. "Quite frankly," the Youngstown Democrat said, "I’m left wondering what the hell we are doing down here." Colorful remarks, indeed. But PolitiFact Ohio was more interested in what Hagan said after the session. In an interview with Marc Kovac, a Statehouse bureau chief for several newspapers, Hagan stressed his preference for a map that better fits the state’s political pedigree. "The governor won this state with 49 percent," Hagan said of Republican John Kasich’s 2010 victory over Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. "We had some of the closest races in the House in history. So you’re not dealing with this 70/30, like they want to make it." Hagan’s argument, and those similarly made by his fellow Democrats, is that new lines should reflect their belief that Ohio is split about 50/50 between the two parties. A map that favors the GOP in 12 of 16 districts could give Republicans 75 percent of Ohio’s congressional seats. We decided to take a closer look at the examples Hagan cites as justification for equality. First, Kasich’s margin of victory has been well-documented. But to cover all bases, we confirmed with the Ohio secretary of state’s office that Kasich received 49 percent of the vote to Strickland’s 47 percent. The remaining four percent went to third-party or write-in candidates. By mentioning this race, Hagan implied that Ohio is evenly divided. We found Republicans won by five points or more in all but one of the five other statewide contests last year. The exception: Mike DeWine’s 1.28-point victory over incumbent Democratic Attorney General Richard Cordray. Examining the second part of Hagan’s claim involved more scouring of past election results. In 2010, according to the secretary of state’s website, six Ohio House races featured margins of two points or fewer. All six of these races were decided by fewer than 1,000 votes. The closest was in the 99th District -- Ashtabula County and a slice of Trumbull County -- where Republican Casey Kozlowski beat Democratic Rep. Deborah Newcomb by 137 votes. Another squeaker came in the Franklin County-encompassing 21st District, where the GOP’s Mike Duffey beat Democrat David Robinson by 377 votes. In Hamilton County, Democratic Rep. Connie Pillich kept her 28th District seat by finishing 602 votes ahead of Republican Mike Wilson. Hagan confirmed to PolitiFact Ohio that those three were the races he was thinking about when speaking to Kovac. But was 2010 really an anomaly in terms of razor-thin margins of victory? Our review of Ohio House races dating to 2002 found no contest quite as close as the Kozlowski-Newcomb match. Another six races in 2008 and seven in 2006 were decided by two percentage points or fewer. Three candidates in 2004 won by fewer than 500 votes. For the sake of context, it’s important to note that the Ohio House has 99 seats, so the half-dozen or so nail-biters are exceptions. Many House elections are blowouts, and some candidates don’t even draw an opponent. It’s also important to point out that in the six tight races in 2010, Democrats and Republicans split the seats, with three going to each party. The makeup of the House today is 59 Republicans, 40 Democrats. That’s more like 60/40 than 50/50. If Democrats had won all six of the close races, the makeup would be 56-43. Unfortunately, there is no perfect accounting for party affiliation in Ohio. Voters here do not specify party when registering -- only when voting in a primary. But that’s an unreliable measure of true political identity. Republicans are known to cross over into Democratic primaries and vice versa, particularly during hotly contested battles for a party’s presidential nomination. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted’s turnout numbers anyway. Of those who voted in the 2010 primaries, 48 percent cast Republican ballots, while 42 percent cast Democratic ballots. So even by this measure, there is no evidence of a 50/50 split. Our best guess is that the 50/50 talk is part anecdotal, part wishful thinking. Ohio is known as a swing state with fickle tastes. In a four-year stretch, voters here elected to the U.S. Senate a known liberal in Sherrod Brown and a known conservative in Rob Portman. The state went for Democrat Bill Clinton twice in the 1990s, twice for Republican George W. Bush in the aughts, then for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008. But since 1991, Republicans have occupied the governor’s chair with the exception of the four years that Strickland served. Then again, as Hagan correctly noted, Ohio isn’t a 70/30 state, either. His arguments -- and those from his Democratic colleagues -- would benefit from more context, though. For one, there’s no bulletproof way of suggesting the state is 50/50 -- a claim Hagan did not make explicitly in his comments to Kovac. Hagan instead implicitly pointed to results of two elections as proof of Ohio’s political parity: Kasich’s narrow gubernatorial victory and a batch of close Ohio House races. Regarding the latter, Hagan remarked on "some of the closest races in the House in history." It is clear that several of those battles match that description. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Robert Hagan	None	None	None	2011-11-14T18:00:00	2011-11-03	['None']

"We have a very divided nation," he said. "You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities. Chicago. You take a look at Washington, D.C. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years." Trump is largely on target that "we have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years." His staff didn’t respond to an inquiry, but Trump seems to be referring to a set of annual statistics released by the FBI. The most recent report came out in September. Those statistics showed that the number of murders and non-negligent homicides rose nationally between 2014 and 2015 by 10.8 percent. When we checked the numbers, we confirmed that this increase does rank as the biggest year-to-year jump in murders since 1970-71, when the number rose by 11.1 percent. That was exactly 45 years ago. In fact, Trump’s debate comment was stated more accurately than what one of his key surrogates -- former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- said earlier in the day on Meet the Press. Giuliani stated that "last year, crime went up more than in the last 41 years." Not only did Giuliani get the number of years wrong, but he also referred to "crime" generally, not to murders specifically. And that makes a difference. Violent crime did go up between 2014 and 2015, but by a significantly smaller percentage than murders did -- 3.9 percent. That rate of increase was smaller than several year-to-year increases since 1971, most recently an increase between 1989 and 1990 of 10.6 percent. In addition, between 2014 and 2015, property crime actually dropped by 2.6 percent. So Trump has a fair point. Still, we’ll note two caveats. First, his terminology was imperfect. The 10.8 percent increase represents an overall national figure -- not the figure for murders "within our cities," as Trump phrased it. That said, murder rates within cities tend to be higher than for the country at large, as this chart shows. (The red line is the rate for cities over 250,000 population, while the blue line is the rate for the country as a whole.) So this flaw in Trump’s phrasing doesn’t strike us as especially problematic. A bigger problem for Trump is that he leaves out some important context -- that, as we have noted previously, crime rates were heading downward for a quarter-century before the most recent uptick, and that the recent increase is nowhere near big enough to erase those gains. Sticking to murder statistics for the moment, the following chart shows a zig-zagging rise in murders between 1970 and the early 1990s, followed by a fairly steady decline since then. To be precise, the number of murders declined by 42 percent between 1993 and 2014, even as the U.S. population rose by 25 percent over the same period. The same 25-year decline also shows up in the statistics for violent crimes more generally … … and for property crimes, too. After the newest FBI statistics came out, we asked several criminologists how much concern they place in the recent murder spike. They said it was definitely worth noting -- but that it also needs to be understood within a broader context. "Violent crime rates are up compared with historic lows, and they are still very, very low compared with just five or 10 years ago," said Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, agreed. "A small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20 year trend is downward," he said. "If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase." And James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist said that while "crime rose, it is far from certain that it will continue. Such a large jump in homicide, the most volatile of crime figures, can easily be followed by a turn in the other direction. One year does not make a trend." For a past example, look no further than an October 2006 report by the Police Executive Research Forum that cited an upward spike around 2005 that’s visible in our graphs above. The group warned of "a gathering storm of violent crime that threatens to erode the considerable crime reductions of the past." But starting in 2006, crime began falling again, and it stayed that way for most of the next decade. As Jeffrey Butts of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice recently told the Guardian, "You lost 50 pounds. You gained back a couple. You’re not fat. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t look at your behavior, because the trend is not good." Our ruling Trump said, "We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years." The number of murders nationally did rise by the biggest amount in 45 years, and criminologists agree that this is a development worth paying attention to. But they add that it comes after a steep, quarter-century decline, which suggests that it is not yet a cause for panic. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dbd0f6e6-df11-462a-bf5c-ac53c13c462f	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-10T01:14:09	2016-10-09	['None']
pomt-07470	"43,000 people are going to be kicked out of nursing homes or denied nursing home entrance" if the Texas House version of the state budget passes into law.	/texas/statements/2011/apr/16/joaquin-castro/joaquin-castro-says-if-house-approved-budget-becom/	State Rep. Joaquin Castro says spending cuts in the Texas House version of the state’s 2012-13 budget will cause vulnerable Texans to suffer. For instance, the San Antonio Democrat said in House debate April 4, "43,000 people are going to be kicked out of nursing homes or denied nursing home entrance." The House-passed budget, yet to be answered by the Senate, would reduce by about 10 percent reimbursement rates paid to nursing homes for residents covered by Medicaid, the state- and federally-funded health program for the poor and disabled. Nursing home advocates say actual daily rates would effectively drop 34 percent — from $123 to $81 per resident — because the House-adopted budget also doesn’t account for projected increases in health care costs or in Medicaid-supported nursing home residents. Nor does it replace federal stimulus aid that ends this year. Some perspective: Of about 90,000 nursing home residents statewide, 54,800 — 62 percent — are covered by Medicaid. Starting in 1999, Medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes have increased seven times, most recently going up 2.7 percent in 2009. Rates have been cut thrice, most recently 2 percent as of February. The state’s reimbursement rate is 49th nationally, according to an April 9 Austin American-Statesman news article. Also, Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us that "there’s widespread agreement that our rates don’t fully cover costs." When we sought backup for Castro’s statement, his office said he got his numbers from the Texas Health Care Association, which represents the state’s nursing home industry. The group’s president, Tim Graves, told us that it analyzed the most recent data, covering 2008, to try to estimate "the scope of the potential impact" of the proposed cuts. Graves said at least 70 percent of the residents at about half the state’s nursing homes, or 550 facilities, are insured through Medicaid — figures we confirmed with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The association estimates that the average number of residents at these facilities is 83, suggesting that 45,650 residents live in heavily Medicaid-dependent homes that would bear the brunt of the House’s rate cut. And how many nursing home residents would be kicked out or denied care? That number proved elusive. A Feb. 16 association press release says the reduction "will force local facilities to significantly cut staffing levels, cut pay — or worse — go out of business, leaving local seniors and local workers to make do with no care and no jobs." Graves told us: "There’s no way I can predict the future, but I can tell you they’ll be in really bad shape. ... Our point is any facility that depends on Medicaid to that extent is going to be in very significant trouble, and that could affect a lot of folks." Graves said the association hasn’t asked every home if it would close upon the proposed rate cut, but conversations with nursing-home operators have persuaded him that widespread closures with residents getting displaced is a valid concern. At his suggestion, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. President George Linial told us it now costs homes $140 to $150 a day to serve residents. Separately, the state health commission told us the average daily cost for nursing-home care in 2008 was $129 per resident and the state projects that average for 2012-13 to be $133. Linial shared an association document titled "Nursing Home Profile for Texas" stating that if the House-approved rates become law, 896 of the state’s nursing homes will close and 63,616 residents will lose their care. Linial, calling the group’s forecast "an estimate... a guess," also said: "It is tough to determine who will close because most nursing homes do not want to alarm their residents by saying they will close ... However, simply looking at their financial statements will tell you that closure is imminent with further cuts." How did the group reach its numbers? Association vice president David Thomason said he determined from cost data collected by the state health commission that an average of 71 residents lived in the state’s nursing homes in 2008 and that Medicaid-covered residents accounted for 65 percent or more of the occupants of 896 homes. Assuming those homes would close if the House-backed budget becomes law, Thomason said, 63,616 residents would be kicked out of the shuttered homes. According to the health commission, 676 nursing homes in 2009 had 65 percent or more of their residents covered by Medicaid. Informed of this tally, Thomason replied by email that he’d "rounded up" in his analysis and the group "will be happy to agree that at least 676 facilities will close at the current House version of the bill," with 47,996 residents kicked out. We pressed Thomason on his assumption that this particular cut would force the homes to close, though their reimbursement rates had mostly risen over the past decade. Reminding us of the homes greatly depending on Medicaid, Thomason said: "There’s no other way around it, you’re going to close." Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that Castro accurately pinned the number of nursing home residents whose "access to care is at risk." Yet whether all those residents "would lose coverage at once, that may be pushing it," she said. Finally, spokeswomen for HHSC and the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, which administers long-term services, said their agencies have not assessed the impact of rate cuts on Medicaid-covered residents. Goodman said: "We don’t doubt that deep cuts in Medicaid rates would mean that some nursing homes would close." All in all, Castro’s claim that the House-approved budget would effectively deny 43,000 people nursing home care was not confirmed by the group he cites as his source. Though a different group estimates a larger number, that’s acknowledged as an educated guess. At this point, all such predictions are speculative. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07098	After not having any foreign trade offices overseas for the past decade, New Jersey opened offices in Shanghai and London in the past six months, and has seen an 18 percent increase in exports.	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/23/kim-guadagno/lt-gov-kim-guadagno-says-foreign-trade-offices-sha/	If you heard Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno on the Brian Lehrer Show on May 11, you'd think New Jersey didn’t have any foreign trade offices for at least a decade until the administration of Gov. Chris Christie set up outposts in Shanghai and London, which led to a big surge in exports. In the middle of her statewide tour to highlight New Jersey’s commitment to economic growth, Guadagno did a radio interview on the WNYC program. After discussing the state’s effort to attract jobs from the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, the conversation turned to where Guadagno said the "real game" is -- overseas. Here’s how Guadagno summed up New Jersey’s international outreach: "It's no longer just a regional market. It's attracting business from overseas. And New Jersey, for the past decade, hasn't had any offices overseas. Compare that to Pennsylvania (that) has 23. Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent." Fred Snowflack, a spokesman for Guadagno, said the offices in Shanghai and London opened last year through a joint effort between the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Two people are stationed in Shanghai and one person is in London, Snowflack said. According to a September 2010 press release announcing the deal, the duties of the foreign trade representatives include helping to advance export sales of New Jersey companies and arranging visits for potential investors. The London office covers the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. PolitiFact New Jersey also confirmed that Pennsylvania has 23 foreign trade offices covering 67 countries. So she is right on that point. But she's wrong on two other key points: that the state lacked foreign trade offices for the past decade and that the two new ones led to the 18 percent increase in exports. Actually, a total of 10 full- and part-time overseas offices were in operation during the past decade. New Jersey had full-time offices in Tokyo from 1988-2006; London, 1994-2004; Ra’anana, Israel, 1995-2007; Mexico City, 1999-2006; Cairo, 2000-2004; and Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2000-2007. The state had part-time offices in South Korea from 1999-2004; Greece, 2000-2004; China, 2001-2004; and Argentina, 2001-2002. Snowflack told us those offices closed for financial reasons. Asked about the discrepancy between Guadagno’s radio interview and the information on previous offices, Snowflack wrote in an email: "As for the other question, the lieutenant governor has said on many other occasions, including her budget testimony of last year, that the offices were closed during the Corzine Administration. I submit that the important point here is that the state has reopened overseas offices, not the exact year in which some of the old ones closed." Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce back up the 18 percent increase in exports. Those exports included chemicals, computers and electronic products, and transportation equipment. But that's a figure for exports throughout the world and an economics professor expressed doubt that the new offices deserve much credit. "I wish economics were that easy," Rutgers University professor Thomas Prusa said. Snowflack told us Guadagno was not linking the export increases to the new offices. "She was not saying that the two new offices were directly responsible for the increase in exports," Snowflack wrote in an email. "Her point was that New Jersey is trying to rekindle business relationships overseas, as evidenced by an increase in exports and two new offices. But she never said two offices that opened within the last year prompted an 18 percent increase in exports." That may have been what she meant, but listeners who heard her would clearly be under the impression there was a link. She said, "Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent." Her wording suggests a clear linkage. Let’s review: Guadagno said New Jersey has opened foreign trade offices in Shanghai and London, marking the first in at least a decade. She’s right about those two offices, but she’s wrong to say such international efforts haven’t been done before. In fact, New Jersey had 10 offices at various times during the past decade. And there's little, if any, evidence that the offices led to the 18 percent increase. We find her statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12958	"General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/04/donald-trump/mostly-true-trump-tweet-about-gm-chevy-cruze-manuf/	President-elect Donald Trump put General Motors on notice for tariff-free imports of vehicles from Mexico, warning of heavy taxes if vehicles are not instead manufactured in the United States. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border," Trump tweeted Jan. 3. "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Imposing hefty tariffs on foreign goods was a staple of Trump’s pro-manufacturing agenda. He suggested on day one of his campaign that if Ford chose to open a factory in Mexico and then tried to sell those vehicles in the United States, he would tell Ford’s CEO that "we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax." In the same speech, he bemoaned Chevy’s slight presence in foreign countries, particularly in Japan. We wanted to look at Trump’s most recent beef with Chevy. The key to our review is that the president-elect singled out the Mexican-made model of the Chevy Cruze. The Cruze made in Mexico is a hatchback that does not sell widely in the United States. Chevy Cruze sedans are more popular in the United States — and they are produced in Ohio. Trump has a point, however, that the Mexican Cruze has made its way to the United States free of taxes, based on provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement. General Motors: We make Cruzes in Ohio, too General Motors, whose portfolio includes Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC, said in a brief statement that all Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in the company’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. In 2016, it sold 185,500 of this body type in the United States. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com But the company "builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.," the statement said. Production of the hatchback model began in mid 2016, said Patrick Morrissey, a General Motors spokesperson, in an email. Out of 29,000 hatchbacks made in Mexico in 2016 for global markets, 4,500 were sold in the United States, Morrissey said. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com (Chevy Cruze photos courtesy of General Motors) Free trade provisions under international agreement The North American Free Trade Agreement, effective since January 1994, lifted trade tariffs and restrictions among Canada, the United States and Mexico. NAFTA has been praised for expanding and facilitating trade among the three countries, but Trump and labor unions from the United States have criticized the deal for outsourcing jobs and lowering wages. Trump called it the "worst trade deal ever," blaming it for the loss of manufacturing jobs. But nonpartisan research said NAFTA has had a more subtle effect on the U.S. economy. "NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters," a 2015 Congressional Research Service report said. "The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP." NAFTA allows the tariffs-free import of autos, light trucks, engines and transmissions from Mexico as long as 62.5 percent of their value is from North America, the 2015 report said. The "rules of origin" requirement for other vehicles and automotive parts is 60 percent, according to the report. The Chevy Cruze hatchback would be covered under NAFTA’s duty-free provision, experts told PolitiFact. NAFTA allowed each participating country to specialize in different stages of production, said Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. Parts can go back and forth in the production of a vehicle, so a car that’s imported from Mexico can actually include components from companies in the United States, Freund said. As for the logistics of Trump’s plan to impose high tariffs, trade experts introduced a number of concerns about it for our June analysis. They cited potential rising production costs and an increased cost burden on consumers, as well as a possible trade war and broken international agreements. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border." That’s accurate for 4,500 Chevy Cruze hatchbacks made in Mexico and sold in the United States in 2016. That was about 15 percent of all Cruze hatchbacks produced in Mexico last year for global markets. NAFTA provisions allow the tax-free imports of autos from Mexico. It’s worth pointing out extra context that Chevy Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The sedan is more than 40 times as popular among American buyers as the hatchback. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

Donald Trump President-elect in a tweet Tuesday, January 3, 2017 -01/-03/2017 Read More info After the Fact After publishing this check, readers reached out telling us some Chevy Cruze sedans have also been imported from Mexico to sell in the United States. We asked General Motors about it, since their statement in response to Trump's tweet said all Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in General Motors' assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. In a follow-up email, a General Motors spokesperson said, "In the fourth quarter of 2016 we built some sedans in Mexico (and shipped to the U.S) to help support the launch of the Lordstown plant with the new Cruze (that was announced and reported on last summer) – about 8,000 total. So some of those are still in inventory in the U.S., but the only Chevrolet Cruze models being built in Mexico now for the U.S. market are the hatchbacks." The approximate 8,000 sedans were sold to dealers in 2016 "and most were probably sold to consumers," General Motors spokesperson Patrick Morrissey said.

pomt-09302	''I have received more contributions than any other candidate in the race – Republican or Democrat.''	/florida/statements/2010/apr/21/dan-gelber/state-sen-dan-gelber-boasts-hes-raised-more-other-/	State Sen. Dan Gelber says he has received more contributions than any other candidate in the race to become Florida's next attorney general. ''We received over $325,000 in contributions – and we did this during a shortened fundraising quarter of two months,” he wrote. ''I have received more contributions than any other candidate in the race – Republican or Democrat. Since announcing last year, our contributions total just under $1 million.'' We wondered if this was accurate, so we checked in with the Gelber campaign where aide Christian Ulvert told us the actual number was $321,000. We went to the Division of Elections website to see how that stacked up with the other candidates. We confirmed the $321,000, but noted that he included in-kind donations. Those would include restaurants comping Gelber for campaign events and the Democratic party sending staffers to assist from elsewhere but not charging for the hours. So we ran our own numbers using the same yardstick for first-quarter figures and found that state Sen. Dave Aronberg, another Democrat in the race, raised more -- $328,543 to Gelber’s $321,426. None of the Republican candidates broke $100,000. (Holly Benson raised $97,566.48; Pam Bondi raised $44,337 and Jeff Kottkamp, $27,230.) We also decided to check the total for the entire campaign, which goes back to June 2009. There again, Aronberg edged out Gelber, $999,609.87 to Gelber’s $991,922.35. Ulvert, Gelber's aide, then tried to move the goalposts by suggesting his boss' claim was true because ''we have the greatest number of contributors to our campaign. Our total contributors are 3,487.'' This, in fact, is true. The state database counted 91 more individual contributors to Aronberg’s 3,396 with none on the GOP side breaking the 2,000 mark. We don't accept that interpretation. When someone says contributions, we believe it's universally interpreted as the dollar amount. Said Aronberg campaign spokeswoman Allison North Jones: ''He is leading the public to believe -- and his supporters and his donors and everyone else -- that he had raised significantly more than his opponents.'' For his part, Gelber conceded in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida that he did not outraise his opponent in the race. Rather, he said, ''We were innocently and unknowingly comparing apples to oranges,'' because Aronberg had published his fundraising totals first, minus in-kind donations. The Gelber campaign believed Aronberg's figures included in-kind contributions. ''Of course the difference turned out to be very, very minor ($8,000 in a million dollar race),'' wrote Gelber. ''Although I did not know or try to say when I wrote the e-mail that we had a greater number of contributors than Dave (which is pretty important as it shows actual level of support) -- I assumed we did and that did turn out to be totally true and accurate.'' The e-mail didn't focus on number of donors. It was about dollars. So we find the claim to be False.

pomt-14184	"A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia."	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/25/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-jim-kenneys-sod/	Jim Kenney’s proposed soda tax went national last week. Hillary Clinton led off what became a back-and-forth political battle by voicing her support for the tax at a forum in Philadelphia. Bernie Sanders chimed in later to call the tax regressive. Kenney fired back in an editorial on Huffington Post that his proposal, which would levy a three cent per ounce tax on distributors, was a "corporate tax" and said Sanders was siding with beverage corporations. Then Sanders responded with an editorial of his own, in Philly Mag. He basically gave an elongated version of what he said earlier in the week, which was, "A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia." Is Sanders correct? Or was this political grandstanding? Berkeley, Calif., remains the lone American city to enact a sugary drink tax. It taxes the distributors of sodas and similar beverages like sports drinks 1 cent per ounce. Studies have shown some of the cost of tax has been passed on to consumers. A Cornell study found about 25 percent of it was passed on, and a University of California-Berkeley study found the amount to be between about 50 to 70 percent, depending on the type of beverage. The prices of soft drinks were more likely to go up at supermarkets than chain drug stores. Carl Davis, the research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told Billy Penn last month soda taxes like the one proposed by Philadelphia are "imperfect:" "The first thing you realize is that it is regressive. It’s going to hit lower and more moderate income families more heavily than higher-income families." William Shughart, a Utah State University professor and sin tax expert, explained taxes like the one proposed by Kenney disproportionately affect lower income residents because a greater amount of their income is used on food and drinks. Warren Gunnels, senior policy advisor for Sanders, said in an email, "It would make much more sense to finance universal pre-school in Philadelphia by raising taxes on its wealthiest residents, who currently benefit from flat state and city tax rates. Right now wealthy Philadelphians pay state income tax of 3.07 percent, an unemployment tax of 0.07 percent, and a city income tax of 3.92 percent. That’s a total state and local tax burden of 7.06 percent. By contrast, New York City’s wealthiest residents pay a top rate of 12.6 percent." Such a plan would be easier said than done, according to Kenney’s administration. "Because of the uniformity clause, it’s constitutionally impermissible right now in Pennsylvania to raise the income tax rate only for wealthy individuals," said Lauren Hitt, Kenney’s communications director. "The Republican controlled state legislature would have to change the constitution and we’re not holding our breath on that one. Our kids need Pre-K now." Kenney has said the tax is not regressive because he believes the money will stay in the neighborhoods. His finance director, Rob Dubow, said most consumers of sugary drinks are in poor neighborhoods. When Dubow suggested distributors would absorb some of the tax, City Council president Darrell Clarke responded, "Fundamentally, I don’t believe that." Our ruling Sanders said Kenney’s proposed soda tax would disproportionately increase taxes for low income families. In the only other instance of a soda tax in the United States, studies have shown somewhere between 25 and 70 percent of the cost of the tax gets passed to consumers. Tax experts say if this tax reaches the consumer level it would affect low income residents to a greater extent. We rule the claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19db2be2-02d7-4cfd-baa1-423db2d4d80f	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-25T13:02:29	2016-04-22	['Philadelphia']
pomt-14125	"There’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives."	/rhode-island/statements/2016/may/08/michael-oneill/how-many-lives-would-be-saved-gun-free-zone/	A bill that would stop the state’s more than 3,000 concealed-carry permit holders from bringing their weapons into Rhode Island schools quickly became the center of attention at an April 26 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Sponsored by Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, Senate Bill 2761 would make schools "gun free zones," meaning that only "peace officers" — defined in state law as people who are sanctioned by the school and have extensive firearms training — could carry weapons in school zones. This roiled Second Amendment enthusiasts who argued against the bill, saying it would put kids at higher risk for acts of terrorism. Legal gun owners, or "good guys," can help disarm a potential attacker if they are on school grounds before police arrive, Michael O’Neill, a pro-bono lobbyist for the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition said at the hearing. Sen. Frank Lombardi, D-Cranston, and Sen. Stephen Archambault, D-Smithfield, both agreed with O’Neill on that point. "If we're going to issue law-abiding concealed-carry permits to people," Archambault said, "... I'd rather know there's a chance someone can put down a lunatic." O’Neill added: "There’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives." We reached out to O’Neill, and his colleague Frank Saccoccio, also of the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition, to clarify. We briefly spoke with both men. Saccoccio said he’d send us information via email Tuesday night. By Friday, he hadn’t sent us an email, and he hasn’t returned subsequent emails and phone calls. On the other side of the argument, support for the bill comes from school committees across the state, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, the Rhode Island Association of School Principals and the Rhode Island Federal of Teachers and Health Professionals, among others. Is it possible that it's not backed up by data? Is there no data? O’Neill’s statement is tough to refute because it’s so broad, said Linda Finn, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence. There may not be data that gun-free zones have "saved lives." It’s hard to disprove a claim like that. Further, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the leading national public health institute — has not extensively researched firearms since 1996, when the National Rifle Association accused the agency of promoting gun control. After the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, President Obama signed an executive order reversing the research ban. But nearly four years later, Congress still hasn’t approved the funding. There is, though, "plenty of data that shows that when guns are present, it increases the likelihood of an injury or death," Finn told us. Like when Michelle Ferguson-Montgomery, a sixth-grade teacher and a concealed-carry permit holder in Utah, shot herself in the leg in the school bathroom in September 2014. Or when an Idaho State University professor literally shot himself in the foot with his concealed gun on campus. Then there’s a psychological phenomenon called the "weapons effect." Numerous peer-reviewed studies, including one dating back to 1967, show the presence of a weapon, or just a photo of one, leads to aggressive behavior in humans. This is especially true when stress levels are high -- say, in an active school shooter situation. The study "Does the Gun Pull the Trigger?" published in "Psychological Science" in 1996 showed that "simply identifying weapons increases the accessibility of aggressive thoughts." This theory played out for a Barrington sixth grader, according to testimony by his father, Willis Peter Bilderback. Bilderback testified that his son became "very afraid" after his teacher told him he had a firearm in his desk. The boy was so shaken that he switched out of the class and had repeated nightmares of "his teacher attempting to track him down with a gun and kill him," according to Bilderback’s testimony. "The fact that my son believed his teacher had a gun in the classroom turned a nationally recognized blue-ribbon Middle School into a house of horrors for him," Bilderback wrote. But do ‘good guys" help? There is anecdotal evidence to back up O’Neill and Archambault’s idea — some of which is outlined in this Washington Post blog from October 2015. In Chicago in April 2015, an Uber driver with a concealed-carry permit "shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people," according to a Chicago Tribune report. A similar incident played out in a Philadelphia barber shop. And an FBI "Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013" showed that out of the 160 incidents studied, in 21 cases unarmed citizens "made the selfless and deeply personal choice" to confront the shooter, and ended the threat. There were seven times that an armed, off-duty police officer, citizen or security guard used a weapon to end the threat. Our ruling: O’Neill says "there’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives." He is correct. There is no definitive data to say that a gun-free zone has saved lives. In part, that’s because the CDC has been blocked from studying anything related to firearms for the last 20 years. And also because "saved lives" are hard to quantify. However, there are many anecdotes, scholarly articles and federal studies with data showing that just the presence of guns can cause anxiety and increase aggressive behavior. Plus, there are the teachers who accidentally shot themselves on school grounds. And yes, there are the cases in which the "good guys" prevail.

pomt-02622	Says Alex Sink "failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices."	/florida/statements/2014/jan/22/republican-party-florida/gop-accuse-alex-sink-using-predatory-lending-pract/	The Republican Party of Florida wasted no time attacking former Florida CFO Alex Sink in her bid for Congress. The GOP started its campaign long before the Jan. 14 Republican primary, which clinched the nomination for David Jolly. A video posted Oct. 31, 2013, begins with Sink taking a break at a CNN/Tampa Bay Times debate in 2010, during which a makeup artist showed Sink an email message from one of the candidate’s advisers. The incident broke the debate’s rules against coaching, and became a sensational talking point about the Democrat cheating. After flashing a sentence accusing Sink of having "failed the public’s trust by cheating during a debate," the video then declares it wasn’t her only failure, launching into several attacks, including the claim that Sink "failed Florida investors by allowing for deceptive sales practices … and failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices." With the March 11 general election matchup set, we decided it was time to lend Sink’s past some of our attention. Sink’s banking background Before being elected Florida’s chief financial officer in 2006, Sink’s extensive banking career included 26 years working for Bank of America, formerly NationsBank. She was promoted to president of Florida operations in 1993 and oversaw tremendous growth. In 1997, NationsBank acquired Jacksonville-based Barnett Bank, then merged with California’s BankAmerica Corp. the following year. The new company took the Bank of America name. Sink retired as Florida president in 2000. The GOP said the "deceptive sales practices" that "failed Florida investors" was referring to a time between 1998 and 2002 when NationsBank and subsidiary NationsSecurities paid more than $13 million in fines to the federal government and the SEC. That led to a class-action lawsuit by investors; the bank in 2002 agreed to compensate their former customers with an $8.1 million settlement. Even though Rick Scott brought up the NationsSecurities fiasco during the same gubernatorial debate being referenced in the ad, Sink said the lawyer bringing the case declared she "had nothing to do with the situation." We found her statement Mostly True in 2010. The part of the ad we are checking, however, is about predatory lending. The video doesn’t give a time frame, and it would be understandable if your first thoughts went to the housing crash of 2008. But when we asked, the GOP told us their accusation actually goes back before that, to NationsBank’s August 1997 merger with Barnett, which was the largest commercial bank in the state at the time. The merger included Barnett subsidiary EquiCredit, which specialized in home loans for low-income borrowers at high interest rates, or subprime lending. EquiCredit was accused of predatory lending on multiple occasions, eventually leading to several lawsuits. The accusations gained steam after a May 2000 hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Financial Services. William J. Brennan, an Atlanta Legal Aid Society attorney, told the committee that EquiCredit and NationsBank’s own subsidiary, NationsCredit were "the worst I have ever seen" in terms of predatory lending. EquiCredit’s delinquency rate -- the share of mortgages either 90 days past due or in foreclosure -- was much higher than average, and targeted minorities, women and the elderly, he said. The company charged higher than average interest rates, which is common in subprime lending. The difference, Brennan alleged, is that EquiCredit willfully deceived vulnerable consumers into taking on loans they could not easily pay, with terms they could rarely understand. At the end of 1999, Bank of America held more than $22 billion in subprime loans, the most of any bank in the country. But Sink was in charge of Florida operations, not national lending for EquiCredit -- that company was run out of two offices in Dallas and Jacksonville, and it used independent brokers, not Bank of America employees. Sink has repeatedly said she did not work with the mortgage side of the business and "never had any involvement with them." Her team reiterated to PolitiFact Florida during the current campaign that she "was not engaged in these disreputable practices." EquiCredit operated as a national entity, with about 150 units across 43 states (22 of which were in Florida). Sink’s Bank of America Florida operations existed alongside the division, but EquiCredit took orders from the bank’s Charlotte, N.C., headquarters. Amid pressure from regulators, lawsuits and consumers, Bank of America closed NationsCredit and sold off EquiCredit by the end of 2001. Officially, both were shuttered because Bank of America no longer considered them profitable. By 2001, one of every 18 EquiCredit loans nationwide went bad, compared to one in 60 of Bank of America’s overall loans. These practices preceded the post-9/11 housing bubble that thrived on subprime lending -- in fact, one of the reasons cited for the closure was the poor economy that initially resulted from the 2001 terrorist attacks. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida accused Sink of having "failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices," citing the subprime lending practices of Bank of America’s NationsCredit and EquiCredit during her time as the bank’s Florida president. The EquiCredit problems were a nationwide issue, though, not just in the Sunshine State. And EquiCredit used brokers to sell their products, not Bank of America Florida employees. Sink would have had no control over that. The video also seems to imply Sink was somehow responsible for the precipitous loss in property values since 2008, but that timeline doesn’t match up, either. There doesn’t seem to be much of anything at all to tie Sink with EquiCredit, other than they both answered to Bank of America HQ in Charlotte. The Florida subsidiary of PolitiFact rates this claim False.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2014-01-22T10:00:00	2013-10-31	['None']
pomt-01494	Says Rick Scott "pled the Fifth 75 times to avoid jail for Medicare fraud."	/florida/statements/2014/sep/25/charlie-crist/crist-says-scott-pleaded-fifth-75-times-avoid-jail/	Gubernatorial campaign commercials have been digging up each candidate’s past for months, but now Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are pretty much calling each other criminals. The Republican Party of Florida, working on Scott’s behalf, had a Fort Lauderdale investor say in a TV ad that he was "swindled" by Crist. The man had invested with Scott Rothstein, who was later convicted of a Ponzi scheme. We rated that Pants on Fire!, because Crist had nothing to do with the plot to defraud investors. Now Crist is going after Scott’s past as the CEO of hospital chain Columbia/HCA, which in 1997 was busted by the federal government for bilking Medicare. Crist referred to the Rothstein attack in a Sept. 19, 2014, commercial, saying Scott lied to voters "4,000 times," the number of times the Rothstein ad had aired on Florida TV stations. "We shouldn’t be surprised," the narrator said. "Scott pled the Fifth 75 times to avoid jail for Medicare fraud." That’s referring to a deposition Scott gave in 2000 for an unrelated civil case. To further muddy the waters, the commercial shows footage from a deposition for yet another unrelated case in 1995. This attack should sound familiar, because it came up in the 2010 campaign, when Scott’s Republican primary opponent Bill McCollum said Scott "barely escaped imprisonment," which we rated False. PolitiFact Florida wanted to revisit this angle and see if Scott, who was never charged with wrongdoing in the federal fraud case, gave vague testimony to avoid time in the cooler. The Columbia/HCA case We’ve been over this many, many times before, so let’s explain the history as quickly as possible. Scott began what eventually became Columbia/HCA in 1987, buying and merging hospitals until his publicly traded company became the nation’s largest health care chain. At its peak, the company boasted more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries. Scott’s reputation as a hard-nosed businessman came from a cutthroat corporate environment, in which the most productive managers were rewarded and the least were fired. Some employees speculated it was that culture that led to unscrupulous behavior, such as padding bills, charging Medicare for procedures that were more lucrative than what was actually performed, and giving doctors kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. Whether Scott knew about such practices is unknown, although he apparently signed off on reports that raised concerns about things happening within the chain. Jerre Frazier, a company attorney told the Miami Herald in 2010 that Scott said the company wasn’t doing anything differently than other chains in the health care industry. Whistle-blowers exposed the fraud, helping federal investigators gather enough evidence to raid the company’s offices and hospitals in 1997. Scott was pressured to resign in July of that year, taking a $5.1 million cash severance and an additional $300 million in stocks and options with him. (Five other top executives also resigned.) Scott has said it was because he wanted to fight the charges while the board wanted to settle, which they did in 2000 and 2002, for a total of $1.7 billion in fines and penalties. Scott was never charged with a crime. His boilerplate response to the incident is that he wasn’t even questioned by investigators, although ABC’s World News Tonight reported in 1997 he was "considered a prime target of the investigation." That’s not unusual, legal experts told PolitiFact, because replacing a CEO is often a first step a company makes to show the government it means business about cleaning up its wayward methods. Whether that’s exactly what happened in Scott’s case, we can’t say. Scott has addressed the case plenty, however. In a 2010 debate he called the deposition a "fishing expedition" he refused to participate in. He told the Tampa Bay Times that same year that he was partly culpable. "There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes," he said. "I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader." Think about the clink The company agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies, which don’t involve jail time but did factor into the fines. Four Florida-based Columbia/HCA executives were indicted. Two were convicted of defrauding Medicare and sentenced to prison, but those verdicts were later overturned. One was acquitted, and a jury couldn’t reach a verdict on the last. Does that mean Scott faced jail at all? In pleading the Fifth Amendment, it certainly seems like a possibility, former federal prosecutor Ryan O’Quinn told us. That’s because the only legal reason to use your Fifth Amendment right in court is if you think your answer would incriminate you. The deposition in which Scott pleaded the Fifth 75 times was part of a civil case by Nevada Communications Corp., which alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract. Scott gave the deposition at his offices in Stamford, Conn., on July 27, 2000, months before the settlement with the federal government. Scott lawyer Steven Steinbach explained the strategy thusly: "Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself." While pleading the Fifth in a criminal case can’t be used as an admission of guilt, it’s just fine to assume that in a civil case. For example, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2014 upheld a $67 million judgment against TD Bank for a group of investors bilked by imprisoned attorney Scott Rothstein, who has factored heavily into campaign commercials between Scott and Crist. In that ruling, the judge said jurors could infer former TD Bank South Florida regional VP Frank Spinosa knew about or participated in Rothstein’s scheme when he invoked the Fifth 193 times. Spinosa has not been charged with a crime and was no longer a bank employee, but was likely avoiding self-incrimination, or possibly as a favor to TD Bank, the ruling said. Scott wasn’t facing a jury, but we’re trying to establish whether one could infer guilt for invoking the Fifth Amendment. In fact, there’s no other reason to think otherwise, because by the letter of the law, Scott must have thought he would incriminate himself if he answered truthfully. "Given the adverse consequences of an assertion of the Fifth Amendment in a civil deposition, an executive must have a significant concern that their response could contribute to their criminal prosecution," O’Quinn said. "A frivolous assertion of the Fifth Amendment would be an unethical act." So if Scott was avoiding incriminating himself and other executives were actually convicted and sentenced to prison (albeit later overturned), does that mean Scott faced jail? That’s conjecture, but he certainly could have faced federal charges, which could have resulted in time in prison. There is a possibility some in the FBI regretted the decision to not go after Scott. "After Columbia/HCA, I realized people, individual corporate officers, had to be held accountable for the actions of their companies,'' former Tampa FBI agent Joe Ford said in a book about the Columbia/HCA case. "Instead of just giving us (the government) money, people need to go to jail. I learn from my mistakes and this was my first big one.'' Our ruling Crist said Scott "pled the Fifth 75 times to avoid jail for Medicare fraud." If you haven’t heard by now, Scott did invoke his Fifth Amendment rights 75 times in a deposition to avoid discussing a Medicare fraud case. But Crist’s ad is pushing the envelope to say he did it to avoid jail. No one went to prison for the Medicare fraud debacle, nor did Scott actually face the rigors of a grand jury or even federal investigators. The commercial seems to imply Scott was in the thick of the raids, when he was actually sent packing as soon as it became apparent the company faced a major punishment for defrauding the U.S. government. It’s impossible to say if Scott would have gone to jail if he had answered those deposition questions, but experts say he was certainly avoiding possible legal trouble by asserting the Fifth Amendment. We rate the statement Half True. Correction, Oct. 3, 2014, 2:30 p.m.: This version clarifies the context in which Scott asserted his Fifth Amendment right. The change does not affect the ruling.

pomt-07063	"There is no $30 million pot of money" for redistricting issues, including defending redistricting lawsuits. "Your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that."	/florida/statements/2011/jun/28/will-weatherford/weatherford-denies-30-million-pot-exists-redistric/	Redistricting will be a messy battle in 2012. And that means legislators need money to protect their turf. But how much have they set aside to wage the war? The Orlando Sentinel has reported that the House set aside $30 million that can be used for redistricting and to fight potential lawsuits. But state Rep. Will Weatherford, the House redistricting chairman and a Republican from Wesley Chapel, rejected that claim while speaking at a public legislative redistricting meeting in Panama City. "There is no $30 million pot of money. That doesn't exist," Weatherford, the House speaker designate, told the June 22, 2011, audience. "Your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that. There is no large pot of money out there that is fighting anything." Several readers saw the Sentinel's reporting and the response from Weatherford and asked us to look into it. First, a quick primer on redistricting. Every 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. The task seems simple enough: to logically divide Florida's 18.8 million residents into 120 House districts, 40 Senate districts and 27 congressional districts. But the process is never without accusations of "gerrymandering" often brought up against the party in power. This round of redistricting, however, could be even more contentious because of two constitutional amendments approved by voters in 2010 that require districts to be drawn in a way that doesn't favor incumbents or political parties or interfere with minority representation. Some lawmakers say the amendments are vaguely worded and are open to interpretation, meaning that any redrawing of district lines will be open to a legal challenge. Expecting lawsuits, legislators have been storing away discretionary tax dollars to fight potential legal challenges. The Sentinel's Aaron Deslatte has been writing about the Legislature's plans and is the source for the $30 million figure. Specifically, Deslatte identified two House discretionary funds -- one with $8.49 million available and another with about $23 million available. (The Senate has set aside about $9 million, according to multiple reports). Deslatte asked House Speaker Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, about the funds in May, and reported that the reserves had been allowed to accumulate in part because the chamber would need money — millions of dollars — to pay for the redistricting fight. "The problem with redistricting every decade is it's unpredictable. The litigation this year is likely to be more broad and complex than it has been in past decades," Cannon said. Through June, the House had spent $945,843 on law firms associated with redistricting, Deslatte reported. Yet, despite the Sentinel stories, and quote from Cannon -- Weatherford is now challenging the dollar figure. Why? Weatherford told us that the problem is suggesting those moneys are specifically earmarked for redistricting. "Those resources are in two different areas, they are not earmarked for redistricting purposes," he said. "Will those pots be utilized for redistricting costs? I believe they will, but that's not the only thing they will be for." Weatherford's right that neither fund has shiny, bold-faced type linking it to redistricting. The funds are called "Legislative Carry Forward" and "House Discretionary Budget." But we believe he's also underplaying their intent. • Of the $8.49 million in the "Legislative Carry Forward" fund, about $571,000 has been spent -- including $18,932 for the redistricting committee. The fund includes small allotments for House members, but the biggest chunk of the money -- nearly $8 million -- is available in a "General House" fund that is available to be used on redistricting. (The redistricting committee has no specific allotment.) • Of the $23 million in the "House Discretionary Budget", about $700,000 has been spent so far on house reapportionment, and most of the money is not allocated for any specific use. Cannon himself admits that the funds were bolstered in order to fend off redistricting challenges. Which makes Weatherford's other claim that "your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that" -- simply not true. (Weatherford told us he wasn't trying to suggest that there are zero dollars for redistricting.) Part of the problem in examining this claim is that the Sentinel's stories got somewhat lost in translation. The Sentinel never said there was a bank vault filled with money sealed behind a door with "Redistricting Only" written on it. But Weatherford, in responding to allegations, was able to suggest as much. And that's what makes his claim -- at least part of it -- credible. There is, in fact, no $30 million pot of money for redistricting in the House. There are two pots of money available for lots of things, but the House speaker said the money predominantly is available to fight potential redistricting lawsuits. That admission, which is not in dispute, defies Weatherford's other point, that "your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that" -- referring to redistricting lawsuits. The Legislature is planning on doing exactly that. There's too much about this claim that is missing. We rate it False.	None	Will Weatherford	None	None	None	2011-06-28T14:20:27	2011-06-22	['None']

pomt-10459	"Bill Clinton invited him (the Rev. Wright) to the White House when he was having his personal crises."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/25/barack-obama/photo-and-obama-dont-lie/	In an interview with Philadelphia radio talk show host Michael Smerconish on March 24, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama defended his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, noting that he was good enough at one point for the Clintons. "But understand this, something else that I think has not gotten reported on enough, is despite these very offensive views, this guy has built one of the finest churches in Chicago. It's not some crackpot church. I mean, witness the fact that Bill Clinton invited him to the White House when he was having his personal crises." Obama is talking about a White House prayer breakfast on Sept. 11, 1998. But this wasn't just any prayer breakfast. This was the forum Clinton chose to make his most comprehensive public apology for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The Clintons invited more than 100 religious leaders from around the country. And Wright, pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ, was one of them. A few days before Obama's radio comment, the Obama campaign released a photo of Rev. Wright shaking hands with President Bill Clinton at the prayer breakfast. Case closed. He was there. They also provided a two-sentence letter Clinton wrote to Rev. Wright the following month. "Thank you so much for your kind message," Clinton's letter reads. "I am touched by your prayers and by the many expressions of encouragement and support I have received from friends across the country." The Rev. Wright's incendiary comments about America — like the oft-viewed comment about America's "chickens coming home to roost" on Sept. 11 — and his close ties as spiritual adviser to Obama have made him the most controversial figure of this presidential election season. A couple days after the Obama campaign released the Clinton-Wright photo, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore took it one step further and claimed that during a time of marital difficulties due to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Clintons had reached out to none other than Rev. Wright for "spiritual counseling." According to ministers at the prayer breakfast, that's not true. Wright was merely one of more than 100 religious leaders invited to the prayer breakfast. There was no spiritual counseling. A small team of ministers were chosen by Clinton to provide ongoing religious counseling about his indiscretions. But Wright wasn't one of them. We rule Moore's statement False. But Obama's wording and purpose are different than Moore's. Obama merely noted that Clinton invited Wright to the White House during a time of personal crisis and didn't suggest there was some close personal tie. And by pointing out the invitation Obama was making clear that Wright was a well-regarded minister — good enough, at least, to be among a select group of religious leaders invited to the White House for an important address by Clinton. "To my knowledge, the 100 leaders were invited on the merits of their leadership and accomplishments in their particular communities," said Dr. Gerald Mann, who delivered a prayer at the breakfast. Listeners hearing Obama's comments might have thought Wright had a larger role at the White House than simply attending a prayer breakfast, but Obama is correct about the timing of the event. And so we find the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-04-25T00:00:00	2008-03-24	['White_House', 'Bill_Clinton']
pomt-07147	"For a young man or woman who is entering the ninth grade in Newark this year, they have a 29 percent graduation rate."	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/15/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-graduation-rate-29-percent/	Gov. Chris Christie recently cited Newark as an example of the problem with New Jersey’s public school system, slapping a bulls-eye on the city’s high school graduation rate. "So let’s talk about Newark for a second, our largest city, little over 275,000 citizens, a school district of about 70 schools, where we spend on average $24,500 per pupil per year. And for a young man or woman who is entering the ninth grade in Newark this year, they have a 29 percent graduation rate. Twenty-nine percent graduation rate," Christie said in a speech at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Christie also used that number at a town hall meeting on April 19 in Jackson while discussing school funding for poor districts. PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check if Newark’s graduation rate is as low as the governor claims. First, let’s put the debate over graduation rates in context. The rates can vary wildly because of differences in calculation. "This is one of the most controversial and confusing areas in education … there is a great need to quiet the debate and have uniform measure," said Jack Jennings, president of the nonpartisan Center on Education Policy in Washington, D.C. "Otherwise, people cherry-pick their numbers." The graduation rate for New Jersey’s Class of 2011 will be based on a new federal standard called the "adjusted cohort graduation rate." The federal measurement closely resembles a common definition of graduation rates that 45 states, including New Jersey, agreed to in 2005. The rate will be calculated by determining the percentage of a ninth grade class that graduates in four years with a standard diploma, accounting for transfers and dropouts. But the number Christie cited at Harvard relied on a different approach. In fact, there are at least two other ways of measuring the graduation rate: One method calculates the percentage of people who enter ninth grade and graduate in four years by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment, or HSPA. A more generous method calculates the students who pass the HSPA, adds in the students who pass an alternate exam as well as special education students whose tests are varied. At Harvard, Christie was referencing a study released in February by Global Education Advisors, a private consulting company incorporated by Christopher Cerf before he became New Jersey’s acting state Education Commissioner. A presentation based on the study’s findings said that 22 percent of children who enter ninth grade in Newark graduate with a "HSPA degree in four years." Newark Public Schools said its graduation rate is 55 percent, which it calculates by including all students who graduate in four years, accounting for transfers and dropouts. Using raw data provided by Newark Public Schools, PolitiFact New Jersey calculated the four-year graduation rate for students who pass the HSPA. We got a rate of 25.8 percent. Newark also had a rate of 19.8 percent for students passing the alternate exam, now called the Alternate High School Assessment and special education students exempt from taking the HSPA accounted for another 9.4 percent, according to the district’s data. The HSPA number is higher than the 22 percent figure from the presentation based on the Global Education Advisors study, which appears to be calculated from two different years of data. And it’s lower than Newark’s 55 percent. Both the state Education Department and Newark Public Schools said they didn’t produce the presentation, so they couldn’t comment on it. Two emails and a phone call to Sangari Global Education, a company with ties to Global Education Advisors, were not returned. Still, Christie’s statistic isn’t totally out of the ballpark -- but only when specifically referring to students who graduate in four years after passing the HSPA. We spoke to three academics and a policy expert to gauge whether one method of calculating the graduation rate is more credible than the other. They said graduation rates should reflect students who graduate within four years prepared for a career or college. "I think we get in this number game way too much," said Alexander Urbiel, assistant dean of teacher education at Ramapo College. "What we really should be looking at is outcomes." One of the academics also said anyone citing a graduation rate statistic needs to be clear on who the number includes. "We need to account for them when we say the school’s graduation rate," said Donna Jorgensen, an associate professor of education at Rowan University, about students who graduate by passing the alternate exam. "If we don’t, it’s like saying they weren’t in school at all." We also talked to Alan Sadovnik, a professor of education, sociology and public affairs at Rutgers University who co-authored a recent report that studied the use of alternate exams in Newark. From 2003 to 2008 the study tracked 9,725 students, 60 percent of whom graduated from high school by passing the alternate exam, which was then called the Special Review Assessment. Forty percent of those students enrolled in college, compared with 68 percent of the students who graduated by passing the HSPA. The study also found that female, low-income and minority students were more likely to graduate by taking the alternate exam. Sadovnik said the governor’s choice of statistic is part of the larger, ongoing debate over eliminating alternate exams and requiring a single-high stakes test for graduation. Let’s review. The governor said the graduation rate in Newark is 29 percent. There are several ways to calculate graduation rates and there is no solid consensus on whether one method is more credible than any other. New Jersey is moving to a federal standard of calculating graduation rates, but hasn’t done so yet. Christie’s number is actually a bit higher than the statistic that measures the four-year graduation rate for students who passed the HSPA. But it’s lower than the calculation that the school system uses. There are different ways to calculate graduation rates and it’s important to be precise in describing them. In this case, the governor glossed over the details and omitted a whole group of students recognized by the state as having graduated, many of whom continued their education beyond high school. For these reasons, we rate Christie’s statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2011-06-15T05:00:00	2011-04-29	['Newark,_New_Jersey']
pomt-05827	Says "there are homes for sale on and around (Oswego Lake) right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy."	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/17/doug-thomas/can-you-really-get-home-near-lake-oswego-less-1500/	A fight over just who should have access to the waters of Oswego Lake is always simmering. Some say the lake belongs to the whole community and needs to be public. Others are coming down on the side of leaving access where it is now, largely with those who live on the lake or have access through easements. In defense of the status quo, Doug Thomas, president of the board of directors for the Lake Oswego Corporation (the organization that manages the lake) had this to say: "Every 10 years or so, someone makes a challenge as to why everyone and anyone can’t come into the lake … But the shareholders built this lake and have maintained it for over a hundred years. Why would we let everyone have access to our backyards?" Then he added an important dimension to the debate, telling The Oregonian that "We’re not exclusive. There are homes for sale on and around the lake right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy." We might be a little out of touch, but "exclusive" is, in fact, one of the first words that comes to mind when we think about Lake Oswego. Generally speaking, the city carries a reputation as an upscale community for those who take home more than most. It seemed to us that $150,000 for a home in the area was a stretch -- let alone a home that sits on or near the lake. We couldn’t help ourselves; we had to check his claim. Our first call was to the Clackamas County assessor’s office. Lynn Longfellow, a sales analyst there, admitted to having heard something about Thomas’ comment earlier. She was similarly confused. She guessed there might be some condos with access to the lake for under $150,000, but she doubted there was anything on the lake for that price. The cheapest she could remember a house on the lake going for was $300,000 -- a short sale with some slide issues. "I can’t imagine anything (else) on the lake selling for $300,000," she said. Let alone $150,000. Still, she was kind enough to run us last year’s sales data, so we could take a closer look for ourselves. As far as waterfront property goes -- that means canals and the lake itself -- the cheapest sale documented was for just over $500,000. If you’re talking Lake Oswego and Lake Grove generally, six homes went for less than $150,000. None of them looked as though they’d be in areas with easement rights -- though we can’t say for certain as the map on the Lake Corp. website isn’t definitive. If you take a look at condos specifically, things look a little more promising. About 44 condos in the whole of Lake Oswego -- half of those listed -- went for less than $150,000. Few of them were in the estimated easement areas, but we did find a couple, including one in Lake Grove that went for just over $100,000. To put that figure in a little bit of context, though, of the 580 stand-alone homes sold in the area last year -- and the figures aren’t completely final -- six sold for less than $150,000, while more than 200 sold for $500,000 or higher. To check the current market, which seemed to be Thomas’ focus, we pulled up current listings in the area on the Windemere Real Estate website. First we searched for strictly waterfront properties under $150,000. Not a single one came up. When we left the waterfront part out, 20 properties popped up, about five of which appeared to be close enough to potentially have lake access via an easement -- though we can’t be sure. Those five properties were all condos. The cheapest listing that explicitly mentioned lake access was for a condo priced at $100,000. Based on that quick search, it seemed like Thomas might be right as far as homes around the lake go -- so long as you consider a condo a home. But there is still nothing directly on the lake, house or condo, that appears to be available for less than $150,000. Still, we’re hardly professionals when it comes to real estate, so we phoned Hasson Realtors, an agency that works in the area, for another take. Bill Marquard, one of the real estate agents with Hasson, was happy to help. He quickly found around 10 condos that were listed for less than $150,000 and would have lake access. Some condos at a property that was formerly an apartment complex even had docks. "You definitely have condos," Marquard said. "You can get into Lake Oswego and have access to the lake for definitely under $150,000." But as for stand-alone houses, "I wouldn't say impossible but very, very difficult. "What's your definition of a home?" he asked. Finally, we wanted to talk to Thomas. After all, he’s the one who made the statement we’re ruling on. After repeated phone calls, we finally got him on the line. He said condos are just as much a home as a house and he pointed out the apartments-turned-condos that were going for under $150,000. "I'm not trying to mislead anybody," Thomas said. "I think everybody always assumes that these properties are expensive." So that brings us to our ruling. Last week, Thomas told the Oregonian that there were "homes for sale on and around (Oswego Lake) right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy." So far as we can tell, there’s nothing on the lake, condos or otherwise, that hits that mark. There are some condos with lake access that go for less than $150,000. But that price is hardly the norm. Those are important details -- and his statement ignores them. We give this a Half True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this staterement and ruling.

pomt-08068	"Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, recommended partitioning Iraq into three separate entities."	/texas/statements/2010/dec/22/george-w-bush/former-president-george-w-bush-says-senator-joe-bi/	In his memoir Decision Points, President George W. Bush says that he declined to announce plans to increase troop levels in Iraq in 2006 until after the midterm elections. "The rhetoric on Iraq was hot," he said. "Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, recommended partitioning Iraq into three separate entities. Republicans were anxious, too. Mitch McConnell (the Senate minority leader from Kentucky) made it clear with his Oval Office request for a troop reduction." Before he was elected Vice President in 2008, Biden called for boundaries to be drawn for the Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite populations. But is that the same as partitioning a country? The word can hold some heavy implications: think India, Korea and Vietnam — previously unified territories that were divided into two countries. Seeking an answer to that question, we turned to the May 2006 op-ed article published in The New York Times that then-Delaware Sen. Biden penned with Leslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. In it, they drew a parallel between conditions in Iraq and Bosnia's recent ethnic turmoil. "A decade ago, Bosnia was torn apart by ethnic cleansing and facing its demise as a single country," the article says. "After much hesitation, the United States stepped in decisively with the Dayton Accords, which kept the country whole by, paradoxically, breaking it into ethnic federations, even allowing Muslims, Croats and Serbs to retain separate armies. With the help of American and other forces, Bosnians have lived a decade in relative peace and are now slowly strengthening their common central government, including disbanding those separate armies last year." A similar plan for Iraq, the Biden-Gelb article says, would "maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it," establishing "three largely autonomous regions with a viable central govetrnment in Baghdad . . .The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multi-sectarian and international police protection." And as to the "p" word? The article says: "Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing. But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq." In 2007, Biden — who by then had become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, shepherded a nonbinding "sense of the Senate" resolution that proposed separating Iraq into three semi-autonomous regions while maintaining a federal government. The resolution passed the Senate 75 to 23. According to a C-SPAN video, Biden told colleagues on the Senate floor in April 2007: "You make federalism work for the Iraqis. You give them control over the fabric of their daily lives. . . Let them control their local police, their education, their religion, their marriage. That's the only possibility. Change the focus to a limited central government and a federal system that their Constitution calls for." But when news articles used "partition" or "soft partition" to describe Biden's proposal, the senator took exception to the label, mindful that in foreign policy, it is a loaded term. A June 2007 paper from the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution making the case for "soft partition in Iraq" says it would divide the "country into three main regions. Each would assume primary responsibility for its own security and governance... it would require new negotiations, the formation of revised legal framework for the country, the creation of new institutions at the regional level, and the organized but voluntary movement of populations." "Such a plan for soft partition (as opposed to hard-partition which involves outright division of Iraq) is consistent" with the Biden-Gelb plan, according to the paper. Michael O'Hanlon, the paper's coauthor and a Brookings' foreign policy fellow, told us in an e-mail that "Biden called it enhanced federalism. He did not say that it would be formal partition into three states." O'Hanlon described "enhanced federalism" as "three regions with lots of autonomy." In an October 2007 op-ed (again co-written with Gelb) for The Washington Post, Biden wrote: "Our plan is not partition, though even some supporters and the media mistakenly call it that. It would hold Iraq together by bringing to life the federal system enshrined in its constitution. A federal Iraq is a united Iraq but one in which power devolves to regional governments, with a limited central government responsible for common concerns such as protecting borders and distributing oil revenue." And during a July 18, 2010 interview on ABC's This Week, Biden said: "I don't want to debate history here, but I never called for a partition. I called for a central government with considerable autonomy in the regions." PolitiFact National rated his statement True. But is a rose by any other name still a rose? We wondered whether what Bush calls a partition and what Biden calls, well, not a partition, shakes out the same way. O'Hanlon said "the word 'partition,' by itself, tends to mean separate states. 'Soft partition' or 'enhanced federalism' or 'autonomous regions' are fairer ways to characterize Biden's thinking. I would say partition is inaccurate as a depiction," he said. Long story short, Biden proposed dividing the country into three separate and semi-autonomous regions while retaining a federal system to handle border security and other common concerns. Bush calls that partitioning. Biden does not, pointing to his support for a central government in Iraq. But both are talking about creating new geopolitical entities in Iraq.

pomt-14646	Martin Luther King Jr. "was a Republican."	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/25/philip-van-cleave/van-cleave-wongly-says-martin-luther-king-jr-was-r/	On the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., gun rights supporters rallied on the state Capitol grounds against efforts to tighten firearm restrictions. Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, which organized the rally, disparaged the Democratic Party as the party of gun control. He then uttered what he said was a little-known fact: "We’re here on a holiday, and this holiday is Martin Luther King’s birthday, right? Somebody who fought for civil rights to bring people to be equal," Van Cleave said. "Let me ask you a question. What party was he with? He was a Republican." That was news to us. We decided to investigate. We asked Van Cleave to support his claim that the slain civil rights leader was a Republican. He told us in a telephone interview that he’d heard that statement many times. He said he’d do some research on the origin of the claim and get back to us. He followed with an email saying his research found some claims that King was with the GOP and others saying his party affiliation was unknown. "I’m also not finding an unimpeachable source either way. So I’d have to say that one can’t claim he was a Republican with absolute certainty, nor can one say he wasn’t a Republican with absolute certainty," Van Cleave wrote. "Rather than get mixed up in this gray area, I’m just going to drop that one off my talking points," he added. Indeed, the Internet is replete with declarations from conservative groups that King was a brethren Republican. The claim rests, in large part, on comments made at least eight years ago by Alveda C. King, the civil rights leader’s niece. "My uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during his lifetime was a Republican," Alveda King said in a video posted on the National Black Republican Association website. Her statement has been dismissed by other members of King’s family. "It is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican," Martin Luther King III, the civil rights leader’s son, told The Associated Press in 2008. "He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican." And on the same day Van Cleave made his statement, Bernice King, the civil rights leader’s daughter, said in a radio interview that her father was "never" a member of the Republican Party. The video of Alveda King’s comments has been circulating for years. But in 2013, she retracted her claim in an op-ed for Newsmax.com, a conservative news website. King wrote that she regrets "having said to a group of peers that my Uncle M. L. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) was a Republican. I said that without having all the facts." Alveda King wrote that her uncle was "an independent, who in his own words tended to vote Democrat." She wrote that she had assumed her uncle was a member of the GOP because his father - Martin Luther King, Sr. - was a Republican. Alveda King wrote that before the election of Democrat John F. Kennedy as president in 1960, most blacks were Republicans. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island in 2012 also examined a claim that the civil rights leader was a Republican. They wrote that it wasn’t surprising that King’s father, who lived in Atlanta, was a Republican because most Southern Democrats at the time backed racial segregation. For more insight, we contacted Clayborne Carson, founding director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. We asked him if King was a Republican and whether there are any voter registration records that would confirm that’s the case. "To the best of my knowledge, the answer to both questions is no," Carson replied in an email. Carson also is director of the King Papers Project, a research initiative with the King Center in Atlanta that is compiling the civil rights leader’s sermons, correspondence, speeches and other writings. He said that project has not found any records that show King registered with either political party. Carson said King wasn’t completely enamored with Republicans or Democrats. "There are many documents indicating that King was critical of both major political parties, because they were insufficiently committed to civil rights and ‘a better distribution of wealth,’" he wrote. Lewis Baldwin, a professor emeritus of religious studies at Vanderbilt University who has written six books about the civil rights leader, told us there’s "no evidence whatsoever" that King was a Republican. Any assertion that King was a member of the GOP is "absolutely false," he said. King said blacks "should remain independent voters, and they should not become unduly tied to any party, Democrat or Republican," Baldwin said. Our ruling Van Cleave said at a rally that Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican. He told us he had heard the claim many times but, after doing some research, now concludes that the evidence is cloudy and said he will stop using the line in speeches. Experts say King eschewed party labels and was critical of both major parties. King’s son and daughter have denied claims that their father sided with the GOP. King’s niece, who once said the civil rights leader was a Republican, retracted that statement three years ago. The burden is on Van Cleave to prove his statement, and he, too, backs away from it.

pomt-11474	Says Mike DeWine "flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA."	/ohio/statements/2018/mar/06/mary-taylor/gop-ohio-primary-governor-mary-taylor-said-mike-de/	Among Ohio’s Republican candidates for governor, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor portrays herself as more conservative than Attorney General Mike DeWine when it comes to Second Amendment issues. "I do not trust Mike DeWine on guns," Taylor said during a Jan. 29 speech at the Washington Heights Baptist Church. "He flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA. I have an A with the NRA." Taylor and DeWine are competing in the May 8 Republican primary for governor with hopes to replace term-limited Gov. John Kasich. There is no disputing that DeWine once received an F grade from the NRA, which was based on his stances while in the U.S. Senate more than a decade ago. In 2002, the Columbus Dispatch described DeWine as a "Republican who's not afraid to stand up to the National Rifle Association." But when DeWine ran for Ohio attorney general in 2010, his positions on gun laws changed. Taylor omits that DeWine’s grades from pro-gun groups have risen as he has taken stances more in line with the NRA. The NRA did not respond to our requests to confirm DeWine’s grades, but DeWine’s campaign spokesman sent PolitiFact documents showing his grades by the NRA, as well as from a state group, the Buckeye Firearms Association. DeWine’s ratings from gun groups have varied over the years DeWine has served in elected office since he won a county prosecutor position in 1976. We largely focused our search of his gun stances starting with his tenure in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007. Taylor’s campaign spokesman Michael Duchesne pointed to Vote Smart’s compilation of DeWine’s ratings from groups that take stances on gun laws. The NRA gave DeWine a 46 percent in 2000, an 8 percent in 2006 and an F in 2010. DeWine supported multiple gun control measures while a senator, including restrictions on sales at gun shows and the assault weapons ban. In 1999, DeWine was one of a handful of Republicans to side with Democrats to support an amendment to enact a waiting period on sales at gun shows following the mass shooting at Columbine High School. "The amendment seemed on balance to make sense," he said a year later. "I feel that the requirement to follow the Brady gun-check law should apply to everyone at a gun show and that's what this amendment did." In 2001, Dewine co-sponsored a bill with U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to impose a three-day waiting period on gun show purchases, which was opposed by the NRA. DeWine was outspoken in favor of extending the assault weapons ban. In 2005 when Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation to re-establish the expired ban, DeWine was among a group of bipartisan cosponsors. "Re-establishing the assault weapons ban is simply good public policy. The law modestly prohibits a select few military-style weapons, all the while protecting the rights of legitimate gun owners nationwide," DeWine said. "As a former prosecutor, I understand the challenges Ohio's mayors and law enforcement officials face, and we owe it to them to reestablish this law." In 2006, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed DeWine in his re-election, according to news reports. DeWine lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Sherrod Brown that fall. The Columbus Dispatch later wrote, "DeWine's 2006 defeat was primarily because voters were sick of the war in Iraq, not because they believe everyone in Ohio should own a machine gun." DeWine’s gun record since leaving the U.S. Senate In 2010 while running for attorney general, DeWine’s campaign told sportsmen and Second Amendment groups that he regretted his assault weapons vote, said Ryan Stubenrauch, who has worked on behalf of DeWine’s campaigns between 2010-18. Stubenrauch said that while DeWine was in the Senate, he heard from law enforcement officials who said they supported the assault weapons ban. But he later concluded the assault weapons ban "didn’t do anything." (Firm conclusions about the impact of the ban are not possible, PolitiFact has previously concluded.) In 2010, the NRA still gave DeWine an F. But his support from gun rights groups would change after he was elected attorney general. While attorney general, DeWine repeatedly took stances in favor of gun rights by supporting legislation in Congress and the Ohio Legislature. He also signed on to amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, including in support of the Illinois State Rifle Association, opposed a federal proposal to ban a certain type of ammunition and supported efforts to arm school teachers. In 2012, DeWine supported the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act to allow any person with a valid state-issued concealed firearm permit to carry the concealed firearm in many other states. He also supported state bills that removed some requirements for concealed carry license holders. When DeWine sought re-election in 2014, the Buckeye Firearms Association gave DeWine a B grade and endorsed him while the NRA gave him a C plus. DeWine’s campaign spokesman said as of Feb. 21 he wasn’t aware of any grade by the NRA for his current race. One other sign of DeWine’s pro-gun stance: He named Secretary of State Jon Husted, who has received an A plus from the NRA, as his running mate. Our rating will only be based on information that was available at the time that Taylor made her statement in January, but we will note that in February the Republicans split endorsements from state gun-rights groups. DeWine was endorsed by the Buckeye Firearms Association, and Taylor was endorsed by Ohioans for Concealed Carry. Our ruling Taylor said DeWine "flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA." DeWine did receiving failing grades from the NRA based on his record in the U.S. Senate, including in 2010 when he ran for Ohio Attorney General. As Taylor noted broadly, DeWine did flip-flop. As attorney general he has taken several stances more aligned with the NRA and no longer supports an assault weapons ban. Taylor zeroes in on DeWine’s record from many years ago and omits that by 2014, he had clearly earned the support of the Buckeye Firearms Association when it endorsed his re-election.

pomt-02720	Says Gov. Scott Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college short of a degree "not long after" he was "kicked out of student elections at Marquette University."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/21/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-scott-walker-was-k/	Some critics of Gov. Scott Walker have for years charged, insinuated or suggested that a dark story underlies his early departure from Marquette University in 1990. Such talk ramped up when Walker announced he was writing a book, "Unintimidated," that was released in November 2013. "The ‘Essence’ of Dirty Tricks: Dropping out at Marquette," read a headline on the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s website. "Scott Walker was kicked out of student elections at Marquette University after masterminding a scheme that destroyed newspapers critical of him," the party alleged on its website. "Walker either dropped out or was forced out not long after." Mike Tate, chairman of the state Democratic Party, told us the party based its post on unnamed sources who he said had privately passed on information about possible "nefarious activity" that Tate did not describe. Those parties would be reluctant to talk to a reporter, he said. The allegation is defensible, Tate argued, because the party is trying to raise questions about the "mystery" of Walker’s departure. That’s a flimsy case, at best. At worst, it suggests a possible fictional smear. It’s similar to claims by others that Walker got caught cheating and was kicked out, for which critics have offered no evidence. To research the various claims, and examine how Walker has shifted his own explanation over time, we examined volumes of university files on the election and other matters from the period, and spoke with Walker, his opponent in the student elections, and students, teachers and administrators -- Walker critics and backers alike. We reported the results of our investigation in a story published Dec. 18, 2013. That story provides a basis for this Truth-O-Meter item, which we decided to break out separately because of how often we are asked by readers to look at -- and rate -- this very claim. Here we’ll summarize some of our findings. Walker enrolled at Marquette in the fall of 1986, and left in spring 1990 with about a year’s worth of credits left to earn. He took a full-time job and was running for state Assembly at the time. In February 1988, as a sophomore, he entered a fiercely fought campaign for Marquette student government president against John Quigley, a liberal student from Chicago. The day before the election, the student-produced Marquette Tribune endorsed Quigley. The paper, though, also said Walker was qualified. That day’s newspaper became a limited edition, students told the Quigley campaign. They’d seen Walker workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings, according to Quigley. Administrators soon got involved in the dustup. Walker campaign officials denied involvement. Stung by the endorsement, Walker’s camp plastered campus with an election-eve flier criticizing Quigley’s political tactics. It was gentle stuff, but the Trib took offense, publishing an election-day editorial headlined, "Walker unfit." It decried his "mudslinging" and said another factor in its reversal on Walker being qualified was the alleged theft of papers. The next day’s vote wasn’t close; Quigley won 1,245 to 927. His tenure was short. Within months, Quigley was forced from office when senators threatened impeachment following his arrest at a sit-in protesting a university decision to displace low-income residents of the central YMCA to make room for Marquette dormitory space. Theft of newspapers alleged Quigley’s departure left an opening in spring 1989. But Walker sat it out and disappeared from the student government scene. An interesting turn of events, but a far cry from proof that Walker was barred from running. Overall, we turned up no proof that Walker was banned from elections. We did find evidence that the alleged newspaper confiscation got the attention of top university administrators, one of whom ordered an investigation. "I have requested the Department of Public Safety to investigate the reported destruction/theft of a large number of Marquette Tribune newspapers on February 23, 1988," Dean of Students James E. Moore wrote to College Of Journalism Dean Sharon Murphy on May 9, 1988. "If the inquiry indicates a conduct policy violation on the part of the identified individuals, a disciplinary process will be initiated." We found no paper trail, and could not learn from interviews, what came of that investigation, if anything. Marquette officials told us that even if they once existed, records regarding disciplinary actions unrelated to academics are destroyed two years after a student or his/her class graduates, per the student handbook. Students who have completed a penalty for non-academic discipline are returned to good standing. Records of suspensions or expulsions are not destroyed, the handbook says. The bottom line: Details of the alleged purloining of the papers are not readily available in the public record, such as it is, much less evidence of who may have "masterminded" it. "These allegations are false," Walker spokesman Tom Evenson told us. Quigley firmly agrees. "I don’t believe any disciplinary action was taken against him for anything that happened in that election," said Quigley, who is now a Democratic political consultant. Marquette releases information Now let’s tackle the larger suggestion by the Democratic Party -- that Walker may have been forced out of the university altogether. In the course of our reporting, we heard nothing -- and found no evidence -- suggesting Walker was pushed out of the university. Publicly available documents cannot fully resolve the question, in part because a federal privacy law blocks release of information on former students unless the person consents. In addition, Walker told us he was sticking to an earlier decision not to release his transcript. With that in mind, we asked Walker if he would allow Marquette to comment on his academic and conduct record. He did. "Gov. Scott Walker was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew from Marquette," the university said in a statement. That means that no conduct issues, academic or otherwise, blocked Walker from continuing in school at the time of his departure, MU spokesman Brian Dorrington told us in early December 2013. When we asked Dorrington whether any conduct issues were on Walker’s earlier school record, he said Walker would have to permit release of that information. Walker did so in response to our request. "Governor Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette University and when he left Marquette University," Associate Vice Provost Anne Deahl said in a letter. "Governor Walker was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time." That statement provides the strongest refutation to date of accusations that Walker was forced out. Finally, there’s another problem with the Democratic Party’s claims. According to MU, Walker left school after the spring semester in 1990. That’s more than two years after the 1988 election, instead of the "not long after" the Dems claim. After we published our Dec. 18, 2013 story, Tate told us the Democratic Party was changing its website in light of the new information released by Marquette that contradicts the party’s claims. "While we still stand behind our sources, only Scott Walker can clarify what happened in his time at Marquette University, and we'll afford the governor the respect of taking him at his word on this," Tate told the Journal Sentinel. "Accordingly, we've updated our website." The site now drops the "forced out" reference. But it still accuses Walker of "masterminding" the scheme to destroy newspapers. Walker, for his part, said this to PolitiFact Wisconsin about the accusation he was kicked out: "I can say unequivocally that isn’t true." Our rating The Democratic Party website said that "Scott Walker was kicked out of student elections at Marquette University after masterminding a scheme that destroyed newspapers critical of him." It added that "Walker either dropped out or was forced out not long after." The party offered nothing to backup up its claims, and our investigation found no backup either. And statements by Marquette go a long way to contradicting the party’s statements. We’ll revisit this item if new evidence emerges, but at this point, we rate the party’s claims False.

pomt-06976	Social Security and other federal checks may not go out on Aug. 3 if the debt ceiling is not increased.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-social-security-and-other-federa/	President Barack Obama and Congress are in intense discussions on raising the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow. But the negotiations aren't going so well, leaving observers -- and some participants -- to consider whether there are Plan B's, Plan C's and Plan D's if the negotiators can't reach an agreement in time. After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts as a temporary measure that bought time for further negotiations. But officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011. While most if not all federal accounts are affected in some way by the debt limit debate, the most urgent items for many ordinary Americans are direct transfer payments, most notably Social Security and veterans' benefits. Obama was asked about this in a July 12, 2011, interview with CBS News anchor Scott Pelley. Here's their exchange: Pelley: "Can you tell the folks at home that, no matter what happens, the Social Security checks are going to go out on August the 3rd? There are about $20 billion worth of Social Security checks that have to go out the day after the government is supposedly going to go into default." Obama: "Well, this is not just a matter of Social Security checks. These are veterans' checks, these are folks on disability and their checks. There are about 70 million checks that go out each month." Pelley: "Can you guarantee, as president, that those checks will go out on August the 3rd?" Obama: "I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on August 3rd if we haven't resolved this issue, because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it." We heard from a lot of readers who wanted us to check whether that statement was factually accurate or if Obama was using scare tactics. Back in February, we examined a similar statement by Obama -- that if there's a government shutdown, "people don't get their Social Security checks." We rated that Barely True. Social Security is a mandatory program supported by a trust fund, so Social Security benefits don't have to be formally approved by Congress every year. However, Social Security Administration employees are paid through appropriated funds. The real question about a government shutdown was whether those employees would be kept from going to work and if so, whether the checks would sit idle rather than arriving in mailboxes nationwide. The rules that cover government shutdowns provide some leeway for federal workers to carry out core Social Security functions. This flexibility allowed checks to go out during a 1995 shutdown, even as less-urgent agency functions lagged. However, the two scenarios -- a government shutdown caused by the absence of funding approved by Congress and a debt ceiling impasse that prevents new borrowing -- are different. So the consequences of one do not necessarily match the consequences of the other. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, put it this way: "Failing to raise the debt ceiling would not bring the government to a screeching halt the way that not passing appropriations bills would. Employees would not be sent home, and checks would continue to be issued. If the Treasury was low on cash, however, there could be delays in honoring checks and disruptions in the normal flow of government services." This is because the government receives both cash, including tax revenue, and bills at irregular intervals. So it doesn't always have enough cash on hand to pay all its debts at any given moment. (Families and businesses will recognize this as the always-dreaded "cash flow problem.") The Treasury Department has argued that failure to raise the debt limit actually would have more dramatic consequences than a government shutdown. "If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, the government would have to stop, limit, or delay payments on a broad range of legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and many other commitments," the department said in a statement. How broad would the impact be? The Bipartisan Policy Center -- a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with a board that includes former politicians from both parties -- conducted an analysis of what the government's fiscal situation would be if a deal on the debt ceiling is not reached. When the center analyzed the government's inflows and outflows for the rest of August 2011, it found $172.4 billion in cash coming in, to offset required payments of $306.7 billion. That works out to a deficit of $134.3 billion. With that amount of income to work with, the government -- if it could prioritize payments, and we'll say more on that later -- could pay the monthly costs of Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Pentagon vendors ($31.7 billion), interest on the debt ($29 billion), and unemployment benefits ($12.8 billion). Those categories total $172.7 billion. But doing so would mean delaying other payments -- for instance, Pell grants and other educational programs ($20.2 billion), salaries and benefits for federal employees ($14.2 billion), welfare and food programs ($9.3 billion), health and human services grants ($8.1 billion), housing assistance ($6.7 billion), and many other programs, including military active duty pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs program ($2.9 billion), Department of Justice funding that includes the FBI and federal courts ($1.4 billion) and IRS refunds ($3.9 billion). If the government could prioritize payments to creditors it deemed most important -- bondholders, say, or Social Security beneficiaries -- it could be a viable stopgap, at least for the favored creditors. But does the government have the power to prioritize whom it pays? The answer is somewhat in dispute. Here's how CRS describes it: "Some have argued that prioritization of payments can be used by Treasury to avoid a default on federal obligations by paying interest on outstanding debt before other obligations," CRS wrote in a study published earlier this year. "Treasury officials have maintained that the department lacks formal legal authority to establish priorities to pay obligations, asserting, in effect, that each law obligating funds and authorizing expenditures stands on an equal footing. In other words, Treasury would have to make payments on obligations as they come due." But CRS added that this view contrasts with one expressed by the Government Accountability Office in 1985 (when the office, the auditing arm of Congress, was known as the General Accounting Office). The GAO found "no requirement" that Treasury pay its bills in a first-in, first-out fashion. "Treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States," the GAO concluded. Even if the government has the authority to prioritize payments such as Social Security checks, doing so would still entail some downsides, and some of these might be considered politically or practically untenable. Doing so merely kicks certain payments down the road, where they may accrue additional interest charges, worsening an already difficult fiscal climate. "A backlog of unpaid bills would continue to grow until the government collects more revenues or other sources of cash than its outlays," CRS wrote. "In some cases, delaying federal payments incurs interest penalties under some statutes such as the Prompt Payment Act, which directs the government to pay interest penalties to contractors if it does not pay them by the required payment date, and the Internal Revenue Code, which requires the government to pay interest penalties if tax refunds are delayed beyond a certain date." Even if payments to bondholders were prioritized, the bond market may still be spooked by the delays in other federal payments, risking harm to the nation's creditworthiness. "If the federal government were to prioritize payments on debt obligations above other obligations, it is not clear whether financial markets would find this distinction to be significant when deciding whether and how to invest in federal government Treasury securities," CRS wrote. CRS added, "if creditors lost this confidence, the federal government’s interest costs would likely increase substantially, and there would likely be broader disruptions to financial markets." Delaying certain payments, even while making others, could ripple through the economy and drag down already weak economic growth. "Removing a portion of government spending from the economy would leave behind significant economic effects and would have an effect on" gross domestic product, CRS wrote. There are also some specific technical challenges for shifting funding into and out of the Social Security Trust Fund, which our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker column looked into here. Most of the experts we interviewed agreed that the federal government, if push came to shove, could probably find a way to prioritize Social Security or other payments, though none expressed absolute certainty. However, most of the experts also acknowledged practical challenges of using such tactics. While he thinks the GAO's green light for payment prioritization carries significant weight, Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute added that "with so much being borrowed, it is hard simply to pick on a few programs" to continue in the face of a debt ceiling impasse. Ronald M. Levin, a professor at the Washington University School of Law said, "I interpret the president to be saying, 'Stopping Social Security checks would be hugely costly, but other curtailments would also be hugely costly. ... Something will have to give, and I cannot responsibly guarantee that it won’t be Social Security.' That is not quite what he said, but to my mind it’s close." Where does this leave us? The critics likely have a point when they say Obama is playing up the risk to the most sympathetic potential victims -- Social Security recipients, 23 percent of whom live in households that depend on the retirement system for 90 percent or more of their income. While it's not a certainty that the Obama administration could prioritize cutting checks to seniors, there's a reasonable shot that the administration could do it. On the other hand, doing so would likely cause a lot of collateral damage to other American creditors, federal workers, students, Pentagon vendors and countless others -- and could also hamper the broader economy at a particularly sensitive time. The president is probably justified in saying that the possibility of an un-raised debt ceiling jeopardizes Social Security checks -- after all, it hasn't happened before, so no one knows for sure. But we also think the president probably has tools at his disposal to avoid the worst-case scenario for seniors that he expresses concern about. Acknowledging that there are a lot of uncertainties, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-07-13T18:26:51	2011-07-12	['None']
pomt-13160	Says drug dealers have "overdosed on purpose" to avoid prosecution.	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/28/chris-sununu/chris-sununu-says-nh-law-protects-drug-dealers-pro/	New Hampshire has a big problem with heroin and opioids -- the state is on track to hit over 480 overdose deaths in 2016 and currently ranks third nationwide for per-capita drug overdose deaths. Candidates up and down the ballot have explained their plans to deal with the crisis. Earlier this month, gubernatorial candidates Chris Sununu, a Republican from Newfields, and Colin Van Ostern, a Democrat from Concord, were asked separately about their plans to tackle the heroin and fentanyl epidemic at a candidate forum in Manchester. Asked about law enforcement’s response to the drug crisis, Sununu gave a lengthy answer on New Hampshire’s Good Samaritan Law, which gives people suffering an overdose immunity from arrest if they call 911 for help. Sununu said the bill has had an unintended effect - making police unable to prosecute drug dealers. And the executive councilor went one step further, saying drug dealers have started overdosing on purpose because they know they won’t be prosecuted. "So what I’ve heard from police officers, police chiefs, they’ve said we’ve gone in and revived folks with Narcan, with 10 fingers of heroin on the table knowing that was going to kill somebody, and they could do nothing," Sununu said. "Those are well intended laws with massively unintended consequences." He went on. "Drug dealers have smartened up right away, they've overdosed on purpose. They're buying Narcan themselves and they've overdosed, they've called 911 so all the drugs they have in the house are now immune from prosecution." Narcan is an overdose reversal drug carried by first responders in the state. Also known by its generic name naloxone, the drug has been made available over the counter at pharmacies because the state’s heroin problem has grown so dire. PolitiFact decided to look into the matter. Are police rendered helpless when responding to a report of an overdose? Are drug dealers intentionally overdosing? The Good Samaritan Law was one of many new pieces of legislation dealing with the drug crisis that went into effect in 2015. Advocates who backed the bill in the New Hampshire legislature argued it would save more lives by allowing people to call for help without fear of arrest. However, the bill was opposed by some in law enforcement for fear it could make it more difficult to arrest low-level drug dealers. The law states that anyone asking for help during a drug overdose "shall not be arrested, prosecuted, or convicted for possessing, or having under his or her control, a controlled drug in violation." But the law only shields individuals from drug possession charges, not charges related to drug dealing. We reached out to Sununu’s campaign, which said he based the statement about drug dealers overdosing on purpose from conversations with "sheriffs, police chiefs, and other law enforcement officials" on the campaign trail. So we called a few of the people Sununu said he’s been talking to. He is correct at least that some law enforcement officials are still concerned about the bill’s effects. Enfield Police Chief Richard Crate, the former president of the NH Chiefs of Police Association, says there was little evidence to show fewer people were calling for help during an overdose before the law was passed and removing the threat of arrest puts police at a disadvantage. "I think we’ve lost a valuable tool by being able to use the threat of prosecution and the threat of incarceration to keep people clean," he said. However, Crate said he is not aware of any drug dealers intentionally overdosing to try and avoid prosecution. We asked around to see if other departments had seen anyone intentionally overdosing to avoid prosecution. In Manchester, the state’s largest city, the police department’s drug unit was "not aware" of any intentional overdoses, said Lt. Brian O’Keefe. Police in Concord, the state's capital, and police in Laconia to the north, also said they had not seen anyone overdosing intentionally to gain immunity. Police in Nashua and the State Police Department did not respond. Even if a drug dealer did overdose on purpose to avoid prosecution, it wouldn’t work. If police respond to an overdose and find a significant amount of drugs, "we’re going to do an investigation regardless if the person overdosed on purpose," said Laconia police officer Eric Adams, the department’s prevention, enforcement and treatment coordinator and an advocate for the "good samaritan" law. While the law protects people who overdose with immunity from drug possession charges, it does not - as Sununu claims - give people with intent to distribute drugs protection from prosecution. A recent local case demonstrates this. On Sept. 30, Concord police responded to the Comfort Inn for a report of two people overdosing. Upon arrival, police treated the people with Narcan and observed hypodermic needles, a large amount of cash and multiple packages of pills. Police arrested both for possession with intent to distribute and seized 115 grams of methamphetamine. The law doesn’t prevent police from seizing drugs either, Concord Police Lt. Tim O’Malley said. "If we walk into living room and there’s heroin on the table, we’re going to seize that," O’Malley said. "We will not walk away from any kind of controlled substance." Our ruling Republican candidate for governor Chris Sununu said drug dealers have "overdosed on purpose" to avoid prosecution on drug charges. That’s not how the law works. New Hampshire’s "good samaritan" law shields people from drug possession charges if they call for help during an overdose. The law does not shield individuals from drug dealing charges and police can still investigate a crime and seize drugs when responding to an overdose. Police in various departments reported no instances of anyone intentionally overdosing to avoid drug charges. We rate the claim False.

pomt-15201	"We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-repeats-flawed-claim-about-us-healt/	Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is on a campaign for "Medicare for all" — or at least something like it. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who identifies as a socialist, told NBC’s Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd to look at how much the country spends compared to the rest of the world as a reason for a single-payer system. "We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country," Sanders said. It’s a striking claim, and one we heard from Sanders six years ago. We rated the claim False then, and it's still wrong now. We looked at data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), widely cited by experts as an authoritative source for this information. In 2007, the United States led the world in health care spending at $7,167 per capita, according to the OECD. Norway and Switzerland followed at $4,579 and $4,568, respectively. The United States maintained its spending lead in the years that followed. But Sanders puts the difference too strongly when he says U.S. spending is "almost twice" per capita of "any other country." According to the OECD’s most recent data, U.S. spending grew to $8,713 per capita in 2013. Switzerland and Norway came in second and third at $6,325 and $5,862 per capita, respectively. (The organization’s incomplete 2014 data set, which does not include the United States, shows no country spending over $6,500 per capita.) Had Sanders fine-tuned his talking point by claiming that the United States spends twice as much per capita as the average developed country, his statement would been accurate. Average per capita spending is less than $3,500 across the 32 countries listed in the OECD database. That’s 40 percent of what the United States spends per person. A spokesman for Sanders could not be reached for comment. Our ruling Sanders said that "we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country." The United States spends more on health care per capita than other countries, but not always twice as much. Sanders’ comment suggests the United States outpaces all other countries more than it actually does. European countries with extensive social service networks aren’t so far behind the United States. We rate his statement False.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-08-16T18:22:23	2015-08-16	['None']
pomt-13321	"In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights."	/missouri/statements/2016/oct/06/jason-kander/kander-supported-second-amendment-while-office/	In a September campaign TV spot that has gained national attention, Jason Kander assembles a military assault rifle while blindfolded. Kander, who is Missouri’s secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, puts together an AR-15 in 30 seconds. As he assembles the gun, he talks about how his opponent, Republican Roy Blunt, has attacked his record on guns Kander, a former Army captain, says "In the Army, I learned how to use and respect my rifle." He continues to say, "In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights," while supporting background checks to keep guns like the AR-15 "out of the hands of terrorists." Kander was a Missouri state representative for four years, from 2009 to 2012, before he was elected secretary of state. We wanted to know more about how Kander handled Second Amendment issues as a representative, so we decided to investigate his claim. Voting record We asked Kander’s campaign about his statement, and his staff sent us part of his voting record. In 2011, Kander voted in favor of a bill that would lower the age — from 23 to 21— at which a person could get a permit to conceal and carry a gun. Kander voted against the bill when the House first debated it, but switched for the final vote. The bill became law. In 2012, he voted to lower the conceal-and-carry age from 21 to 18 for military members. That bill also became law. That same year, Kander voted for a resolution that would amend the Missouri Constitution to protect "the right of every citizen to possess, purchase, reload, or manufacture ammunition and any other parts or articles essential to the proper functioning of arms." The resolution died in a Senate committee. But that’s only part of the story when it comes to Kander and gun legislation. The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund gave Kander an ‘F’ rating on his advocacy for the Second Amendment for 2016. It provided us with more information about Kander’s voting record. In 2009, Kander voted against a bill that would extend the Castle Doctrine to renters. The doctrine allows a homeowner to use deadly force against a perceived intruder. The bill also would have lowered the age to get a concealed carry permit and would remove a ban on carrying a gun on a college campus. Kander voted against the "Business Premises Safety Act" four times – once during each of his terms as a state representative. That bill would have prevented business owners from restricting people from lawfully possessing a firearm in a car on business property. Both the NRA and incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, Kander’s opponent, have released ads in response to Kander’s ad, denouncing his claim that he supports the Second Amendment. What the Supreme Court says about the Second Amendment So Kander did not support every effort to expand access to guns while serving in the state legislature. That doesn’t mean he is against Second Amendment rights. In a 2010 landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment prohibition against infringement on the right to "keep and bear arms" extends to state and local governments. But the court has also ruled in the 2008 case of District of Columbia v. Heller that some restrictions on guns are acceptable. In the Heller decision, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, made clear that while D.C. could not ban handguns, the Second Amendment is "not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose." He went on to say that some restrictions, like the prohibition of guns in churches and government buildings, were not affected by the court’s decision. Carrying a concealed weapon is also subject to regulation. Kander’s votes against expanding access to guns fall within the Supreme Court’s definition of allowable regulation of the Second Amendment. He has never proposed, or voted for, a bill that would repeal the Second Amendment or flout the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the amendment, our review found. Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law and well-known constitutional law expert, said in an email that analysis of Kander’s stance on the Second Amendment depends on two questions: "Does one believe that the Second Amendment protects a right to have guns?" and "Are particular regulations of guns desirable?" "Even if one believes in the Second Amendment right to have guns, that does not mean that every law to allow more access to guns should be regarded as a good thing," he said. "Someone could believe in the Second Amendment, but still support some restrictions on guns." Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in constitutional law, agreed. "The Supreme Court has only said that the right protects the right to have a handgun in the home," he said in an email. "So long as he did not vote to deny law-abiding people that right, then he can reasonably claim to be a supporter of the right to bear arms." Our ruling In a TV ad, Kander said, "In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights." As a state representative, Kander voted in favor of two bills, which are now law, that would lower the age for someone to conceal and carry a weapon. On the other hand, he also voted against several bills that would reduce regulations on guns. In short, his gun record is nuanced. Further, experts cautioned us not to draw a straight line between votes and gun legislation and support for the Second Amendment. It is possible to support the Second Amendment and favor some regulation on guns. Even though he sometimes voted against bills to expand access to guns, it is fair for Kander to say he supported the Second Amendment as a legislator. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-05315	President Obama "promised" families making less than $250,000 a year would not see taxes go up, but "Obamacare raises 18 different taxes."	/florida/statements/2012/may/17/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-health-care-law-raises-taxes-1/	The conservative advocacy group Crossroads GPS has a new ad that says President Barack Obama has broken his campaign promises. The ad says, "President Obama’s agenda promised so much," then recounts several areas where it says Obama broke his promises. One those points is about taxes. The ad shows video of Obama saying, "If you are a family making less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes go up." The ad’s narrator says, "Broken: Obamacare raises 18 different taxes. … We need solutions, not just promises." The text on the screen says, "$503 billion between 2010 and 2019." We’ll be fact-checking the ad’s other claims in separate reports. Here, we’ll look at what the ad says about taxes. We should note that here at PolitiFact, we consider ourselves experts on the president’s campaign promises. Our Obameter tracks more than 500 campaign promises Obama made during the 2008 campaign, including many promises about taxes. The health care law and taxes The ad makes a sweeping claim about taxes that suggests broad increases. It says that the health care law raised 18 different taxes, citing an analysis from the Heritage Foundation. We know from our previous research on the law that it does in fact raise taxes. But when we looked at the issue in January 2011, we found only 13 measures that could reasonably be considered tax increases. (The other items were mostly new regulations.) Many of those taxes are aimed at health insurance companies, drug manufacturers, medical device makers or high earners, not people who make less than $250,000, as the ad says. (See our detailed list of taxes in the health care law.) When we looked at the list with the Crossroads statement in mind, we found only five taxes that might apply to individuals making less than $250,000. Those taxes include the following: • Higher federal excise taxes on tobacco. • A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. • Limiting the amount taxpayers can deposit in flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. For people who use the accounts, this could increase their taxable income. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • Raising the 7.5 percent adjusted gross income floor for the medical expenses deduction to 10 percent. People who would have qualified for the deduction this year would pay more. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. • A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided "Cadillac" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2018. There’s one other thing that may or may not be a tax, and it’s a biggie: the individual mandate. The mandate means that everyone has to have health insurance or pay a penalty; the Supreme Court is currently considering whether it's constitutional -- and whether it's a tax. We won’t take a side on this question here. The tax increases on tobacco and tanning services prompted us to give Obama a Promise Broken on our Obameter for his pledge that "no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase." But the statement from Crossroads is different. It makes the sweeping claim that the health care law raises 18 taxes on people who make less than $250,000 when in fact many of the taxes are on corporations and health care companies. Only a few of them are on individuals in that income range. Obama’s tax cuts for workers On the other side of the equation, though, Obama has cut taxes for many people of modest means. Obama pushed for small tax credits in the economic stimulus of 2009. The "Making Work Pay" tax credit amounted to about $400 per worker per year for two years. Then, in 2010, Obama hammered out a deal with Republicans for lower payroll taxes. That lowered them by 2 percent; with a maximum tax break of about $2,202 per year. Those tax cuts apply to all workers, while the health care tax hikes apply to more limited groups, such as smokers and indoor tanners. Our ruling The Crossroads ad says Obama "promised" families making less than $250,000 a year would not see taxes go up, but "Obamacare raises 18 different taxes." Obama has increased a few taxes -- on tobacco and tanning -- that hit people making less than $250,000. But he also gets credit for tax breaks for workers, most notably a payroll tax holiday that is still in effect. The Crossroads ad wrongly implies that people of modest means are getting hit with 18 tax increases because of the health care law. In fact, most of the taxes in the health care law are on high-income individuals or the health care industry. We rate their statement Mostly False.

Rick Perry shot back a statistic we hadn’t heard before. Perry, engaging with Stephanie Cutter, the from-the-left co-host of CNN’s Crossfire, said on the Sept. 18, 2013, edition of the show: "Ninety-five percent of all the wages in Texas are above minimum wage." We’re in gravy, baby! But is that so? By email, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed shared the calculations behind Perry’s statement. Nashed noted that according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, 452,000 Texas workers in 2012 earned the minimum wage or less, accounting for 7.5 percent of the state’s 6 million hourly workers over all. The Texas minimum wage equaled the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Nationwide, the bureau said, 4.7 percent of hourly workers earned the minimum wage or less. And those 452,000 minimum-wage Texas workers, Nashed said, accounted for 4.2 percent of the state’s total workforce, counting salaried workers and those paid on an hourly basis, of 10,879,800. The latter figure reflects the number of jobs held in Texas in 2012, according to the government’s payroll surveys. Nashed’s email continued: "This would tell us that roughly 95.8% of all Texas workers earn at or above minimum wage. And since this is our own analysis of the data, we prefer to round down to 95% to be cautious." By email, Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based bureau economist, did not quibble with the raw figures relied on by Perry. Then again, Abbot said by telephone that federal surveys of households and employers do not elicit detailed state wage data for employees paid by the week, the month or on other bases such as by the piece. Precisely, she said, the government’s household survey asks someone how much they’re paid only if the respondent says they are paid on an hourly basis. In 2012, Abbot said, the state’s 6 million hourly workers represented 57 percent of all wage and salary workers. So, what about the remaining workers? "Because we don’t have detail on wage levels for the non-hourly (workers)," Abbot said, "I really can’t tell you if any of those people are paid above or below the minimum wage." Still, she added, she assumes most non-hourly workers are paid more than the minimum wage. "I’m not saying that ‘95 percent’ is out of the realm of reason," Abbot said, just that "I can’t verify that." By phone, University of Texas economist Daniel Hamermesh told us that Perry’s methodology seems reasonable, though he agreed that because the bureau has no wage information from non-hourly workers, he said, "you can’t know for sure." Another factor, Hamermesh speculated, is that workers who are not legally authorized to live here may be underrepresented in the survey results; neither they nor their employers are likely to reveal extremely low pay rates, he said. Separately, political scientist Doug Hall of the Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute said by phone that while the bureau figures largely support Perry’s statement, any assumption that this means nearly every Texan is reasonably paid--or that low-income Texans are doing particularly well--deserves scrutiny. For instance, Hall said, the lowest 10th percentile of Texas workers--meaning those who earned less than 90 percent of the workforce--were paid an average $7.84 an hour in 2012, according to U.S. Census Bureau survey results analyzed by the institute. That average wage for workers at the 10th percentile placed Texas third-lowest in the nation, besting Arkansas ($7.80 an hour) and Louisiana ($7.71), according to the institute. Hall noted that Texas ranked better in 2000 (7th) and 1990 (12th). (See the state-by-state breakdown here.) Our ruling Perry said 95 percent "of all the wages in Texas are above minimum wage." That conclusion ties to 452,000 of the state’s nearly 10.9 million workers in 2012 being paid the minimum wage or less. But those numbers are incomplete, because the federal agency that analyzes such data doesn’t gauge how much any non-hourly workers are paid. It seems reasonable to speculate that most non-hourly workers earn more than the minimum wage, but it’s not an across-the-board certainty. We rate this statement as Mostly True.

pomt-07034	Says that in 2009, Jon Huntsman "said that the Recovery Act wasn't large enough and as governor he asked for $14.4 billion in federal stimulus funds. Now he's saying that he never supported it."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/03/richard-swett/former-us-rep-richard-swett-says-huntsman-flip-flo/	A week and a half ago, New Hampshire Democrats took aim at a former Republican governor they say has a deep history of flip-flopping. And no, it's not the one you think. Minutes after former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman officially launched his campaign for president, New Hampshire Democratic leaders took to the phones, accusing him of flip-flopping on key issues. Taking part in a New Hampshire Democratic Party conference call for political reporters, former U.S. Rep. Richard Swett criticized Huntsman for switching his stance on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the federal stimulus package. "Gov. Huntsman has left diplomacy for a reinvention tour that would make even Mitt Romney blush," Swett, a former ambassador to Denmark, said in the June 21, 2011, conference call. "In 2009, Huntsman said that the Recovery Act wasn't large enough and as governor he asked for $14.4 billion in federal stimulus funds. Now he's saying that he never supported it." So, is Huntsman backtracking? Or is Swett off base? To sort it out, we reviewed Huntsman's comments on the stimulus over the past two years. We used statements provided by the Democratic Party and the Huntsman campaign as well as some that we found in our own research. Together, they reveal that Huntsman was ready and willing to accept the federal money when it was made available, but that he has not retreated the way the Democrats claim. News accounts from the Salt Lake Tribune show that he requested more than $14 billion worth of stimulus funds for state projects, and he predicted the money would help create more than 124,000 jobs over the next five years, according to the Deseret Morning News. By October 1, 2009, six weeks after Huntsman left office, Utah had been awarded $1.5 billion in stimulus funds, and state officials had formally accepted $624 million during that time, according to the federal Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which tracks stimulus spending. But, even as he accepted the money, Huntsman expressed concerns over the $787 billion Recovery Act, including questions about the size of the bill (too small) and the amount of tax cuts (too few). Let’s go to the transcripts. Jan. 19, 2009, Huntsman to Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, supporting the stimulus for state projects: "Well, if stimulus money is going to be invested in the U.S. economy, why don't those dollars follow projects that are ready to go? "Our state has more shovel-ready projects than any state in America right now. And you’ve got to remember, we're now the fastest growing state in America, which surprises a lot of people. … "We need to electrify. We need to move toward renewable opportunities. We need highways. We need everything that the rest of the country is talking about, but we need it sooner because of the way in which we're growing demographically and economically." Feb. 24, 2009, to Cavuto, saying he would have opposed the stimulus because it was too small: "Well, if I were in Congress, I probably would not have voted in favor (of the Recovery Act), because it didn`t have enough stimulus and probably wasn`t big enough to begin with. "But it is where it is. And I`m not going to quibble with a 1 or 2 percent of the entire package. We are trying to make our states run. We are going to take receipt of it. And we are going to try to actually focus some of the unallocated money on our own stimulus ideas in our states that might create some of the industries of tomorrow." Feb. 24, 2009, to Politico.com’s Alexander Burns, questioning the lack of tax cuts: "I guess in hindsight we can all say that there were some fundamental flaws with (the bill). It probably wasn’t large enough and, number two, there probably wasn’t enough stimulus effect. For example, a payroll tax exemption or maybe even a cut in the corporate tax … for small and medium-sized businesses for three years, for example. "I’m not sure it’s the stimulus money that will necessarily allow the economy to recover … It will help to fortify our budgets, frankly, to ensure that there isn’t as much backsliding in the areas of education and healthcare, for example. But economic recovery must be earned. And it will be earned by entrepreneurs and it will be earned by small businesses. "The size of about a trillion dollars was floated by Mark Zandi, who’s a very respected economist. I tend to believe what he is saying about the size of the package, which didn’t necessarily hit the mark in terms of size." April 27, 2009, to 2009 Milken Institute Global Conference, calling the stimulus flawed but helpful: The stimulus has helped by "building our core capacity to attract brain power, and to build our industries of tomorrow around innovation. Even when times are bad, we've invested in engineering and our science and technology undertaking, and are reaching out to name brand universities around the country and try to steal talent, to put it very crassly. So building these core areas of innovation, which we're not throttling back on at all, and some of the stimulus dollars have, in fact, allowed us to kind of move forward. "(There’s) too little focus on meaningful and relevant infrastructure that would have enhanced our entire nation and our ability to compete, whether delivering products or getting people from point A to point B. In other words, the overall enhancement of needed infrastructure in our country, which is desperately needed, so maybe you have 25 percent infrastructure, 75 percent all other categories. It should have been reversed in my mind, so that coming out of the stimulus phase, we actually could have maybe achieved a better, stronger, more 21st century infrastructure in our country. So that is my one gripe. There wasn't vision and direction in terms of where those dollars went. "Stimulus, to be sure, that was needed. We needed to sort of kick start the economy and infuse it with some liquidity. It was the targeted end points that I would sort of question, and whether or not that was done in a way that, longer term, will be meaningful for our citizens." May 19, 2011, to ABC’s George Stephanopolous, reflecting on his past criticisms of stimulus: "My take was, let's stimulate business. Let's look at tax cuts, let's look at payroll tax deductions. If you read on in the (2009) interview, that's exactly what I said. But more than that, George, a specific focus as opposed to just giving dollars to states. And let's face it, every governor took it. "Mark Sanford in South Carolina was the only one who stood up and said, ‘I'm not going to take it,’ and in the end, he ended up taking it too. We as governors, our states, we all make contributions to Washington. And when stimulus dollars are coming back, you ultimately found that every governor took those dollars. "(There’s) a regret that it was not properly focused around that, which would really stimulate the economy, tax cuts, and it was not focused around enhancing our infrastructure, and preparing ourselves for the future." Our ruling Huntsman's comments on the stimulus have been all over the map. He said from the start he would have voted against it -- because it wasn't big enough -- and then he's offered different explanations that have emphasized the need for more infrastructure spending or more tax cuts. Swett was right in saying that Huntsman requested $14 billion in stimulus funds, and that he offered his support for a figure even larger -- $1 trillion. But Swett's account is too one-sided. The record shows Huntsman has continued to raise questions about the stimulus all along, even as he accepted the money. We rate Swett’s statement Half True.

pomt-08620	Says Bill White "didn't pay taxes while earning $133,600 annual salary as deputy secretary of energy."	/texas/statements/2010/sep/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-bill-white-didnt-pay-taxes-1995/	Republican Gov. Rick Perry hasn't seen Democratic challenger Bill White's 1995 tax return. Even so, he says White didn't pay taxes that year. "Bill White hiding his taxes because he didn't pay them," says the headline on a Sept. 7 news release from Perry's campaign. That's followed by this header: "Liberal trial lawyer didn't pay taxes while earning $133,600 annual salary as deputy (U.S.) secretary of energy." Perry's press release did not say what kind of taxes he meant, though we suspect most observers would conclude that he is referring to White not paying federal income taxes that year. Perry said as much as we wrapped up our research on this topic, telling San Antonio's KTSA-550 AM last week that White "didn't pay any income tax in 1995." We believe that dramatic charge is impossible to independently prove or disprove without access to the relevant White tax return. Later that day, White told the station: "I served part of the year in the federal government. I paid income tax; there was withholding. And the other half of the year, when I was out of government, I lost money in my business with a self-employed business and so then I got a refund." Some background: White's tax returns have proved a Perry talking point. While White has released returns from his mayoral tenure (2004-09), Perry said he would not agree to a debate until he made public his tax returns from when he was deputy energy secretary in President Bill Clinton's administration (1993-95) and chairman of the Texas Democratic Party (1995-98). That didn't happen. In his Sept. 7 press release, Perry says White's 1995 tax obligation was "uncovered" in an Aug. 14 Dallas Morning News article citing information from White's campaign that he reported "no taxable income for 1995." Katy Bacon, White's campaign spokeswoman, declined to share the candidate's 1995 tax return or grant us an interview with White's accountant. But to counter Perry's charge that White paid no taxes while earning his federal pay in 1995, she sent us figures that she said White's camp gave the Dallas newspaper in August; they showed White's annual taxable income from 1993 through 1995 and his annual tax liability. For 1995, White's taxable income was listed as zero and his tax as $3,482. Katinka Podmaniczky, an Energy Department spokeswoman, confirmed that White's annual salary at the agency was $133,600. He resigned from the post in August 1995, according to White's 1995 federal financial disclosure report. Bacon told us in an e-mail that White grossed nearly $90,000 for his work at the department that year and that $21,568 in federal income taxes were withheld from his paycheck. He did not have another job in 1995 for which federal taxes were withheld, she said. "After he left Department of Energy, while starting a new business, his losses were such that he had no 'taxable income' and a refund of $24,186," Bacon said. (His refund was larger than the amount of taxes withheld, she said, because "he had also paid in estimated taxes and had rolled over an overpayment from 1994 that totalled $6,100.") She said the new business was White Acquisitions, which "pursued investments in oil and gas services and oil and gas." She told us that the firm was formed in September 1995 and dissolved on the last day of 1997. According to Bacon, White owned the company, there were no other investors and he was the "sole shareholder." Based solely on information from the White campaign, here's the tax math so far: Counting what he paid through withholding and estimated tax payments, plus his overpayment from 1994, White was credited with paying a total of $27,668 in income tax in 1995. His business losses the same year erased most of his tax liability, so he received a $24,186 refund. That left $3,482, which the federal government kept because he owed "household employment taxes ... on the income he paid to his employee," a housekeeper, Bacon said. Separately, we asked a tax policy expert whether it's possible to have no taxable income while still paying federal taxes on earnings. Sure, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. He told us that if White's taxable income was zero after all of his investment losses and other adjustments (exemptions, deductions, credits) were taken into account, his federal income tax liability would indeed have been zero. That would have produced a refund of income tax. However, Williams said, the vast majority of American workers also pay Medicare and Social Security taxes, commonly known as payroll taxes, which the government doesn't refund. If White paid those, "they are gone," Williams said. To address this aspect without handing over White's tax return, his campaign agreed to our suggestion that White ask the Energy Department to release all the taxes that were withheld from his pay in 1995. In an e-mail to the White campaign that was forwarded to us, the agency's payroll department listed $21,568.45 in federal income taxes, $3,794.40 in Social Security and $1,302.55 in Medicare taxes that were withheld from White's pay. (According to his 1995 tax return, Perry had $3,794 in Social Security and $1,121 in Medicare taxes withheld from the state salary he received as state agriculture commissioner.) Now to the Truth-O-Meter: Perry's press release claimed that White "didn't pay taxes while earning $133,600 annual salary as deputy secretary of energy." Later, he said he was referring to income taxes. Regardless of what sort of taxes Perry meant, we confirmed that White was paying taxes — income, Medicare and Social Security — while he was making that salary during the first eight months of 1995. White said he got income taxes back after filing his tax return. Why? His business losses later that year largely offset the income taxes he had already paid through withholding, he said, leaving him with no taxable income in 1995. Is that the same as White paying no taxes that year while he did his federal job, as Perry says? We think not. We rate the statement False.

pomt-00323	"In 2017, the number of new business registrations in West Virginia grew nearly 11 percent (8,318 new businesses registered for the year). This comes off the heels of a 12 percent increase in new business registrations during 2016."	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/20/west-virginia-republican-party/business-registrations-are-wva-closures-high-too/	Has there been an increase in new businesses in West Virginia? The West Virginia Republican Party says so. On Sept. 4, the West Virginia GOP tweeted "In 2017, the number of new business registrations in West Virginia grew nearly 11 percent (8,318 new businesses registered for the year). This comes off the heels of a 12 percent increase in new business registrations during 2016." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet cited a news article in the Herald-Dispatch of Huntington, W.Va., that includes this information almost verbatim. The data comes from the Business Statistics Database maintained by the West Virginia Secretary of State’s office, and the office confirmed to PolitiFact the accuracy of the numbers in the tweet. Erin Timony, the office’s assistant communications director, said the numbers focus on limited liability companies and corporate business license registrations by county. Since other types of businesses are not included, the data does not encompass all new businesses in the state. Another point to note: The tweet cites business registrations, but not business closings. "The number of businesses that are ‘born’ and ‘die’ in a given year (would) provide a more accurate portrayal of business conditions overall," said Brian Lego, a research assistant professor of economic forecasting at West Virginia University. This data is compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, though data for both births and deaths is available only through the first quarter of 2017. Here’s a chart showing trends on business births and deaths in West Virginia. Quarters that saw more births than deaths are marked in blue, while quarters that saw deaths exceed births are marked in red: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com So, looked at from this perspective, 15 out of 17 of the last quarters have seen more business deaths than births in West Virginia. This doesn’t mean that the business registration data is wrong; rather, it just says that the tweet paints an incomplete picture. Our ruling The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, "In 2017, the number of new business registrations in West Virginia grew nearly 11 percent (8,318 new businesses registered for the year). This comes off the heels of a 12 percent increase in new business registrations during 2016." The data cited in the tweet is solid. However, it looks only at certain types of business births. Looking at data for both business births and deaths shows a less rosy picture for business creation in the state.

pomt-00601	Says that during his eight years as Florida governor, "we created 1.3 million net new jobs -- more jobs created than Texas."	/florida/statements/2015/jun/03/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-13-million-jobs-were-created-florida/	At an event in Orlando attended by several GOP presidential contenders, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a likely Republican candidate, touted his state’s record on job creation during his tenure. "In Florida, during my eight years, we grew at 4.4 percent per year, and we created, together, many of the people in this room, by creating a better environment, we created 1.3 million net new jobs -- more jobs created than Texas, more jobs created than any state in country other than California, a state 2 1/2 times our size," Bush said. That’s a direct knock at one of his likely rivals in the presidential race -- former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who also spoke at the summit and is expected to announce his candidacy for president later this week. We decided to look at the number of jobs created in Florida and Texas, respectively, and how much credit Bush deserves for that. Bush was governor from January 1999 through January 2007; Perry was governor from late 2000 to early 2015. Net jobs in Florida vs. Texas Bush’s term in office was bookended by two periods of robust job growth -- 1998-2000 and 2004-06. The 2007 recession hit after he left office. Bush’s spokesman pointed to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for total, nonfarm, seasonally adjusted jobs. In Florida, there were about 6.7 million such jobs in December 1998 and 8 million in December 2006. That works out to about 1.3 million net new jobs. By comparison, in Texas, there were about 9.1 million jobs in December 1998 and 10.2 million jobs in December 2006. That works out to 1.1 million net new jobs. So during Bush’s two terms in office -- which, we’ll note, includes a period before Perry was governor -- the number of net new jobs in Florida was 186,800 higher than in Texas. Does Bush get credit for the job growth? Bush took a measure of credit during his speech. And on his PAC’s website, Bush also took credit for growth saying that "his limited-government approach helped unleash one of the most robust and dynamic economies in the nation, creating 1.3 million net new jobs ... ." Is that justified? We started by asking his spokesman if he could point to anything that Bush did to fuel that job growth. "Creating 1.3 million new jobs and leading the nation in job creation over your final five years in office doesn’t just happen by riding an economic wave," Matt Gorman said. "That takes strong, pro-growth economic policies like those put in place by Gov. Bush. He consistently improved Florida's business climate, including cutting taxes every year he was in office." PolitiFact has frequently noted that when it comes to the economy and jobs, assigning credit (or blame) for a given statistical accomplishment isn’t as clear cut as politicians would like voters to believe. Much has to do with timing: Bush was fortunate to have governed during some economically robust years. "It is very hard to measure how much credit Gov. Bush should get for the job creation in Florida during his eight years, since so many different factors affect a state's job creation," George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair said. Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, compared the state’s economy to an omelet with many ingredients going into the final product. Snaith said it’s "difficult to point to one specific ingredient as being responsible for the omelet itself. Florida’s economy performed very well during this time period, the economic omelet was quite tasty. Not all of the ingredients, however, originated in Tallahassee’s kitchen. Low interest rates and a global thirst for oil impacted these state’s economies but neither had any control of these important ingredients." Moody’s economist Kwame Donaldson added that in the early 2000s, Nevada and Arizona experienced a similar growth trajectory as Florida, suggesting that Bush’s policies were not singularly responsible for his state’s growth. (Arizona, for instance, had a Democratic governor for the second half of the period in question.) Construction fueled Florida’s job growth -- and then bust The experts added that it’s worth looking at what happened after Bush left office. Texas’ job growth during that time frame was also relatively strong – a 19.6 percent increase in Florida vs. a 12.5 percent increase in Texas. Both states were higher than the 7.6 percent for the country as a whole over that period, said David Cooper, an expert on state labor markets at the Economic Policy Institute. Construction employment in Florida grew by 46.6 percent over that time frame -- more than double the growth in Texas and the nation. Then, when the recession hit, the construction job market in Florida nosedived. As a result, "Florida’s job losses were much more severe than in Texas," Cooper said. "I am not sure that the job growth during Jeb Bush administration should be celebrated, because it was primarily fueled by a housing bubble that burst as Bush’s term was ending," said Donaldson of Moody’s. "Florida is still struggling to recover from this housing bust." Sinclair concurred. "Although it makes more sense for a governor to compare across states in order to somewhat control for national level events, it would also be fair for him to take some of the blame for the worse performance of Florida so soon after he left office if he wants to take credit for the good times," she said. Texas, by contrast, was not as hard hit because it had stronger bank regulation, meaning it didn’t have as many bad loans as Florida, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. As The Economist explained in 2010, "Texas has strict rules on home-equity lending, relative to other states, and this has helped to prevent ratios of loan size to home value from rising as high as they have elsewhere." Residential construction fell by about two thirds in Texas, but it collapsed by even more -- 85 percent -- in Florida, said Moody’s senior economist Chris Lafakis. "I certainly wouldn’t blame only Gov. Bush for Florida’s recession — there were many culpable parties that overlooked and underestimated the effect of horrific lending standards and bad mortgages — but Gov. Bush certainly didn’t prevent or mitigate the recession either," he said. "Vermont is an example where state policy restricted the housing boom but prevented the housing bust." It’s also worth noting that the sheer number of new jobs doesn’t say much about how well they paid, said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University economist who is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Texas and Florida are both places that get a big influx of migrants either from other states or immigrants from other countries and I think they drive a lot of job creation in both places, often low-wage job creation," Holzer said. Our ruling Bush said that during his eight years in office, "we created 1.3 million net new jobs, more jobs created than Texas." He got his numbers right, but it’s worth noting that no governor is solely, or even mostly, responsible for economic growth in their state -- and if he wants to take credit for the expansion on his watch, then he also needs to shoulder some of the blame for the bust that followed his departure from office. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-06-03T15:28:10	2015-06-02	['Texas']
pomt-14593	Americans "are working longer hours for low wages . . . and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/04/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-exaggerates-concentration-wealth-in/	Sen. Bernie Sanders repeated his ongoing theme that the rich have gotten richer and the United States needs to reverse income inequality during the Democratic president debate on Feb. 4 at the University of New Hampshire. "Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged," Sanders said. "They are working longer hours for low wages. They are worried about the future of their kids. And yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent," he said. "(That's) not what America is supposed to be about." PolitiFact has looked a couple of variations on his claims about wages, hours and income distribution. In the past, Sanders has said wages have gone down. He didn't make that claim Thursday night, perhaps because when we looked at data, we found that most reports concluded that wages have been flat since the 1970s. Instead, he characterized wages as low, a value judgement we won't quibble with. On the question of hours, we found mixed evidence that Americans are working longer during the week. The best data, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, show average weekly hours for production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector have actually declined a bit since the 1960s. The trend flattened out at the beginning of this century and took a temporary dip during the Great Recession, but broadly speaking the numbers don't support the longer hours claim. Gallup surveys have found that workers report working longer hours than what the BLS numbers show. However, historical data from those Gallup surveys reveal that there hasn't really been a change in the number of hours that full-time employees report working between 2001 to 2014. On the other hand, when the Brookings Institution looked at a small slice of the middle class -- the middle 10 percent of families -- they found an increase in hours worked among mothers who were toiling longer to maintain their family's standard of living. Finally, there are plenty of data showing that new income is becoming concentrated in the richest Americans, which is Sanders' overarching theme. The question is to what degree. Sanders said Thursday night and during recent interviews that it's "almost all" new income. A year ago, he was saying it was 99 percent. There's no handy-dandy, universally agreed-upon formula to calculate an exact amount, but the economist that Sanders has been relying on concluded in 2015 that the top 1 percent had accumulated 91 percent of the income gains made from 2009 to 2012. That would be "almost all." But when the analysis was updated in 2015, the estimate dropped to 58 percent, a ratio Sanders has publicly acknowledged. That may be just over most of the new income, but it’s far from "almost all." One important caveat: One economist we consulted told us that the calculation Sanders relies on, which looks at pre-tax income minus all government payments, uses a method that tends to make the rich look richer. Our ruling Sanders said Americans "are working longer hours for low wages ... and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent." The issues are whether Americans are working longer hours -- on average, they're not -- and whether "almost all" new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. A lot of it has, but not "almost all." If Sanders were to argue that a disproportionate amount of income and wealth is going to the very richest Americans, he'd be right on the money. But he's over-exaggerating. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-04T22:27:33	2016-02-04	['United_States']
pomt-14072	Under Donald Trump's tax plan, "the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/20/jennifer-shilling/top-01-would-be-big-winner-under-donald-trumps-tax/	For being Hillary Clinton surrogates, two Wisconsin lawmakers sounded rather like Bernie Sanders when they got on the phone with reporters to denounce Donald Trump’s tax plan. "For the billionaires, by the billionaires," state Rep. Cory Mason of Racine declared in the May 11, 2016 teleconference, which was arranged by Clinton’s Wisconsin campaign. Mason was joined by fellow Democrat Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, the Senate minority leader. Her attack was more specific. Shilling stated that with Trump’s plan, "the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined." Economic inequality has been a signature issue for Sanders, whose presidential campaign has kept Clinton from claiming the presumptive nominee title Trump has on the Republican side. When Sanders said in Madison that the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, we rated his claim Mostly True . Let's take a look at Shilling’s one-tenth of 1 percenters claim -- which, as we’ll see, was made at something of a moving target. The figures Standing in the lobby of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan in September 2015, Trump rolled out his tax reform plan -- which some analysts immediately saw as a boon for the wealthy. He proposed significant cuts across the board, PolitiFact National found, but the wealthiest would get the most in tax cuts. For the highest income earners, the top income tax rate would drop from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. When we asked about Shilling’s claim, Clinton’s Wisconsin campaign cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of two Washington, D.C. think tanks: the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. The analysis found that on average, under Trump’s plan, households at all income levels would receive tax cuts -- but the highest-income households would receive the largest cuts, both in dollars and as a percentage of income. More specific to Shilling’s claim: The highest-income 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- those who had an income of over $3.7 million in 2015 -- would get an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million in 2017. That same group would receive 18 percent of the tax reduction, while the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers would receive 16.4 percent of the reduction. At our request, the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice also did calculations, which came out nearly the same: The top 0.1 percent would get 17 percent of Trump's proposed tax cuts and the bottom 60 percent would get 13 percent of the cuts. To some extent, this isn’t a surprise, in that the wealthiest pay the lion’s share of income taxes. In a June 2015 report, the Tax Policy Center said the top 0.1 percent pay 21.1 percent of all individual income taxes and the bottom 60 percent pays 1.5 percent. Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, also ran the numbers and told us Shilling’s claim is accurate. But Cole noted that under Trump’s plan: -- People in the 40th to 60th percentiles have about 99 percent of their income tax liability removed. -- People in the 0 to 40th percentiles who paid positive income taxes have about 100 percent of their income tax liability removed. "So the reason Trump’s plan doesn’t cut middle-class income taxes by more than that is, well, you can’t cut middle-class income taxes by more than that," Cole said. So, the figures back Shilling. The thing is, shortly before she made her claim, Trump’s tax proposal was changing. Sort of. Maybe. Or was it? Trump’s equivocation In the three days prior, Trump said he might raise, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Then he indicated the wealthy would get tax cuts, but the cuts might be less than what is in his plan. And then Politico reported that Trump’s campaign had enlisted conservative economists to revise his plan, and that they were advising a top tax rate of 28 percent -- higher than the 25 percent in Trump’s proposal. All of which has caused some confusion as to what Trump would do with taxes. Nevertheless, by the time Shilling made her statement, Trump had not changed his tax proposal, which remained on his campaign website. (Indeed, for what it's worth, the day after Shilling’s claim, a Trump spokeswoman told the New York Times: "There are no changes being made to the plan.") Our rating Shilling said that under Trump's tax plan, "the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined." A report from a respected nonpartisan research group calculates that the 0.1 percent -- those making more than $3.7 million per year -- would receive 18 percent of the tax cuts under Trump’s proposal. The bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, meanwhile, would enjoy only 16.4 percent of the cuts. Another tax group found similar figures. Trump has indicated he might make alter his tax proposal, but he hadn’t as of when Shilling made her statement -- so we rate the statement True.

pomt-05035	Says New Jersey’s tenure law "has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure."	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/12/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-state-reformed-its-tenure-law-/	Gov. Chris Christie didn’t get everything he had proposed from a tenure reform bill the state Legislature passed recently. But the Republican governor told a national audience this week teachers will lose tenure after receiving negative evaluations, one element of his education reform plan. That’d be a win for the governor, if it were true. But it’s not that simple. Christie said after the New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, spent two years campaigning against his tenure reform proposals, they finally "came to the table. And we negotiated New Jersey's tenure law, which is over 100 years old, the oldest tenure law for K to 12 education in the country, has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure," Christie said during a July 9 speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. "We're putting accountability back into the system." PolitiFact New Jersey found teachers who receive negative evaluations may be fired, but under the legislation -- passed by both houses of the Legislature on June 25 but not yet signed by the governor -- teachers still have the right to appeal, the core job protection afforded by tenure. Christie has described tenure as a job for life, but a process through which districts can fire teachers has always existed. Critics, however, argue the system is so costly and time-consuming that it deters districts from using it except in extreme cases of misconduct. State law says tenured teachers cannot have their pay reduced or be fired except for inefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct or other just cause, and then only after a hearing. That does not change with the new legislation. Tenure charges are still subject to a hearing, though the process has been overhauled in an effort to make it easier to dismiss teachers. Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie, said the governor "did not go into full detail and, for the sake of brevity in a speech, merely abbreviated the process which clears the way for revocation of tenure." "This is a sea change in the law," Drewniak said. "Prior to the tenure bill, teachers could be removed for only a handful of reasons in a process that was massively expensive for school districts and ridiculously time consuming. For the first time, there is a statewide evaluation system that can be used to remove poor-performing teachers through a more streamlined process." The legislation creates an evaluation system with four possible ratings: ineffective, partially effective, effective and highly effective. Superintendents will be required to file a charge of inefficiency against a teacher who receives either two consecutive ineffective ratings or a partially effective rating and then an ineffective rating the next year. Superintendents, under exceptional circumstances, may defer filing tenure charges for a year against a teacher who receives two consecutive partially effective ratings or an ineffective rating and then a partially effective rating the next year. But the charges must be filed if the teacher does not receive a positive evaluation the next year. Still, tenured teachers facing a charge of inefficiency maintain the right to dispute those charges with a third-party, though the process has been changed. For instance, arbitrators, rather than administrative law judges, will now hear cases involving tenure charges. We can’t know now whether that process will definitely make firing inefficient teachers easier, but what is clear is that tenure isn’t immediately revoked after two negative evaluations. Our ruling Christie said New Jersey’s teacher tenure law "has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure." For the large part, superintendents must file tenure charges against teachers who receive two consecutive negative ratings on annual evaluations. In those cases, teachers may ultimately be fired, but they don’t automatically lose their tenure and, therefore, maintain the right to appeal the charges levied against them.

pomt-10336	"Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/21/john-mccain/the-campaign-trail-leaves-little-time-for-hearings/	An ad for Sen. John McCain makes the case that Sen. Barack Obama is a foreign policy lightweight who has voted against funding for troops. "Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan," an announcer states. "He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops — positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working." See our story for details about the ad's other claims. Here we'll look at the statement on hearings about Afghanistan. The basis for McCain's attack here is that Obama serves on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and chairs the subcommittee on Europe. You might ask why the subcommittee on Europe should hold hearings on Afghanistan, which is in Central Asia. But we're familiar with this claim because Sen. Hillary Clinton made the same argument during a Democratic debate on Feb. 26, 2008. Obama "chairs the Subcommittee on Europe," Clinton said during the debate. "It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan." Obama responded then: "Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan." Back then, we talked to a spokesman for Sen. Richard Lugar, who served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee from 2003 to 2006, when Republicans controlled the Senate. Lugar's spokesman said something as major as NATO's role in Afghanistan would typically be held before the full Foreign Relations Committee, rather than Obama's European subcommittee. See our full item here. The committee is now chaired by Democratic Sen. Joe Biden, who has also said such hearings should happen before the full committee. And Sen. John Kerry has said that if it were to happen at the subcommittee level, it should go to his subcommittee on Near East and South and Central Asian Affairs. About a month after the debate exchange between Clinton and Obama, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened for an afternoon hearing with testimony on Iraq from Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus, which Obama attended. That morning, though, Obama chaired a full committee hearing on nominations for ambassadors to Europe, including Kurt Volker to be the U.S. permanent representative on the Council of NATO. During the hearing, Obama talked in some depth about NATO and Afghanistan. "Afghanistan, NATO's first major mission beyond the borders of Europe, has been overlooked and undermanned by many members of the alliance, including the United States," Obama said. "Success in Afghanistan, I believe, is critical to American national security and to the security of the entire world, and a failure there would not only endanger our nation and global stability, it would cast serious doubt on the ability of NATO's military and political architecture to uphold our security in the 21st century." When Clinton laid out her argument for why Obama should have held hearings, we found that she had her facts straight and gave her a True rating. McCain's ad, though, doesn't make the detailed case that Clinton did as to why Obama should have held hearings on Afghanistan in the first place. And in the months since Clinton made her claim, Obama did chair a meeting of the Foreign Relations committee in which Afghanistan was discussed at some length (though it arguably was not the primary reason for the meeting; the ambassadorships were). Taking all of this together, we find we have to lay out a number of explanations for McCain's statement on hearings, but in essence, he's right. Obama did not hold hearings that dealt directly with Afghanistan. We rate McCain's statement Mostly True.

pomt-00374	Says Joe Radinovich "was cited 30 times for not paying court fines."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/10/congressional-leadership-fund/joe-radinovich-no-stranger-traffic-court/	Do the crime (or petty misdemeanor), pay the fine. That’s an adage of justice. What to make, then, of a congressional candidate who’s cited more than 30 times with driving and parking violations but fails to pay in eight of those cases until the courts sic a collections agency on him? Minnesota’s Joe Radinovich says it was all an oversight, and a number of his tickets were a result of parking overtime in a meter zone -- not exactly high crimes -- although he’s also had a few speeding citations over the years. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to elect Republicans, says the behavior of Radinovich, a Democrat running for the open seat in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District, shows he is a "typical politician," one who will raise your taxes yet "refuses to pay his own bills." We went to the records. They show Radinovich, a former state representative now vying to represent the Iron Range district in the nation’s capital, has been something of a ticket scofflaw until recently. He had his driver’s license revoked for a time. And he only paid the state's collections agency for the last four of his outstanding fines recently, at $75 each, months after he was originally ticketed and right when those tickets and fines became fodder in the 2018 congressional race. The claim The claim against Radinovich arose when the Congressional Leadership Fund, a PAC allied with U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, put out a TV ad and news release on Aug. 17. An announcer in the ad says, "Joe Radinovich votes to raise our taxes, but refuses to pay his own bills. Radinovich voted for a $2 billion tax hike, hurting working families. But Radinovich was cited 30 times for not paying court fines. "And after refusing to pay his bills, Radinovich was turned over to a collection agency eight times." The tax part of the claim refers to Radinovichs vote in the Minnesota Legislature for an "Omnibus Tax Bill" in 2013, according to KSTP-TV in Minnesota. The bill raised income taxes on Minnesota's highest earners by $1.1 billion dollars but also raised cigarette and other tobacco taxes by $430 million, the TV station said. The bill closed $400 million worth of corporate tax loopholes and increased taxes on some estates by $80 million, the station said. As for the tickets, the Congressional Leadership Fund accessed Minnesota court records, which are available online. Those records show the date a citation is issued, the alleged offenses, the plea and disposition of the charges and the collection of a fine if one is issued. The Congressional Leadership Fund’s ad led KSTP to do a "Truth Test" on the claim. That Truth Test -- in which the station gave the Congressional Leadership Fund’s claim an A minus -- in turn led Radinovich’s Republican opponent in the congressional race, Pete Stauber, to issue his own statement on Aug. 23. Stauber said that Radinovich "won't even pay his own bills and take responsibility for his own actions." Radinovich’ response Radinovich responded quickly to the Minnesota media. "I reject that they're a character issue," the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party member said of the tickets and fines, according to an Aug. 23 story in the Duluth News Tribune. He called the issue "a headache," the newspaper reported, and said he would be more careful about it going forward. He also said he uses a post office box and does not get mail at his physical address in Ironton, Minn., which sometimes led to a delay in his receiving notices. "The vast majority of violations occurred in Hennepin County in the last several years, when Radinovich worked as an aide to onetime city councilor and current Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey," the News Tribune reported. "It was tough to avoid parking tickets sometimes," Radinovich said in the story. He said construction and a lack of other parking options forced him to use streetside meters, which would expire while he became preoccupied with the business of the day. What the record shows PolitiFact accessed the Minnesota state court system’s online records. The records showed 32 cases against Radinovich dating to 2004, when he was 18, most of them minor and all leading to convictions or findings of guilt. They included two cases in 2018, 12 in 2017 and one in 2016. Where the level of offense was listed, all were labeled as misdemeanors. Other details: Sixteen of the 32 cases involved parking meter violations. Four involved speeding, the most recent in July 2017 when records show Radinovich was accused of driving 69 mph in a 55 zone. A 2006 case showed a conviction for driving on a revoked license. The circumstances of the revocation were not detailed in the online record. In 2009, Radinovich was charged with speeding, accused of going 81 in a 65 mph zone. The records say the court requested a driver’s license suspension that October for failure to appear in court, and requested reinstatement of the license the following March when payment was made. The collections Eight of the cases wound up going to a collection agency after Radovich was late paying his fines, records show. That does not mean private bill collectors were on Radinovich’s tail, however, because the state courts switched in 2010 from using private collectors to using the Minnesota Department of Revenue, Kyle Christopherson, a communications specialist with the Minnesota Judicial Branch told PolitiFact. Every one of Radinovich’s collection matters therefore would have been handled by the revenue department. Of the underlying offenses in those collection matters, six were for parking overtime in a meter zone. One was for obstructing traffic with a vehicle. One was for a violation that was unspecified in the online docket but was related to a vehicle registration, permit or license plates. Radovich pleaded or was adjudicated guilty in each case case against him, whether it went to collections or not, the records show. Petty stuff? That’s what Radinovich suggested. The Duluth News Tribune quoted him as saying, "I take full responsibility for this. It's a series of petty misdemeanors and that's the extent of it." When contacted by PolitiFact, Radinovich's congressional campaign did not dispute the tickets and late payments. Campaign spokesman Bennett Smith said the earliest driving offenses are from when Radinovich, now 32, was a young man. Radinovich's mother was shot and killed in a family murder-suicide in 2004, according to Minnesota media reports. "Like many people in their late teens and early 20s, Joe has done a lot of growing up," Smith said. "He's matured and is a different person." As for the numerous parking offenses, Smith said the Republican-supporting PAC is "oversensationalizing his ability to find convenient parking when he was working for the mayor." Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund said Radinovich was cited 30 times for not paying court fines. Radinovich unquestionably did not pay a number of his traffic and parking fines when due. The 32-year-old was charged in 32 separate traffic or parking cases since he was 18. But a single case can involve one or more legal citations, and this is where the Congressional Leadership Fund’s characterization can get a bit tricky. The PAC said Radinovch was "cited 30 times for not paying court fines," but a "citation" can mean, in the legal sense, a ticket or a charge. Or it can mean a notation in the record. It is unquestionable that the Minnesota court records note Radinvich’s repeated failure to pay fines when due. That did not mean Radinovich faced 30 new misdemeanor charges strictly for failure to pay; rather, the PAC told PolitiFact that it used the word "cited" as a reference to court notations of Radinovich’s failure to pay on time, and these notations were not just in the cases sent for collection. With that caveat, we rate the Congressional Leadership Fund’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-09080	"When George Bush took office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus."	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/25/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-forgets-which-party-controlled-cong/	With polls showing Americans becoming increasingly concerned about the debt, Democrats have been trying to blame President George W. Bush and Republicans for fiscal decisions of the past decade. But in some cases, the Democrats have gotten their facts wrong. In a speech on the Senate floor on June 24, 2010, Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island criticized the Bush Administration for squandering a federal surplus. "When George Bush took office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus," Whitehouse said. "It was returning more money to the federal government than we were spending. It was an annual budget in surplus. We had a national debt at the time, but with the annual budget in surplus, our Congressional Budget Office — the nonpartisan, not Republican, not Democratic, professional Congressional Budget Office — had estimated that, when George Bush took office, we would be a debt-free nation by 2009. We would be a debt-free nation by 2009. That was the trajectory that Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Democratic Congress left, along with those annual budget surpluses, when George Bush and the Republicans took office." We won't delve into the varying degrees of blame that Clinton and Bush deserve for the current deficit and debt in this item. But when Whitehouse says that "Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus," he's wrong. When Clinton handed over the reins to Bush, there was a Republican Congress, not a Democratic one. In fact, it wasn't even a close call: For the last six years of Clinton's term, the GOP had been in control of both the House and the Senate. We'll note that on the numbers, rather than the party labels, Whitehouse is correct. In 2000, Clinton's final year in office, the federal government ran a surplus of $236 billion. The following year, Bush's first as president, the surplus was $128 billion. That was the last time the government ran a surplus, at least as of now. In early 2001, the CBO did indeed predict surpluses as far as the eye could see -- enough to eliminate the debt by 2009, as Whitehouse said. When we contacted Whitehouse's office, a spokesman acknowledged that the statement could have been articulated more clearly, but added that the senator was referring to the 1993 Clinton budget, which was passed narrowly by a Democratic House and Senate with widespread Republican opposition. Many economists argue that this blueprint set the table for the budget surpluses of the 1990s. So we see where Whitehouse, who got elected to the Senate in 2006, is coming from with this explanation. But when we looked at the words he spoke on the Senate floor, we decided that they did not indicate he was referring to the 1993 budget. In cases where we think someone simply misspoke inadvertently, we give them leeway. And we'll credit Whitehouse for repeating the numbers accurately. But in this case, Whitehouse said the same mistake twice -- and it was crucial to the point he was making on assigning partisan blame. Any listener not intimately familiar with budget legislation from the 1990s would be led to believe that the Democrats controlled Congress when Bush became president. So even though the mistake was inadvertent, we think it's sufficiently noteworthy to call out Whitehouse. We rate his statement False.

pomt-00267	Says Tammy Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation "to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA, "later a veteran died" and Baldwin "covered it up."	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/03/leah-vukmir/leah-vukmir-partially-accurate-faulting-tammy-bald/	On the campaign trail and in radio talk show interviews, Leah Vukmir has attacked U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin for months over the scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Tomah, Wis., where veterans were over prescribed opioid painkillers. But as the Nov. 6, 2018, election draws nearer, the Republican challenger’s attacks on the Democratic incumbent are reaching a crescendo. Vukmir hammered Baldwin again over the Tomah VA scandal on TV public affairs programs that aired Sept. 23, 2018 in Green Bay and in Madison. They were something of a prelude to a TV attack ad on the scandal that Vukmir aired three days later. So, let’s take a look at one of the attacks. Vukmir was asked on "Capital City Sunday" on WKOW-TV in Madison how she would have handled the Tomah VA matter differently. She responded by claiming that Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation "to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA, "later a veteran died" and Baldwin "covered it up." All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Let’s break down the three-part attack, starting with a quick review about what we know about Tomah. The scandal Problems at the Tomah VA first made news in January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. Doctors were handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place "Candy Land." The attacks on Baldwin began in early 2017 from a super PAC largely funded by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. The group claimed in a radio ad that Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about "overmedicated veterans," she made "deadly mistakes" and "three veterans died." We rated that False, based on how and when the deaths occurred and the "deadly mistakes" part of the claim. Now to Vukmir’s claim, which doesn’t go so far as to blame Baldwin for a death. 1. Baldwin ‘only one’ to have a report The first part of Vukmir’s claim is that, among the Wisconsin members of the U.S. House and Senate, only Baldwin received a report "outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA." The report was done by the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office of Inspector General following a 2½-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin’s office received it on Aug. 29, 2014. Baldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time. So, Baldwin had been informed about the problems at the Tomah VA before they were exposed publicly. And she doesn’t dispute that she was the first member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation to get the report. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. 2. ‘Later a veteran died’ Former Marine Jason Simcakoski died of a "mixed use toxicity" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol. Simcakoski death, however, occurred Aug. 30, 2014 — just one day after Baldwin received the VA inspector general’s report about Tomah that Vukmir highlights. So, it’s misleading to say "later a veteran died," given that Baldwin had not had time to act on the report. 3. Baldwin ‘covered it up’ The third part of Vukmir’s claim is that Baldwin "covered it up" — a reference to the entire Tomah VA matter, not solely to Simcakoski’s death. In the interview, Vukmir elaborates by saying Baldwin tried to "fire one of her aides that brought the issue forward, offering the aide "taxpayer hush money" and hiring "Hillary Clinton's attorneys" to "cover this up." Let’s break down these sub-points. An important point: It’s clear Baldwin did not take steps publicly on the scandal until the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose — months after she received the inspector general’s report and Simcakoski’s death. At the same time, there is no evidence that she took active steps to cover up the matter. Firing: Baldwin did fire an aide, but it’s not entirely clear she did so because the aide "brought the issue forward." In January 2015, after the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose, Baldwin had called for the VA to investigate Tomah but remained under fire for inaction on the scandal. Baldwin then fired Marquette Baylor, her deputy state director, without explanation, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed. Whistleblower and former Tomah VA employee Ryan Honl told the newspaper he had talked with Baylor for two hours in late November 2014 about the Tomah VA and that she discouraged him from going public with his concerns, saying that doing so might get her and others fired. Baylor later said she had prepared three memos on the Tomah situation for Baldwin's review and forwarded them to her supervisors; she alleged they were either not delivered to Baldwin or were ignored by Baldwin. ‘Hush money’, Clinton lawyer: Baldwin did offer a severance payment to the fired aide and did hire a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer. But this needs further explanation. As part of the firing, Baldwin's office offered a severance package to Baylor that would have included a confidentiality agreement and a payment, the Journal Sentinel reported. Attorney Marc Elias, who was the top lawyer in Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, was hired by Baldwin with campaign funds to review how her office handled the Tomah VA matter. He said the U.S. Senate's chief employment lawyer had helped put together the offer and described the confidentiality clause as routine. Baldwin later said the deal would have included a payment of about $17,000, which would have been from Senate funds. Baylor later rejected the offer and, according to Baldwin, sought more than four times that amount. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. Elias said Baylor’s handling of the Tomah VA matter was only one reason she was fired. ‘Cover up’: In addition to not releasing the inspector general report, Baldwin was slow to address the Tomah VA matter publicly. But ethics complaints filed against her alleging a cover up were found to have no merit. Baldwin avoided questions about the matter for weeks after the Center for Investigative Reporting’s expose; and it took attorney Elias nearly a month to confirm Baylor’s firing. After being fired, Baylor filed an ethics complaint accusing Baldwin of engaging in a political cover up by firing her for her alleged role in the mishandling of a whistleblower complaint. The complaint asked the U.S. Senate Ethics Select Committee to investigate Baldwin. The committee dismissed Baylor’s complaint and two similar complaints filed by groups, saying they lacked merit. Our rating Vukmir says Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation "to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA, "later a veteran died" and Baldwin "covered it up." Baldwin was the only one, and she didn’t make the report public or go public with her concerns until the scandal made news. But she received the report only a day before the veteran died. On the cover up part of the claim, there was on inaction on Baldwin’s part -- not releasing the report, declining for weeks to answer questions and to confirm that she had fired a top aide. But there is no evidence Baldwin took active steps to cover up the matter, and a Senate committee determined that Baldwin had not engaged in a cover up. For a statement that contains elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-08186	"Oregon, once again, remains among the top five hungriest states in the nation."	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/27/oregon-food-bank/oregon-one-nations-most-food-insecure-states-it-am/	Oregon doesn’t have a stellar track record in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s annual report on hunger, or as the report refers to it, food insecurity. The state is routinely above the national average and, despite much research, experts still aren’t sure exactly how to go about reversing this trend or, for that matter, why it exists at all. Whatever the case, the trend continues, and as proof we have the most recent study from the USDA. We also have a press release from the Oregon Food Bank alerting us all to the realities detailed within the report. "Hunger in Oregon continued to hover far above the national average as the Great Recession battered Oregon’s economy, according to the 2009 hunger report released today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture." It continues: "Oregon, once again, remains among the top five hungriest states in the nation, as it was last year." There’s a pretty big tendency, whether you’re writing a press release or a news article, to take this sort of data and compare one state to the next. In fact, that tendency is so strong, that while we were looking into the Oregon Food Bank’s assertion that our state is "among the top five hungriest in the nation" we came upon at least three articles that went one further and called Oregon the third hungriest state. There was a column in The Oregonian, an article in The Statesman Journaland a short brief by The Associated Press. But rarely -- heck, never -- are statistics so simple. We decided to see whether the report really backed up these various assertions. We started with the Food Bank itself to see which information from the report it was using to back up the "among the top five" claim. Jean Kempe-Ware, the spokeswoman, pointed us to the table that shows the "prevalence of household-level food insecurity and very low food security by state" for 2007-2009. The report offers two numbers for each state. The first is the percent of households that are suffering from either low or very low food security. The second category focuses on just those households suffering very low food security. In previous years, that category, she said, had been described as "hungry." Kempe-Ware said she focused on that second category. If you rank the states from highest rate to lowest rate, Oregon winds up in third place at 6.6 percent or, to put it another way, ahead of 47 other states. Now, this is where the state media seem to have stopped. By this measurement, Oregon is the third highest for those feeling extremely food insecure. To her credit -- and in an effort to be better safe than sorry -- Kempe-Ware went one further than the journalists and also looked at whether the state’s position would change much if you considered Oregon’s margin of error of plus or minus 1.02 percent. If you apply each state’s margin, in either direction, at the same time, Oregon winds up in fifth place, ahead of 45 other states. (It’s important to note here that the margin of error varies by state depending on how many residents were surveyed and the state’s overall population.) Based on these numbers and some additional advice, Kempe-Ware said "among the top five" felt like a fair estimate to her. We can see why. But there’s a lot more happening in these numbers that is worth exploring. For starters, we wanted to take a look at the first category that includes not just very low food security but also low food security. If you look at that number, Oregon’s prevalence of food insecurity jumps to 13.9 percent, but it ranks at 18th highest, or, to put it more accurately, it comes in higher than 32 other states. Not great marks, but certainly better than third or fifth. That’s just the beginning, however. The rankings that we’ve outlined here are all suspect. Just because Oregon might be near the low side of its margin of error doesn’t mean all other states will be. Of course, there are national factors that would probably weigh on all states, but for statistical purposes, there are a lot of possible variations. Let’s go back to the Food Bank’s preferred "very low food security" level. Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that Oregon’s rate is the lowest statistically possible, meaning 5.58 percent (that’s the initial estimate of 6.6 percent minus the 1.02 percent margin), but all the other states are at the high end of their margin. Well, that would put Oregon higher than just 18 other states. Conversely, if Oregon’s rate were the highest possible and all other states were at their lowest, Oregon would rank the out and out hungriest. The take-away: Oregon can appear first or lower than 31 other states. If you use the first set of numbers (remember low and very low food security?) you get an equally perplexing range of 3rd to 43rd highest. For more input we turned to Mark Nord, one of the authors of the USDA report. He helped shed light on a few points. First, he said, it was pretty apparent that Oregon was among the nation’s leaders in very low food security. But, he said, "we kind of discourage ranking by indicating how large the margins of error are. What we try to emphasize is states that are above the national average and states that are below the national average." Oregon is above the national average. Mark Edwards, an associate professor of sociology at Oregon State University who has helped advise the Oregon Food Bank on this report and has also been tracking and looking into the causes of food insecurity in Oregon for the last decade, said much same. The numbers allow for a lot of leeway in all directions, Edwards agrees, but he still maintains that the report highlighted real problems with hunger in Oregon. As proof he pointed to past reports that have consistently showed Oregon near the top. "The fact that we repeatedly come out higher than other states convinces me that there's something unique going on in Oregon that's a problem." There are, naturally, other broader issues with the survey, according to its detractors. John Charles at the conservative-leaning Cascade Policy Institute said the study’s findings, which depend on the respondents’ subjective interpretations of various questions, offer little hard data. Instead, he said, the jobless rate might offer a better indication of how many individuals are struggling to get by. That number -- 10.5 percent -- and the food stamp rate -- one in five Oregonians -- also indicate a lot of people in Oregon who have trouble buying food. We can see why Kempe-Ware felt that "among the five hungriest" was a safe statement. We can even see why some journalists felt that "third highest" was appropriate (we might have been tempted to use the same language ourselves). There are some numbers here that would appear to back them up. And two experts agree that Oregon is on the high end of things -- certainly higher than the national average. Still, those same two experts discourage out-and-out rankings. Then there’s the fact that quite a bit of variation is possible no matter how you look at the numbers. For those reasons, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Oregon Food Bank	None	None	None	2010-11-27T06:00:00	2010-11-15	['None']
pomt-05519	Says "unemployment tripled" in Dane County due to Kathleen Falk’s tax policies	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/12/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-unemployment/	Enter the phrase "Madison liberal" into Google and up pop 17,000 hits. Many of those involve conservatives affixing that label to Kathleen Falk, the labor-backed Democrat seeking to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election. As the recall election became official, the pro-Walker Republican Governors Association got in on the action. In a TV ad by its political arm (Right Direction Wisconsin PAC), the group features a mock Internet search on Falk, who was the Dane County executive from April 1997 to April 2011. (It’s similar to the ad taking on Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, another Democratic candidate in the race, a claim we already evaluated) "Kathleen Falk is a longtime Madison politician," the narrator says as search results pop up. "Huh." "Backed by government employee unions. Oh boy." It continues: "She raised taxes every year she was county executive. Huuuuh. And under her watch, unemployment tripled. Oh oh." The narrator’s final words: "Typical liberal Madison politician. Raised taxes and lost jobs. Kathleen Falk for governor? I don’t think so." We previously rated True a claim by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch that Falk raised property taxes by millions of dollars every year and approved the second highest increase in the state in 2010. But what about the joblessness claim -- that unemployment tripled during her time? And that the blame for the rise falls solidly on Falk’s shoulders? The numbers Dane County’s low unemployment rate compared with the rest of Wisconsin is notable. The county’s rate is typically a couple percentage points or more lower than Wisconsin as a whole, thanks in part to state government and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show. Unemployment was at just 1.7 percent when Falk took office in April 1997, and in her first full month on the job dipped to 1.5 percent. It held mostly under 3 percent until 2002, hovered between 3 and 4 percent until 2009, then spiked up for almost two years before receding a bit as she left office in April 2011. Dane County was growing at the time and overall employment was up, but the labor market couldn’t keep up with those seeking work. When Falk stepped down, the unemployment rate was at 5.2 percent, compared to Wisconsin’s overall rate of 7.5. In sum, the county’s unemployment rate grew during her tenure. Did it triple? It more than tripled if you compare the rate in her first full month to her last full month. The same is true when comparing the raw number of unemployed at those two points. And the same is true if you use her partial month in April 1997 as the baseline. There’s still another way to get there: When unemployment reached 6.7 percent at its height during her term, that was well over three times higher than Dane County’s rate when she came in. So the RGA is solid on the numbers. Responsibility But beyond the numbers the ad asserts that Falk and her policies were directly responsible for the jump. In the ad, the narrator notes the increase happened "under her watch." A website the RGA PAC set up to accompany the ad makes a stronger cause-and-effect link: "With Kathleen Falk’s tax hikes, came higher unemployment, too." As noted, taxes did go up. And some economists link high taxation to limits on economic growth. But it’s a stretch to pin the ups and downs of the economy in Dane County solely on Falk alone, much less pinpoint her tax increases alone. The trends are the work of multiple forces at the local, state, national and global level. The two big spikes in unemployment during Falk’s time coincided with national recessions, the latest fueled by the global meltdown in housing and financial markets. And on taxes, Falk mostly held to a yearly tax hike tied to inflation plus population growth. Only 15 of the state’s 72 counties had a lower cumulative tax levy increase during the time she was exec, we found in an earlier item. In short, the RGA claim is accurate on the numbers, but misfires by tying Falk so closely to the unemployment rise. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-14097	"Big rooftop solar's plan forces Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar."	/nevada/statements/2016/may/13/solar-energy-fairness/solar-subsidy-claims-need-more-evidence/	A group backed by Nevada’s energy monopoly is airing television ads that aim to cast a shadow over the well-publicized complaints of the rooftop solar industry. Solar Energy Fairness (which is backed by NV Energy, the state’s electric service monopoly) is airing an ad throughout Nevada with a narrator warning that "big rooftop solar" is trying to trick consumers into supporting a "government-mandated subsidy with no limits." "Big rooftop solar's plan forces Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar," it warns. The rooftop solar battle has seen angry protests and everyone from presidential candidates to actor Mark Ruffalo speaking out on the issue, so we thought the subsidy question was one that needed to be answered. A primer on net metering The gist of the subsidies question centers around Nevada’s net-metering program. Like most states, Nevada has a net-metering law that allows ratepayers who install solar panels and microturbines to sell excess energy they generate for use by their neighbor. Lawmakers created the program in 1997 to encourage shifting more of the state’s energy production to renewable sources. Generally, the idea is that utility companies will buy excess energy at the retail rate, so the "seller" is charged only for their net energy use. The process is an incentive for customers to make the investment in solar energy to lower their power bills. Critics of net metering, however, say solar customers are getting an unfair advantage because they’re not paying for the network that harnesses and distributes electricity. And in 2015, Nevada’s Public Utilities Commission agreed. The regulatory group effectively lowered the amount of credits solar customers can receive after determining that net metering participants were receiving an unreasonable subsidy. That prompted a revolt from solar companies, who left the state in mass, laying off workers and fighting to reverse the commission’s ruling through the ballot. The evidence Solar Energy Fairness (the group behind the ad) claimed that net-metering participants in Southern Nevada received $623 in annual subsidies under the former plan. In Northern Nevada, the annual subsidy was $471, the group claimed. In explaining the regulatory change, the PUC said that net-metering participants see a cost shift, or subsidy, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars over an extended period of time. That cost-shift contradicted a 2015 Legislative directive to reduce any "unreasonable shifting of costs" from net-metering participants to other energy customers. But net-metering customers make up a tiny percentage of all energy customers in the state, so the commission’s highest estimate of a per-month subsidy for other power customers would be between $1-3 a month, depending on inclusion of a rebate program. While the ad itself refers specifically to the net-metering program, it’s worth noting Nevada has previously subsidized rooftop solar installation to the tune of $225 million through a rebate program approved by the state Legislature. Arriving at a figure Determining the exact subsidy figure is complicated. Utility commissioners outlined 11 possible variables in their ruling to determine the value of the net metering. It included a broad range of possible costs and benefits, ranging from the avoided energy that would be needed to replace locally produced solar electricity, total grid capacity and the possible social and environmental boons. The sticking point for many is that the commission only used two of the 11 factors (reduced line losses and capacity) when determining the value of excess energy produced through net metering — the other nine were not used because they were difficult to quantify. Rooftop solar advocates, like Chandler Sherman of advocacy group Bring Back Solar, say omission of the other nine factors nullifies the subsidy argument entirely. "These are real tangible benefits," she said. "This is real dollars and cents the utility is saving." The problem is that arriving at a more balanced measurement of the full costs and benefits of net metering is really difficult. Devin Hartman, a former energy analyst with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote a policy brief criticizing the "utter lack of convincing evidence of cost-shifting" in the commission's report. But he acknowledged that actually putting down a dollar figure for some of the benefits can be speculative as well. Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and current director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group, said expanded rooftop solar penetration undermines the ability of utility commissions to set rates, and said the presumed benefits generally are outweighed by costs. "Solar is intermittent," he said. "You have to ignore it for purposes of planning capacity." Hartman told PolitiFact that the existence of a net-metering subsidy depends on variable market factors, but writing off all potential benefits likely leads to a flawed outcome. "Methodologically, you can come up with a better estimate than saying, ‘we just don’t have anything,’ " he said. "There was room for improvement, even though the task itself was very difficult." Another difficulty is the lack of standardized metrics used to measure potential net metering subsidies. A 2013 Rocky Mountain Institute study found many states overlap in their measurements of cost and benefits, but contain a "significant range of estimated value across studies." An independent analysis Both sides point to an independent analysis of Nevada’s net-metering program, done by Energy+Environmental Economics in July 2014 at the request of the commission. Rooftop solar advocates often refer to a section proclaiming a $36 million benefit for all consumers through net metering, but several factors in the study — like the price of solar per megawatt hour — have substantially changed since the report was issued in 2014. Still, it’s worth noting that study did not detect a major cost shift either way. Solar Energy Fairness spokeswoman Nicole Willis-Grimes said the Legislature has requested an update to the "E3" study, and Bring Back Solar’s Sherman says that SolarCity and non-profit group Natural Resources Defense Council are preparing their own study on the alleged cost-shift. Best estimates So what does all of this mean for the average energy customer who isn’t in the net-metering program? The subsidy figure used by Solar Energy Fairness likely represents the worst-case scenario, as it’s difficult to foretell the actual cost and benefits of the net metering program because so many factors have changed since the last independent report was filed in 2014. Though the assumed monthly subsidy cost is relatively small, Solar Energy Fairness spokeswoman Nicole Willis-Grimes notes that the number of net-metering applications skyrocketed in 2015 — going from around 6,000 participants between 1997 and June 2016 to more than 24,000 applications over the following six months. Our ruling A pro-NV Energy backed group is running ads claiming that "Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar." The net-metering subsidy question is complex and likely takes more than a 30-second television ad to explain in full. The root of the subsidy claim comes from a Public Utilities Commission decision that has been criticized for focusing too narrowly on the costs of the program. Rooftop solar systems have traditionally seen subsidies on both the state and federal level, but without hard evidence of a cost-shift occurring under the previous net metering rates, it’s a difficult argument to hold up. The reality is more complicated than Solar Energy Fairness puts on. We rate this claim as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a31514aa-c154-4824-9ec9-400e0a178cdf	None	Solar Energy Fairness	None	None	None	2016-05-13T15:36:03	2016-04-13	['Nevada']
pomt-10394	"I've supported every investigation (into Hurricane Katrina) and ways of finding out how – what caused the tragedy. I've met with people on the ground. I've met with the governor."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/11/john-mccain/with-two-notable-exceptions/	One of the ways Sen. John McCain is trying to put distance between himself and President Bush is by criticizing the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. But to pull it off, he's having to sidestep politically sensitive votes he took in 2005 and 2006 to limit Democrats' ability to investigate federal response to the disaster. At a press conference in Baton Rouge, La., on June 4, 2008, the presumptive Republican nominee was asked why he twice opposed creation of an independent commission to probe such issues as the government's role and the impact of the storm. McCain responded that he had backed every probe into the disaster. "I've supported every investigation (into Hurricane Katrina) and ways of finding out how — what caused the tragedy," McCain replied. "I've met with people on the ground. I've met with the governor." But McCain twice joined other Senate Republicans to beat back Democratic efforts led by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to launch an independent probe that could have embarrassed the administration. Those efforts came at a time of particularly bitter recriminations over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, while the White House was refusing to release certain documents or to make senior officials available for sworn testimony before Congress, citing the confidentiality of executive branch communications. In the GOP-controlled Senate, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee had launched a probe of the federal role in hurricane preparedness and its response. Republican leaders expressed faith in the bipartisan investigation and derided Democratic efforts to charter an independent commission to conduct a parallel inquiry. An aide to then-Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., called amendments to establish an independent Katrina commission "taxpayer-funded flatulence that would just waste time and money to distract from the inquiry already well under way in the Senate." On Sept. 14, 2005, McCain and 53 other Senate Republicans rejected an effort by Clinton to establish the commission by attaching an amendment to a spending bill. Republicans said the move violated Senate rules, by attempting to legislate policy via a spending bill. Less than five months later, on Feb. 2, 2006, McCain joined with 52 Senate Republicans in a vote to kill a Clinton effort to attach a similar amendment to a tax bill. The Republicans countered Clinton's proposal by offering to create a bipartisan congressional committee consisting of senators and representatives to examine the hurricane response, but Democrats rejected the idea. Sen. Barack Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee each pounced on McCain's gaffe, sending e-mails providing the dates and vote numbers of the two Senate votes. "John McCain seems perfectly comfortable misleading the American people rather than telling them the truth," said DNC spokeswoman Karen Finney. McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the Arizona senator was not familiar with the votes referenced in the question at the press conference, and was referring to his support for the Senate Homeland Security Committee investigation that was ongoing while Clinton offered her amendment. He issued a statement chastising Obama for launching "tired negative attacks." As for McCain's claim that he met with "people on the ground" and then-Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, his campaign would not provide information to back it up. But in March 2006, McCain was among the first senators to visit stricken districts of New Orleans, partly at the behest of the community activist group Women of the Storm, and he subsequently called for expanded funding to rebuild portions of the city. Media accounts of the visit state he was briefed by civic and business leaders and Army Corps of Engineers officials. Though there are no accounts of McCain and Blanco meeting, McCain and Louisiana state officials did consult on hurricane-related matters, such as in late 2006, when he was a player in unsuccessful House-Senate negotiations over a water resources bill that took up how much oversight to apply to future Army Corps of Engineers projects. McCain clearly showed empathy over the government's response to the disaster and the scope of the damage. But he overlooked his participation in two outright Senate rejections of Democratic efforts to establish an independent Katrina commission, so we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13103	Says "Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/04/americans-united-change/does-gop-wisconsin-sen-ron-johnson-call-social-sec/	Social Security is one of the most commonly used vehicles for attack ads in election campaigns. And the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, which will be decided Nov. 8, 2016, is no exception. Republican incumbent Ron Johnson said his Democratic challenger, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, "voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors" and "tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants." Our rating was Mostly False. Feingold did support a measure that increased taxes on Social Security benefits for higher-income seniors, not across the board, but did not try to give benefits to illegal immigrants. Mostly False was also our rating when the Wisconsin Democratic Party said Johnson "supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age" for Social Security. Johnson has said he is open to considering such proposals and he voted for a federal budget proposal that contained them. But voting for a federal budget proposal and its myriad programs isn’t an explicit show of support for cutting benefits and raising the retirement age for Social Security. (Go here to see all of our fact checks in the Johnson-Feingold race.) Now comes Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group that released an ad Oct. 26, 2016 that makes this claim: "Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program." We’ll check both parts. ‘Ponzi scheme’ During the U.S. Senate campaign in 2010, in which Johnson ousted Feingold, Johnson said Washington politicians "run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme" (a claim we rated Mostly False). A Ponzi scheme is illegal -- it’s an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors. Johnson has emphasized the pay-as-you-go nature of Social Security -- using taxes on today’s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans -- and decried the "raiding" of the Social Security trust fund. The claim from Americans United for Change, though, is that Johnson currently calls Social Security a Ponzi, not that it’s run like one. The Huffington Post reported that Johnson told a local Americans for Prosperity group in June 2016: "We’ve got to convince more of our fellow citizens that Social Security really is — and by the way, I was wrong when I said this in 2010, I said it’s a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes are illegal. So, Social Security is — it’s a legal Ponzi scheme." Johnson has also called Social Security a legal Ponzi scheme on other occasions during the current campaign. ‘Privatize the program’ The Huffington Post article said Johnson supported privatizing Social Security, but that the public wasn’t ready for the idea. He was quoted as saying: "Currently, politically, you can’t do it." The article didn’t say whether Johnson explained what sort of privatizing he would favor. Johnson’s campaign did not dispute the Huffington Post story, which the website said was based on a recording it obtained. The campaign told us Johnson is willing "to consider any serious proposal that would protect Social Security." In 2015, Johnson told a small of group of people he would "take a look" at a form of privatization, according to a video clip that was posted to YouTube. He said perhaps he would be open to raising taxes for Social Security if people could keep part of the funds rather than having them go to the Social Security fund. Johnson also said it "was a shame" that a privatization initiative from President George W. Bush wasn’t explored more fully. And that brings up an important point. The claim that Johnson "wants to privatize the program" could be taken to mean a complete privatization. But there is no indication he backs that. The Bush initiative amounted to partial privatization. It would have allowed younger workers to contribute portions of payroll taxes into government-approved private mutual fund accounts. Our rating Americans United for Change says: "Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program." Ponzi schemes are illegal. Johnson calls Social Security a legal Ponzi scheme to emphasize that it uses taxes on today’s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans. Johnson has expressed support for some form of privatization of Social Security, such as allowing individuals to invest some of their Social Security contributions, but it’s not clear that he backs complete privatization. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9edf489e-cf8b-41ad-b0f3-359c9ac03823	None	Americans United for Change	None	None	None	2016-11-04T19:11:47	2016-10-26	['None']
pomt-03076	Says Maggie Hassan is the only female governor in the country.	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/sep/27/nh-afl-cio/new-hampshire-afl-cio-says-maggie-hassan-only-fema/	New Hampshire voters made a splash in November 2012 by sending the country’s first all-female delegation to Congress. The state also elected Democrat Maggie Hassan as its governor. With women continuing to be underrepresented politics, the electoral sweep garnered national attention, including from political powerhouse EMILY’s List, which backs female candidates. EMILY’s List hosted its second "Madam President" town hall discussion in Manchester, N.H., on Friday, Sept. 27, 2013. Hassan was among the speakers at the event, which focused on promoting women candidates for political office, including the presidency. Coverage of the event quickly took to social media. "At Emily list event in manchester nh," reads a message posted to the NH AFL-CIO’s Twitter account on Friday morning, Sept. 27. "Gov Hassen (sic) address a gathering as only women governor in the country." People quickly took to Twitter to tweak the tweeter’s grammar — and also to challenge the assertion that Hassan stands alone as the only female governor in the country. So we decided to check into it. Hassan is actually one of five women who are currently serving as governors. She’s joined by Republicans Jan Brewer of Arizona, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Nikki Haley of South Carolina, and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Hassan is the only Democrat in the bunch -- and female governors are scarce. The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey has compiled a definitive history of the country’s female governors. The center determined that 35 women have served as governors in 26 states. The first state to elect a female governor was Wyoming, where voters put Nellie Tayloe Ross into office in 1924. Before that, the former Wyoming Territories also passed the first law in U.S. history explicitly granting women the right to vote. Wyoming went on to approve the first constitution in the world granting full voting rights to women in 1889. In New Hampshire, former state Senate President Vesta Roy holds the title of the first woman to serve as governor. Roy, a Republican, held the position for seven days after the death of Gov. Hugh Gallen in 1982. She was replaced a week later when Gov. John H. Sununu was sworn into office. The Granite State's first elected female governor was Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, who served from 1997-2003, and was later elected to the U.S. Senate. Arizona claims the title of the first state to elect four women to serve as governor. It was also the first state to elect two successive women governors. Throughout history, 20 Democratic women and 15 Republican women have served as governors. Before Hassan took office, the last two Democratic governors were Christine Gregoire, of Washington, and Beverly Perdue, of North Carolina, who both served until 2013. Hassan’s distinction as the country’s only Democratic female governor at the moment might have been the distinction the AFL-CIO was aiming for when it tweeted about Hassan’s speech at the event in Manchester. We placed a call to NH AFL-CIO headquarters to inquire about the source of their tweet. President Mark MacKenzie said he was responsible for publishing the information, and acknowledged the error.

pomt-03640	South Carolina has a labor shortage, specifically in the meatpacking industry.	/georgia/statements/2013/may/03/lindsey-graham/graham-points-hard-fill-jobs-immigration-debate/	Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a member of the bipartisan Gang of Eight senators pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. Graham has repeatedly used his state’s labor issues to justify guest worker programs for low-skilled and agricultural workers. "Nobody wants to displace a willing American worker, but I can tell you in South Carolina there are certain jobs, like in the meatpacking industry, that as an employer you can advertise all day long every day of the week and you’re not going to get that workforce," Graham said during a February 2013 Senate hearing. The senator made similar comments to a South Carolina Rotary Club. "When you go to these meatpacking plants in Saluda (S.C.), harvesting the crops or servicing the hotels along the coast, you may not believe it, but it is true -- there is a shortage of labor in some parts of our economy, even though we have high unemployment," Graham said. We wanted to know whether Graham’s comments about a labor shortage in some areas were correct. South Carolina’s jobless rate is higher than the national rate. That state and Georgia’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March. The national rate was 7.6 percent. So why would jobs go unfilled? The issue may be one of wages, not workers, said Steve Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. "Real wages in meat/poultry processing have declined about 40 percent in the last 30 years. These are not the lowest-paying jobs, but they are nasty, not pleasant work," he said. "If the job pays dramatically less than it previously did, that means there is a wage issue and not a jobs issue." The national average hourly wage for slaughterers and meatpackers was $11.99 in May 2012. In South Carolina, the average hourly wage was $11.36. In 2010, the national hourly wage for the job was $11.55; South Carolina’s wage was $8.81. Because of the nature of the work and the pay, the jobs may not attract enough applicants, said Mark Grey, an anthropology professor and director of the Iowa Center for Immigrant Leadership and Integration. The nonprofit, nonpartisan center at the University of Northern Iowa notes that its programs incorporate "a strong appreciation for the critical role newcomers play" in the state’s economy. "(Meatpacking) wages have increased, but still at $16 per hour (on the high end), the job would probably not be appealing to anybody with any kind of education," he said. In Saluda County, S.C. -- the area mentioned by Graham -- the unemployment rate for residents with less than a high school diploma was 19.1 percent in 2011, the most recent federal data available. The rate dropped to 10.9 percent for high school graduates with no college. Statewide unemployment that year was 10.5 percent. To sum up, research shows that South Carolina’s unemployment is almost a full percentage point higher than the national average, and the rate for lower-educated residents is even higher. But in the meatpacking industry, the nature of the work and the wages often turn off many American workers, those on both sides of the immigration debate said. Graham said that there was a problem filling certain jobs, even amid high unemployment. But his statement lacks context about wages and conditions in the meatpacking industry.

pomt-05488	"We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/18/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-his-administration-has/	President Barack Obama touts his administration’s record holding trade partners accountable by drawing a contrast with President George W. Bush over China. "We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration," he said in an April 13, 2012, speech in Tampa, Fla., before a trip to Colombia. Here’s how he set it up: "Now, one of the ways that we've helped American business sell their products around the world is by calling out our competitors, making sure they're playing by the same rules. For example, we've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration. We just brought a new case last month. And we've set up a trade enforcement unit that's designed to investigate any questionable trade practices taking place anywhere in the world." It’s a claim he’s made before, published in the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times. We wondered, is it true? ‘The honeymoon’ We asked the White House for support for the president’s claim. Obama referred to cases brought against China before the World Trade Organization, said spokesman Matt Lehrich. The WTO is a group of more than 150 governments that sets and enforces international trade rules. Since the United States and China are both members, it’s a pivotal place they can go to settle disputes with one another. There are other important types of trade cases, such as anti-dumping cases brought before the U.S. International Trade Commission, but those are brought by private industry, said Peg O’Laughlin, public affairs officer for the ITC. Other kinds of enforcement cases include those brought under Section 301 or 201 of U.S. trade laws. They're rare now because, under WTO rules, the United States isn't supposed to regularly turn to that sort of unilateral action, said Paul Blustein, a trade expert with the Brookings Institution. So while there are a wide range of trade measures available, the experts we consulted said focusing on just WTO cases seemed reasonable. The Obama administration has brought six cases against China before the WTO in less than one term, while the Bush administration brought seven cases over two terms — thus, the claim "at nearly twice the rate." But there’s a distinction between the two presidencies, what we’ll call China’s "honeymoon." China joined the WTO in 2001, after Bush took office. At that point, member countries essentially gave China a grace period to follow the new rules. "Business was just rushing into China … those were good days," said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow for the Peterson Institute for International Economics who writes about U.S.-China trade and worked in the Carter and Ford administrations. "Nobody was wanting to bring cases in particular. (China) probably got more of a grace period than would normally be expected because of the business boom." The United States became the first country to file a trade case, over trade barriers against integrated circuits, in March 2004. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in 2004 that China had needed time to adjust its tax and regulatory policies to comply with WTO standards, but that after two years "the honeymoon" was over, according to Congressional Quarterly and other news organizations. The Obama administration, on the other hand, had no such delay — plus it could take advantage of work started under Bush to file a first case within six months of taking office. That’s not to say Democrats back in 2004 weren’t arguing the Bush administration could have acted sooner. "One case brought as a political talking point does not make up for the administration's failure to develop a China trade policy over the past three years," Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top-ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, was quoted as saying in Congressional Quarterly in 2004. "This is an open-and-shut case that the administration should have addressed years ago." A Bush-era deputy U.S. trade representative says Bush realistically had five years to bring cases against China — not seven. "The first year of China's membership was eaten up giving them a chance to prove compliance," said John Veroneau, who also worked in the Defense Department under President Bill Clinton. "The second year was eaten up jawboning about problems and preparing the facts and analysis to be able to bring a WTO case. At the beginning of the third year, we brought the first case." That changes the math, putting Bush’s rate of cases much closer to Obama’s. Rather than nearly two cases a year for Obama vs. about one for Bush, the comparison would be nearly two cases a year for Obama vs. about one and a half for Bush. Driving factors The trade policy of the president isn’t necessarily the largest factor driving the rate of trade cases, said Hufbauer, the expert with the Peterson Institute. Other considerations out of Obama’s control (and Bush’s) held greater sway, he said. • When the country has more trade, you’re going to have more cases. And trade with China has boomed over the decade. • The economic climate matters. While the government brings cases to the WTO, its staff relies on private companies to come forward with strong evidence of wrongdoing. That requires companies to be motivated to do the legwork. In boom times, there’s less motivation. An economic downturn makes a difference. "Private companies have been much more aggrieved in the last few years than the first few years." • China hasn’t been as welcoming. "It just isn't as friendly to companies as it was during the Bush administration," Hufbauer said. "That wasn't because of the Bush administration — but because of the times. … This is leading companies to see more of the downside." That means they’re more willing to spend time to help the government build trade cases. One piece of evidence that Obama’s administration has been deliberately more aggressive than Bush’s deals with use of safeguards under Section 421 of U.S. trade law, which will be allowed by the WTO through 2013. The section allows U.S. industries to request blocking particular imports from China to protect American companies. While the Bush administration refused several such requests, Obama approved one on tires. "There is a very sharp change in that," Hufbauer said. But the White House told us Obama’s statistic relied on WTO cases, not other types of trade measures, so we're basing our ruling on that measurement, which independent experts said was a good metric. Our ruling Obama said his administration has "brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration." Though the statistic takes into account the fact that China didn’t join the WTO until nearly a year into Bush’s term, it fails to acknowledge time for China after it joined to adjust to new WTO regulation. By contrast, Obama's administration could hit the ground running. The math still favors Obama, but not by as much as he claims. Also, there are several external factors that affect an administration's decision to pursue trade cases. Those are important details and context. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-02749	School children can earn higher grades by studying Islam under a new "nationwide Muslim outreach program" announced by President Barack Obama.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/16/blog-posting/viral-post-claims-barack-obama-has-begun-nationwid/	Several readers recently asked us to check a claim that’s been spreading widely through chain emails and on social media -- that the Obama administration is pursuing a "nationwide Muslim outreach program for children" in grades K through 12. Here’s some of the text that usually accompanies the claim: "At a press conference today, President Obama announced plans for the first ever federally funded Muslim outreach program. The program will be available nationwide for all elementary school students grade K-12 beginning February 1st, 2014. The program is designed to educate children about the fundamentals of the Muslim religion and Islamic belief. "President Obama spoke with reporters to explain why it is so important that these outreach programs exist. ‘The Muslim community deserves our full understanding and respect,’ Obama said. ‘We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. These folks are not all bad. In fact, most of them are hard-working citizens just like you and me. I encourage every student in America to participate in your school’s Muslim outreach program. Learn about the Muslim community, the beauty of the Sunnah and the magic of the Qur’an.’" The item cited "35-year-old Paul Horner, a teacher at Starks Elementary School in Louisiana," who purportedly told MSNBC that he is "excited about the new program," because "if Becky has a D+ in math she can take a three week after-school class on the Qur’an and would then have an A in Math. That’s a win-win for everyone!" It closed by urging any parents of students who "would like to volunteer and teach the Muslim religion" to "call the Nationwide Muslim Youth Outreach hotline at (202) 863-8500." This all sounded fishy to us, so we checked with the White House, which confirmed that no such press conference had ever happened. Nor was there any such program. We also rooted around the Internet and discovered that a portion of the text originated with an "article" in the National Report, a satire website. In fact, when we fact-checked the previous iteration of the claim from National Report in October 2013 -- that "Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month" -- we rated that Pants on Fire. This is only the latest example of satire passed off as truth on the Internet. We took a detailed look at the phenomenon here. The recently circulating item about the Muslim outreach program included some of the same language as the National Report item, but it was substantially rewritten. Not only was the topic somewhat different, but the quote from "Horner" was added, among other things. (The website of Starks High School in Starks, La., -- which includes students from K-12 -- does not include any staff member by that name.) In addition, the phone number listed as being for the "Nationwide Muslim Youth Outreach hotline" was actually the phone number of the Republican National Committee. RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski confirmed that the RNC had nothing to do with the piece. "We’ve gotten calls from people giving us a heads up about this. We didn’t have anything to do with this and are telling people as much when they call," she said. The furthest back we could trace the language was to a Dec. 7, 2013, post on the website Conservative Frontline. While the National Report acknowledges that its stories "are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report" and at one time included a disclaimer that that "all news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news," we could not find any indication that Conservative Frontline is designed to be a satire site. It includes an array of articles from a conservative perspective and sometimes conspiracy theories, but does not appear to be full of satire articles. From there it spread through conservative blogs, passed off, apparently, as truth. Conservative Frontline did not offer any contact information on its website, so we were unable to reach its staff. Our ruling Social media posts have reprinted or linked to a story titled, "Obama Administration Announces Nationwide Muslim Outreach Program For Children Grades K-12," that claims, among other things, that school children can earn higher grades for studying Islam. It’s not true. No such program exists. In fact, part of the story has been recycled from a previous satire article that we and others debunked. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-11982	New York has "the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state."	/new-york/statements/2017/sep/29/edward-cox/new-york-has-most-people-leaving-other-states-coun/	New York state’s population declined last year for the first time in a decade. State Republican Chairman Edward F. Cox blames the drop on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Cuomo's economic policies make it hard for employers to add jobs, especially in upstate New York, so residents are leaving the state for better employment opportunities elsewhere, he said. "We have the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state," Cox said. Thirty other states also lost population to other states last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Is Cox right that New York state tops that list? Latest data New York state lost a net 191,367 residents to other states between July 2015 and July 2016, more than any other state. Where are they going? The most popular destination is Florida, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Almost 70,000 New York state residents moved to the Sunshine State in 2015. The second-most popular destination was New Jersey, which gained about 50,000 people from New York state. California ranked third with almost 37,000 people from New York. Brooklyn had the largest exodus from New York with a net 43,264 people moving from the borough to another state. Only three counties — Ontario, Saratoga, and Warren — had more people move in from another state than out. Since 2011 Last year was the worst year for domestic migration in New York state since at least 2011, the data shows. The state had a net loss of 90,342 people to other states between 2010 and 2011. That count has increased each year since, except for a short-lived dip in 2013. New York lost a net 846,669 people to other states between 2011 and 2016, more than any other state. Illinois recorded the second-highest outmigration in the country with a net loss of 540,166 residents. Again, Florida and New Jersey attracted the most New York residents. Almost 300,000 of them moved to Florida between 2011 and 2015. New Jersey ranked second, drawing about 225,000 people from New York state. Pennsylvania was the third most popular destination, with about 160,000 people migrating from New York state At the same time, New York state’s population has increased by 367,179 since 2010 thanks to almost 1.5 million births and migration from other countries. Migration rates Beyond raw counts, New York state has the biggest outmigration rate among the states if considering just domestic migration. Ten of every 1,000 New York state residents moved to another state in 2016. Illinois ranked second, with nine of every 1,000 residents in that state moving to another state. Governing magazine charted each state's migration rate -- the difference of in-migration and outmigration -- per 1,000 people in 2015-16, and it also included people coming and going from outside the country. New York state ranked fifth behind Illinois, Wyoming, North Dakota and Kansas. Our ruling Cox said New York has "the biggest outmigration of citizens of any state." By raw numbers alone, Cox is right. Census data shows more people are moving from New York state to other states than move from any other state. And the flow has become larger since 2011. Given that New York state has the nation's fourth-largest population, nearly 20 million, it's not surprising the numbers dwarf smaller states. But by proportion, and when including international migration, several other states have bigger outmigration rates. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05944	"Romneycare sent costs spiraling out of control" in Massachusetts, "hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets."	/florida/statements/2012/jan/26/winning-our-future/pro-gingrich-super-pac-blames-romneycare-spiraling/	Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are on the same side, says an ad from from a pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC. "Think you know Mitt? Think again," says the ad from Winning our Future, which is spending a reported $6 million on the air in Florida. The ad then makes the point that the health care law Romney signed when he was governor of Massachusetts in 2006 is much like the one President Obama signed in 2010. "When Mitt Romney invented government-run health care, Romney advisers helped Barack Obama write the disastrous Obamacare," a narrator says. "Romneycare sent costs spiraling out of control, hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets." Yes, Romney’s health plan is a lot like the plan Obama ushered into law. No, it’s not government-run health care. These are old talking points that we’ve fact-checked many times. Here, we wanted to look specifically at whether "Romneycare sent costs spiraling out of control, hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets." First, a little about the health care plans: Generally speaking, both laws leave in place the major insurance systems. There’s employer-provided insurance for workers and their families, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the very poor. Both laws require people to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." Both laws also seek to cover the uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to moderate-income people to buy insurance. Companies that don't offer insurance will typically pay penalties, with exceptions for small business. Massachusetts paid for the plan with some new state spending, but also with help from the federal government. In part because the Massachusetts plan is so similar to the national plan, health policy analysts have tracked the outcomes there closely and publish regular reports. In reviewing these reports, we found consensus that the high cost of health care is still a concern for Massachusetts. Also, more people have insurance in Massachusetts, so overall spending is up. But cost increases for individual households are largely due to the fact that health care costs have been rising across the country, regardless of the Massachusetts plan. We found little to suggest that the Massachusetts plan caused costs to go up more there than they did elsewhere. In an examination of the state’s health plan published in June 2011, the Boston Globe concluded that health care costs are on the rise in Massachusetts, just as they are elsewhere, but it’s not fair to blame the Romney plan for the trend. "Massachusetts does have the highest health care costs in the nation, but it owned this dubious distinction long before ‘Romneycare’ was born," the Globe said. Similarly, a January 2012 report in the scholarly journal Health Affairs concluded that affordability remained an issue for the state’s health care system. But the plan’s expansion of coverage also means that more people have insurance, and consumers have lower out-of-pocket expenses. "Going forward, the success of health reform under the Affordable Care Act in Massachusetts, and in other states, will depend on the ability of policy makers and stakeholders to come together to take on the considerable challenge of reining in health care costs," the report said. When we contacted the Romney campaign, they pointed us to statistics from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that showed while the cost of insurance has still been increasing in Massachusetts, it’s increasing more slowly than it did in the years before reform. We asked Winning Our Future for evidence to back up its claim, but we didn’t hear back. Our ruling The Massachusetts health plan expanded coverage to many people who didn’t have insurance before, and that did cost the state and federal government money. Also, consumers saw increases in their health care costs. But there’s little to show that the health plan Romney signed as governor caused the increased costs that affected household budgets. In recent years, health care costs have been rising around the country, and Massachusetts is not exempt. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04469	Gov. Nathan Deal "has taken at least $15,600 from the (Koch brothers), their businesses, and their employees."	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/09/patriot-majority-usa/group-attempts-link-deal-koch-brothers/	When it comes to the game of big-money politics, there are few competitors more influential than the Koch brothers -- and supporters of President Barack Obama don’t like the way they play. Charles and David Koch support libertarian and tea party principles of lower taxes and smaller government, using some of their vast wealth to back causes and candidates that often oppose the president’s policies. The Koch brothers, who own myriad businesses under the umbrella company Koch Industries, have a combined reported fortune of $35 billion. One group recently came to Georgia to ask Gov. Nathan Deal to denounce the Koch brothers for "funding laws like voting restrictions that hurt Georgians." Georgia is one of several states in recent years to pass laws requiring various forms of photo identification at the polls, to the dismay of civil rights groups and Democrats. "Deal has taken at least $15,600 from the Kochs, their businesses, and their employees," Patriot Majority USA, which describes itself as a bipartisan organization, wrote in the news release. The group held a news conference at the state Capitol on Oct. 1 as part of its national tour to push solutions that it says will encourage economic growth. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether this group had its numbers right and whether any context was missing. Patriot Majority USA describes itself as an organization hoping to empower all Americans. Its action plan includes providing more money for public schools, improving the nation’s roads and bridges, supporting the federal health care law’s provision that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance until the age of 26, and closing tax loopholes for special-interest groups. Efforts to reach Deal’s office for comment were unsuccessful. Deal spent $8 million during his successful 2010 campaign for governor. Christy Setzer, a media representative for the organization, sent us a weblink that listed five separate contributions to Deal from individuals it claims are employees who work for companies owned by the Koch brothers. One of the individuals mentioned was James S. Balloun, a longtime leading Atlanta businessman and civic leader. State records show Balloun has made campaign contributions to a number of prominent Republicans, including Casey Cagle, Karen Handel, Sam Olens and Sonny Perdue, as well as to Deal. Balloun was named a director of Georgia-Pacific in 1998. The company was purchased by Koch Industries in 2005. As Patriot Majority USA stated, Balloun made contributions of $5,000 and $2,500 to Deal in 2010, according to state campaign finance records. Balloun, however, listed himself as retired when those two contributions were made. Setzer acknowledged that Balloun retired as a Georgia-Pacific director well before he made the contributions to Deal. She said, though, that Balloun was no "run of the mill" employee and that "there has been speculation in various blogs that Balloun continues to carry water for G-P." The other contributions Patriot Majority USA mentioned came from Georgia-Pacific and donors who work at the company. Balloun said he has never met the Koch brothers and noted that he had retired from Georgia-Pacific when Koch Industries bought the company. Balloun said he was a supporter of Perdue, who was governor from 2003 to 2010. He felt Deal would govern with a similar approach, he said, so he gave money to the Deal campaign. As for Patriot Majority USA’s claim that Balloun continues to carry water for Georgia-Pacific, he said: "There’s speculation that the Earth is flat, too." PolitiFact Georgia also found some contributions made by Georgia-Pacific and at least one executive, Curley Dossman, to Democrats in Georgia, including former Attorney General Thurbert Baker and former state Sen. Dubose Porter. Those contributions totaled $2,000. So does that mean the Koch brothers support the policies of these two Democrats because of these contributions? To sum up, Patriot Majority USA says Deal accepted $15,600 in campaign contributions from businesses owned by the Koch brothers or employees who work for those companies. One of those employees cited had retired by the time he made two contributions to Deal totaling $7,500, nearly half of what Patriot Majority USA mentioned in its news release. The information in the release is not accurate. We rate it False.	None	Patriot Majority USA	None	None	None	2012-10-09T06:00:00	2012-09-30	['Nathan_Deal']
pomt-11285	Says the 2015 vote on the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act "was not a vote to deny access to the U.S."	/florida/statements/2018/apr/24/gwen-graham/did-gwen-graham-vote-favor-legislation-denying-res/	Gwen Graham’s opponents for Florida governor criticized her during the first Democratic debate over a past vote to put extra restrictions on Syrian refugees. Orlando-area businessman Chris King said the 2015 vote made it harder for Syrian refugees to come to this country (even though it never passed). Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum pointed out how former President Barack Obama was against the legislation. Graham, who served one term in Congress representing north Florida, said her vote on the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act would not have banned refugees from the country. "That vote was not a vote to deny access to the United States," Graham said April 18 in Tampa. "It was a vote that would only have certified the process that was in place." Given the pushback from her opponents, we wondered if Graham was right about the effect of the legislation. The SAFE Act did not explicitly deny refugees’ entry to the United States. However, Graham downplayed the new burden it would have placed on the processing of certain refugees that would have slowed the process, likely resulting in at least a pause in admissions. What did the the SAFE Act mean for refugees? The Republican-controlled U.S. House passed the SAFE Act (HR 4038) in response to the Nov. 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris that resulted in more than 130 deaths. The vote was 289-137. Forty-seven Democrats, including Graham, broke from the party and voted for the legislation. The bill never made it through the Senate. Supporters at the time said the bill would increase national security. "In light of new threats, we must strengthen our vetting process," Graham told reporters at the time. "We must be able to identify those who wish to do us harm, while continuing to offer a safe haven to those in need of refuge from war and persecution." But opponents including the Obama White House said the bill would in effect prevent Syrian immigrants from coming to the United States. The end of the statement by the White House indicated Obama would veto the bill if it made it to his desk. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So what would this legislation have really have meant for Syrian refugees? Under the existing requirements, experts said refugees experienced a processing time of 18 to 24 months in 2015. Refugees had to undergo a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, "cultural orientation" classes, and one final security clearance. The legislation would have added a layer of certification to the process that was in place. It would have required each refugee case to have the sign-off of three agency heads. Here’s a key portion of the text: "A covered alien may only be admitted to the United States after the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence, certifies to the appropriate Congressional Committees that the covered alien is not a threat to the security of the United States." Had this become law, it would have extended the waiting period for these applications. "To ask that we have my FBI director make personal guarantees would effectively grind the program to a halt," U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a news conference after the bill passed the House. So a more reasonable interpretation of this bill is that it would have slowed down or temporarily paused refugees from coming in to the United States. That is important context in understanding Graham’s defense. "The bill did not specify how the certification process would work, so DHS, the FBI, and the Office of the National Intelligence Director would be tasked with agreeing on standards—which could take months (and result in a pause)," said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a nonprofit organization that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees, agreed that nothing in the legislation stopped refugees from coming in. But he said the measure would have crippled the existing program. "Such a new security layer would have added a major bureaucratic hurdle without value, as it would largely be redundant to the existing (checks)," he said. The flow of Syrian refugees has decreased significantly since 2016 when the U.S. resettled more than 15,000, according to the Refugee Processing Center. In calendar year 2017, the country let in 3,024 refugees from Syria. So far this year, that number is just 11. A few days into his administration, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to indefinitely suspend the entry of Syrian refugees. A revised order in March 2017 suspended refugee entry for 120 days, but did not single out Syrian refugees for indefinite admission. Refugee admissions eventually resumed under "enhanced vetting." In September 2017, Trump also reduced the cap on refugees coming to the United States from anywhere in the world to 45,000. Our ruling Graham said her 2015 vote for the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act was "not a vote to deny access to the U.S." Graham’s take on the legislation requires some context. While it would not have prevented Syrian entry outright, it would have installed a significant new layer of bureaucracy that would have at least delayed their entry. The bill would have required the signature of three agency heads for each case, an extraordinary hurdle on top of previous requirements. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03270	"Obamacare … carries on even under a government shutdown."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/08/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-government-shutdown-wouldnt-sidelin/	Some congressional Republicans are threatening to deny funding for government operations unless a provision is included to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law. Because defunding Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment is a nonstarter for Democrats, lawmakers are now openly pondering the possibility of a government shutdown. Other Republicans -- including Paul Ryan, the party’s former vice presidential nominee -- are warning that a government shutdown is a bad idea and won’t work anyway. That was a point he made on the Aug. 4, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. "Obamacare is an entitlement like Medicare and Social Security is, and so the entitlement carries on even under a government shutdown scenario," said Ryan, who is also the House budget chairman. First, some background. Shutdowns occur when appropriations bills expire, and Congress and the president are at an impasse. A shutdown typically prevents federal agencies from carrying out any functions deemed non-essential. A shutdown last occurred in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. That led to two shutdowns -- one for five days in November 1995 and the other for 21 days from December 1995 to January 1996. Some government functions are not reliant on congressional appropriations, and these can usually continue unimpeded in the face of a shutdown. Several elements of the health care law fall into this category. Here’s a summary of some of the key provisions of the health care law and how they might be affected by shutdown. Insurance exchanges and premium subsidies Ryan referred to Obamacare being like such "entitlements" as Social Security and Medicare, which are not affected by shutdowns. An entitlement is a government program that is funded by a formula, rather than by the kinds of specific congressional appropriations that run out in a shutdown. Any American who meets the criteria for receiving the benefit will keep receiving payments even in the absence of congressional appropriations. The health care law creates online marketplaces where uninsured Americans can purchase health insurance, and it offers them means-tested subsidies to help pay the premiums for those plans. The subsidies fit the definition of an entitlement most directly. Because the subsidies are provided in the form of tax credits, they are not subject to appropriations, and thus should be able to proceed during a shutdown. As for the operations of the exchanges themselves, these too seem likely to be unaffected by a shutdown, although for a different reason. The independent Congressional Research Service has concluded that implementation of the insurance marketplace is being funded by long-term appropriations -- funding streams that won’t be cut off during a government shutdown. There’s one caveat, however: Delays could still occur if federal agencies have no workers, or too few, to carry out needed tasks. This has been an issue in the past with Social Security Administration employees. The agency’s operational employees are paid through appropriated funds. Would a shutdown prevent employees from going to work, potentially halting operations? A 1981 attorney general's opinion protects the right of at least some Social Security workers to carry out necessary functions -- and that’s essentially what happened during the 1995 shutdowns. According to Social Security's official history on its website, 4,780 employees remained at work at the start of the four-day shutdown, while the other 61,415 were furloughed. But this cut "significantly impacted the Agency’s service to the public," the account said, and on the second day, additional employees were recalled to work. The second shutdown -- which lasted three weeks, the longest in history -- could have brought even more severe consequences. But the agency deployed 55,000 employees and operations remained close to normal. Noting the past experience of Social Security, CRS wrote, "it may be reasonable to infer that any similar benefit programs" under the health care law would have enough administrative flexibility to keep operations going during a shutdown. In other words, there’s no guarantee, but it’s likely that operations will continue. Tax provisions In general, tax collection is not affected by a shutdown. Anyone who incurs taxes is still liable for paying them on a quarterly or annual basis, even if the IRS is in shutdown mode. In addition, exceptions exist for processing tax payments received during a shutdown. Some Obamacare taxes, such as those on branded pharmaceuticals, need to be calculated and assessed in writing by IRS before the manufacturer pays them, so these could be affected by a shutdown, according to the Congressional Research Service. But even if there’s a delay, the taxes will ultimately be paid, shutdown or not. This is true for the mandate on individuals to purchase health insurance; people who run afoul of this pay their penalty through their tax return. Regulations Many key aspects of the health care law are regulatory in nature -- for instance, rules about what insurers have to cover, how much insurers need to spend on health-related expenses and protections for patients with pre-existing conditions or those with young adult children. While these are all part of the health care law, a government shutdown wouldn’t really affect them. At most, enforcement efforts might lag during a shutdown, but the rules will remain on the books and will have to be respected. "At most, government enforcement activity might be put on hold, but after the shutdown people could be investigated and held liable for violations they committed during the shutdown period," said Ronald Levin, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. We will conclude by emphasizing the rarity of government shutdowns, and the absence of any that lasted any significant period of time. "It depends how long any shutdown goes on," said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "It's easy to be creative for a short period but harder after a while." Our ruling Ryan said that "Obamacare … carries on even under a government shutdown." For various reasons, most key parts of the law -- the insurance marketplace, the premium subsidies, and the taxes and regulations -- should continue unimpeded. But shutdowns are rare and unpredictable, so we can’t be entirely sure that there will be no major interruptions. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-11451	American aluminum and steel "are vital to our national security. ... They are the bedrock of our defense industrial base."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/09/donald-trump/how-vital-our-national-security-are-steel-aluminum/	When President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, the stated reason was national security. "The president is exercising his authority to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports in order to protect our national security," the White House said in a statement. Specifically, the White House cited section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which it said "provides the president with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security." Hours before he officially announced the tariffs, Trump said he was "taking action to protect American industries that are vital to our national security, including American aluminum and steel. … Aluminum and steel are the backbone of our nation. They are the bedrock of our defense industrial base." Is Trump right that American aluminum and steel "are vital to our national security" and "the bedrock of our defense industrial base"? Dueling departments In an undated but recent memo, Defense Secretary James Mattis acknowledged concerns about "unfair trade practices," but he emphasized that "the U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum each only represent about 3 percent of U.S. production." In other words, domestic production in the United States is more than 30 times the amount required to satisfy Defense Department needs -- before having to use a single ton of imported steel. Defense’s share of the high-purity aluminum produced domestically is a bit higher -- 10 percent -- but here, too, this "is more than adequately met" by existing U.S. sources, according to the Aerospace Industries Association of America. The Pentagon’s small share of U.S. steel and aluminum output would seem to undercut the argument of national security as a credible justification for the tariffs. However, the decision to impose tariffs for steel and aluminum imports was made based on a different argument by the Commerce Department, which is headed by a longtime free-trade skeptic, Wilbur Ross. In a pair of January 2018 reports, the Commerce Department addressed the role of the American steel and aluminum industries in preserving national security. In both cases, the department said that action against imports was necessary. The department concluded that the present import situation was "weakening our internal economy," which it noted was language included in the 1962 law. Specifically, the law says: In the administration of this section, the director (of the Office of Emergency Planning) and the president shall further recognize the close relation of the economic welfare of the nation to our national security, and shall take into consideration the impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare of individual domestic industries; and any substantial unemployment, decrease in revenues of government, loss of skills or investment, or other serious effects resulting from the displacement of any domestic products by excessive imports shall be considered, without excluding other factors, in determining whether such weakening of our internal economy may impair the national security. The law offers a more expansive definition of national security than might be obvious on the surface. Both Commerce reports cite a variety of elements of "national security" that fall well beyond the scope of military activities. National security, according to the steel report, "encompasses U.S. critical infrastructure sectors including transportation systems, the electric power grid, water systems, and energy generation systems." Similarly, the aluminum report cites "critical infrastructure sectors that are central to the essential operations of the U.S. economy and government, including power transmissions, transportation systems, manufacturing industries, construction, and others." Keeping a viable industrial base Wayne Ranick, spokesman for the United Steelworkers labor union, said he has no quarrel with the Defense Department’s 3 percent calculation. However, he argued -- as the Commerce Department did -- that "to sustain that 3 percent, there must be viable U.S. aluminum and steel mills." Ongoing viability, Ranick said, requires operating at 80 percent capacity. "Mills that have so few orders that they must operate at less than 80 percent capacity shut down sections, lay off workers and lose money," he said. "When too much money is lost, the company goes bankrupt and the mill closes." He pointed to findings by the Commerce Department that there’s only one company left in the United States that produces the Navy armor plate used to build the Virginia Class Submarines, and that only one smelter produces the high-purity aluminum required for defense aerospace needs. Skeptics, however, see this argument as industry concerns masquerading as national security concerns. "Steel and aluminum are widely traded commodities in international markets, and the U.S. has ample production capacity to satisfy its defense needs," said Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which generally has a free-trade bent. "The case for tariffs made by the Commerce Department is that other countries underprice steel and aluminum, hurting U.S. production. This is not a national security argument." Impacts not considered Critics of the tariffs say they can cause at least as many national security headaches as they solve. For instance, the tariff issue has already irked U.S. allies whose assistance is needed in countless military and diplomatic situations across the globe. Those allies also tend to be valued customers for the U.S. defense sector, which has a sizable trade surplus with the rest of the world. "When relations overall are good, we export quite a lot of military equipment to allies and partners," said Remy Nathan, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association. Because a lot of that business come from maintenance, repair and spare parts of U.S.-made military items, this is "the gift that keeps on giving." There’s also a concern that the tariffs could kick off a global trade war, with unknown but potentially significant impacts on the availability of other inputs needed by the U.S. military, not to mention the economy at large. A Bloomberg article noted that access to solid rocket fuel is a commodity that should be much more worrisome for the United States than either steel or aluminum. In the meantime, the decision to justify the tariffs based on national security could embolden other countries to impose trade barriers of their own on the basis of "national security," with negative impacts for the United States. In addition, while the tariffs would likely aid domestic producers of aluminum and steel, they would presumably raise prices for companies that turn those raw materials into finished products, and this could hurt national security as well. This is especially acute for companies that sell both to private sector companies and the Pentagon, Nathan said. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said that American aluminum and steel "are vital to our national security. ... They are the bedrock of our defense industrial base." Military purchases account for a small fraction of U.S. production for both metals, to say nothing of foreign imports. Critics add that the tariffs could have negative impacts on national security that aren’t taken into account by the White House or Commerce Department. Bolstering Trump’s point, however, the 1962 law used as justification for the tariffs specifically allows a more expansive definition that adds far-reaching critical infrastructure to specific military activities.

pomt-02852	Medicare Part D "was far more expensive than the Affordable Care Act and unlike" the act, "was never budgeted."	/texas/statements/2013/nov/18/facebook-posts/obamacare-law-was-funded-and-expected-save-billion/	"Obamacare? Expensive?" says a photo-quotation mashup that a reader sent us on Facebook. Beneath a photo of President George W. Bush making a face, the caption reads, "Bush’s Medicare D was far more expensive than the Affordable Care Act, and, unlike the ACA, was never budgeted." The Facebook-shared image is unattributed, but its caption tracks word-for-word with an Oct. 18, 2013, tweet and blog post by writer and pundit Andrew Sullivan. Sullivan’s post doesn’t elaborate on Part D -- Medicare’s prescription drug program, created in 2003. But others have made similar comparisons. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in a Dec. 29, 2009, New York Times blog entry about "the trouble Republicans have been having as they try to explain why, if they consider the fully-funded, deficit-reducing Democratic health care reform unaffordable, they voted for the completely unfunded Medicare drug benefit six years ago." Did Congress "budget" enough for the promises made under the Obamacare law but not those in Medicare Part D -- and was Part D "far more expensive"? ‘Budgeted’ Via email, Krugman told us, "Not sure about what ‘never budgeted’ means, or exactly how ‘more expensive’ is defined. But the ACA designated cost savings and revenues to pay for the outlays; Part D just specified outlays with no offset." Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization), told us by email, "It's certainly true that the ACA was funded while Medicare Part D was not." Part D is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for senior citizens on Medicare. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them. Obamacare requires Americans to buy health insurance, extends Medicare to cover more people and makes numerous other changes. Auerbach said, "The ACA was funded in the sense that taxes were increased to pay for the estimated expenditure cost. Medicare Part D provided a new benefit with a substantial long-run cost... and did not raise any taxes." Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us by email, "Medicare Part D was always coming out of general revenues (unlike most of the rest of Medicare)," because the federal deficit was a less prominent concern at the time, "whereas ACA/Obamacare was drafted in a more deficit-conscious era." Ellis’ group, based in Washington, D.C., describes itself as a nonpartisan watchdog advocating more transparency and less waste in government spending. In a Nov. 3, 2013, fact-check, PolitiFact summed up tax increases in the Obamacare law, aside from the penalty Americans will pay if they don’t have approved health insurance: Medicare payroll taxes for the wealthy, investment income taxes and others on insurance companies, the health care industry and more are included. Other provisions are intended to push Medicare costs down. Medicare Part D wasn’t "funded" in that a source of money was not created or dedicated to offset all its costs -- say, a tax increase or other funding mechanism. Medicare trustees’ March 23, 2004, report explained Part D would be financed with general revenue (mostly federal income taxes) plus the enrollees’ premium payments and some money from the states. Because the premium amounts and the amount of general revenue would be reset each year, they could be adjusted to cover anticipated costs, the report said: "Thus, Part D income will automatically track Part D expenditures fairly closely." Which cost(s) more? Part D and Obamacare are intended to extend into the future. How does one measure the cost of such efforts? One way is to look at projected costs over a 10-year span, as PolitiFact Virginia did in a Dec. 7, 2010, fact-check. Which 10-year span? The photo-quotation that touched off this story gave no context. First we looked at the cost estimates available to members of Congress when they voted. On Nov. 20, 2003, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Part D’s gross cost would total $409.8 billion from 2004 through 2013. The net cost of the entire Medicare Modernization Act, including Part D and expected revenue increases, was given as $394.3 billion ($501 billion in today’s dollars). On March 18, 2010, the CBO and Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Obamacare law’s net effect would be to save the government -- that is, reduce the federal deficit -- $138 billion from 2010 through 2019 ($148 billion in today’s dollars). Later estimates have varied, and realities are also kicking in. PolitiFact found in a June 15, 2011, fact-check that Medicare Part D costs were coming in 28 percent to 40 percent lower than projected by the CBO in 2003. Among the reasons: Fewer people than expected used the program and expiring patents made some name-brand drugs cheaper. The Obamacare law isn’t fully implemented yet, but Ellis said, "The tricky thing about the ACA/Obamacare is that it counts on a lot of moving parts and a lot of assumptions to get to the savings number. If things don’t work out as planned, it won’t be a deficit reducer… whereas after nearly a decade we know what Medicare Part D cost." Bob Moffit, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Center for Health Policy Studies, pointed out by phone that the Medicare trustees have expressed doubt that Congress will leave its cost-reducing measures in place -- particularly the "sustainable growth rate" formula meant to lower Medicare payments to doctors. The Medicare trustees’ May 31, 2013, report said, "At a minimum, readers should not assume that the SGR-related payment rate reductions will take place." That report’s forecasts included a prediction that Part D’s general revenue outlays from 2013 through 2022 could total $852 billion but, the trustees wrote, "Medicare’s actual future costs are highly uncertain and are likely to exceed those shown by the current-law projections in this report." As for the Obamacare law, the CBO said in a May 14, 2013, blog post that its most recent prediction of the act’s total budget impact was a July 24, 2012, estimate that repealing the law could raise the federal deficit by $109 billion ($111 billion in 2013 dollars) from 2013 through 2022. But "projections of the effects of the ACA" are "highly uncertain," the CBO warned, with other factors including the law’s overall effect on the nation’s health systems and the Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of expanding Medicaid eligibility. The law had required states to widen Medicaid access. Krugman gives a different measure in his late-2009 blog entry: "According to the Medicare trustees, Part D created a $9.4 trillion unfunded liability over the next 75 years." The trustees’ 2013 report updated that estimate to $9.2 trillion for 2013-2087. A June 17, 2013, PolitiFact Virginia fact-check showed that January 2013 Government Accountability Office estimates of the Obamacare law’s cost over 75 years could result in two scenarios: It could raise the national debt $6.2 trillion if its cost containment measures were phased out, or it could save the government $13.3 trillion if it works as intended. A GAO analyst said the report did not say whether one outcome or the other is more likely. Our ruling The image shared on Facebook said, "Bush’s Medicare D was far more expensive than the Affordable Care Act, and, unlike the ACA, was never budgeted." It’s a vague claim without context. Looking for a reasonable way to evaluate it, we found the Obamacare law was "funded" and Part D "unfunded" and that, using estimated 10-year costs at inception, the former was projected to save $148 billion and the latter to cost something under $501 billion (in 2013 dollars).

pomt-14966	"You wonder why you don't see Rand Paul as much; he's still shopping for his billionaire. He's like the only one who hasn't found a billionaire to fund his super PAC."	/missouri/statements/2015/oct/20/claire-mccaskill/campaign-finances-more-complicated-claire-mccaskil/	Sen. Claire McCaskill has noticed Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul’s recent drop in the polls, and she thinks she knows why. Paul hasn’t found a financier to bankroll his campaign, she told Bill Maher on his Aug. 21 show. In fact, she said the Kentucky Republican is the only GOP presidential candidate "who hasn’t found his billionaire to fund his super PAC." "You wonder why you don't see Rand Paul as much; he's still shopping for his billionaire," McCaskill said. "He's like the only one who hasn't found a billionaire to fund his super PAC." With the importance money will play in the 2016 presidential race, we wonder if Paul is the only GOP candidate without a wealthy backer. We reached out to McCaskill for evidence, but her office did not respond. Paul’s big backers McCaskill used the word "billionaire," which is certainly an exclusive club. The problem is there is no easy way to determine who’s a billionaire versus, say, a super-rich millionaire. That’s part of how Donald Trump can say his net worth is $8.7 billion while others peg the number at about $3 billion. Also, it’s important to note that the presidential candidates don't have super PACs because, legally, super PACs and candidates cannot work together, said MU economics professor Jeffrey Milyo. "The senator’s comment is misleading about the nature of the law, but that sort of sloppiness is very common, in part because the issues are somewhat complex, and in part because it serves the purpose of the speaker," Milyo said in an email. Logistics and legalities aside, at the heart of McCaskill's claim is the suggestion that no wealthy supporters have stepped up to support Paul in a big way. That’s not correct. Campaign finance records compiled by OpenSecrets.orgshow that on June 19, Jeff Yass gave $1 million to America's Liberty, a super PAC that supports Paul. He also has given $250,000 to Concerned American Voters, another super PAC that supports Paul. Yass is the founder of Susquehanna International Group, a privately held global trading firm. Yass is rich. How rich is unclear. Reuters described Yass as a billionaire in a June story about campaign giving.PhillyMag.com described Yass as Paul’s "(very) rich friend in Philadelphia." Yass doesn’t make Forbes’ 400, but that list includes people with net worths of $1.7 billion or more. Paul has another wealthy backer in Scott Banister, a self-described capitalist who sits on the board of directors for multiple companies. Scott and his wife, Cyan, have served as angel investors for almost 100 companies, including Zappos, according to Fortune. Banister has given a combined $1.2 million to Concerned American Voters. In all, $5 million has been raised for the two super PACs that support Rand Paul. In comparison, Right to Rise, a super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has a war chest of more than $100 million. Is Banister a billionaire? Again, we don’t know for certain. The other candidates So Paul does have the support of some wealthy donors. And Yass has been described as a billionaire. What about the rest of the crowded GOP field? We found three who don’t appear to have the backing of someone who can write a big check. PACs supporting former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Virginia Gov. James Gilmore haven't broken the $1 million mark and haven't received significant help from one donor in particular, Federal Election Commission filings show. Security is Strength, a super PAC that supports Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., lists $500,000 donations from billionairesRobert McNair and Ronald Perelman. Former Arkansas Gov.Mike Huckabee’s super PAC has relied heavily on the support of Ronald Cameron, who donated $3 million, according to OpenSecrets.org. Steve Wynn has supported New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; T. Boone Pickens is helping Bush; and Robert Mercer is with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, according to FEC filings. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has been helped out by Larry Ellison and Norman Braman. Donald Trump has, well, himself. And Republicans aren’t the only ones who have support from wealthy donors. Seven people have given $1 million to the super PAC supporting Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according toOpenSecrets.org. Yet, the numbers don't tell the whole story. As MU political science professor Marvin Overby points out, candidates have been well-funded in past election cycles, but they still failed to secure the nomination. "A wealthy donor, like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, can make a candidate, like Newt Gingrich in 2012, more viable for a longer period of time," Overby said. "But there are reasons Gingrich didn’t get the GOP nomination: Despite a wealthy backer, he was the wrong candidate, with the wrong message, and a troubled organization." Our ruling McCaskill said Paul’s failure to gain traction in the crowded GOP field may have something to do with the fact that Paul is the only candidate to have not found his billionaire. There are two problems with this statement. There are candidates running for president who don’t have a billionaire, and Paul has a reported billionaire backer in Yass. We rate McCaskill’s statement False.	None	Claire McCaskill	None	None	None	2015-10-20T15:19:40	2015-08-21	['Rand_Paul']
pomt-06146	"Rhode Island is leading our nation in foreclosures."	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/20/theresa-price/rhode-island-activist-says-state-has-highest-rate-/	There's no doubt that Rhode Island's economy is in rough shape, and one element of that problem is the number of people poised to lose their homes because they can't make their mortgage payments. During a Dec. 10, State House rally to highlight the plight of the homeless, and some legislative proposals to relieve it, Theresa Price, a board member of Direct Action for Rights and Equality (DARE), complained about the number of evictions caused by banks taking over properties. "Rhode Island is leading our nation in foreclosures," she said. Two days after the rally, Jim Ryczek, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, sent us an unsolicited e-mail saying Price had misspoke. "Rhode Island ranks highest in New England in both foreclosure starts and serious delinquencies, not the entire nation. We did not mean to claim the lead for the entire U.S." That sentiment was echoed by Christopher Rotondo, a DARE organizer, when we called to get the source of Price’s numbers. Price did not respond to repeated requests for a comment. We decided we needed to get the facts ourselves. We found earlier numbers on various websites confirming that Rhode Island isn't at the top of the list. But we weren't sure if they were the latest numbers. The Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade association that releases quarterly statistics from more than 120 real estate companies that submit delinquency and foreclosure counts, sent us its latest numbers from July through September 2011. They reported: * 4.27 percent of Rhode Island's housing units are in the foreclosure process. Rhode Island ranks 12th, not first. Connecticut (4.8 percent) and Maine (5.7 percent) rank even higher. Florida, at 14.5 percent, is at the top of the list. * 1.66 percent of the state's housing units entered the foreclosure process during the third quarter of 2011. Here, we had the dubious distinction of being tops in New England and fourth in the nation. Only three other states -- Arizona (1.67 percent), Florida (1.96 percent) and Nevada (2.48 percent) -- had higher rates. * 8.48 percent of the state's housing units are owned by people who are at least one payment behind on their mortgage. Rhode Island ranks 19th by that measure, the worst in New England. Mississippi, at 13.2 percent, is number one. We also checked with RealtyTrac, an online marketplace for foreclosed properties. It reported on Dec. 15 that, in November, one in every 954 Rhode Island units had been the subject of a foreclosure filing, putting us 21st in the nation for the second month in a row. In New England, New Hampshire had a worse rate - 1 in 735. Rhode Island fares better than the national average of 1 in 579. Different organizations collect their numbers differently, warned Brenda Clement, executive director of the Housing Action Coalition of Rhode Island. Nonetheless, "Rhode Island has, from the very start of this foreclosure mess, consistently ranked in the top ten and usually in the top five across the country in terms of foreclosures and highest in New England," Clement said. Our ruling In the push to rally support for legislation to fight homelessness, DARE official Theresa Price said, "Rhode Island is leading our nation in foreclosures." Clearly that's not the case. Other states consistently have worse rates when it comes to foreclosures, although Rhode Island's -- whether you look at new foreclosures, ongoing foreclosures or delinquent payments -- are well above the national average. If Price had said we lead New England, that statement would not have been clearly true either. Depending on how the data are collected, people in other nearby states may face a greater foreclosure threat. Ryczek, of the Coalition for the Homeless, gave a more accurate characterization of the New England figures after the fact. But, in her speech to hundreds of people outside the State House, Price wasn’t talking about New England. She was talking about the United States. Her fallacious foreclosure factoid is False.

"You begin to get in a situation where the interest payments on the debt become unsustainable, the debt becomes unsustainable, and there's a lot of uncertainty. There's uncertainty now about the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, the impact that'll have on the economy, the impact on health care, the Obamacare spending, what impact that will have, possible cap and trade. And people are just sitting on the sidelines saying, 'Where does this end?'" said Daniel Senor, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Bush administration official. To demonstrate his point, Senor brought up Japan as an example of a country whose debt is unsustainable. "I mean, if you look at just the interest payments alone that the Japanese government pays, it accounts for 25 percent -- the interest on its own debt, 25 percent of its national budget," said Senor. That comment caught the attention of Paul Krugman, a Princeton economist who was also at the round-table. "That's just not right," objected Krugman. Jake Tapper, the show host, moved the argument along, but not before inviting PolitiFact to act as an objective judge. So we decided to investigate. We'll leave the debate about Japan's financial stability to economists, however, and focus on the numbers. Is a quarter of Japan's budget going solely to the interest payments on its debt? The details of Japan's fiscal condition are nicely summarized in a document put out by the Japan Ministry of Finance in February 2010. Page two of the report indicates that Japan spends 22.4 percent of its budget on "national debt servicing." Debt servicing consists of interest rate payments and bond redemption, which is essentially a repayment of the loan principal. Looking at interest rate expenses alone, that percentage is 10.6 percent. One can also look at the percentage as compared with the budget that does not include debt-related expenditures. That works out to 13.7 percent. Either way, Senor was off by a significant amount. We checked with Senor, who told us that even if we go with the 13.7 percent, his broader point stands -- Japan's debt is not sustainable. As we said before, that's a mess we'll leave to the economists. Our goal was to see if Senor was using the correct figures, and we found that he wasn't. Even if we go with the higher of the two figures, Senor missed the target by nearly half. For that, we give him a False.	None	Daniel Senor	None	None	None	2010-07-06T18:14:58	2010-07-04	['Japan']
pomt-10351	U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan include a "few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/11/john-mccain/thousands-of-green-card-soldiers-in-iraq/	Update: We originally addressed this when it was released as a web ad on Memorial Day. On July 11, the McCain campaign released the same video as a national television ad. Because it will be new to many people seeing it for the first time on television, we decided to re-post the item. In a Web ad released on Memorial Day, Sen. John McCain praises the many Hispanic soldiers serving in the U.S. military, some of whom are not yet legal citizens of the United States. "My friends, I want you, the next time you're down in Washington, D.C., to go to the Vietnam War Memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite," McCain begins. "You'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names. "When you go to Iraq or Afghanistan today, you're going to see a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background. "You're even going to meet some of the few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country, who love this country so much that they're willing to risk their lives in its service in order to accelerate their path to citizenship and enjoy the bountiful, blessed nation. "So let's, from time to time, remember that these are God's children. They must come into this country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them." We checked with the Defense Department to see how many noncitizens are serving in the U.S. military, and if McCain was accurate that there are thousands serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. The short answer is that McCain is right. As of Feb. 29, 2008, there were 20,328 noncitizens on active duty in the military (about 1.5 percent of the entire active military), according to a report provided by the Pentagon. Of those, 4,112 were serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, or in support of those operations elsewhere. There were another 2,236 whose citizenship was "unknown." These are legal residents with green cards who have not yet become naturalized citizens. There are citizenship incentives for those who enlist. All immigrants who serve honorably in the military during wartime are eligible to file for immediate citizenship under special wartime provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. An analysis of the Pentagon report by PolitiFact determined that about a quarter of the "green card" soldiers are originally from Spanish-speaking countries. In addition, there are 10,533 naturalized citizens serving in the military who were born in Spanish-speaking countries. The thousands of noncitizens serving in Iraq and Afghanistan is one of the military's little-known facts. But apparently not to McCain. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06426	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s "actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs."	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/24/brett-hulsey/gop-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-killed-15000-jobs-d/	On the day Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker held a forum n creating jobs, state Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, tried to steal some of his thunder. Hulsey sent a tweet, made himself available to reporters and issued a news release on Oct. 18, 2011, all to highlight his view of Walker’s record on jobs. In the news release, Hulsey declared: "Governor Walker’s actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs." That’s an ear-catching claim. It would mean that Walker -- who promised to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term -- not only presided over a period of staggering job losses, but in effect took out 15,000 of them himself. Hulsey cited five sources to back up his claim -- three are estimates and two use hard numbers. We’ll start with the estimates. 1. Think tank estimate: 9,900 jobs Hulsey’s news release cited a February 2011 report on Walker’s 2009-2011 budget-repair bill by the Institute for Wisconsin’s Future, a liberal research and advocacy group based in suburban Milwaukee. The bill, which led to unprecedented public protests in Madison because it curbed collective bargaining rights, made public employees pay more for their pensions and health insurance. The institute said the higher benefit payments would reduce the public workers’ take-home pay and thus, their spending power, eventually leading to the elimination of 9,900 private-sector jobs. So, these are not jobs already lost, but potential losses that would have begun since Walker signed the bill into law in March 2011. Jack Norman, the institute’s research director, provided this example: If a typical state worker now takes home $70 per week less in pay because of higher payments toward pensions and health care, the worker might decide not to buy a ladder from the hardware store one week, not to buy a child’s coat from the department store the next and to postpone a dentist appointment the following week. Over time, he said, that worker’s reduced purchasing power means less income for those businesses, which eventually will reduce their work forces. Norman said the institute has been revising its projections, and now estimates 16,000 jobs will be lost over the course of one year because of the budget-repair bill and because of spending cuts Walker made in his 2011-2013 state budget. We should note that while both budget measures were proposed by Walker, they needed to be adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature to become law. Norman said the job-loss estimates were made using "economic modeling software" called IMPLAN. We found that IMPLAN is used by consultants, university researchers and government agencies to make various economic projections. When we asked Hulsey if he had other evidence to back the 9,900 lost jobs part of his claim, he cited a March 2011 news article on a similar estimate made by University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Steven Deller. According to the article, Deller said 21,843 jobs would be lost within two years because of the budget-repair bill and Walker’s budget proposal. Like Norman, Deller cited reduced spending from public workers and public agencies that he said would result from Walker’s two budget measures. But that’s a narrow view of the economy. We asked Thomas Miller, resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., about estimating job losses in this way. "You can’t wall off one limited portion of the population and decide that whatever is done to them is good or bad," he said. Miller said the economy is affected by many factors, including the finances of state government. Walker essentially reallocated some of the state government’s resources by having employees pay a larger share of their benefits. In the big picture, he said, such a move, among other factors, could help employment. So, Hulsey relies on predictive estimates in claiming that those moves will eventually kill 9,900 jobs. But there simply isn’t evidence that Walker’s actions, as Hulsey claims, are "directly responsible" for that many jobs being eliminated. 2. Train construction estimate: 2,300 jobs Hulsey cited a November 2010 memo from the Wisconsin Legislature Fiscal Bureau that estimated the number of jobs that would have been created in connection with construction of a high-speed rail project between Milwaukee and Madison. The next month, the federal government pulled funding for the project after Walker, who had not yet been inaugurated, expressed his opposition to it. The memo, however, does not use the 2,300 figure and did not estimate jobs, per se. Rather, as we reported in a December 2010 PolitiFact item, the memo estimated that over six years, the rail line construction itself plus economic activity generated by it would create a certain number of jobs’ worth of work each year. That figure ranged from 250 to 5,535 per year. It should be noted that -- like the study of the potential jobs lost due to pension and health changes -- this looked at only one side of the picture. As we noted in another PolitiFact item, the estimates don’t take into account jobs that might have been lost due to more people riding trains and fewer using cars or other modes of transportation. So the advertised increase, on a net basis, may have been less. But there is some ground for Hulsey saying that Walker prevented roughly 2,300 jobs from being created by blocking the train project. It’s certainly true that a certain number of jobs would have been created to build the line itself, and Hulsey’s figure is within the range of credible estimates. 3. Wind-energy estimate: 950 jobs Hulsey cited comments by Denise Bode, chief executive officer of the American Wind Energy Association lobbying organization, in a January 2011 news article. Speaking about a bill proposed by Walker that would limit where wind turbines could be located, she said the measure would shut down 12 planned wind farm projects that could produce about 950 full-time jobs for one year. Since Walker introduced the bill, some of the 12 projects have been canceled while others remain on hold as Walker attempts to work out a compromise measure. So, there is evidence that Walker’s action prevented at least some jobs from being created. But Hulsey assumes that all 950 jobs -- which were projected, not certain -- will never be created and that is still an open question. Now, let’s go to the sources that used hard numbers: 1. State government positions: 1,030 jobs Hulsey cited a July 2011 fiscal bureau memo that said Walker’s 2011-2013 budget reduced the number of full-time-equivalent positions in state government by 1,032. That’s a firm figure. But it’s not what it might appear to be. Bob Lang, director of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, told us: "I would not portray these 1,000 (positions) as people who got laid off." Rather, he said, the budget eliminated authorized positions that theoretically could have been filled -- but many had been vacant for a year or more and the budget ordered that they be taken off the books. So, it’s not clear that anyone lost a job because of this Walker maneuver -- and in any case, certainly nowhere near 1,000 jobs were killed. 2. School layoffs: 1,000 jobs Hulsey cited news reports of the layoffs of teachers and other educational staff in Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha and Germantown, all in southeastern Wisconsin, and in Wisconsin Heights, northwest of Madison. The articles reported a total of roughly 1,000 layoffs in those school districts. Hulsey said he attributes all the layoffs to nearly $800 million in reduced state aid to schools in Walker-proposed and the Legislature-adopted budget. But again, it’s not that simple. In the article Hulsey cited about 519 layoffs -- including 354 teachers -- at Milwaukee Public Schools, the MPS superintendent said the layoffs were the result of a number of budgetary factors, not just the reduction of state aid. Moreover, MPS had laid off 482 educators in June 2010, five months before Walker was elected, which indicates that other factors trigger layoffs. Similarly, the article Hulsey cited that reported the Kenosha layoffs said the layoffs were the result of federal and state budget cuts as well as a previously-negotiated increase in staff pay. So, while Walker’s budget was a factor in some teachers losing their jobs, Hulsey cannot back his claim that 1,000 school layoffs all were caused by Walker. OK, what’s the final assessment? Hulsey said Walker’s "actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs." Two-thirds of his claim is based on estimates of the effect of reduced spending by government employees and government agencies as a result of budget actions taken by Walker. The estimates, however, don’t tie the spending reductions to actual job losses and take a very narrow -- some would say wrongheaded -- view of how the economy works. Hulsey’s claims of perhaps a few thousand jobs not being created because of actions taken by Walker regarding high-speed rail and wind energy have some merit. But his claim that the state budget killed 1,000 jobs appears to be off altogether. In sum, Hulsey isn’t close to demonstrating that actions taken by Walker are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs. We rate his statement False.

pomt-15222	"The Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won women since 1988."	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/09/heather-mcghee/republican-presidential-nominee-hasnt-won-over-wom/	Personal attacks against Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly may have cost Donald Trump an invite to an influential conservative powwow, but a prominent progressive activist says "batting away" the frontrunner’s misogyny will do little to help the GOP. Heather McGhee, president of the liberal economic think tank Demos, said on Meet the Press that the Republican Party has both institutional and structural biases against women. "I think it’s important to remember the Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won women since 1988, so this is a very deep problem for the party," McGhee said Aug. 9, 2015. "It’s not going to be enough for anyone, a commentator or one of the candidates, to just disavow Trump’s sort of interpersonal sexist comments." We were curious about McGhee’s 1988 statistic. Is it true that no GOP nominee candidate in almost three decades has earned more support from women than the Democratic nominee? McGhee pointed us to an article published Aug. 7, 2015, in the New York Times. Even though the article repeats the statistic without citing a source, we found several datasets that corroborate the claim with slightly different numbers. To be clear, the source of the information is surveys of voters, and includes exit polling data, so it's not an official record. But the surveys are widely cited as the best data available. In 1988, Republican nominee George H.W. Bush received a single percentage point more of female votes (at 50 percent) than Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, according to research by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Since then, no GOP candidate has "won" the women’s vote. Women overall have had a higher voter turnout than men in every presidential election for 35 years, almost always favoring liberal candidates. Their allegiance to the Democratic party is reflected in congressional races as well. Barack Obama earned 56 percent of women’s votes in 2008 — one of the highest shares of female voters ever — and 55 percent in 2012. Why do more women vote for Democrats? Aside from more women simply identifying as Democrats than men, women are also more likely to favor left-leaning policies of more government assistance for poor Americans, children and the elderly; providing better access to contraceptives and reproductive health; and protecting the environment, according to the Pew Research Center. Other factors include the rise of the powerful pro-choice PAC Emily’s List in the 1980s and 1990s and the controversy over Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, added Karen O’Connor, a professor of political science at American University's Women & Politics Institute. "Women were very angry," O’Connor said of the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee’s questioning of Thomas’ former employee, Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment. The partisan gap has solidified in recent years, but experts say the female vote began to align with Democrats in 1980, eight years before Bush won a slight majority of female voters. Kelly Dittmar of Rutgers’ Center for American Women and Politics lists the feminist movement, increased participation in the labor force, and greater reliance on government programs as reasons for the shift. At the same time, men have shifted right, she said. Women generally favored GOP candidates from the suffrage movement in 1919 through the 1950s. Republican President Herbert Hoover was known as "the woman's candidate" in 1928, according to feminist scholar Jo Freeman. Democratic presidential candidates lost the female vote by double digits in 1952 and 1956, according to Gallup data. "Early on, white upper-class women were Republicans," explained O’Connor. Then came the 1960s, with both parties responding to the feminist movement. The era of bipartisanship was reflected in the presidential elections, with Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson and Republican Richard Nixon each receiving substantial majorities of female votes. By the late 1970s, however, the political divide in women’s votes resurfaced and changed course. Christina Wolbrecht, a professor who studies gender and politics at the University of Notre Dame, points to a specific watershed moment: the 1980 Republican convention, when the party for the first time refused to endorse the Equal Rights Amendment. "By the early 1980s, the two parties stood on opposing sides of the debate over women’s rights," Wolbrecht wrote in The Politics of Women’s Rights. Not that the GOP wasn’t aware of the divide. In his first term as president, Ronald Reagan responded by enacting policies that appealed to women. "Reagan supported things like tax credits for child care and individual retirement accounts for homemakers, and the White House Working Group for Women was created in 1983," said Dittmar of Rutgers. "He also appointed some women to high-profile posts (such as) Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court." In his 1984 re-election, Reagan beat Walter Mondale and his female vice presidential pick with 56 percent of women supporting him. The experts said women are more driven by party lines than female candidates, which will make it hard for Republicans to upend the trend in 2016. Our rating McGhee said, "The Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won women since 1988." The data, based on surveys of voters, backs her up. George H.W. Bush won his 1988 election campaign with just 1 percentage point more of female votes than his Democratic opponent. No Republican has "won" the fight for more women’s votes since. We rate McGhee’s claim True.	None	Heather McGhee	None	None	None	2015-08-09T18:47:23	2015-08-09	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03467	Says the success of his economic agenda is supported by the fact "we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower."	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/16/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-success-office-reflected-2-point/	Gov. Scott Walker has long emphasized falling unemployment rates as evidence that Wisconsin’s sluggish job growth is heading in the right direction. In his January 2013 "state of the state" speech, Walker highlighted the decline from 7.8 percent unemployment the month before he took office in January 2011 to the 6.7 percent figure for December 2012. Now, with the recent uptick to 7.1 percent unemployment in the first quarter of 2013, Walker has reworked his message. Asked by host Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s Upfront show about Democrats criticizing him for focusing on a potential presidential bid instead of the governorship, Walker replied: "They can’t argue with the success. We went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower. The deficit was $3.6 billion when I took office. We now have a half a billion dollar surplus." Let’s take a look at the new talking point on the unemployment rate. Walker says the success of his economic agenda is supported by the fact that "we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower." Is he right? According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures from monthly household surveys, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate peaked as the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009. That peak -- 9.2 percent -- is the figure Walker selected as a four-year comparison point. And it did fall 2.1 points in that time, so the numbers are accurate. But the statement is complicated by other factors, especially the phrase "when I decided to run." The unemployment rate was surging up in late 2008 and early 2009, so the timing makes a big difference. For instance, Walker officially announced his long-expected candidacy in spring 2009. The most recent unemployment figure at the time was 8.4 percent. But news reports as far back as August 2008 described Walker as "expected" to run. The latest unemployment rate at that time was 4.7 percent. When we asked Team Walker for backup, spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster said, "he is not referring to the specific moment he decided to run, but generally to the climate during the time he decided to run four years ago." Doyle and Walker Then there’s the issue of who gets credit for the drop from 2009 to 2013; Walker couched the two-point decline as part of "the success" he can point to as governor. Here’s the timeline: -- From its 9.2 percent peak in June-July 2009, the rate fell almost monthly during the late stages of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s second term, dropping 1.4 points to the 7.8 percent mark in December 2010 when Doyle left office. So exactly two-thirds of the drop Walker mentions happened on his predecessor’s watch. -- After Walker took office in January 2011, the rate ticked down but was essentially flat for nine months before falling slowly to 6.7. Then it reversed course early in 2013, taking some of the luster off the positive trend. That left the total drop during Walker’s time at 0.7 points. So one-third of the drop compared to four years ago came during Walker’s administration. We asked Webster about this, and she responded in an email: "The Governor was providing a frame of reference for where we were and where we are now." A bit of perspective, before we wrap up. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is lower than the national figure (7.1 vs. 7.6 percent). Among seven Midwest states, Wisconsin trails far behind Iowa (4.7) and Minnesota (5.3), but is well ahead of Illinois (9.3), Indiana (8.5) and Michigan (8.4). Wisconsin is fourth of the seven states in improvement in the unemployment rate since the month Walker took office in 2011. Our rating Walker said the success of his agenda is supported by the fact that "we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower." Walker’s numbers are on target if you go back "four years." But he muddies the waters by describing that as when he "decided to run" -- and that skews the picture when it comes to improvement. His decision came at an earlier date, when the unemployment rate was either much lower (at the time of his official announcement) or even lower than that (when he was unofficially running). Finally, the construction of the claim is misleading in part on the issue of who gets credit for the improvement. He discloses that he’s going back in time before he was governor but omits Doyle’s record and claims the "success" as his, glossing over the fact that only one-third of the gains took place on his watch. There’s an element of truth here, but critical facts are left out. That’s why we’re rating his statement Mostly False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-06-16T06:00:00	2013-06-16	['None']
pomt-02672	"Crime in Atlanta is down 18 percent since 2009."	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/10/atlanta-police-foundation/police-foundation-target/	Just in time for the Christmas holidays, people who give their time and money to help the Atlanta Police Department received good news in the mail. A flier from the nonprofit Atlanta Police Foundation arrived with this impressive headline: "Crime in Atlanta is down 18 percent since 2009." That is something to feel good about. But is it true? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look deeper into the foundation’s claim, especially given that, at several times during the year, residents have been rattled by -- and outspoken about -- high-profile neighborhood crimes. To make the claim of an 18 percent drop in crime, the foundation compared crime data in the first 45 weeks of 2009 against data for the same 45 weeks in 2013. The foundation focused on what are known as Part 1, or major, crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto thefts. The foundation pulled straight from records of the Atlanta Police Department, which show: 2009 2013 % difference Murders 72 70 -3 Rapes 95 93 -2 Robberies 2209 2020 -9 Aggravated assaults 2302 1970 -14 Burglaries 7654 5010 -35 Larcenies from auto 9447 7988 -15 Other larcenies 7191 6902 -4 Auto thefts 4898 3867 -21 All Part 1 offenses 33,868 27,920 -18 The 18 percent decline was calculated by taking the Part 1 offenses for 2009, subtract the Part 1 offenses from 2013, then divide the difference by the Part 1 Offenses in 2009. Step 1) 33,868 - 27,920 = 5,948 Step 2) 5,948/ 33,868 = 0.1756 (rounded to .18 or 18%) Robert R. Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice and director of the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange at Georgia State University’s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said the calculations are "legitimate." This is "one of several ways to calculate what’s happening with crime," he said. "It relies on raw figures, Friedmann said. "If you actually calculate rates, then the decline will be higher than 18 percent since the population has increased." The claim by the foundation, which raised and spent more than $2 million in 2012 to support police department initiatives, was "fair for the purpose it was done for," he said. "I read PolitiFact, and I would rate it as a True," Friedmann said. "I wouldn’t have an issue with it." Jack Levin, the director of the Brudnick Center on Conflict and Violence at Northeastern University, said the Atlanta Police Foundation could have provided its supporters a "clearer picture" of crime in the city had it shown the crime trends from 2009 to 2013, rather than a 45-week-to-45-week comparison. "But using a baseline of 2009, it doesn’t look like they were trying to put one over on the public," Levin said. Homicide rates were the lowest in decades in 2009, so someone wanting to make the city look better would likely have chosen another year to compare with 2013, he said. Had the foundation chosen to compare the 45 weeks of 2013 with the same weeks in 2010, 2011 or 2012, crime also would have been down, but not as much as compared with 2009. The Christmastime flier was sent to supporters "as a reminder of the impact that their donations have had funding critical programs spearheaded by the APF," said Miguel Sepulveda, the foundation’s vice president for communications and director of Crime Stoppers of Greater Atlanta. Earlier this year, the foundation sent supporters a postcard, directing them to a more detailed crime report, Sepulveda said. The recent flier didn’t give the reader any specifics to support the foundation’s claim. "Perhaps, we should do that," Sepulveda said in an email exchange. "We used the first 45 weeks because those were the most current stats available for 2013 at the time the [flier] went to print," he said. Mayor Kasim Reed made crime fighting a topic of his second inaugural address this week. He rated the Police Department’s expansion to 2,000 workers as a first-term milestone and promised to "double-down" efforts to address crime in his second term. Crime has brought the city some unflattering headlines. For instance, Forbes magazine ranked Atlanta as the ninth "most dangerous city" in the nation for 2013, down from sixth in 2012. The magazine creates the annual list by using the FBI's Crime Statistics database screened for cities with populations of 200,000 and higher. Experts generally downplay these rankings, and the FBI specifically warns against using its statistics for city-against-city rankings. But there’s no evidence that the foundation’s flier claim was anything but accurate based on the available data. We rate the statement True.

pomt-15180	"Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine … and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people."	/rhode-island/statements/2015/aug/23/rhode-island-center-freedom-and-prosperity/ri-center-prosperity-freedoms-rails-against-regula/	Rhode Island has issued a controversial vaccination requirement designed to fight HPV, or human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted virus that can cause cancer. The requirement, ordered by the Rhode Island Department of Health, took effect Aug. 1. It has drawn fire from a group of critics that included the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, which calls itself a "free enterprise think tank." The new policy calls for the vaccination of all seventh grade boys and girls before the start of school. The requirement does not apply to students whose doctors cite a medical problem; or to students whose parents object for religious reasons. And the health department defines religious reasons very liberally. Before a series of public information meetings on the vaccination requirement, the Center for Freedom and Prosperity posted this statement on its website: "Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine … and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people." We telephoned Mike Stenhouse, the center’s founder and chief executive officer, and asked him for his sources. We didn’t get anything from him right away. So we did our own research and found that Virginia is the only other state to require students to receive immunization for HPV. Virginia’s vaccination requirement, which is only for sixth-grade girls, took effect in 2008 following an act of the legislature. Rhode Island’s policy is the product of a regulatory process that began in 2013 under the leadership of Michael Fine, then the state’s director of the Department of Health. In both states, HPV vaccination policies use the word "required" and both have opt-out provisions. In Virginia, parents have "sole discretion" on whether their children receive the vaccination. Stenhouse labels the policies in Virginia and Rhode Island as mandates. But Jason L. Schwartz, an assistant professor at the Yale University School of Public Health, says you can’t call policies with such liberal exemptions mandates. The breadth of Rhode Island’s opt-out provisions may not have been clear to the public — or to Stenhouse — before a public meeting Aug. 5. That’s when Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, the new director of the Department of Health, told parents that their philosophical objections would qualify for the religious exemption spelled out in the regulations. But what about the center’s claim that Rhode Island imposed the requirement by "regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people"? And, as the center says later in its policy statement, was the health department’s decision an example of "regulatory despotism" that "bypasses the traditional democratic process"? While it’s true that the General Assembly did not pass a law for the HPV vaccination, existing Rhode Island law gives the health director the power to adopt regulations to protect public health. And, of course, the health director is appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of, the governor. Further, control of health-care policy by the executive branch is common in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, makes decisions affecting the health welfare of the country without first getting an act of Congress. "To say it’s anti-democratic would be a misunderstanding of how we structure our government in the United States," says Schwartz, the Yale professor, who co-authored a recent article about state vaccination requirements for the Journal of the American Medical Association. Also it’s not as if the state adopted the regulation in a back room somewhere — even though Stenhouse’s organization on July 30 described the news of the requirement as a "stunning revelation." On Dec. 2, 2013, Fine, the former health director, filed a notice of public hearing for Jan. 16, 2014, and also solicited written statements on the issue. In response to criticism, the department delayed the beginning of the program from Aug. 1, 2014, to Aug. 1, 2015, according to a form for the regulation that was filed with the Office of Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea. The Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union registered its ardent opposition to the proposed regulation at the hearing and in written comments. On Jan. 27, 2014, the ACLU called on the health department to reconsider the proposal. The ACLU also criticized the requirement on Facebook. That’s seems like debate to us. We tried to get Stenhouse to explain what the center meant by the phrase "regulatory fiat." He declined. Instead, he sent us a written statement in which he said the center "stands by its statement" and he challenged PolitiFact’s fairness and objectivity. Our ruling The center says "Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine … and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people." The center, in its statement, got two things right and two things wrong. It was right about Rhode Island being the second state and it was right that the requirement was not adopted by "the elected representatives of the people." It was wrong when it said the vaccination requirement was imposed "by fiat" and "without public debate." In 2014, the ACLU sharply criticized the vaccine requirement at the public hearing and debated the proposal in social media and on its website. As for acting by fiat, the regulation was put in place through a process established by law. And comments at a public hearing influenced that process, leading to a decision by the director of health to delay execution of the policy for one year. More recently, the new health director told the public that philosophical objections were enough to qualify for the religious exemption. In other words, parents can pretty much say whatever they want to get exemptions for their children. For those reasons, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-12311	"5.7 million -- that’s how many illegal immigrants might have voted" in 2008.	/florida/statements/2017/jun/22/ainsley-earhardt/following-trump-voter-fraud-allegations-claim-57-m/	President Donald Trump’s unfounded allegations that millions voted illegally in 2016 is back in the news, with his supporters pointing to a new analysis that claims millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2008. Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt talked about it on the morning show recently. "5.7 million -- that’s how many illegal immigrants might have voted" in 2008, she said. Her comments referenced an article in the Washington Times, a conservative newspaper. Trump has made repeated claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we’ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again (and we debunked a claim by his spokesman Sean Spicer). The claim made on Fox and Friends is based on an extrapolation of a controversial study that relied on a very small number of responses. Researchers involved in the underlying survey of voters have cautioned against using their data to reach conclusions about noncitizen voters. Study about the 2008 election We emailed a spokeswoman for Fox News and did not get a reply; however, the Washington Times article showed that the information came from Just Facts, a think tank that describes itself as conservative/libertarian and was founded by James D. Agresti, a mechanical engineer in New Jersey. Agresti’s conclusions are based on data from a paper by Old Dominion University researchers who used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, or CCES. He multiplied the findings in that data with U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the noncitizen population to come up with a conclusion about the number of noncitizen voters nationwide. It’s important to note that the CCES researchers have disputed the conclusions Old Dominion researchers reached about noncitizen voters. Here’s how the studies unfolded: In 2008, the CCES surveyed 32,800 adults nationwide online about their political views. Respondents answered at least 100 questions before they made it to the citizenship question, one of the last questions asked. The survey showed that 339 identified themselves as noncitizens -- about 1 percent of the total respondents. Then of the 339 self-identified noncitizens, 39 of those claim to have voted, said Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of the main researchers. That’s 39 respondents out of 32,800 people who are now being used to extrapolate millions of illegal voters. Schaffner has warned that with a subset that small, the responses might be unreliable. "Survey respondents occasionally select the wrong response by accident—perhaps because they are rushing through and not reading the questions carefully, because they do not fully understand the terminology being used, or because they simply click on the wrong box on the page," Schaffner wrote in a Politico magazine article after the November election. Subsequent CCES surveys provide more evidence that some respondents answered the question wrong. There were 20 respondents who identified themselves as citizens in 2010 but then in 2012 changed their answers to indicate that they were noncitizens, which Schaffer said is "highly unrealistic." In 2014, researchers at Old Dominion University used the CCES data in 2008 and 2010, as well as voter records in 2008, to conclude that more than 14 percent of noncitizens indicated that they were registered to vote. Their best guess at the portion of noncitizens who voted was about 6.4 percent, or 1.2 million votes cast. The researchers at CCES (including Schaffner; Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist; and Samantha Luks, managing director of scientific research at YouGov) have criticized the methodology used by Old Dominion. They said it didn’t fully consider the possibility that people responded to the survey inaccurately. "You are ignoring the measurement error in a very small group which is going to inflate those numbers," Schaffner said, "then you assume this is a random sample of all noncitizens in the country, which it probably isn’t." More than 100 political scientists from universities and colleges wrote an open letter in January disputing the Old Dominion paper as evidence for Trump’s claim that millions of noncitizens voted. "In a survey as large as the CCES, even a small rate of response error (where people incorrectly mark the wrong item on a survey) can lead to incorrect conclusions," they wrote. "The scholarly political science community has generally rejected the findings in the Richman et al. study and we believe it should not be cited or used in any debate over fraudulent voting." Jesse Richman, one of the Old Dominion researchers and a political science professor, told PolitiFact he still stands by his research and responded to the criticisms by CCES researchers in a working paper in February. Agresti of Just Facts, the source of the numbers cited on Fox and Friends, used the same data from CCES and Old Dominion and concluded that between 594,000 to 5.7 million noncitizens voted illegally in the 2008 election. Agresti said his number on the high end of his range was higher than Old Dominion because he used different methodology in his calculations. Other research has found small numbers of noncitizen voters Setting aside surveys, another way to find noncitizen voters is to examine state voter records and compare that with data about immigration status. But states have struggled with attempts to do that. Florida tried before the 2012 election and scrapped the effort amid many errors. We interviewed other election experts: Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine; Lorraine Minnite, political science professor at Rutgers University; and Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has tracked voter fraud allegations since 2000. All three rejected Agresti’s conclusions. There have been some instances of noncitizens voting, but actual evidence has shown small numbers among millions of votes cast nationwide. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who co-chairs Trump’s voter fraud commission, has obtained a total of one conviction for noncitizen voting since 2015. North Carolina’s 2016 post-election audit showed a few dozen noncitizen voters out of 4.8 million votes cast. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced in February that since he took office in 2011, he has identified 126 noncitizens who cast ballots. Our ruling Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, "5.7 million -- that’s how many illegal immigrants might have voted" in 2008. The number comes from a conclusion by Just Facts, a conservative/libertarian think tank. Just Facts’ numbers came from a study by Old Dominion University researchers. That study was based on a survey which showed that 39 people out 32,800 claimed to be noncitizens who had voted. Just Facts used data from the study and Census estimates on the noncitizen population to come up with a national figure of noncitizen voters. But other researchers and political scientists have said the small number is not a reliable source of data on noncitizen voters nationwide. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09139	"The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/14/john-boehner/boehner-says-house-has-always-passed-budget-resolu/	On the June 13, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, got into a back-and-forth over how diligent lawmakers have been in passing a budget in recent years. Hoyer said that "the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06," while Boehner claimed "the House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era." With dueling claims like these, we had no choice but to step in and play referee. In this item, we'll look at what Boehner said; in a separate item, we'll look at Hoyer's comment. First, a little background. The budget process used by Congress today was set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Both the Senate and the House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation and other fiscal policy items. This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it. The budget process is distinct from the series of appropriations, or spending, bills that actually allocate money for specific purposes. Unlike the appropriations bills, the budget resolution doesn't carry the force of law. In fact, unlike a law, the budget resolution is not signed by the president after it passes both chambers. If a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can still use parliamentary procedures to proceed to appropriations bills, but the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate. That's why the expected failure of the Democratic House majority to pass a budget for fiscal year 2011 has become a talking point for Republicans. According to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the House has indeed passed a budget every year since the Congressional Budget Act first took effect for fiscal year 1976. So if the House does not pass a budget for fiscal year 2011, it will be the first time since the current rules went into force. However, we should also note that the House has not always been joined by the Senate in passing a budget -- a factor that explains the difference between what Boehner and Hoyer said. Since 1983 -- the first year the House and Senate stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and began passing one per year -- the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, then under Democratic control, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind, and on three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007) the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. Because Congress always works on the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, the Republican Congressional majority failed to pass a finished budget in three years: 1998, 2004 and 2006. So Boehner is correct that the House has always passed a budget resolution, even though on three occasions, it later failed to work out differences with the Senate and pass a final, identical version, and once the Senate, under Democratic control, had no budget resolution. We'll note that caveat, but we don't think his failure to mention that point undermines the accuracy of his statement. So we rate Boehner's statement True.

pomt-11677	Says Sandra Bullock said to Hillary Clinton, "If you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again."	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/04/flash-24-daily/no-sandra-bullock-didnt-disparage-hillary-clinton/	A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isn’t happy with how things are going. "Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,’" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October. While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didn’t include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name. The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her "new film," Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate. At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans. "I don’t agree with that at all," Bullock said. "That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement." The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl. "I would like my rights represented and those of my son — very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them," she says. "When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good." We found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton "if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again." We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-08248	"My debt to GDP was the lowest or one of the lowest of modern presidents. My taxes to GDP was the lowest and my spending to GDP" was too.	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/12/george-w-bush/former-president-george-w-bush-defends-his-fiscal-/	During the tour to promote his presidential memoir, Decision Points, George W. Bush defended his fiscal record in an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show. In the interview, Bush said that the ratio of the deficit to gross domestic product during his time in office "was lower than Ronald Reagan's by half. Lower than my dad's. And only [worse than] Bill Clinton among modern presidents. ... My debt to GDP was the lowest or one of the lowest of modern presidents. My taxes to GDP was the lowest and my spending to GDP" was too. We thought it would be worthwhile to see if Bush was correct. So we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole. The challenge is figuring exactly how to compare recent presidents. Let's start with the deficit. The most obvious way to do it is to add up all of the annual percentages for a president and divide by the number of years served, to produce an average. Calculating it this way -- and beginning our list of "modern" presidents with President Dwight Eisenhower -- we came up with the following order: Eisenhower (deficits averaged 0.53 percent of GDP), Clinton (0.76 percent of GDP), Richard Nixon (0.93 percent), Lyndon Johnson (1.1 percent), George W. Bush (2.0 percent), Jimmy Carter (2.4 percent), George H.W. Bush (3.98 percent), Reagan (4.23 percent). (We excluded John F. Kennedy and Gerald Ford because of their short tenures.) You can do the same with spending and tax receipts. For spending as a percent of GDP, the ranking from low to high is Eisenhower (18.1 percent of GDP), Johnson (18.7 percent), Nixon (19.2 percent), George W. Bush (19.6 percent), Clinton (19.8), Carter (20.8), George H.W. Bush (21.9), and Reagan (22.4). For tax receipts as a percentage of GDP, the ranking from low to high is Eisenhower (17.5 percent of GDP), Johnson and George W. Bush (tied at 17.6 percent), George H.W. Bush (17.9 percent), Reagan (18.2 percent), Nixon (18.3 percent), Carter (18.4 percent) and Clinton (19 percent). Whether Bush is correct depends heavily on which presidents you consider "modern." If you only go back to Reagan -- the earliest president that Bush himself cited by name in the interview -- then Bush is basically correct. Only Clinton did better when measured by deficit as a percentage of GDP, while no president dating back to Reagan scored better on spending or tax receipts as a percentage of GDP. By contrast, if you go back to Eisenhower -- the first fully post-World War II president -- Bush is in the middle of the pack on the deficit and on spending, and he's near the top on tax receipts. But there's another way to look at the deficit -- to compare a president's first deficit as a percentage of GDP to their last. This shows what direction the deficit went during their tenures. And on this one, George W. Bush does the worst of any president dating back to Eisenhower. The younger Bush went from a 1.3 percent surplus to a 3.2 percent deficit, a decline of 4.5 percentage points. The best was Clinton, who moved the deficit from a 3.9 percent deficit to a 2.4 percent surplus -- a positive change of 6.3 percentage points. The other presidents all had changes up or down that were roughly two percentage points or smaller. This suggests that Bush's fiscal record wasn't so sterling if you use a different measure than the one he did. But to analyze the accuracy of his statement, we'll stick closely to the words he used. George W. Bush is correct that he outperformed his father, Reagan and (mostly) Clinton. So if you consider those the "modern" presidents, he's essentially right. If you broaden the "modern presidents" to include those serving in the entire post-World War II period, Bush is about average. While we wouldn't have chosen to define the "modern presidents" to include just the four that Bush mentioned by name, we'll give him some deference in framing the question. So we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	George W. Bush	None	None	None	2010-11-12T19:00:00	2010-11-08	['None']
pomt-14956	"The word progressive ... was created as a substitute for ‘communist’."	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/22/jon-voight/actor-jon-voight-says-progressive-just-another-wor/	Cigar smokers of the world unite. Actor and conservative advocate Jon Voight engaged in a wide-ranging interview for Cigar Afcionado in which he got into the smoke-filled rooms of politics. The magazine released excerpts in advance of publication, and a Fox News website Fox411 wrote about Voight bemoaning how liberals have rebranded themselves. "I think the word ‘progressive’ is a very devious term. It was created as a substitute for ‘communist,’ " he said. "What they propose is the reverse of progress. It’s some that that (sic) does taste of communism and Karl Marx’s pernicious philosophy." We looked into the origins of the word progressive to see if it was created as a ruse to mask communistic thinking. What we found is quite the opposite. The progressive platform emerged as way to thwart the growth of nascent American socialist or communist movements. The birth of the progressive movement The progressive label showed up in the first decade of the 20th century. The Library of Congress describes the progressives as those who "tried to make big business more responsible through regulations of various kinds. They worked to clean up corrupt city governments, to improve working conditions in factories, and to better living conditions for those who lived in slum areas, a large number of whom were recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. Many progressives were also concerned with the environment and conservation of resources." Around the turn of the 20th century, children worked in factories, city bosses rigged elections, and corporate mergers had allowed single entities to enjoy monopoly or near-monopoly power. In nearly 80 industries, there was one firm that controlled over half the total output. The movement had many strands and at times drew support from both Republican and Democratic politicians. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt, having failed to win the Republican nomination, ran for president under the banner of the Progressive Party (in the popular press it was called the Bull Moose Party.) Some planks in the party platform resonate today. They called for limits and disclosure of campaign contributions, an eight-hour workday, a national health service, social insurance for the elderly, the unemployed and the disabled, and oversight of Wall Street. They also sought direct election of senators and creation of a national income tax. William Link, a progressive-era historian at the University of Florida, told us that while some activists focused on cleaning up slums and others on fighting political corruption, there was a unifying theme. "It was mostly an attempt to regulate and restrain the negative forces of industrial capitalism," Link said. "This meant public interventions -- often, of government, but not always -- designed to create a better society in the industrializing age." During the progressive era, the nation gave women the right to vote and regulated the meat and drug industries, as well as the railroads. The progressive agenda showed strong regional differences. In the South, it was part of the white supremacist movement. In the North, some factions were strongly anti-immigrant. Many progressives also supported Prohibition. A break from the socialists and Marxists Rutgers University’s website on this period said many of the leaders of the movement were members of "the middle and upper-class establishment" who believed that the excesses of industry were breeding conditions that amplified calls for more radical change. "Fear of the expansion of Socialism and Marxism provoked many in the upper class to support more moderate reform efforts as a means to ease the growing tensions between rich and poor and head off more extreme threats to their privileged role in society," the authors wrote. Charles Postel is an historian at San Francisco State University currently writing a book on the progressive era. Postel told us leading progressives such as President Teddy Roosevelt were quite clear on the relationship between their reform agenda and socialism. "Roosevelt lectured business leaders that they needed to get on board with the graduated income tax and similar reforms if they were to successfully defeat the socialists," Postel said. Historian Shelton Stromquist at the University of Iowa wrote that the progressive agenda split from Marxist thinking on the issue of class. While Marxist thought emphasized class consciousness as the key to change, the mainstream progressives looked to reforms such as better housing, work conditions and education to raise people out of misery. "They convinced themselves that class conflict and the 'parochial' class loyalties that bred it could be transcended," Stromquist wrote in Reinventing "the People": The Progressive Movement, the Class Problem and the Origins of Modern Liberalism. Stromquist wrote that modern-day liberals inherited this framework, saying, "Liberals have largely continued to deny the relevance of class to reform." Later progressives Most historians mark the years immediately after World War I as the end of the progressive era. Link told us the term fell out of favor for nearly three decades. It returned briefly in 1948 when former Vice President Henry Wallace (he served in Franklin Roosevelt’s last full term) ran a third-party bid for president under the Progressive Party. Wallace had virtually no chance to begin with, but after the Communist Party USA endorsed him, his campaign was doomed. Wallace himself praised aspects of the Soviet Union for promoting "economic democracy." That incarnation of the Progressive Party dissolved in 1955. The Wallace link aside, Link told us that Voight’s assertion is "absurd." "To say that it ‘substituted’ for communism is historically inaccurate," Link said. Our ruling Voight said that the word progressive was created as a substitute for communist. The historic record shows that the progressive movement emerged around the turn of the last century in response to the conditions created by runaway capitalism. Its policies aimed to regulate private industry, not eliminate it. That agenda enjoyed broad support from people who identified with both parties and led to many of the basic features of government today. Many of the movement’s mainstream supporters backed reforms as a way to head off more radical movements based on class identity rooted in Marxist thought. There was a brief period when the progressive label attracted support from avowed Communists, but that ended about 60 years ago and played no role in the creation of the term.

pomt-13200	The Democratic Party "is the oldest continuous political party in the world."	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/24/tim-kaine/democratic-party-oldest-continuous-political-party/	It’s widely stated that the Democratic Party is the oldest political party in the world. PBS says the party is the "world’s oldest existing political party." In a 2003 book review, the Washington Post called the party the "world’s oldest political party." And at a rally in Wisconsin, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine repeated the claim: "When I was standing on that stage, and the balloons were falling after Hillary (Clinton) had accepted the nomination, and my 81-year-old mother was there with me, and all of our extended family, my mom said to me: 'Tim, this is the greatest night of my life,'" Kaine said in an Aug. 5, 2016 appearance in Milwaukee. "Now, she was saying that partly because of me, but, but she was saying it because it was a historic night for the oldest continuous political party in the world, and for the first time in the history of the United States, to have a woman nominated for president." We decided to take a stroll through the history books to see if Kaine was right about the Democratic Party being the oldest continuous political party in the world. The experts we reached gave us an answer: Yes, but. "It’s a very common statement and it’s largely true, but it’s a little complicated," said Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University. U.S. history Both parties can trace their beginnings to the start of George Washington’s time as president (1789), but the path is more direct for Democrats. The political parties that eventually developed in the United States were the first modern political parties in the sense that they drew broader representation from the general electorate than political groups in other nations. The Democratic Party traces its roots to the early 1790s. At that point, Congress was starting to divide into two groups, said John Aldrich, a Duke University political science professor who wrote the book, "Why Parties?: The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America." But as a modern-looking continuous political party, it dates to either 1828, with the election of Andrew Jackson or 1832, when the party held its first national convention. Republicans could trace their roots back to Washington’s administration as well -- but the word "continuous" is key in this context. "The Democrats have established their claim that they’re the oldest continuous political party because the name changes less,"Jillson said. "The (two sides’) agendas, though, go all the way back to the first Washington administration in the 1790s." The Republican Party can trace itself -- by three different names -- to Washington’s first years, during which Alexander Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury and Thomas Jefferson was Secretary of State and they argued with each other in Washington’s cabinet, Jillson said. "The two parties grow out of that (those arguments) and so it’s right to say that the Democrats are the oldest continuous party but the Republicans could make the claim that under three different names their party is just as old," he said. The Federalists, originally associated with Hamilton’s policies, became the Whigs, which became, ultimately, the Republicans, Jillson said. But the line from Federalists to Republicans is more obscure, Aldrich said. Most would say that while there are some connections, the Whigs and the Republicans were really new parties, especially when compared to the more or less direct line between Jefferson and today’s party, Aldrich wrote in an email. The Republican Party says its founding came in the 1850s. The Republican National Committee describes its formation at a meeting in Ripon, Wisconsin, in 1854 and the party’s formal organization at a convention in Michigan that same year -- long after the Democrats. It held its first national convention in 1856. In the whole world? "In the U.S., we know the Democratic Party is older than the Republican Party and so the question is, is it older than other parties elsewhere in the world?" said Casey Dominguez, an associate professor at the University of San Diego’s Department of Political Science and International Relations. There are only a handful of other democracies in the world to compare to, she said. Our experts primarily compared the U.S. political parties to those in Great Britain. American political parties are recognized for their broad electorate that tends to line up behind the two major political parties, whereas that dynamic came much later in Britain, Jillson said. When political parties were developing in the United States, the British counterparts were more aggregations of elites. The Conservative and Liberal parties in Britain can trace their roots to well before the founding of the United States. But it was not until the Great Reform Act of 1867 that Britain began to develop modern parties in the sense that a broader swath of the electorate was able to participate. Our rating Kaine said that the Democratic Party is "the oldest continuous political party in the world." The political parties that developed in the United States were the first modern political parties in the sense that they drew broader representation from the general electorate than their predecessors in other nations. In the U.S., the Democratic Party is older than the Republican Party.

pomt-02167	Says Scott Brown "voted to give oil companies big tax breaks."	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/apr/30/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-says-scott-brown-voted-give-oi/	The Senate Majority PAC, which employs several former aides to Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has again struck former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who’s now running in New Hampshire to oust Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. The April 27, 2014, ad, titled "Baggage," focuses on Brown’s connection to "big oil." "Scott Brown’s carrying some big oil baggage," the narrator says. "In Massachusetts, he voted to give oil companies big tax breaks. They make record profits. He collects over $400,000 in campaign contributions." In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Brown’s votes. We’ll tackle his campaign contributions separately. The Senate Majority PAC cited Brown’s votes in 2010, 2011 and 2012 against measures that would have kept the "big five" oil companies (Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips) from taking advantage of existing tax breaks. Sponsors of the measures sought to apply the roughly $24 billion in additional tax revenue toward energy efficiency and conservation. Specifically, the measures would have prevented those five oil companies from using these existing tax breaks: • Deductions on taxes paid to foreign governments • Deductions on domestic manufacturing costs • Deductions for intangible drilling costs • Percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells • Deductions for qualified tertiary injectant expenses Three of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the "big five" oil firms. In each of these three years, the measures failed -- by margins of 35-61 in 2010, 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. Majorities weren’t enough in the final two years, since those measures required 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, was the only Republican to vote in favor of the 2012 bill. In 2011, she voted the same way, along with fellow Maine Republican Susan Collins. In 2010, no Republican supported the measure. Brown joined most Republicans and a few Democrats from oil states in voting against the measure each time it hit the floor. Ironically, the Senate Majority PAC supports this year’s re-election bids of two other Democratic senators who voted the same way on these measures as Brown did -- Mark Begich of Alaska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. The bill’s opponents sometimes cited a March 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded that withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump. In general, then, the ad is correct that Brown sided with the position of "big oil" on these votes. However, the ad’s claim is phrased slightly misleadingly. Rather than voting "to give oil companies big tax breaks," Brown voted not to take away the tax breaks that oil companies were already using. Also, it’s worth noting that two out of the five tax breaks in question were not targeted only at oil companies but were tax breaks that non-oil companies could benefit from, as well. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC ad said Brown "voted to give oil companies big tax breaks." For three years in a row, Brown did indeed vote against measures that would’ve barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed. That’s slightly different than what the ad says -- rather than voting to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Brown voted to support the status quo. Still, the ad is correct to suggest that Brown was voting in concert with the biggest oil companies on that legislation. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03091	Says President Barack Obama "has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own (health care) law."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/25/tom-graves/rep-graves-says-obama-has-changed-aca-19-times/	The Republican effort to defund Obamacare threatens a government shutdown at the end of the month. U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., is one lawmaker who believes the dangers of the health care law justify extreme measures. Over the summer, Graves called the Affordable Care Act "destructive" and a "job killer." "We need to make every effort to ensure Obamacare is never implemented," he said. Graves said President Barack Obama’s actions highlight the law’s terminal flaws. "Something very important has happened since the president did win the election," Graves said on ABC’s This Week. "He himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law. So if it's so good for America, then why he is delaying it for his friends in big business?" We wondered if in fact, Obama has made that many changes in the law. Graves’ office pointed us to a letter from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank for Congress. The Congressional Research Service review listed 19 times the Affordable Care Act changed since it was passed in 2010. The report counted 14 public laws and five administrative actions that made a variety of modifications to the law. For the record, we note that a dozen of those adjustments took place before the 2012 election, and not after as Graves said. The timing seems less important than the substance of what was done. Changes to the Affordable Care Act Some items on the list qualify as significant in the eyes of the health policy experts we contacted. One of the country’s leading authorities on health care law, Timothy Jost at the Washington and Lee School of Law, pointed to three: A one-year delay in requiring firms with over 50 workers to provide insurance Scrapping a long-term care insurance program (for nursing home care, for example) called the CLASS Act Lifting the requirement on businesses to file a form called a 1099 for a variety of business expenses The administration acted on its own to delay the employer mandate, explaining that the systems were not in place to implement it. The other two changes came through votes in Congress. "Congress couldn’t find a way to make the CLASS Act actuarially sound," Jost said, "so they repealed it and put the money elsewhere." As for the business reporting rule, "businesses said this was a huge burden and Congress responded," Jost said. "There was strong bipartisan support, and you could find the votes to make those sorts of changes." In addition to those three, a program to create consumer health insurance cooperatives was retained but lost $2.2 billion in funding. Most of the items on the Congressional Research Service list, however, are less dramatic. Several clarified that certain government health insurance programs would count as coverage under the individual mandate. This included Tricare, which covers the military, and insurance through Veterans Affairs. Other adjustments extended tax breaks, such as a tax credit for families that adopt a child. There were changes in the Medicaid federal matching formula (to keep money flowing to Louisiana after Katrina), and a tweak to the calculation of income that determines the level of premium subsidies in the insurance exchanges. Such changes are common in Congress, according to our experts. "Legislators aren't perfect," said Jost. "They don't get everything right the first time. That’s the nature of the legislative process." It is also clear that Obama did not drive the majority of the changes. They emerged as Congress worked on various elements of a multi-faceted law. Still, Obama signed off on those changes as part of larger pieces of legislation. We’ve been here before Graves’ comments suggest that so many changes to the health care law means it's fundamentally flawed. Actually, major pieces of legislation rarely remain the same as the day the president signs them into law. The Medicare prescription drug benefit, passed under President George W. Bush, was changed several times after its initial passage. Both that law and the recent health care law lay a government program on top of a complex private market system, said Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University. "Patches on a patchwork mean making a coherent quilt very difficult," Marmor said. Even though the country had about two years to get ready for the Medicare drug program, about the same as with Obamacare, some pieces were not in place when the program launched, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University. "States were worried that bunches of people would show up on Jan. 1, 2005, and not be able to get their prescription drugs," Hoadley said. "So some of them started picking up the tab." Later, Hoadley said, the Bush administration pulled money from another fund to reimburse the states. The law required insurance plans to set up systems to keep an eye on people who took many different medications. The goal was to make sure the drugs were compatible. The purpose was sensible but as of 2005, the technology wasn’t ready. "The decision was made that while that requirement was still there, there would be no enforcement until they had time to get things up and running," Hoadley said. "It took several years of saying ‘Lets not focus on this; it’s not the most important thing’." Our ruling Graves said Obama "himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law." Based on the analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, Graves has the right number. However, he simplifies the way that many of those 19 changes came about, and by doing that, makes it seem as though the president were more directly involved. Graves cited these changes as evidence that the law is fatally flawed but he glossed over the differences among them. Some of the changes were significant and some were technical or tangential to the health care law itself. The basic number is right but there are lot of details of details missing from Graves' assertion. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Tom Graves	None	None	None	2013-09-25T10:24:09	2013-09-22	['None']
pomt-00055	The U.S. Geological Survey increased Yellowstone volcano eruption threat level to "high"	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/03/blog-posting/no-yellowstone-volcanos-eruption-threat-level-did-/	Amid partisan allegations of political disasters, should we be more worried about the natural variety—and cancel any upcoming vacations to the first national park in the United States? "Yellowstone super volcano threat level just increased to ‘high’ by USGS," warned the headline on a story posted with a "preppers" tag on Oct. 29 on Disclose.tv. (USGS is th acronym for the U.S. Geological Survey, which provides science about natural hazards.) The Disclose.tv website lets users submit and share topics and videos that are supposedly ignored, denied or inadequately covered "by the mainstream media, governmental institutions and other information keepers." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Disclose.tv said in an email to PolitiFact that 100 percent of its content is user-generated. But at some point before we reached out, the headline was changed to read, "Yellowstone super volcano threat level set to ‘high’ by USGS," and it said it was posted to "nature," not "preppers." The Epoch Times, which posted a story on Oct. 25 about an eruption threat, also updated its coverage, but with a correction. "The Epoch Times published a misleading headline declaring the threat of Yellowstone volcano eruption had increased to ‘high.’ Yellowstone volcano’s ranking of 21st on the U.S. Geological Survey’s assessment has not changed." Yet another publication, the Post Register in Idaho, reported that the threat had been bumped from "moderate" to "high," though the newspaper cautioned that the Yellowstone caldera isn’t expected to "explode in a mega eruption anytime soon." Perhaps anticipating—or responding to—confusion over the volano’s threat assessment, USGS published its own article on Oct. 29 that explains what it all means. Here are the facts: Earlier this month, the agency released an updated threat assessment for U.S. volcanoes for the first time since the original assessment was published in 2005. The new assessment accounts for new research and observations over the past 13 years. In the 2005 assessment, Yellowstone is listed as a "high threat" volcano. In the 2018 assessment, Yellowstone is listed as a "high threat" volcano. Each volcano also has an overall threat score, which considers factors including average recurrence of eruptions, what types of eruptions have taken place and nearby infrastructure. In 2005, Yellowstone was ranked 21. In 2018, Yellowstone was ranked 21. "This qualifies Yellowstone as a ‘high threat’ volcanic system," according to the USGS article. "This is not a change or any sort of upgrade in the threat posed by Yellowstone, and carries no implications for future eruptive activity. It is merely a way to provide a sense of Yellowstone’s threat level compared to other volcanoes in the USA." It’s also important to note that the assessment is not an indicator of which volcanoes are most likely to erupt, according to USGS. It’s also not a ranking of the most active volcanoes (and "active" means that a volcano has erupted in the past 11,650 years). Rather, assessments gauge the relative risk a volcano poses to people and property. So if a volcano erupts but no one is living on it, it has a very low threat because no people or property are at risk, according to USGS. Meanwhile, "a volcano that might experience only small explosions but that is surrounded by towns and near an airport has a higher threat, since lots of people and property are exposed to the hazard (even if the hazard might be a relatively small one.)" We’ll let Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey and scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, have the last word. "In a nutshell, this whole ‘bumped Yellowstone’s volcano threat to high’ thing is a massive job of misreporting," Poland said in an email. "The threat level for the caldera system is rated as ‘high’ in a report that was issued by USGS. That report updates an initial report from 2005, in which Yellowstone was also rated ‘high.’ ... Nothing has changed" We rate this statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-11-03T11:19:11	2018-10-29	['None']
pomt-08113	You "can't check out a library book without a photo ID."	/texas/statements/2010/dec/11/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-you-cant-check-out-library-boo/	Advocating for a law that would require Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told an interviewer this summer that "you can't get on a plane without a photo ID, you can't buy Sudafed without a photo ID, you can't check out a library book without a photo ID . . . We need to protect the sanctity of our votes," he told a representative of Americans for Prosperity in a June 11 interview at the Republican State Convention in Dallas. Most everyone knows that airline passengers have to hand up a photo ID before going through airport security. And since 2005, Texas pharmacies have been required by state law to make a person purchasing pills containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or nopseudoephedrine to display a driver's license or other ID containing the purchaser's photograph, as noted online by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy. Sudafed, a decongestant, contains pseudoephedrine, according to WebMD, a medical information website. But showing your ID to check out a library book? To our inquiry, Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz shared information we confirmed indicating that applicants for library cards from the Austin, Dallas or San Antonio public libraries must present a photo ID. His point: If a photo ID is needed to get a card, that's like requiring a photo ID to check out a book. You need a card before you can check out a book. In Austin, according to its library website, adults seeking a card must apply in person at any branch and present a current photo ID plus proof of home address. Minors seeking a youth card may also apply at any branch, with a parent or guardian, the site says. "They should bring current photo ID and proof of current residence address," a library site says. Next, we looked into whether libraries around the country have identical photo-ID policies. Not so, according to Amy Sargent, spokeswoman for the Chicago-based Public Library Association, a division of the American Library Association. Sargent, who undertook an overview at our request, said via e-mail that "for as many listings we found of libraries that require a photo ID, we found as many that don't, so it's safe to say that the requirement is not nationally consistent" or "even consistent among types of libraries (urban, suburban, rural, etc...)." "Even if a photo ID is a primary requirement," her e-mail says, "many libraries seem to make concessions for people without IDs." According to the association, individuals seeking a Chicago library card must present a current ID with their photo or two pieces of current identification, such a a personal check, voter registration card or a current telephone, gas, electric or cable TV bill. Applicants for cards from the El Paso public library must show a photo ID or, if lacking picture identification, one type of non-photo ID with their name and current address. According to the association, applications for a card from the Montgomery County (Md.) library must be accompanied by "official identification," such as a driver's license, a check with pre-printed address or a postmarked letter addressed to the applicant. Photo IDs are required to get cards at libraries in San Diego, Calif.; Scottsdale, Ariz.; Manchester, N.H.; and Troy, Mich., Sargent said. And what about practices in Texas? Gloria Meraz, director of communications for the Texas Library Association, said local communities set their own policies. At our request, she asked librarians to share their approaches. From the responses, we learned that the Plano Public Library does not require a photo ID from applicants for library cards, while public libraries in Alamo, Allen, Baytown, Haslet, Irving, Richardson, Taylor and Wells Branch do have the ID hurdle. Broadly, many libraries require photo IDs to get a card, some do not. Still, we found no instances of libraries requiring a photo ID when actually checking out a book. Walz of Dewhurst's office said the lieutenant governor makes his point. "If there are libraries that do not require a photo ID" to get a card, "there are certainly some that do," Walz said. Our take: Dewhurst's claim confuses activities that are subject to uniform regulations in Texas--boarding a plane, purchasing Sudafed--with one that is subject to inconsistent, local rules. Photo IDs are always required to board a plane or purchase Sudafed, while public libraries simply don't require photo IDs at checkout. However, patrons of most libraries have to show a photo ID when applying for a library card, a factor that gives Dewhurst's statement an element of truth. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12432	"We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin."	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/17/scott-walker/testing-scott-walker-claim-record-education-findin/	As Gov. Scott Walker laid out his 2017-’19 budget, he touted the "historic investment in our priorities" -- including K-12 education. To that end, Walker declared: "We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin." More money than ever before? With Walker’s budget now before the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, where it will undergo changes, we wondered if that was the case. We took a look at the budgets back to fiscal year 1991, which provides about 25 years of data and shows the trajectory before state funding jumped significantly in the late 1990s. The answer, we found, depends on how you crunch the numbers. Total state aid vs. inflation-adjusted For starters, we took Walker’s statement to mean K-12 education, not a picture that would include colleges and universities, and the "we" to refer to money directly from the state. That’s based on the context within Walker’s Feb, 8, 2017, budget address and the K-12 education fact sheet linked from the address itself. And when we reached out to Walker’s office, a spokesman pointed us to page 6 of the "Budget in Brief," where K-12 education is addressed. That page in the briefing document shows that state aid to schools for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (the years covered by Walker’s budget) would be the highest in raw numbers -- at least back to fiscal year 2009, where the chart on the page ends. The $11.5 billion over the two years would amount to the largest tally in state history. That figure shakes out to $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. But when you compare figures over time, it’s important to take inflation into account. That is, costs grow, prices grow, the economy grows. Adjusting for inflation puts everything on an equal footing. To get inflation-adjusted state aid, we took the raw numbers from past reports from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and gathered data back to fiscal year 1991. We put the figures through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator and also compared our inflation-adjusted numbers to those run by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Both calculations found that fiscal year 2003 was the highest inflation-adjusted year for state aid to schools. That year, the raw total in state aid was $4.8 billion. But the tally by the Taxpayers Alliance found that inflation-adjusted state aid that year totaled $6.5 billion. That’s far more than the $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion proposed for the next two years in Walker’s budget plan. The bigger picture Although inflation-adjusted state aid is the best measure, we decided to examine another calculation. In Wisconsin, state aid doesn’t tell the full story in terms of how much money is going to schools. What’s known as the "revenue cap" imposes a limit on funding by local school districts. That means that without a referendum to exceed the limit, if state aid to schools goes up, local property taxes would go down, leaving a district with the same amount of funding. At the same time, the state can give schools additional money outside the revenue cap. "The revenue limit did not go up the last two years," said Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance. "However, what they’ve done is for the past about six years they’ve been giving the schools money outside the revenue limit." That brings us to "per-pupil" funding. Knapp took the inflation-adjusted total of state aid and property taxes allocated to schools and divided that by full-time equivalent enrollment for fiscal years 1997 through 2017. If you slice the numbers that way, fiscal year 2011 is the highest at $13,112 per student. That compares to $12,329 in the current fiscal year. The challenge with calculating per-pupil aid is knowing enrollment numbers, which are difficult to predict for 2018 and 2019. Knapp said even this number comes with another important caveat. "Generally, per student funding has risen over the years, even after accounting for inflation," he said. "That it peaked in 2011 is also not a surprise as funding was cut in 2012. However, Act 10 saved districts enough to cover those cuts. Thus, you have to be careful about how you think about that. "Essentially, school costs were reset at a lower level in that year, and they have generally been rising since." Our rating Walker said in his budget address -- and in the weeks and months since -- that Wisconsin is investing more in education than ever in the history of the state. This is true in raw dollars but the statement doesn’t account for inflation-adjusted numbers, which is the best way to look at figures over time. When adjusted for inflation, fiscal year 2003 would be the highest ever. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-03406	"In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for (expanded background checks.)"	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/01/joe-manchin/sen-joe-manchin-says-1999s-nra-supported-expanded-/	Washington may have moved on to immigration and the scandal du jour, but the gun law debate still simmers in states like Sen. Joe Manchin’s West Virginia. Dueling ads from the NRA and Manchin target West Virginia voters: "Tell Senator Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment!" and "Call the NRA and tell them to support criminal background checks!" Manchin’s not giving up his quest to broaden gun buyer background checks, the Associated Press reported June 26, 2013. The Democratic senator told Chris Matthews on MSNBC that he’s still making his case to the people in West Virginia to resurrect the bill that died in April. "When they start seeing what we have done to the bill, you know what they said? And you mean the NRA in Washington is against this? We have been fighting for some of these provisions for the last decade or more. "And I said, all we have done — and I said, guess what? In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this. I haven't changed. They changed, Chris." Was the NRA leadership for the provisions of Manchin’s gun proposal back in ‘99? ‘Instant criminal background checks’ We’ve checked related claims from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Barack Obama that Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, once supported wider background checks. It’s true he told a House subcommittee in May 1999 that "it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes for anyone." But the House rejected an expansion of background checks in June 1999 — a rejection the NRA supported. A Washington Post headline at the time said, "NRA Achieves Its Goal: Nothing." LaPierre’s testimony before the House subcommittee hadn’t been in support of background checks legislation — it was against an amendment from Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.. In his testimony, he outlined a set of proposals the NRA at the time found "reasonable," such as "instant criminal background checks." But the crux of his testimony was that he found provisions of the legislation unreasonable, such as the way the legislation defined a gun show, how the law handled inheritance of weapons, and that the instant check system didn’t destroy records of transactions immediately. The NRA ultimately backed legislation in the House that did expand background checks to sales at gun shows — but cut the time allowed for background checks to 24 hours, a change that ultimately killed the legislation. Manchin’s recent legislation, which he offered with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, addressed a number of the NRA’s concerns with Lautenberg’s 1999 provisions. (We summarized Manchin-Toomey back in April.) It didn’t apply background checks to transfers between close relatives. Its definition of a gun show increased the number of guns from 50 to 75 and excluded residences of private collectors. It ultimately would have cut the time allowed for background checks down to 24 hours. But the NRA still challenged applying background checks to transfers between distant relatives and "lifelong friends," for example, echoing its opposition to 1999 proposals. Our ruling Manchin explained his continued pursuit of expanding background checks, saying that in 1999, even "the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this." He’s correct that LaPierre, at the center of the most recent gun legislation battle, testified before lawmakers that the NRA supported "mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale." But then, as now, the group was opposed to specific legislative measures behind implementation of expanded checks. Even Manchin’s compromise measure may not have passed muster with 1999’s NRA. He’s right that the leadership expressed support for expanding background checks generally, but the details get more complicated, especially in the context of specific legislation. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Joe Manchin	None	None	None	2013-07-01T13:23:14	2013-06-20	['Washington,_D.C.']
pomt-13522	Says Gov. Pat McCrory "tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years."	/north-carolina/statements/2016/sep/01/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-ad-attacking-pat-mccrory-education-leav/	Education continues to be front-and-center in the North Carolina governor’s race. The latest ad from Democratic candidate Roy Cooper features a teacher talking about how teachers have to buy supplies for their jobs, and how she decided to move to another state that pays teachers more. "Gov. Pat McCrory talks about raising our pay, but he tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years," she says. "Like over 2,000 other teachers, I’m having to move to another state so I can do what I love and make ends meet. Someone needs to fix this." We wondered if McCrory really did suggest cutting education funding to the lowest share of the overall state budget in more than 30 years. First, though, we have to figure out what the ad was talking about. The state’s education budget is broken into three categories – higher education, community colleges and K-12. Since the ad is entirely about K-12 schools and the claim is spoken by that K-12 teacher, our first impression was that the claim was about K-12 funding. Cooper’s campaign told us it was actually referring to the total education budget. However, we believe a normal person viewing this ad will think it’s talking about K-12 funding. So we’ll look at both. Overall education spending North Carolina’s budget is tweaked annually, although the big-picture budget is set every other year, during odd-numbered years. In his 2015 proposal, McCrory suggested spending 56 percent of the budget on public schools, community colleges and universities in 2015-16, and 54.4 percent in 2016-17. It was that drop to 54.4 percent that Cooper’s campaign honed in on. They cited data from McCrory’s own budget that went back to 1981-82 and showed larger portions in all of those years. McCrory spokesman Ricky Diaz said the historically low proposal was because of uncertainty surrounding tax cuts. He added that the funding "was always expected to be increased when the legislature came back ... after the state's revenue picture became more clear as the governor's tax cuts took hold, improving the economy and in turn, increasing revenue." We should note here that the N.C. General Assembly did not take McCrory’s advice. In 2015 it allocated 55.5 percent of state funding to education for 2016-17, more than a percentage point above McCrory’s proposal. And in July 2016, lawmakers increased the 2016-17 share to 56.8 percent. And that 56.8 percent share is, furthermore, less than what McCrory suggested in 2016. His proposal that year would have given education 57.5 percent of the state budget. That would’ve been the highest share since 2009-10, not the lowest in 30 years. Neither of McCrory’s suggestions were adopted by the legislature, high or low. But the ad specifically said McCrory "tried to cut" education’s budget share, so it’s fair to look at what McCrory proposed instead of what actually passed. And on that evidence, the claim is accurate about McCrory’s 2015 proposal. His 2016 proposal, however, suggested the largest budget share for education since the recession. K-12 only Next we’ll look only at the portion of the budget spent on K-12 schools. In 1981-82, the state spent 44 percent of its money on K-12. In 2015, McCrory suggested a 2016-17 spending level of 37.8 percent of the budget. That’s a drop, but it was not the "lowest budget share in over 30 years." In 2008-09, 2010-11 and 2012-13, the budget’s share of K-12 funding was even lower. The 2008-09 budget was under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley. The other were under Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue. The first two were passed by a Democrat-led legislature, and the 2012-13 budget was passed by a Republican-led legislature. Per-pupil funding McCrory’s campaign pointed out that the budget shares for overall education spending and for K-12 specifically also fell while Cooper was in the General Assembly. Cooper served in the House of Representatives from 1987-91 and in the Senate from 1991 until 2001, when he became attorney general. From 1987 to 2001 the share of the budget going to all types of education dropped from 68 to 60.1 percent. The K-12 share dropped from 45.5 to 42.4 percent. So the same thing Cooper’s accusing McCrory of also happened when Cooper and his fellow Democrats were in charge of the budget. Cooper’s campaign defended his record, though. Megan Jacobs, his campaign spokeswoman, said education’s 60.1 percent budget share in Cooper’s final year in the Senate was "almost 6 percent higher than what McCrory proposed here. It was also the highest it had been since 1993-94, which was before (Cooper) rose to senior leadership." So both Cooper and McCrory oversaw budgets that gave a smaller slice of the pie to education. But both also oversaw increases to per-pupil funding – a metric experts agree is a more indicative measure of support. Cooper knows all about the importance of per-pupil spending; we previously ruled his claim that North Carolina is near the bottom nationally as Mostly True. And per-pupil funding – from a combination of state, local and federal sources – rose under Cooper and has also risen under McCrory. Let’s rewind 20 years to the 1995-96 school year when Cooper was midway through his legislative career. North Carolina schools got $5,090 per student, the equivalent of $7,916 in 2015 dollars. Cooper’s last budget was for 2000-01, when he was the Democratic majority leader in the Senate. Schools that year received $6,654 per pupil, the equivalent of $9,158 in 2015 dollars. For comparison, North Carolina spent $8,496 per student in 2013-14 – McCrory’s first budget, and a few dollars higher than the year prior – and an estimated $8,898 in 2015-16, according to the National Education Association. Our ruling Cooper said McCrory "tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years." McCrory’s proposed budget in 2015 did suggest doing exactly that for the 2016-17 school year, although McCrory later adjusted his proposal in 2016, when his budget’s share of education funding would’ve been the highest since 2009-10. That’s a detail the ad leaves out, along with the fact that the share of the budget going to education also declined when Cooper was in the legislature. Since the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/59591c46-5118-4647-82a3-682071f7ea26	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2016-09-01T14:51:27	2016-08-29	['Pat_McCrory']
pomt-14209	"Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-ad-ignores-fact-members-congress-ca/	A new television ad by Sen. Bernie Sanders describes a very lucrative method for making money if you're a politician in Washington. "Wall Street banks shower Washington politicians with campaign contributions and speaking fees," the ad says. "And what do they get for it? A rigged economy, tax breaks and bailouts, all held in place by a corrupt campaign finance system. And while Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches, they oppose raising the living wage to $15 an hour. $200,000 an hour for them, but not even 15 bucks an hour for all Americans. Enough is enough." The ad was played in New York in the days leading to the state’s April 19 primary. The ad was clearly going after Sanders' Democratic opponent, former U.S. Sen. and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who made lots of money giving speeches after leaving government in 2013. Sanders has argued that Clinton can't effectively regulate Wall Street when she has taken so much money from the big banks. But the language of the ad is much broader than that, making three references to Washington politicians in general and twice linking them to a $200,000 per hour payment. In addition, four of the 11 camera shots in the 30-second ad show the United States Capitol building, the headquarters of Congress. There are no shots of the White House or institutions such as the Federal Reserve or the State Department. The clear impression is that Sanders is talking — exclusively or not — about members of Congress, the premiere political class of Washington. Can they really accept more than $200,000 an hour for speeches? The ad is very misleading. Senators and representatives have been prohibited from accepting money for speeches since 1991. Before then, members of Congress would often accept speaking fees from the industries they oversaw, which critics characterized as a form of bribery. And it's not just members of Congress. In the House, for example, even senior staff can't be paid for speeches, appearances or writing an article. Junior staff also can't do it if the topic relates to their official duties. The executive branch has a similar ban. But once a person leaves government service, those rules no longer apply, and they're free to charge for speeches. As we reported a year ago, Clinton was typically earning honorariums of about $225,000 per speech and, in some instances, over $300,000 each. Again, these happened after she left office. When we asked the Sanders campaign about the ad's claim, they sent along a list of links reporting on what some former federal government employees were getting for their speeches. They included: * $100,000-$175,000 for George W. Bush, who insists on a non-disclosure agreement so the sponsors can't say what they paid the former president (Politico). * At least $250,000 for a speech in Abu Dhabi by former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. His predecessor, Alan Greenspan, reportedly received comparable pay to speak at the private Lehman Brothers dinner after he left the Fed (Reuters). But the Sanders camp also sent links to stories about Mitt Romney making $68,000 for a speech (USA Today) and Jeb Bush commanding about $50,000 per talk (New York Times). That's far less than $200,000, and neither has held any significant elected or appointed office in Washington. And none of these people listed by Sanders had any kind of vote in the recent debate over the $15 minimum wage (which also sounds like a veiled shot at Clinton). Finally, we should note that it's a stretch to say that someone who earns $200,000 for a speech is earning $200,000 an hour. Most speeches require some preparation, research and travel time. It's akin to saying that a pastor paid $30,000 a year is earning $577 an hour because that's how long a Sunday service lasts. Our ruling Sanders said in an ad that uses repeated shots of the U.S. Capitol that "Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches." His ad is disingenuous on many levels. Politicians trying to get to Washington, or those who have come from Washington, certainly can earn such fees, but members of the House and Senate and top officials in the executive branch are not permitted to accept payment for speeches. And Sanders' campaign is including politicians who have never served in Washington in any significant capacity. Because the statement contains a small element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19e74cb2-d6b7-4ba0-8088-ed2767c75a31	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-20T10:00:00	2016-04-15	['None']
pomt-01471	A 2011 measure passed into law with Wendy Davis’ support "removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like" the school funding case.	/texas/statements/2014/sep/30/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-blames-wendy-davis-limit-settlements-p/	UPDATE, 4 p.m., Oct. 8, 2014: We updated this article with detail about how the attorney general carries out the 2007 mandate that certain legal settlements win legislative consent. This change did not affect our rating of Abbott’s debate statement. Given an opportunity, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis pressed Republican Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, about his office continuing to battle school districts in court despite a state district judge ruling the school finance system to be both underfunded and unconstitutional. "The only thing right now coming between our children and appropriate funding of their schools today is you," Davis asserted in the pair's Sept. 19, 2014, debate in the Rio Grande Valley. "On behalf of the 5 million children of this state, will you agree tonight that you will drop your appeals and allow our schools to be appropriately funded?" Abbott responded by blaming legislators, including Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, for limiting his options. "Sen. Davis," Abbott replied, "there is actually another thing coming between me and settling that lawsuit. And that is a law that you voted on and helped pass in 2011 that removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like this." Did legislators including Davis move to keep the attorney general from settling lawsuits? We started this fact check by asking the Abbott campaign for elaboration. Spokeswoman Amelia Chasse pointed to a proposal that won legislative approval in 2011, with Davis among supporters. Then again, it came clear, the legislative leash on the attorney general’s ability to settle cases originated in 2007 action -- more than a year before Davis won her first Senate term. The 2007 law said the attorney general must get legislative approval/consent to settle matters with damages costing the state more than $25 million. The 2011 change lowered the threshold to $10 million. Resolving the school-finance matter would surely cost more than either limit. In 2013 and again in August 2014, state District Judge John Dietz of Austin ruled against the state in the case, though he also gave lawmakers until July 2015 to act. At the time of the Davis-Abbott debate, state lawyers overseen by Abbott were expected to appeal to the Texas Supreme Court (which they did a few days later). By email, David Thompson, a lawyer representing hundreds of districts in the litigation, told us either settlement threshold -- $10 million or the previous $25 million -- "would be substantially below what it will take to resolve the school finance lawsuit." Meantime, former state Sen. Steve Ogden, who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and authored the settlement thresholds that passed into law, told us by phone that Abbott can’t settle the school case without the Legislature’s permission "because it’s going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to do it." He and Rep. Tryon Lewis, R-Odessa, chairman of the House Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence Committee, were guided to us by Chasse. Both said the 2011 action effectively toughened and arguably reaffirmed the original restriction. Here are the details behind the legislation leashing the attorney general’s power: In 2007, according to legislative records, Ogden, R-Bryan, won passage of Senate Bill 2031,which required legislative consent or approval of the settlement or compromise of a claim or action against the state involving state expenditures exceeding $25 million. Specifically, the law barred the attorney general or any lawyer representing the state from entering into a settlement of a claim without legislative consent or approval. The new law said this limit applies if the settlement requires the state to pay damages exceeding the $25 million in a biennium or if it "commits this state to a course of action that in reasonable probability will entail a continuing increased expenditure of state funds over subsequent" two-year periods, which strikes us as sweeping in a possible resolution of the school suit. In May 2007, very few legislators objected to Ogden’s proposal as it headed toward Gov. Rick Perry. A House Democrat voted "no" in that body’s final vote and three Democratic senators cast "no" votes when the Senate later agreed to House amendments. Four years later, with Davis in the Senate, lawmakers and Perry signed off on Senate Bill 899, reducing the dollar threshold for legislative involvement. An accompanying analysis, by the in-house Senate Research Center, said: "In keeping with increased scrutiny of state expenditures, this bill would lower the threshold settlement amount requiring legislative approval from $25 million to $10 million." Senators including Davis unanimously advanced the reduction to the House, where it won approval with one Republican voting "no." To recap: Davis was not in the Legislature when lawmakers initially limited the attorney general’s ability to settle cases. She was a member of the Senate that approved a toughening. We asked Abbott’s office to explain how, day to day, the limit has been applied to cases. A spokesman, Jerry Strickland, replied after we initially published this fact check, saying by email: "Procedurally, when a settlement may implicate the statute, the opposing party is notified that any settlement reached will be subject to legislative approval. The terms of the settlement are negotiated before the settlement is brought to the Legislature. The Legislature can then approve, reject or request modifications to a settlement." We also asked about the attorney general’s biennial reports to lawmakers on such settlements; such reports were required by the 2007 law. Each biennium, Strickland said, the agency "provides privileged attorney-client communications concerning potential settlements requiring legislative approval. If a settlement is reached, the settlement is presented to the Legislature for consideration." Our ruling Abbott said Davis voted for a 2011 measure that removes the attorney general’s ability to settle lawsuits like the school funding case. That’s not so; a 2007 law created the legislative hurdle for major settlements -- and, significantly, Davis wasn’t a senator then. Still, this claim has an element of truth because Davis joined nearly every other lawmaker in tightening the limit in 2011 by reducing the threshold for settlements the attorney general may reach without legislative sign-off to those costing the state $10 million or less. Given how Abbott characterized the law at issue, we rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-02017	Ken "Block supports Obamacare."	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/08/allan-fung/gubernatorial-candidate-allan-fung-says-his-republ/	In the contest to be the next Republican candidate for governor in Rhode Island, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung has released a TV commercial that lampoons supporters of his GOP opponent, businessman Ken Block. The commercial, called "Blockhead," portrays them with large, cube-shaped heads and has them espousing positions that most Republicans would find objectionable, as "Over the Waves," a song often heard during circus trapeze acts, plays in the background. One of the "blockhead" characters says: "Block supports Obamacare," a reference to the Affordable Care Act that Republicans in Congress have tried to repeal, gut or delay more than 50 times. When the ad was released June 2, 2014, Block's campaign manager Jeff Britt, publicly invited PolitiFact Rhode Island to evaluate the claim because, he said, it misrepresents Block’s position on Obamacare. How could we resist? Britt sent us an email stating, unequivocally, that "Ken never supported Obamacare." He added that Block, who "has frankly been a strong critic, pointing out in speeches and in radio interviews how devastating it has been to his business." When Block, president of a Barrington software firm, reacted to the commercial on Buddy Cianci's WPRO radio show, he made the same assertion: "I've never supported Obamacare, in fact I've whacked Obamacare pretty hard because of the negative impact it's had on my business and the cost of acquiring insurance." While we were waiting for information from the Fung campaign seeking the source of its claim, we examined a new flier from Fung’s campaign that made a slightly different claim about Block's support for Obamacare. It shows a green-faced Block, along with Gov. Lincoln Chafee, depicted as "Two Peas in a Pod" because both "have been cheerleaders for liberal agendas." "Both supported Obamacare," it asserts, characterizing Block's support in the past tense. So where's the truth? Unlike the television ad, which lists no source for its claim, the flier says the claim is based on Block's Nov. 15, 2013 appearance on the WPRI-TV show "Newsmakers." Four minutes into that program, Block states that he has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, including President Obama in 2012. "In 2012, I bought what Barack Obama was selling in terms of changes to health care for me as a small business owner, someone who buys insurance for employees. I can no longer afford to do what we're doing. And I believed that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, was going to provide the kind of relief that we needed in my business to insure my employees," he says. "And it turns out that the promise didn't live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote," Block continued. "I'm looking for answers and those answers didn't come." In other words, Block acknowledged in November that he did support the promise of Obamacare, signed into law in March 2010, and Obama's reelection in 2012, but stated that he no longer supports that law. And on March 31, the enrollment deadline for Obamacare, Block released a statement, published in The Providence Journal, characterizing it as "a horrible bill, ill-conceived, unilaterally passed by one party, and terribly implemented." He said it "raised taxes and massively disrupted the health insurance market in Rhode Island without increasing competition, access, or affordability." Even if Fung hadn’t seen that story, we know he is aware of Block’s earlier repudiation of Obamacare. That’s because when Fung appeared on "Newsmakers" on April 11, moderator Tim White challenged Fung over his internet ad that selectively quoted Block's November "Newsmaker" appearance. He noted that the Fung ad clipped out Block's phrase, "The promise didn’t live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote." Fung said he didn't have a problem with the omission. Despite this, the "Blockhead" commercial says "Block supports Obamacare," asserting that he supports the controversial health care law today. When the Fung campaign got back to us, spokesmen Patrick Sweeney and Robert Coupe argued that it is accurate to say that Block supports Obamacare today because Block has never called for repeal of the law, as other opponents have and has never formally revoked the support he acknowledged in the November "Newsmakers" appearance. On the latter point, we disagree. Block has repeatedly made it clear he no longer supports Obamacare. The very "Newsmakers" appearance the Fung campaign cites in its attack on Block shows that. In light of all the evidence, it is clear that Fung is making a ridiculously blockheaded claim. We rate it Pants On Fire.

pomt-11676	There is "substantial evidence of voter fraud."	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-theres-substantial-evidence-vote/	President Donald Trump is closing the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a panel to investigate voter fraud that had attracted controversy during its short life. The commission -- headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- had been "bedeviled by internal dissension, threats of litigation and the refusal of some states to provide information. Its last known meeting was Sept. 12," NBC reported. The panel included a few Democrats, but its membership was majority Republican. One Democratic member of the commission even filed a lawsuit, demanding to be kept abreast of its activities. Separately, the Government Accountability Office, a federal agency, announced in October 2017 that it would probe its handling of voter files and other issues, in response to calls by Democratic lawmakers. In a statement on Jan. 3, 2018, announcing his decision to disband the commission, Trump said, "Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry. Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action." PolitiFact is separately checking a different assertion by Trump, that "mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data" to the commission. In this fact-check, we’re looking at whether Trump is correct that there is "substantial evidence of voter fraud." This is hardly the first time Trump has made an assertion of this sort. He has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we’ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Trump has not yet produced any evidence that supports these claims, and the White House did not respond to another request for this article. The White House’s previous argument In a press briefing on Jan. 24, 2017, a reporter asked his then-press secretary Sean Spicer how Trump came to believe that it’s possible that illegal votes were to blame for his popular vote loss. "I think there's been studies," Spicer responded. "There's one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens. There's other studies that have been presented to him. It's a belief he maintains." We determined that Spicer was conflating a couple different studies, and that those studies have been erroneously used to prop up claims that noncitizens have swayed elections by voting illegally. There is no study that shows 14 percent of the votes cast in 2008 were cast by noncitizens. That would have added up to more than 18 million fraudulent votes — an implausible assertion, considering the total noncitizen population was about 22.5 million in 2010. As for the study that "came out of Pew in 2008," it actually came out in 2012, and it’s about outdated voter rolls -- not fraudulent votes. The 2012 Pew study -- found that about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are inaccurate or no longer valid, but it did not find evidence of actual voter fraud. The study was about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. David Becker, the former director of Pew’s election program, tweeted in November 2016 that "we found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted." Meanwhile, the study that shows that "14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens" has been widely criticized for its methodology. Many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error. In a blog post, one of the authors, Old Dominion professor Jesse Richman, said he stands by his study, but "our results suggest that almost all elections in the U.S. are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions." Voter fraud uncommon Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread. • News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. • A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. "Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper," reads the 2007 report. • In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s administration tried to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the rolls. Meanwhile, ProPublica, an investigative journalism project, tweeted that "we had 1,100 people monitoring the vote on Election Day. We saw no evidence the election was ‘rigged’ " and "no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted illegally." Expert opinion In our previous articles on this topic, numerous election experts dismissed assertions like those made by Trump. Asked again for this article, experts agreed that nothing new had emerged as a result of the commission’s work. Trump’s claim "is not accurate at all," said Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who specializes in election law. "There has been no proof of substantial voter fraud in the 2016 election. We have seen really just a smattering of isolated cases." Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University political scientist and author of The Myth of Voter Fraud, said that her efforts to track the issue since 2001, including as an expert witness, has enabled her to study election processes up close in such states as Wisconsin, Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Kansas. Her conclusion? "I am not aware of any evidence of substantial voter fraud ever being offered or presented to state legislatures adopting voter ID laws, or in any of the litigation in which states, as defendants, have brought forth such evidence to defend why they adopted the laws," Minnite said. Our ruling In his statement, Trump said there is "substantial evidence of voter fraud." That wasn’t accurate before, and it isn’t accurate now. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12147	"It costs us about $33,000 a year (on average nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year."	/california/statements/2017/aug/09/kamala-harris/does-it-cost-75k-year-lock-inmate-california/	U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris believes taxpayers aren’t "getting a good return on investment" when it comes to California’s prison system. The California Democrat told the Women Unshackled forum in Washington D.C. in July that alternatives to locking up inmates, such as drug treatment programs, are far cheaper and sometimes more effective than prison sentences. Her figures for California’s per inmate costs were eye-opening. "Let’s look at the fact that there is an issue around how much we are paying — and again, this gets back to the economic cost — it costs us about $33,000 a year to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year," Harris said on July 18, 2017. Harris makes her claim at about the 16:50 minute mark in the video above. Harris made criminal justice reform a top priority during her time as California’s attorney general and has done the same so far in the Senate. Recently, she teamed up with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to push bipartisan bail reform legislation that would prevent minor offenders from sitting in jail if they can’t afford the cost of being released before trial. In discussing prison costs, Harris said governments should place a greater focus on crime prevention and drug treatment given the high cost of incarceration. We interpreted Harris's claim about per inmate expenses to mean the operational costs to house male and female inmates, including security, health care, facility upkeep and employee compensation. Advocates for criminal justice reform often argue that just looking at the operational costs of running prisons ignores the social costs of incarcerating Americans. We looked at those costs as well, but based our rating primarily on the evidence supporting the numbers Harris cited in her Women Unshackled appearance. Our research A spokesperson for Harris provided us with data on the cost of federal incarceration, from the independent Vera Institute of Justice, as well as numbers for California, based on Gov. Jerry Brown’s spending plan for the 2017-18 fiscal year. In its May 2017 report "The Price of Prisons," the Vera Institute examined the cost to house inmates at prisons nationwide. It obtained data for 45 states and found the total cost per inmate averaged $33,274. The institute advocates for reducing inmate totals and improving conditions in prisons. It reported receiving about three-quarters of its funding from the federal government. The study’s findings support Harris’ claim on the average cost of housing inmates nationally. But what about the California’s per inmate price of $75,000? For that figure, Harris’ spokesman cited a June 2017 article by the Associated Press. It estimated the cost per inmate would reach a record $75,560 in the current fiscal year. The AP based its estimate on the money Gov. Brown set aside in this year’s budget for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. To verify this figure and put it in context, we examined the governor’s 2017-18 budget and contacted the Brown Administration’s corrections and finance departments, as well as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. These sources pointed us to the projected $76,320 cost per inmate in Brown’s 2017-18 budget. That qualifies as "about $75,000" as Harris put it. A spokeswoman for the state’s corrections department told us California paid about $73,000 per inmate last fiscal year, also very close to Harris’ number. Cost in context While Harris’ numbers are nearly spot on, we wanted to know what’s driving this high cost to lock up prisoners in California. The expense to house each inmate has doubled since 2005, even as court orders reduced the prison population by about a quarter, according to the Associated Press. Several reasons account for the dramatic increase. Viewed simply, fewer inmates combined with higher corrections spending equals a higher per capita cost. But why are there fewer inmates and higher spending? California was forced to cut inmate levels after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that overcrowding in prisons violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The drop in inmates hasn’t led to the closure of any prisons and hasn’t led to a reduction of prison staffing that corresponds directly to the drop in inmates. Jonathan Peterson, an analyst at the Legislative Analyst’s Office, said that’s because there are security requirements at the prisons that don’t allow for the elimination of guards simply because there are fewer inmates. "Regardless of how many inmates are in a particular unit, you still need the one guard to open and close the doors," Peterson said. The governor’s budget expects a nearly 2-to-1 inmate to prison staff ratio for the current fiscal year. That’s down from a ratio of a 2.24-to-1 just two years ago. Higher employee costs Just as the inmate population started to drop, employee compensation in the prison system jumped significantly. The corrections department budget has gone up $1.2 billion since 2012 due to employee compensation and retirement costs, according to the Department of Finance. Of that increase, $436 million is directly tied to increased pension contributions by the state for prison employees. Additionally, in July 2013, the state opened the California Health Care Facility providing 2,600 beds for inmates needing medical attention. The facility has cost $288 million since it opened, the finance department reported. California voters have contributed to the shrinking prison population in recent years by approving ballot measures that reclassify many felony drug and property crimes as misdemeanors and improving chances for parole for offenders classified as nonviolent. These measures are expected to further reduce the prison population by thousands of inmates. If that happens and prison employee costs rise or stay stable, California’s per capita inmate expense will continue to be higher than other states. Our ruling Sen. Kamala Harris recently claimed "it costs us about $33,000 a year (nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year." A recent study that examined costs in 45 states plus data from California’s departments of corrections and finance support the senator’s statement. Digging deeper, we found reducing inmates in California’s prisons, which Harris supports, may actually increase the per capita costs she highlights. That will be especially true if salary and pension costs continue to increase as inmate numbers drop. Harris doesn’t make a specific claim about what’s driving these costs. Her statement centers on the costs alone to house inmates nationally and in California. The evidence supports the figures she cited. We rate Harris' claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.
