faan-00110	 Facebook photo of Stephen Harper and the words “Target closing means 17,000 people have lost their jobs”	http://factscan.ca/tom-mulcair-facebook-photo-of-stephen-harper-and-the-words-target-closing-means-17000-people-have-lost-their-jobs/	Tom Mulcair’s Facebook page has a picture that reads “Target closing means 17,000 people have lost their jobs” with Stephen Harper in the background. This is a case of guilt by association, and is misleading.	None	Tom Mulcair	None	None	None	2015-02-18	ruary 4, 2015	['Stephen_Harper']

The Citizenship Act is not that specific. It says a person “shall take the oath of citizenship by swearing or solemnly affirming it before a citizenship judge.”	None	Paul Calandra	None	None	None	2015-03-07	uary 13, 2015	['None']
faan-00002	 The Canada Child Benefit has lifted “nearly 300,000 children” out of poverty	http://factscan.ca/esdc-canada-child-benefit/	The number of children lifted out of poverty by the Canada Child Benefit won’t be known until 2019. The government is still relying on the projected impacts of the CCB and not on survey data.	None	ESDC	None	None	None	2018-10-04	gust 20, 2018	['None']
faan-00052	 On voting for Quebec sovereignty, Tom Mulcair carries “two different discussions at the same time.”	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-two-different-discussions/	Mulcair did not say different things in English and French on Quebec sovereignty as Trudeau alleged. In the appearances in question, Mulcair’s position on vote count rules was consistent. 	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2015-10-08	mber 28, 2015	['None']
faan-00061	 “Sexual violence and exploitation of children unfortunately is on the rise.”	http://factscan.ca/peter-mackay-sexual-violence-on-the-rise/	Incidence of reported sexual violence and exploitation of children is on the rise. Not all forms of this crime are rising – some are in fact falling – but on the whole, the trend line is up. Statistics Canada notes the number of police-reported sexual violations against children marked “one of the few categories of violent violations to increase from the previous year.” Police-reported is a key term here, since a spike in reporting doesn’t always mean a spike in actual crime.

faan-00042	 “The atmosphere doesn’t care where emissions get emitted.”	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-the-atmosphere-doesnt-care/	It’s true. The atmosphere is pretty indifferent about the location of emissions. Almost identical amounts of carbon measured in different, remote parts of the world confirm this.

faan-00069	 “Over the past 30 years, median after-tax family incomes in Canada, those of the middle class, have only increased by 15 per cent.”	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-median-after-tax-family-incomes/	It is true that in three decades, from 1980 to 2011, incomes rose by 15 per cent. But the aggregate 30-year period misses other parts of the income growth story, including a higher-growth period starting in the late 1990s.

faan-00054	 “We have not taken away health care from immigrants and refugees. On the contrary, the only time we’ve removed it is if we had clearly bogus refugees who have been refused and turned down.”	http://factscan.ca/stephen-harper-health-care-from-immigrants-and-refugees/	In 2012, the Conservatives introduced health care changes that represented a cut in coverage for refugee groups beyond just rejected refugee claimants. The cuts affected ordinary claimants – people whose refugee status is, by definition, to be determined. The cuts also affected privately sponsored refugees.

faan-00007	 “Trudeau’s carbon tax will raise gas prices by 11 cents/litre.”	http://factscan.ca/andrew-scheer-carbon-tax/	Gas prices are projected to rise by 11 cents per litre by 2022 in provinces and territories without their own carbon pricing systems. However, the federal carbon tax likely won’t apply in BC, Alberta, Ontario, or Quebec. These provinces already have their own carbon pricing systems in place. Gas prices will likely increase a few cents in those provinces in order to align with federal carbon pricing standards, but that increase won’t reach 11 cents.

faan-00001	 Crime guns are “often stolen or illegally diverted or smuggled in from the United States.”	http://factscan.ca/bill-blair-crime-guns/	While the data on this topic is limited and somewhat flawed, experts agree that historically, most crime guns in Canada have arrived unlawfully from the US. Some new reports contradict this view and imply that a higher rate of crime guns are domestically sourced, however, these reports show that domestic crime guns have been illegally diverted (straw purchases), as opposed to being legally owned by the perpetrators.
