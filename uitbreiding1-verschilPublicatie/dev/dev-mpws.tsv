mpws-00019	In their quest to make Minnesota a more attractive place to retire, a group of Republican state senators drafted a bill that would eliminate taxes on Social Security. To make their case, bill sponsor Sen. David Senjem, R-Rochester, said most states don’t tax the elderly or their benefits. “Thirty-eight states don’t tax us at all. Twenty-nine states of those states have by purpose eliminated the Social Security tax… Seven states, including Minnesota, do tax Social Security.” As it turns out, Minnesota is an outlier. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/01/poligraph-senjems-social-security-claims-correct/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Senjem’s Social Security claims correct	January 23, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
mpws-00026	For months after a rocky roll out of the federal and state health insurance exchanges, Democrats distanced themselves from the Affordable Care Act. Now, they’re using it to throw barbs at their Republican opponents. In Minnesota, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is criticizing 8th Congressional District Republican candidate Stewart Mills for saying he would scrap the law, including parts that both sides support. “Millionaire Stewart Mills III has taken thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from the health insurance industry, and now he wants to put the insurance companies back in charge to deny care to people with-pre-existing conditions and kick kids off their parents’ plans,” a DCCC press release states. 	false	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/08/poligraph-dccc-mills-claim-half-wrong-half-right/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: DCCC Mills claim half wrong, half right	August 29, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'United_States_Congress']
mpws-00024	Another week, and another ad on the airwaves in the 8th Congressional District. There, Republican Stewart Mills is running against incumbent DFL Rep. Rick Nolan in one of the hottest races in the country. Mills is getting a lot of help from National Republican Congressional Committee, which targets Nolan for being “dangerously liberal” in its newest ad. “Nolan voted to cut funding for the fight against Al Qaeda. Veterans aren’t receiving health care, yet Nolan voted against funding the veteran’s health administration. And hardworking Minnesotans are just trying to make ends meet. Nolan voted against work requirements for welfare recipients.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/09/poligraph-two-hits-and-a-miss-on-nrccs-latest-ad/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Two hits and a miss on NRCC’s latest ad	September 12, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Al-Qaeda', 'Congressional_district', 'Minnesota', 'Republican_National_Committee']
mpws-00044	 In a speech to union workers this week, House Speaker Paul Thissen said the Legislature is focusing on putting more money in the pockets of Minnesotans. Chief among those priorities are raising the minimum wage and making sure women get better pay. “The argument that the Republicans make that this is going to undermine jobs, that it’s going to tank our economy, simply don’t hold up to the facts,” Thissen said. “We did it in the 90s, and our economy got better, we did it in the mid-2000s and our economy got better.” Thissen went on to point out that woman are particularly affected by changes in the minimum wage. “Sixty percent of the folks on minimum wage or less are women in this state. They make up 50 percent of the workforce, but they are disproportionately working at low-paying jobs.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/03/poligraph-thissens-minimum-wage-claims-mostly-true/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Thissen’s minimum wage claims mostly true	March 21, 2014, 2:30 PM	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Minnesota']
mpws-00015	If you didn’t think Gov. Mark Dayton’s decision to raise pay for his commissioners would be a 2016 campaign issue, think again. At least one political group is already minting and sending fliers to Senate districts where Democrats will be up for re-election next year. One is landing in the mailboxes of Sen. Melisa Franzen’s constituents. Franzen is a Democrat from Edina. “Minnesota wages are flat, but political appointees are getting pay raises thanks to legislation supported by Senator Melisa Franzen,” the flier from the GOP-backed Minnesota Action Network flier reads. “This wasn’t the only time she voted to give politicians a pay raise.” According to the flier, Franzen voted to increase her own by 35 percent and for a constitutional amendment to make it easier to raise legislative pay. 	misleading	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/02/poligraph-mn-action-network-flier-omits-key-details/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: MN Action Network flier omits key details	February 27, 2015, 3:15 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Mark_Dayton', 'Edina,_Minnesota']
